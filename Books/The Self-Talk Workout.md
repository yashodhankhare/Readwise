## Highlights
- AS A CHILD in the 1980s, I would hear Whitney Houston’s song “The Greatest Love of All” and feel confused. “The greatest love of all” sounded accidental and mysterious: the words expressed that the love was “happening” to her, but they also hinted that some sort of process was involved: “The greatest love of all / Is easy to achieve / Learning to love yourself / It is the greatest love of all.” But how was I supposed to learn to love myself when I felt pretty much the opposite? Good for Whitney, I thought, but I remained baffled by the idea that it was easy to start liking or loving yourself, as though choosing that attitude were as simple as putting on a new outfit. I carried right on disliking myself, which took the form of constant self-criticism. It was easy to do. Academic, extracurricular, and social settings each emphasized peer comparisons, and there were always plenty of people who were smarter, more talented, more attractive, and cooler than I was. Self-criticism seemed like it might help me to identify and fix my flaws, to keep me motivated to improve, and to become more acceptable to myself and to others. Instead, the habit of self-criticism ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=72))

- depleted me, leaving me worried and discouraged. When I finally wanted to develop more encouraging self-talk—the way that I treated myself inside my own mind—I didn’t know how to do it. After experiencing a great deal of painful self-criticism as a child and as a young adult, I am lucky to have had a combination of personal and professional experiences over the past couple of decades that led me to form a completely different relationship with the voice in my head.

- worsens depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas self-kindness improves those conditions. One study of 349 individuals, ages sixteen to sixty-seven, observed that people with higher levels of self-compassion were less likely to experience mental health difficulties.[4] Another study of 119 university students found that students who viewed themselves as inadequate had higher levels of depression and anxiety in response to stress.[5] Researchers investigating recovery from severe depression observed that reductions in self-criticism among 518 patients formed the strongest predictor of improvement.[6] A range of other studies demonstrate the importance of encouraging, kind self-talk as it relates to motivation, job performance, relationships, and physical health.

- For instance, anxiety and depression are often researched separately, although many people are both anxious and depressed. When it comes time to pick an area of expertise as a researcher or a therapist, it is more common to choose one that is well established rather than one that crosses traditional disciplines.

- Is self-talk the same as self-esteem? No. Self-talk refers to the way that you talk to yourself or relate to yourself, whereas self-esteem has to do with the way that you evaluate yourself (for instance, as good, bad, attractive, unattractive, productive, unproductive, and so forth). Of course, they are related: if you speak to yourself as an adversary, and if much of the content of your self-talk has to do with negative self-evaluations, you’ll probably wind up with low self-esteem. But it can be helpful to stop thinking in terms of a high versus low self-esteem framework, because judging yourself in general (either “good” or “bad”) can create problems. Evaluating yourself highly (high self-esteem) is associated with happiness and optimism, but it sometimes also includes narcissism, having a self-serving bias, being unable to tolerate negative feedback, and needing others’ approval.[14] And judging yourself as inadequate worsens mental health. Contrary to what you might think, the way to handle low self-esteem effectively isn’t to try to boost your self-esteem—instead, it involves reducing the amount of time and energy that you spend judging yourself and comparing yourself to other people. That doesn’t mean not noticing or caring whether you’re treating other people decently or meeting your goals. But too much focus on self-esteem, whether positive or negative, is a ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=218))

- trap. It perpetuates a mindset of self-judgment that often leads to suffering. I’ve worked with many first-year college and university students who’ve experienced a drop in self-esteem during their adjustment to college life. Many students’ identities were based upon having been high academic achievers as compared to their high school peers, but then, surrounded by other high-achieving individuals, their self-esteem crumbled. The process highlights what the self-esteem and self-compassion researcher Kristin Neff identifies as key problems with self-esteem: it is unstable, because it depends on information from the environment, which can change; it involves engaging in comparisons between oneself and others that often leave people feeling “less-than”; and it promotes an attitude of self-judgment in which your attention becomes trained on evaluating yourself rather than on enjoying your life.[15] The alternative is to learn to treat yourself in a way that is encouraging, motivating, and kind but that doesn’t emphasize judgment or comparisons at all. With practice, you can learn to relate to yourself not as a judge but as a friend who cares about your experience and who wants to help in a supportive way.

- Who’s the tallest? Who’s the fastest? Who’s the smartest? Who has the best body? We use grades or points to show who scored the most goals or got the highest grade. We’ve got beauty competitions, standardized tests and college admissions, music and dance auditions, and performance evaluations at work. Magazines often feature photographs of very thin or fit individuals alongside instructions for improving your “problem” areas. And, as noted above, the culture often rewards those with a certain set of characteristics with more resources and positive attention while marginalizing diverse qualities as “other” and “less than.” It’s hard not to absorb such messages. Cultural norms about modesty, self-criticism, and self-esteem. When I was growing up, it seemed as though insulting yourself was part of the female conversational currency, whereas males seemed to be expected to hide their self-criticism. Cultural expectations about modesty or self-criticism may influence how people view themselves.[18] However, self-criticism might only arise in certain situations, or reflect norms about communicating about oneself to other people rather than a person’s inner beliefs.[19] ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=308))

Becoming more aware of your self-talk and implementing new ways of relating to yourself are processes that reflect central themes in mindfulness, sometimes defined as ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=395))

- paying purposeful and nonjudgmental attention to the present moment. Mindfulness is often cultivated during meditation, the specific time set aside for dedicated practice of mindfulness techniques. Some meditation practices and traditions such as lovingkindness (see chapter 5) directly develop kinder orientations toward ourselves and others. However, many other meditation techniques also seem to reduce self-criticism, in part by training the ability to observe thoughts and feelings without judging them or reacting to them. Although people meditate for many different reasons, reducing self-judgment is one well-established benefit. If you have some experience with meditation, it’s likely that you’ve practiced observing how you treat yourself within your own mind, including your reactions to disappointment or frustration. Meditators often note that self-criticism emerges during meditation (for instance, judging yourself when your mind wanders away during sitting meditation). Using meditation skills to observe self-criticism in a nonjudgmental way, without getting swept up in it, can help it subside. Because many mindfulness teachers have thoughtfully addressed self-talk, I’ve included a range of their insights and perspectives throughout the book. Meditation practice doesn’t appeal to everyone, and you don’t have to be a meditator to benefit from this book. I’ve also included other methods of shifting self-talk (for instance, cognitive reappraisal, or intentionally looking at a situation in a different way (chapter 2), and behavioral activation, or prioritizing and reinforcing ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=397))

- healthy actions (chapter 4), because powerful changes related to self-talk can occur via several different approaches. However, I am truly enthusiastic about meditation practice, especially as a structured, repeated, and effective way to transform self-talk. It’s usually quite challenging at first. Beginning meditators often react in a very self-critical way when meditation is difficult, and they often assume that meditation isn’t for them. It can help to reframe self-criticism during meditation. Navigating self-criticism might seem like an impediment to meditation, but it is often a valuable part of the workout. Part of the way that meditation reduces self-judgment is through the repeated practice of gently noticing distraction, boredom, doubt—and even self-criticism itself—without judging… ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=409))

- Working Your Self-Talk Muscles Almost everyone can benefit from regular physical exercise. To be physically healthy, it’s ideal to devote some amount of time and energy to working out. We can’t change everything: no amount of physical exercise is going to make me grow four inches or get curly hair. But with repeated workouts, we can get stronger, more energetic, and more flexible. Why does a mental workout seem so much different? People assume that their mental habits are more fixed—that they reflect fundamental traits. That assumption is kind of strange when you consider how much our culture prioritizes learning and education, activities reflecting that it is possible to change the way that we think. While it’s true that some elements of personality seem stable over time, the evidence is out there that we can change our mental habits. For instance, the book Altered Traits by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson highlights research showing that specific aspects of mindfulness training can transform parts of ourselves that we might consider to be fixed characteristics—and yield meaningful changes such as being calmer or reacting differently when stressful circumstances arise.[33] ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=448))

- To practice “inhale, my friend; exhale, my friend,” you can begin by trying to locate the sensation of breathing within your body. When you are ready, you can start to match the silent phrases (“inhale, my friend; exhale, my friend”) to your inhalations and exhalations. Or, if it’s easier for you, you can start with the words themselves and allow them to lead the way to your breathing. You might observe a feeling of “syncing up” the words and their meaning with your physical sensations. You can also choose to substitute your own variation on “my friend,” such as “my dear,” “my love,” “kiddo,” or even your own name. You might experiment with repeating the phrases for a few minutes of dedicated practice each day, and also inserting the practice even as a single guided breath throughout your day. You don’t need to change anything about how you are breathing other than paying attention to the physical sensation of breathing and paying attention in a kind way.

- “Self-talk” reflects the mind’s constant commentary—filled with self-criticism, worries, and obsessions. It turns out that the flow of that commentary is governed by a network of specific brain regions known as the default mode network (DMN). Even if you didn’t know about the default mode network or call it by that name before, it’s probably the reason that you picked up this book. That network dominates our mental experience as the “default,” and it will most likely continue to chatter on unless you purposefully strengthen other networks through mental practice. The DMN refers to a group of brain regions that work together when you’re not doing much of anything—that is, if you’re not mentally engaged in a particular task. If you’re just hanging out, walking, doing chores, showering, and so on, your brain’s cortex is most likely operating in this particular way. During those moments, the DMN will probably be engaged and playing the current “Top 40” ruminations, much of them about you and your life. You might be surprised to learn that your brain is quite active when it doesn’t really seem like you’re doing much at all. Even one of the scientists who discovered the DMN, Dr. Marcus Raichle, was surprised. “It hadn’t occurred to anyone that the brain is actually just as busy ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=616))

- “Inhale, my friend; exhale, my friend” provides a way to interrupt that DMN chatter. It’s a reset button, rebalancing attention toward the present moment, and it’s available anytime. It’s supportive, not interpretive. As you practice “inhale, my friend; exhale, my friend,” you might find yourself inhabiting your body below your shoulders a bit more and hanging out in the usual parts of your brain a bit less.

- IN MEDITATION WORKSHOPS and retreats, a common theme is to develop the skill of observing experiences without judging them. Instructors advise attendees to notice through the “sense doors” of one’s eyes, ears, mouth, and bodily movements—pre-verbally, if you can. Is it possible to really tune in to the texture and flavors of the food that you’re tasting, even before you label it “good” or “bad”? Can you take in the sound of a bird chirping, perhaps even before your mind steps in with the word bird? You might find it quite difficult to notice experiences without automatically judging them. However, the process of trying to register sensations first, even before interpretations and judgments emerge, can help shift old patterns. The effort itself can make a difference in how you react to what’s going on, both within yourself and in response to the outside world.

- Sometimes when I meditate, it feels like I am rising to a higher version of myself, floating above the clouds of my own thoughts to join with a more stable and noble self who is always watching. I feel that when I meditate, I connect with that observer self, who has endless compassion for my own thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Spending time with this “self” has made me a stronger person because those qualities shine through in my daily life; I am more stable, more able to detach from unhelpful thoughts, and can do all of this while being a little more compassionate and loving toward myself.

- In research studies investigating whether meditation and other mindfulness practices help people with depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress, investigators have identified reducing judgment as a key mechanism of action—a major ingredient that explains why mindfulness improves mental health.[4] Meditation helps people “suspend or disrupt negative or self-critical appraisal.”[5] Because reducing judgment doesn’t seem to happen by just deciding, you have to practice a new way until it becomes as strong as the old way.

- And then there’s gender. Female people are usually conditioned to see themselves through others’ eyes, and to imagine how others are gauging our level of attractiveness and the ways that we stand, speak, walk, or act. The author Lily King writes, “You get trained early on as a woman to perceive how others are perceiving you, at the great expense of what you yourself are feeling about them. Sometimes you mix the two up in a terrible tangle that’s hard to unravel.”[9] The identity of being female can get so wrapped up with roles of caregiving, entertaining, attracting, or pleasing other people. Moving away from always attending to others’ thoughts about us can feel strange at first, but it gets easier with practice. Specific mindfulness techniques, such as focusing on the sensations of the breath, can train the mind to focus on present-moment lived experience rather than on imagining others’ thoughts about you.

- Brain activity involves two specific networks: the task positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN)—the latter of which we looked at in chapter 1. When one network is active, the other network is much less active, and vice versa. A third network, the salience network, is involved in switching between the two. The task positive network (TPN) dominates when you are paying attention to something in the present moment. If you’re engaged in your work, playing sports, making music, or pursuing another task in a focused way, TPN activity is prominent. Brain regions involved in the TPN include the lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, and the somatosensory cortex. When you’re not doing much of anything, your brain is still quite busy. The DMN (including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, inferior ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1467))

- parietal lobule, and the hippocampal formation) is active—passing information along, modifying it, and processing it—in habitual ways such as rumination (thinking about the same things over and over again, especially memories and past experiences, without active problem-solving), self-referential thinking (thinking about yourself, in the usual ways that you do that), and judgment (deciding whether things are good, bad, or neutral).

- The DMN isn’t all bad, and we need it to survive. The DMN helps us connect the past, present, and future, and helps us maintain our identity and our understanding of the world. We couldn’t really get along without it. We need to be able to predict what might be needed in an upcoming situation, and to remember people and other information. The neuroscientist Marcus Raichle asserts that the DMN provides integration that is necessary for survival. The DMN is active as we make judgments. Raichle explains, “It’s not only important to remember what’s important, but also to put a value on what’s important. The part of the default mode network up front, down almost between your eyes, just above your nose, has to do with deciding whether something is good, bad, or indifferent. In other words, input from our body and the external world passes through this area of the brain before… ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1476))

- Although the DMN appears to help with physical survival, its overuse seems to contribute to suffering. Rumination and self-judgment—prominent during DMN activity—are linked with depression, anxiety, and other mental health difficulties. In fact, more functional connectivity between DMN regions is related to a tendency to ruminate and to unhappiness.[13] In the DMN, many of us have a brain network that is working too much and too efficiently, in the sense that it is highly developed and quick to activate. That’s because our mental habits have shaped the DMN’s structure and function. Because the DMN helps determine how experiences and thoughts relate to yourself (“What does this mean about me and about my life?”), it leads to what the mindfulness teacher Jon Kabat-Zinn calls “selfing,” or interpreting life experience through the constant background narration of “I, me, mine” or “the story of me.”[14] Kabat-Zinn advises that we need to consciously work to balance the tendency of “selfing” in order to have a peaceful mental life. And one way to do that balancing work is through meditation. Research studies provide evidence that meditation reduces DMN activity.[15] It doesn’t seem to matter what kinds of meditation people practice (for instance, techniques that focus on concentration or compassion); research studies demonstrate reduced DMN activity results regardless of the type of meditation practiced.[16] Overall, the brains of experienced meditators show less DMN activity and greater activity in other brain networks—and that holds true whether they are in the midst of meditation or not.[17] Meditation seems to enhance activity in the salience network, so that it’s easier to switch out of the DMN when you catch yourself ruminating. Meditation practice builds connectivity between the brain’s networks and the ability to switch between them,[18] leading to less “selfing,” less rumination, less judgment, and to higher levels of well-being.[19] You might consider how DMN and TPN operate within the moments of meditation. As you sit down and begin to pay attention to each breath in the present moment, that effort engages your task positive network (TPN). However, it’s likely that your DMN will interrupt with its usual material (“I’m bad at this! Rumination of the Top 40 current worries and past mistakes! More ‘selfing’ and self-judgment!”). Your job is to notice… ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1485))

- and your control over which network is activated.[21] This capacity generalizes beyond your meditation practice and into everyday life. In fact, over time, meditation practice reshapes the architecture of the DMN, so that the brain’s default state becomes more present-centered and attentive.[22] From this description, it is hopefully apparent that distraction during meditation practice is a necessary ingredient in training the brain to switch out of its DMN. If distractions never arise, you won’t get the practice engaging the salience network and switching out of the DMN. And that practice is how meditation reduces self-criticism: less DMN activity means less “selfing”… ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1515))

- It’s our brain’s default to judge people rapidly, often even before we’re aware that we’re doing it. We notice one thing about a person (most likely about their appearance) and then, especially if there are lots of people around or if we also have other things on our minds, we move on. Done. But that oversimplification leads to all kinds of biases—racism, sexism, and ageism among them. Research indicates that meditation leads to lower levels of racism and ageism, because people make fewer automatic associations.[23] I also suspect that making rapid, automatic judgments about people based on their appearance contributes to loneliness and even self-judgment. When you view other people as one-dimensional supporting actors or extras, it can seem as though you’re the only one trying hard to handle a complex and challenging inner life. That false assumption can seem real, and it is quite an isolating one. The neuroscientist Rick Hanson teaches a mindfulness practice called “See beings, not bodies” that can help break the habit of categorizing, judging, and “thingifying” people.[24] He advises that when you encounter someone, you can try to remember the many different roles that they have (teacher, parent, friend, son, smart, funny, reader of detective novels). You can try to imagine the complexity within their own mind and all of the thoughts and emotions that must be swirling around with them. You might also notice moment-to-moment changes that you observe within yourself (like feeling energized or sleepy, or how pieces of a conversation feel for you). Then, you might consider how moment-to-moment changes are happening for the other person. You can try out this practice with someone who feels “neutral” to you, like a bus driver or café employee, and then with people who are closer to you. I tried “see beings, not bodies” on a silent weeklong meditation retreat by first noticing my one-dimensional impression of other participants: “purple-haired girl,” “tattoo guy,” or “wheelchair guy” (I suspected, in my own space of projected judgment, that I ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1529))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- was “pregnant woman,” fully defined by that feature alone). Then, I consciously tried to notice less obvious things about them: “tattoo guy” reached for the same hot sauce that I preferred; “purple-haired girl” seemed quite skilled at chopping carrots. I also imagined some of the many ways that those other people had lives that were just as multifaceted as mine. I noticed that I felt less lonely when I stepped beyond that urge to judge or label people with only the feature that initially stood out to me. Meditation can enhance practices such as “see beings, not bodies,” since meditation builds the capacity to notice without judging, or at least with less judging. As you notice your breath, you can observe different aspects about it. Maybe some breaths are shorter, longer, a bit shallow, or a bit deeper. Inhaling and exhaling each involve different physical sensations. Judgments and words might arise, but as you meditate, you can practice observing physical sensations by noticing them with your body (“How does this breath feel right now in my body?”) rather than with your brain and its labels. Over time, this practice leads to more noticing without labeling and judging. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1546))

- self-criticism might emerge. You might dislike the thoughts and feelings that arise—and it might even feel as though you dislike yourself for having them. Or perhaps the issue is more physical. If you find yourself experiencing physical tightness or tension, fidgeting, or falling asleep, you might automatically berate yourself for not meditating correctly. You may be upset about a lack of consistency with your meditation practice, see the normal ups and downs in meditation as a sign that you’re doing it wrong, or feel disappointed with yourself that you’re not seeing benefits from meditation as quickly as you had hoped. Those are all real, valid feelings; however, they all contain an element of self-criticism in interpreting challenges with meditation as a sign that there’s a problem with you or with your practice. During the actual experience of meditating, you have the opportunity to try to notice your own self-criticism—and other challenges—as you practice. Here are a few ways to address self-criticism or other challenges if they arise during meditation: With curiosity. As you notice your experiences during sitting meditation and how they influence self-talk, you can bring in some curiosity for what’s happening when you criticize yourself about meditating. Does beating yourself up for losing focus during meditation reflect an overall sense that you’re generally not good enough, not doing enough? Does going there feel familiar, or easy? What are the physical sensations that arise during moments of self-judgment? Can you try noticing them with your body, instead of generating so many thoughts about them? By meditating for longer periods at a time. Because meditation is so difficult (but often valuable for learning new ways to handle thoughts and experiences), many beginners like to start with about five to ten minutes at a time. But many people (even experienced meditators) find that the mind takes about twenty minutes to settle down, like a snow globe that’s been shaken up. Some people even just write off the first twenty minutes as sort of a warm-up. When you’re ready, you… ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1556))

- By acknowledging with compassion. Yes, meditation is hard. Changing mental habits is hard. I wouldn’t be recommending it without solid evidence that it is indeed possible. But it’s hard. I’m sorry about that. Perhaps you can also acknowledge that it is truly difficult, validate that it can be quite frustrating at times, and keep encouraging yourself that it’s a process. By noticing what’s neutral. You can tune in to breathing sensations that don’t seem particularly “good” or “bad,” listen to the sounds around you, or notice aspects of your environment as you walk. During the first week of November 2020, I found myself tied up in knots as I waited for the results of the United States presidential election. I tried to tune in to the fall leaves around me during walking meditation. Yellow. Red. Brown. Green. Pink. Purple. Orange. Gradations in color, contrasting colors. Fluttering, buoyant, steady. It comforted me that the leaves didn’t care who won the election; paying attention in a neutral way… ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1586))

- I love this one: “Fail early, fail often, fail forward.” You know, it’s always a little bit frustrating to me when people have a negative relationship with failure. Failure is a massive part of being able to be successful…. You gotta take a shot, you have to live at the edge of your capabilities. You’ve got to live where you’re almost certain you’re going to fail. That’s the reason for practice. Practice is controlled failure; you’re getting to your limit until you get to the point where all of a sudden, your body makes the adjustment and then you can do it. Failure actually helps you to recognize the areas where you need to evolve. So fail early, fail often, fail forward. —Will Smith (2018) ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1661))

- WHICH COMES FIRST, action or thought? Those of us who struggle with self-criticism might assume that thoughts always come first. Self-critical thinking, including the fear of failure, can paralyze us, keeping us from acting in alignment with our deepest values. It’s hard to start an exercise program, apply for a new job, or invite someone to lunch when your mind automatically worries that you’ll mess it up. Instead of waiting to feel better about yourself before you take action, this chapter asks you to flip it around: to act first and think later. Healthy actions can lead to healthy self-talk, especially if the actions are specific, scheduled, and consistent. Motivation, confidence, and well-being can all arise from repeated positive actions. For instance, regular acts of service form a central part of many religious and spiritual traditions. The idea is that service itself—the action rather than the intention—cultivates positive internal states. Instead of waiting to become generous before helping others, people become generous through helping others. This route, from behavior to belief, can also work for people who believe that they just can’t begin dating, write a short story, or make a homemade pie. Psychology professors sometimes draw a triangle on the chalkboard and label its vertices “thoughts,” “feelings,” and “behavior.” Each domain affects the others. For instance, self-critical thoughts (“I’m not very good at making friends”) could lead to feeling sad and to refraining from socializing. Or it could go the other way; that ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1666))

- is, refraining from socializing could lead to feeling more anxious about it. The interrelationships between thoughts, feelings, and behavior also operate when you’re trying to improve well-being. However, it’s hard to just have (and truly believe) a healthier thought or to generate a more pleasant feeling. Going right to the behavior can be a very effective strategy if you can tolerate that you might not actually feel motivated. You might ask yourself, “What would I be doing each day if I felt better about myself?” Can you go straight to doing some of those actions, without waiting for the self-criticism to disappear first? You may find that self-criticism abates after the new behaviors are in place. “Act before you think” is a strategy for managing the kind of self-criticism that interferes with your goals. The saying “Think before you act” (sometimes extended to add “and twice before you speak”) relates to actions that could hurt you or someone else. So, when I encourage people to “act before you think,” I’m not suggesting that you explode at people or spend money that you don’t have. Rather, prioritizing positive actions can help you get ahead of the self-criticism that impedes them—the self-doubt that stops you before you even get started. Prioritizing action can… ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1678))

- failure is a big impediment. We need to be able to tolerate it or learn from it, and not just quit or never get started. Athletes, musicians, and chefs all understand that failure is part of the process of learning a new technique, piece of music, or dish. Being a caring parent or partner also involves a willingness to make and repair mistakes. Confidence arises from learning from the problem and trying again rather than withdrawing or believing those self-critical voices that rush to interpret failure as meaning there’s something wrong with you. Deepening attention and curiosity toward your actions in the moment can help you persist, and it may also cause the fear of failure and other aspects of self-criticism to recede. The idea is to act despite the presence of self-criticism. You will need to think a bit, however, about which actions you want to take and how you plan to make them specific, regular, and consistent. As you approach… ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1690))

- Growth-mindset interventions that teach how the brain works—that is, that we build new physical pathways in our brain by trying and learning new things—seem to be particularly helpful. Research demonstrates that it’s fabulous for the adult brain to learn a new sport or a new musical instrument: the combination of practicing new ways of thinking, new ways of moving your hands or body, and new hand-eye coordination are all extremely good for our brains. Growth mindsets initiate a self-reinforcing spiral. That is, you might start by taking action to try new things and to persist when they get hard. This in turn makes you feel more confident and competent about trying new things and persisting, which then contributes to having a “growth mindset” in which you view yourself as able to learn, grow, and persist. This then contributes to your success and happiness, which reinforces subsequent efforts, engagement, and willingness to try new things…and the cycle continues. I hope it’s clear by now that the central element of cultivating a growth mindset is growth-oriented action. To change mindsets, decide what growth-oriented action you want to take in your life, and then do it. In a section of her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success called “feeling bad, but doing good,” Dweck notes that “vowing is useless” and advises readers to “make a concrete, growth-oriented plan, and stick to it.”[15] ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=1908))

- It’s much easier to accept failure if we interpret it as a normal part of being human, as a necessary part of learning and growth, or as a neutral event. It’s much harder to accept failure if we interpret it as meaning something terrible about ourselves. Believing “I feel anxious because I’m an anxious person” doesn’t leave much room for change. Conversely, believing that “anxiety is a something that I often experience” leaves all kinds of room for exploration and experimentation.

- The word lovingkindness is unusual. It’s an attempt to convey a certain kind of love. It’s a translation of the word metta (or mettā in Pali—the original language of Buddhist texts) that expresses this kind of love as well as the practices to cultivate it. The word metta is thought to come from a similar word, mitra, which refers to friendliness, goodwill, benevolence, affection, kindness, nonviolence, and taking an active interest in other people. It is completely fine to think of the idea as friendliness or goodwill if the term lovingkindness seems unwieldy ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2057))

- If you have immense difficulty starting LKM with a focus on yourself—if the idea of sending yourself good wishes feels just too weird or selfish—you don’t have to practice that way. One of my students noted that “I feel slightly less authentic and more like I’m saying it because I have to. This is interesting because I obviously believe all of these things for others but giving myself the same level of understanding is trickier.” If it seems more comfortable, you can start with the “benefactor” or someone for whom it’s easy for you to send thoughts of goodwill. Then, you can keep the feeling going but redirect it toward yourself as you move to LKM practice toward ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2166))

- yourself. Over time, LKM practice can even soften those sorts of self-other distinctions. It creates a scope of friendliness that encompasses all beings, with all of their flaws, including you, including me, including everyone, everywhere. In a single session of LKM practice, you can either call to mind one specific individual or move through all of the categories, spending at least five minutes on every category. However, it is helpful to choose your focus before you start a session; that is, to pick the recipient or sequence of recipients that seems right and stick with that plan. People enjoy practicing LKM in a number of ways. I have a friend, also a psychologist, a very loving and warm person, who decided to focus her LKM practice on herself for over a year, so that most of her sessions included the phrases only for herself. That is a fine and normal way to practice. Some teachers advise you to progress to the next category only after you have established a deep sense of friendliness for the preceding category.

- As you repeat the LKM phrases for other people, it can help to picture them in your mind. However, if visualizations don’t help or come easily, you don’t need to strive or to force them. LKM practice may also be accompanied by physical feelings of softness or warmth. The experience of wishing others well is sometimes described as a “radiating” practice, and you may feel sensations in ([Location 2180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2180))

- your heart or chest. According to the Buddhist scholar and monk Analayo, the physical sensation of metta can emerge as a feeling of softness somewhere in the middle of the chest. Many teachers describe a sense of radiating metta outward. Analayo emphasizes that metta radiation is soft and gentle rather than a forceful feeling of pushing out toward the intended recipients.[8] ([Location 2183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2183))

- One lovely way to practice is an LKM walk. As you start walking, you repeat the phrases for yourself. Then, as you encounter other beings on your walk (a person crosses the street in front of you; a bird flaps down onto the concrete), you direct a “round” of LKM phrases toward that being. Then back to yourself, and then back to others whom you encounter. One student described infusing LKM into regular walks: After implementing LKM, I started becoming more intentional in the conversations that I have in my head. For example, while I am on my walk I see that flowers are budding and the cherry blossoms around my neighborhood are blooming. While I look at them, I tell myself, “May I bud and bloom vibrantly.” I love walking to the International District through the Danny Woo garden and as I pass by aunties, uncles, grandmas, and grandpas, I pass the same phrase onto them: “May you bud and bloom vibrantly today.” ([Location 2196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2196))

- Why does mantra meditation work? It’s a form of concentration meditation, not so different from focusing on your breathing. It’s just that here the object of focus is the sound, word, or phrase instead of the breath. The benefits of learning to manage attention and not to identify with distractions are most likely the same, whether your focus is the breath or a mantra. In both cases, you’re training your mind away from its default way of thinking (reflecting the brain’s “default mode network” and the habit of self-criticism) and engaging the “task positive” brain network that is linked with more intentional focus and greater well-being.

- To build healthier relationships with emotions, the psychologist Marsha Linehan encourages people to develop “challenge statements” that revise emotion myths.[6] For instance, if you hold the belief that there’s one right way to feel in every circumstance, you could try out the challenge statement, “There are many normal ways to feel in the same situation.” To challenge the belief that negative feelings are inherently wrong, you might develop the challenge statement, “A full range of feelings is a fundamental part of being human.” ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09XQ27KM8&location=2748))

- The practices that I describe below offer structured ways to experience your feelings in the present moment. The self-compassion break, created by psychologist Kristin Neff, involves acknowledging suffering, remembering that emotional pain is a normal part of being human, and responding to your feelings with self-kindness. The RAIN practice, as developed by mindfulness teacher Michele McDonald and described by the psychologist and mindfulness teacher Tara Brach, outlines a sequence of steps for recognizing feelings, allowing them to be present, investigating them with a caring and interested attitude, and nurturing feelings with self-compassion. Finally, seated breath meditation, introduced in chapter 3, can be used to practice allowing all feelings without judging them.

- This exercise, originally developed by mindfulness teacher Michele McDonald, uses the acronym RAIN to structure it into four steps: recognizing feelings, allowing them, showing interest, and maintaining non-identification with emotions. Another meditation teacher, Tara Brach, has the acronym stand for recognize, allow, investigate, nurture. Either version of RAIN can provide a helpful structure for observing and relating to feelings. I’ve attempted to integrate both versions into the descriptions of the RAIN approach below.
