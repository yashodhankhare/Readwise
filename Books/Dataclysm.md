- But if there’s one thing I sincerely hope this book might get you to reconsider, it’s what you think about yourself. Because that’s what this book is really about. OkCupid is just how I arrived at the story. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=158))

- If Big Data’s two running stories have been surveillance and money, for the last three years I’ve been working on a third: the human story. Facebook might know that you’re one of M&M’s many fans and send you offers accordingly. They also know when you break up with your boyfriend, move to Texas, begin appearing in lots of pictures with your ex, and start dating him again. Google knows when you’re looking for a new car ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=187))

- and can show the make and model preselected for just your psychographic. A thrill-seeking socially conscious Type B, M, 25–34? Here’s your Subaru. At the same time, Google also knows if you’re gay or angry or lonely or racist or worried that your mom has cancer. Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, all these companies are businesses first, but, as a close second, they’re demographers of unprecedented reach, thoroughness, and importance. Practically as an accident, digital data can now show us how we fight, how we love, how we age, who we are, and how we’re changing. All we have to do is look: from just a very slight remove, the data reveals how people behave when they think no one is watching. Here I will show you what I’ve seen. Also, fuck body spray.

- The approximations technology has devised for things like lust and friendship offer a truly novel opportunity: to put hard numbers to some timeless mysteries; to take experiences that we’ve been content to put aside as “unquantifiable” and instead gain some understanding. As the approximations have gotten better and better, and as people have allowed them further into their lives, that understanding has improved with startling speed. I’m going to give you a quick example, but I first want to say that “Making the Ineffable Totally Effable” really should’ve been OkCupid’s tagline. Alas. Ratings are everywhere on the Internet. Whether it’s Reddit’s up/down votes, Amazon’s customer reviews, or even Facebook’s “like” button, websites ask you to vote because that vote turns something fluid and idiosyncratic—your opinion—into something they can understand and use. Dating sites ask people to rate one another because it lets them transform first impressions such as: ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=219))

Sites have collected billions of these microjudgments, one person’s snap opinion of someone else. Together, all those tiny thoughts form a source of vast insight into how people arrive at opinions of one another. The most basic thing you can do with person-to-person ratings like this is count them up. Take a census of how many people averaged one star, two stars, and so on, and then compare the tallies. At right, I’ve done just that with the average votes given to straight women by straight men. This is the shape of the curve: ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=227))

Looking at people like this is like looking at Earth from space; you lose the detail, but you get to see something familiar in a totally new way. So what is this curve telling us? It’s easy to take this basic shape—a bell curve—for granted, because examples in textbooks have probably led you to expect it, but the scores could easily have gone hard to one side or the other.… ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=237))

- Also, our male-to-female ratings curve is unimodal, meaning that the women’s scores tend to cluster around a single value. This again is easy to shrug at, but many situations have multiple modes, or “typical” values. If you plot NBA players by how often they were in the starting lineup in the 2012–13 season, you… ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=249))

- That’s the data telling us that coaches think a given player is either good enough to start, or he isn’t, and the guy’s in or out of the lineup accordingly. There’s a clear binary system. Similarly, in our ratings data, men as a group might’ve seen women as “gorgeous” or “ugly” and left it at that; like top-line basketball talent, beauty could’ve been a you-have-it-or-you-don’t kind of thing. But the curve we started with says something else. Looking for understanding in data is often a matter of considering your results against these kinds of counterfactuals. Sometimes, in the face of an infinity of alternatives, a straightforward result is all the more remarkable for… ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=255))

- it is, in fact, one of those textbook examples I was making light of. So the curve is predictable, centered—maybe even boring. So what? Well, this is a rare context where boringness is something special: it implies that the individual men who did the scoring are likewise predictable, centered, and, above all, unbiased. And when you consider the supermodels, the porn, the cover girls, the Lara Croft–style fembots, the Bud Light ads, and, most devious of all, the Photoshop jobs that surely these men see every day, the fact that male opinion of female attractiveness is still where it’s supposed to be is, by my lights, a small miracle. It’s practically common sense that men… ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=265))

- The red chart is centered barely a quarter of the way up the scale; only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged. Now, the men on OkCupid aren’t actually ugly—I tested that by experiment, pitting a random set of our users against a comparable random sample from a social network and got the same scores for both groups—and it turns out you get patterns like the above on every dating site I’ve seen: Tinder, Match.com, DateHookup—sites that together cover about half the single people in the United States. It just turns out that men and women perform a different sexual calculus. As Harper’s put it perfectly: “ Women are inclined to regret the sex they had, and men the sex they didn’t.” You can see exactly how it works in the data. I will add: the men above must be absolutely full of regrets. A beta curve plots what can be thought of as the outcome of a large number of coin flips—it traces the overlapping probabilities of many independent binary events. Here the male coin is fair, coming up heads (which I’ll equate with positive) just about as often as it comes up tails. But in our data we see that the female one is weighted; it turns up heads only once every fourth flip. A large number of natural processes,… ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=274))

- Throughout, we’ll see that the Internet can be a vibrant, brutal, loving, forgiving, deceitful, sensual, angry place. And of course it is: it’s made of human beings. However, bringing all this information together, I became acutely aware that not everyone’s life is captured in the data. If you don’t have a computer or a smartphone, then you aren’t here. I can only acknowledge the problem, work around it, and wait for it to go away. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=314))

- The data set we’ll work with encompasses thousands of times more people than a Gallup or Pew study; that goes without saying. What’s less obvious is that it’s actually much more inclusive than most academic behavioral research. It’s a known problem with existing behavioral science—though it’s seldom discussed publicly—that almost all of its foundational ideas were established on small batches of college kids. When I was a student, I got paid like $25 to inhale a slightly radioactive marker gas for an hour at Mass General and then do some kind of mental task while they took pictures of my brain. It won’t hurt you, they said. It’s just like spending a year in an airplane, they said. No big deal, they said. What they didn’t say—and what I didn’t realize then—was that as I was lying there a little hungover in some kind of CAT-scanner thing, reading words and clicking buttons with my foot, I was standing in for the ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=332))

- typical human male. My friend did the study, too. He was a white college kid just like me. I’m willing to bet most of the subjects were. That makes us far from typical. I understand how it happens: in person, getting a real representative data set is often more difficult than the actual experiment you’d like to perform. You’re a professor or postdoc who wants to push forward, so you take what’s called a “convenience sample”—and that means the students at your university. But it’s a big problem, especially when you’re researching belief and behavior. It even has a name. It’s called WEIRD research: white, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. And most published social research papers are WEIRD.1 Several of these problems plague my data, too. It will be a while still before digital data can scratch “industrialized” all the way off the list. But because tech is often seen as such an “elite field”—an image that many in the industry are all too willing to encourage—I feel compelled to distinguish between the entrepreneurs and venture capitalists you see on technology’s public stages, making swiping gestures and spouting buzz talk into headset mikes, people who are usually very WEIRD indeed, from the users of the services themselves, who are very much normal. They can’t help but be, because use of these services—Twitter, Facebook, Google, and the like—is the norm. As for the data’s authenticity, much of it is, in a sense, fact-checked because the Internet is now such a part of everyday life. Take the data from OkCupid. You give the site your city, your gender, your age, and who you’re looking ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=338))

- for, and it helps you find someone to meet for coffee or a beer. Your profile is supposed to be you, the true version. If you upload a better-looking person’s picture as your own, or pretend to be much younger than you really are, you will probably get more dates. But imagine meeting those dates in person: they’re expecting what they saw online. If the real you isn’t close, the date is basically over the instant you show up. This is one example of the broad trend: as the online and offline worlds merge, a built-in social pressure keeps many of the Internet’s worst fabulist impulses in check. The people using these services, dating sites, social sites, and news aggregators alike, are all fumbling their way through life, as people always have. Only now they do it on phones and laptops. Almost inadvertently, they’ve created a unique archive: databases around the… ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=351))

- But this asymmetry is ending; the small noise, the crackle and hiss of the rest of us, is finally making it to tape. As the Internet has democratized journalism, photography, pornography, charity, comedy, and so many other courses of personal endeavor, it will, I hope, eventually democratize our fundamental narrative. The sound is inchoate now, unrefined. But I’m writing this book to bring out what faint patterns I, and others, detect. This is the echo of the approaching train in ears pressed to the rail. Data science is far from perfect—there’s selection bias and many other shortcomings to understand, acknowledge, and work around. But the distance between what could be and what is grows shorter every day, and that final convergence is the day I’m writing to.

- I’ve tried to capture all this with my mash-up title. Kataklysmos is Greek for the Old Testament Flood; that’s how the word “cataclysm” came to English. The allusion has dual resonance: there is, of course, the data as unprecedented deluge. What’s being collected today is so deep it verges on bottomless; it’s easily forty days and forty nights of downpour to that old handful of rain. But there’s also the hope of a world transformed—of both yesterday’s stunted understanding and today’s limited vision gone with the flood.

- What I’ve just described, the wall and the long accumulation of a life, is what sociologists call longitudinal data—data from following the same people, over time—and I was speculating about the research of the future. We don’t have these capabilities quite yet because the Internet, as a pervasive human record, is still too young. As hard as it is to believe, even Facebook, touchstone and warhorse that it is, has only been big for about six years. It’s not even in middle school! Information this deep is still something we’re building toward, literally, one day at a time. In ten or twenty years, we’ll be able to answer questions like … well, for one, how much does it mess up a person to have every moment of her life, since infancy, posted for everyone else to see? But we’ll also know so much more about how friends grow apart or how new ideas percolate through the mainstream. I can see the long-term potential in the rows and columns of my databases, and we can all see it in, for example, the promise of Facebook’s Timeline: for the passage of time, data creates a new kind of fullness, if not exactly a new science.

- I’ll start with the opinions of women—all the trends below are true across my sexual data sets, but for specificity’s sake, I’ll use numbers from OkCupid. This table lists, for a woman, the age of men she finds most attractive. If I’ve arranged it unusually, you’ll see in a second why.

- Of course, another way to put this focus on youth is that males’ expectations never grow up. A fifty-year-old man’s idea of what’s hot is roughly the same as a college kid’s, at least with age as the variable under consideration—if anything, men in their twenties are more willing to date older women. That pocket of middling ratings in the upper right of the plot, that’s your “cougar” bait, basically. Hikers just out enjoying a nice day, then bam. In a mathematical sense, a man’s age and his sexual aims are independent variables: the former changes while the latter never does. I call this Wooderson’s law, in honor of its most famous proponent, Matthew McConaughey’s character from Dazed and Confused.

- Unlike Wooderson himself, what men claim they want is quite different from the private voting data we’ve just seen. The ratings above were submitted without any specific prompt beyond “Judge this person.” But when you ask men outright to select the ages of women they’re looking for, you get much different results. The gray space below is what men tell us they want when asked: ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=506))

- Since I don’t think that anyone is intentionally misleading us when they give OkCupid their preferences—there’s little incentive to do that, since all you get then is a site that gives you what you know you don’t want—I see this as a statement of what men imagine they’re supposed to desire, versus what they actually do. The gap between the two ideas just grows over the years, although the tension seems to resolve in a kind of pathetic compromise when it’s time to stop voting and act, as you’ll see.

- It’s this kind of calculated no-man’s-land—the balance between what you want, what you say, and what you do—that real romance has to occupy: no matter how people might vote in private or what they prefer in the abstract, there aren’t many fifty-year-old men successfully pursuing twenty-year-old women. For one thing, social conventions work against it. For another, dating requires reciprocity. What one person wants is only half of the equation. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=524))

- Think about it like this: imagine you could take a typical twenty-year-old guy, who’s just starting to date as an adult (definition: no SOLO cups present during at least one of courtship/consummation/breakup), and you could somehow note all the women who would be interested in him. If you could then track the whole lot over time, the main way he’ll lose options from that set is when some of them just stop being single because they’ve paired off with someone else. In fact, his total “interested” pool would actually gain women, because as he gets older, and presumably richer and more successful, those qualities draw younger women in. In any event, his age, of itself, doesn’t hurt him. Over the first two decades of his dating life, as he and the women in his pool mature, the ones who are still available will find him as desirable an option as they did when they were all twenty. If you could do the same thing for a typical woman at twenty, you’d get a different story. Over the years, she, too, would lose men from her pool to things like marriage, but she would also lose options to time itself—as the years passed, fewer and fewer of the remaining single men would find her attractive. Her dating pool is like a can with two holes—it drains on the double. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=531))

- Women want men to age with them. And men always head toward youth. A thirty-two-year-old woman will sign up, set her age-preference filters at 28–35, and begin to browse. That thirty-five-year-old man will come along, set his filters to 24–40, and yet rarely contact anyone over twenty-nine. Neither finds what they are looking for. You could say they’re like two ships passing in the night, but that’s not quite right. The men do seem at sea, pulled to some receding horizon. But in my mind I see the women still on solid ground, ashore, just watching them disappear. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=558))

- Even at the person-to-person level, to be universally liked is to be relatively ignored. To be disliked by some is to be loved all the more by others. And, specifically, a woman’s overall sex appeal is enhanced when some men find her ugly. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=598))

- These patterns exemplify a mathematical concept called variance. It’s a measure of how widely data is scattered around a central value. Variance goes up the further the data points fall from the average; in the table above, it is highest in Pattern E. One of the most common applications of variance is to weigh volatility (and therefore risk) in financial markets. Consider these two companies: Both returned 10 percent for the year, but they are very different investments. Associated Widgets experienced large swings in value throughout the year, while Widgets Inc. grew little by little, showing consistent gains each month. Computing the variance allows analysts to capture this distinction in one simple number, and all other things being equal, investors much prefer the low score of that pattern on the right. Same return, fewer heart palpitations. Of course, when it comes to romance, heart palpitations are the return, and that gets to the crux of it. It turns out that variance has almost as much to do with the sexual attention a woman gets as her overall attractiveness. In any group of women who are all equally good-looking, the number of messages they get is highly correlated to the variance: from the pageant queens to the most homely women to the people right in between, the individuals who get the most affection will be the polarizing ones. And the effect isn’t small—being highly polarizing will in fact get you about 70 percent more messages. That means variance allows you to effectively jump several “leagues” up in the dating pecking order—for example, a very low-rated woman (20th percentile) with high variance in her votes gets hit on about as much as a typical woman in the 70th percentile. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=616))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I’ve been talking about messages as if they’re an end unto themselves, but on a dating site, messages are the precursor to outcomes like in-depth conversations, the exchange of contact information, and eventually in-person meetings. People with higher variance get more of all these things, too. So, for example, woman D would have about 10 percent more conversations, 10 percent more dates, and, likely, 10 percent more sex than woman A, even though in terms of her absolute rating she’s much less attractive. Moreover, the men giving out those 1s and 2s are not themselves hitting on the women—people practically never contact someone they’ve rated poorly.3 It’s that having haters somehow induces everyone else to want you more. People not liking you somehow brings you more attention entirely on its own. And, yes, in his underground castle, Karl Rove smiles knowingly, petting an enormous toad. It only adds to the mystery of the phenomenon that OkCupid doesn’t publish raw attractiveness scores (or a variance number, of course) for anyone on the site. Nobody is consciously making decisions based on this data. But people have a way of feeling the math behind things, whether they’re aware of it or not, and here’s what I think is going on. Suppose a guy is attracted to a woman he knows ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=636))

- is unconventional-looking. Her very unconventionality implies that some other men are likely turned off; it means less competition. Having fewer rivals increases his chances of success. I can imagine our man browsing her profile, circling his cursor, thinking to himself: I bet she doesn’t meet many guys who think she’s awesome. In fact, I’m actually into her for her quirks, not in spite of them. This is my diamond in the rough, and so on. To some degree, her very unpopularity is what makes her attractive to him. And if our browsing guy was at all on the fence about whether to actually introduce himself, this might make the difference. Looking at the phenomenon from the opposite angle—the low-variance side—a relatively attractive woman with consistent scores is someone any guy would consider conventionally pretty. And she therefore might seem to be more popular than she really is. Broad appeal gives the impression that other guys are after her, too, and that makes her incrementally less appealing. Our interested but on-the-fence guy moves on. This is my theory at least. But the idea that variance is a positive thing is fairly well established in other arenas. Social psychologists call it the “pratfall effect”—as long as you’re generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you’re more competent. Flaws call out the good stuff all the more. This need for imperfection might just be how our brains are put together.

- services, obviously, but you can only say so much without a keyboard. Even on Instagram, the comments and the captions are essential—the photo after all is just a few inches square. But the words are the words are the words. They’re still how feelings come across and how connections are made. In fact, for all the hand-wringing over technology’s effect on our culture, I am certain that even the most reticent teenager in 2014 has written far more in his life than I or any of my classmates had back in the early ’90s. Back then, if you needed to talk to someone you used the phone. I wrote a few stiff thank-you notes and maybe one letter a year. The typical high school student today must surpass that in a morning. The Internet has many regrettable sides to it, but that’s one thing that’s always stood it in good stead with me: it’s a writer’s world. Your life online is mediated through words. You work, you socialize, you flirt, all by typing. I honestly feel there’s a certain epistolary, Austenian grandness to the whole enterprise. No matter what words we use or how we tap out the letters, we’re writing to one another more than ever. Even if sometimes dam gerl is all we have to say.

- and we have reams of them. There will be more words written on Twitter in the next two years than contained in all books ever printed. It’s the epitome of the new communication: short and in real time. Twitter was, in fact, the first service not only to encourage brevity and immediacy, but to require them. Its prompt is “What’s happening?” and it gives users 140 characters to tell the world. And Twitter’s sudden popularity, as much as its sudden redefinition of writing, seemed to confirm the fear that the Internet was “killing our culture.” How could people continue to write well (and even think well) in this new confined space—what would become of a mind so restricted? The actor Ralph Fiennes spoke for many when he said, “You only have to look on Twitter to see evidence of the fact that a lot of English words that are used, say, in Shakespeare’s plays or P. G. Wodehouse novels … are so little used that people don’t even know what they mean now.” ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=727))

Of course, they do so with a special purpose—dating—but the interface provides no specific prompt and enforces no limit on what or how much anyone types. Think of it as Gmail for strangers: the communication on the site is about two people getting to know each other; the romance comes much later, offline. Outside researchers rarely get to work with private messages like this—it’s the most sensitive content users generate and even anonymized and aggregated, message data is rarely allowed out of the holiest of holies in the database. But my unique position at OkCupid gives us special access. First, the site’s decade of history lets us see how technology has altered how people communicate. OkCupid has records from the pre-smartphone, pre-Twitter, pre-Instagram days—hell, it was online when Myspace was still a file storage service. Judging by messaging over all those years, the broad writing culture is indeed changing, and the change is driven by phones. Apple opened their app store in mid-2008, and OkCupid, like every major service, quickly launched an app. The effect on writing was immediate. Users began typing on keyboards smaller than their palm, and message length has dropped by over two-thirds since: ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=906))

- The average message is now just over 100 characters—Twitter-sized, in fact. And in terms of effect, it seems readers have adapted. The best messages, the ones that get the highest response rate, are now only 40 to 60 characters long. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=918))

- By considering only messages of a certain length, and then asking how many seconds the message took to compose, we can get a sense of how much revision and effort translates into better results.

- I’ve added another diagonal line, and as before, it marks the place where the two axes are equal—meaning that for the red dots along it, the text matched the keystrokes that went into it. Essentially, the sender typed what was on his mind and hit Send, no backspace, no edits. Therefore we know that message A, in the upper-right corner, was typed more or less in a headlong rush, with almost no revision. Going back to the logs, I found it took the sender 73 minutes and 41 seconds to hammer out… ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=938))

The broad gist of the scatter plot is: as you approach the diagonal, the messages show less revision. Move toward the bottom right, you get heavy editing, toward the upper left, you get … physical impossibility. Our chart’s geometry means that as soon as you cross over the diagonal into the upper half, you’re into people who must’ve typed fewer characters than their messages actually contained. Who are these arcane summoners, wringing words from thought alone? They are the cut and pasters, and they are legion.

- That dense band of dots running just below the diagonal is the writing-from-scratch guys. It’s surprisingly compact. There is, of course, the hard upper boundary of the line, which separates the from-scratch messages from the pasted ones, like a border between warring factions. But the band’s lower boundary is almost as crisp. There appears to be a natural limit to how much effort a person is willing to put into a message. If you do the arithmetic, it’s 3 characters typed for every 1 in the finished product. Above the diagonal are the people who… ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=951))

- and made a few edits to it. Here the logarithmic nature of the chart can fool you—even just a small amount over that central line means most of the content in the message is stock. Running up the left side, you see the dense vertical lines, the ruts. Those are the messages that were “typed” with just a few keystrokes. There are a lot of them—all told, 20 percent of the sample registered 5 or fewer keystrokes. These writers settled on something they like or that works, and they went with it. It’s not spam in the way we normally use that word—OkCupid is quick to get fake or bot accounts off the site. These are real people’s attempts at contact, essentially memorized digital pickup lines. Many are about as lazy and mundane as you’d expect: “Hey you’re cute” or “Wanna talk?”—just digital equivalents of “Come here often?” But some of the repeated messages are so idiosyncratic it’s hard to believe they would even apply to multiple people. Here’s one, presented exactly as typed: I’m a smoker too. I picked it up when backpacking in May. It used to be a drinking thing, but now I wake up and fuck, I want a cigarette.

- “(sp?)” is my favorite flourish. Forty-two different women got this same message. Sitewide, the copy-and-paste strategy underperforms from-scratch messaging by about 25 percent, but in terms of effort-in to results-out it always wins: measuring by replies received per unit effort, it’s many times more efficient to just send everyone roughly the same thing than to compose a new message each time. I’ve told people about guys copying and pasting, and the response is usually some variation of “That’s so lame.” When I tell them that boilerplate is 75 percent as effective as something original, they’re skeptical—surely almost everyone sees through the formula. But this last message is an example of a replicated text that’s impossible to see through, and, in a fraction of the time it would’ve taken him otherwise, the sender got five replies from exactly the type of woman he was looking for. And let me tell you something. Nearly every single thing on my desk, on my person, probably in my entire home, was made in a factory alongside who knows how many copies.

Language is more varied than ever before, even if some of it is directly copied from the clipboard—variety is the preservation of an art, not a threat to it. From the high-flown language of literary fiction to the simple, even misspelled, status update, through all this writing runs a common purpose. Whether friend to friend, stranger to stranger, lover to lover, or author to reader, we use words to connect. And as long as there is a person bored, excited, enraged, transported, in love, curious, or missing his home and afraid for his future, he’ll be writing about it.

- A major drawback to data from dating sites is that it tells you next to nothing about people actually going on dates. Once people are together in person, they don’t need messages or ratings or any of that. It’s an irony both in the data set and in the job itself—you do it right and the customers leave. In pairs, no less! ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=999))

- Network analysis, the study of dots and lines just like the patterns above, has been a science for almost three hundred years, and you can see something of the rise of data (from trickle to cataclysm) in its progress. The first network problem was a kind of rustic brainteaser, really an Enlightenment-era urban legend, that it was impossible to walk through the Prussian city of Königsberg by crossing each of its seven bridges once and only once. In 1735, Leonhard Euler, as geniuses will do, came along and reduced what had been a colloquial question of neighborhoods and footpaths to an abstraction of dots and lines (formally: nodes and edges), and in doing so, he proved with rigor that the legend was true. He expressed the town as a network, and a discipline was founded. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1034))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Euler’s insight was that because you’re only supposed to cross each bridge once, to enter a new neighborhood you need a pair of bridges—one to get you in, another to get you out. So the solution is as simple as looking at the network plot and asking whether each point along your path, other than your beginning and end, has an even number of lines (a pair of bridges) attached. In Königsberg, none of them do, so the problem was solved. That from such homely origins can come an enduring and flourishing science, one that’s only now finding its full expression, is, I think, the best possible case for the human spirit.1 Euler’s concept of nodes and edges, which at first unraveled nothing more than a day’s walk, has since helped us understand disease and its vectors, trucks and their routes, genes and their bindings, and of course, people and their relationships. And in just the last few decades, network theory’s application to these last have exploded—because the networks themselves have exploded. Forty years ago, Stanley Milgram was mailing out parcels (kits with instructions and postage-paid envelopes) to a hundred people in Omaha, working on his “six degrees of separation,” hoping maybe a few dozen adventuresome souls would participate. His quaint methods—ingenious though they were—would give him the famous theory, but not quite its proof. In 2011, the unprecedented and overwhelming scale of Facebook allowed us to see that he was indeed right: 99.6 percent of the 721 million accounts at the time were connected by six steps or fewer.

- real life. For example, going back to my own story, Reshma’s cousin Sheel is highly embedded in her life. The two of them grew up together, and he, like she does, has connections to virtually every member of their large extended family, including many people I don’t even know. They’ve known each other their entire lives, whereas Reshma and I have been married for only seven years. Sheel and Reshma’s relationship as a central pair would function much like my left-hand example above. However, Sheel doesn’t know Reshma’s coworkers. He doesn’t know the members of Reshma’s dance troupe. He doesn’t know Reshma’s friends from college. I know them all, and what’s more, I am the only other person in her life these three distinct groups have in common, at least directly. For these groups, we embody the ideal on the right. It’s worth noting that if, for example, Reshma and I worked together, or she didn’t dance, or we went to the same college, we could not play the role we do in each other’s networks. Backstrom and Kleinberg call the level to which a relationship fulfills this ideal its “dispersion” because it shows how disconnected your graph would be without you—that is, how utterly your social circle would fly to the winds if you and your spouse were somehow ripped from the center (by, say, having a second child). I prefer “assimilation” because I think that better captures the upshot: assimilated people have a unique role as a couple within their mutual network. Highly assimilated couples function—the two people together—as the bond between many otherwise unconnected cliques. They are the special glue in a given ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1077))

- And here’s why it matters: For married people on Facebook, their spouse is the most assimilated member of their network an astounding 75 percent of the time. And, even more important for assimilation as a metric of relationship strength, the young couples for whom that’s not the case are 50 percent more likely to break up. In the most stable relationships, the two people play this unique role in each other’s lives. Considering alternate graphs of a nonassimilated couple, it makes a certain sense why—in an overly embedded one, like the left-hand example before, you and your spouse end up competing with everyone else for time and attention. There’s too much leveling, no specialness. Too many girls’ nights. Or in a cliquey network without assimilation, “leading separate lives” can very quickly become “leading secret lives,” which might look something like this: ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1094))

- Against assimilation, Backstrom and Kleinberg tested many other ways to evaluate a relationship, and there was one detail in their paper, presented almost as an aside, that I found particularly wry. Early on, the best predictor of a relationship doesn’t depend on the couple’s social graph at all; for the first year or so of dating, the optimal method is how often they view each other’s profile. Only over time, as the page views go down and their mutual network fills out, does assimilation come to dominate the calculus. In other words, the curiosity, discovery, and (visual) stimulation of falling for someone is eventually replaced by the graph-theory equivalent of nesting.

- There’s a great Tumblr called “Clients from Hell,” where anyone can submit their service-industry horror stories. There are all kinds of cluelessness and oblivion on display, and new posts go up every few hours. Here’s a typical submission, from someone doing a photo spread: CLIENT: Can we have a heading on the photo as well? DESIGNER: Well, it already has a caption. CLIENT: If the reader misses the caption, then they will still see the heading. DESIGNER: It would be quite unusual to have both a heading and a caption on a photo. CLIENT: That makes sense. Just put a heading next to the caption, then. My favorite client quote on the site right now is: “I don’t like the dinosaur in this graphic. It looks too fake. Use a real photo of a dinosaur instead.” The blog mostly gets submissions from graphic designers, but Clients from Hell’s popularity speaks to a universal truth. People hate their customers. I don’t mean hate on an individual level but, en masse, customers, like any rabble, are to be feared. Anyone who tells you otherwise, from the cupcake-shop owner down the street to the CEO in the boardroom, is lying.

If you are, say, a car company and people don’t like some part of your product, they mostly tell you indirectly, by not buying it. There’s historically been no open channel between Ford and the folks who want the cup holders to be green or who think it would be better if the steering wheel were a square, because, you know, most turns are 90 degrees. That’s why traditional companies spend so much on market research—they have to stay way ahead of these kinds of things, because by the time a company like Ford would naturally hear about a problem, via Accounts Receivable, it’s way too late. A website is different: if people have a cockamamie idea, someone at the company is just an e-mail away. And if people don’t use something, the site notices immediately. Measurements are tracked in real time, down to the finest grain, everywhere.

The app provided an interface to let both parties confirm, but there was no way for anyone to directly communicate before the date.

Attractiveness didn’t matter. This data, from real dates, turned everything I’d seen in ten years of running a dating site on its head. Here are the numbers for men. I’ve expressed attractiveness at right as the relative difference in a couple’s individual ratings, rather than as absolutes. I did this to capture the fact that a person’s happiness at finding himself across the table from, say, a “6” is highly dependent on his own looks. If he’s a “1,” he might be thrilled with that arrangement—it means he’s dating up. A “10” would feel differently.

In fact, there’s a lot of money to be made off it. You know what the difference between Tylenol and Kroger’s store-brand acetaminophen is? The box.

In terms of superficial compatibility, self-described Democrats and Republicans get along the least of all major groups on OkCupid—worse even than Protestants and Atheists. I know this through the many match questions the site asks: they cover pretty much everything, and the average user answers about three hundred of them.

- particular belief. We confirmed this in a summer-long experiment in 2011. People tend to run wild with those match questions, marking all kinds of stuff as “mandatory,” in essence putting a checklist to the world: I’m looking for a dog-loving, agnostic, nonsmoking liberal who’s never had kids—and who’s good in bed, of course. But very humble questions like Do you like scary movies? and Have you ever traveled alone to another country? have amazing predictive power.1 If you’re ever stumped on what to ask someone on a first date, try those. In about three-quarters of the long-term couples OkCupid has ever brought together, both people have answered them the same way, either both “yes” or both “no.” People tend to overemphasize the big, splashy things: faith, politics, and certainly looks, but they don’t matter nearly as much as everyone thinks. Sometimes they don’t matter at all. Fiasco though it was, Love Is Blind Day gave us a visceral example of what people do in the absence of information. In hiding pictures but changing nothing else, we created a real-time experiment to set against the site’s usual activity. For seven hours our users acted without the very thing our previous data had indicated was the single most important piece of knowledge OkCupid could offer: what everyone else looked like. Some of the upshot was predictable. People sent messages without the typical biases, or racial and attractiveness skews. What a user couldn’t see, he couldn’t judge. But of the 30,333 messages sent blindly, eventually 8,912 got replies, a rate about 40 percent higher than usual. And in the dark, for those who were there, something astounding happened. Twenty-four percent of the pairs of people talking when the photos were hidden had exchanged contact info before pictures were turned back on. That was in only the seven-hour window of Love Is Blind Day. The expected number in that amount of time is barely half that. So not only were people writing messages that were far more likely to get replies, they were giving out phone numbers and e-mail addresses at a higher rate—to people they’d never even seen. For the couples who began talking and were still getting to know each other when we restored photos at four p.m., however, the day had a reverse effect. The two people had been in the dark, then suddenly the lights came on, and, in the data, you can actually see them… ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1199))

I had to make it that way, because when you’re looking at how two American strangers behave in a romantic context, race is the ultimate confounding factor. And to make sure whatever I wanted to say about attraction or sex spoke to those ideas alone, I needed to cut it from the discussion.

- On OkCupid, one of the easiest ways to compare a black person and a white person (or any two people of any race) is to look at their “match percentage.” That’s the site’s term for compatibility. It asks users a bunch of questions, they give answers, and an algorithm predicts how well any two of them would get along over, say, a beer or dinner. Unlike other features on OkCupid, there is no visual component to match percentage. The number between two people only reflects what you might call their inner selves—everything about what they believe, need, and want, even what they think is funny, but nothing about what they look like. Judging by just this compatibility measure, the four largest racial groups on OkCupid—Asian, black, Latino, and white—all get along about the same.1 In fact, race has less effect ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1283))

To a computer not acculturated to the categories, “Asian” and “black” and “white” could just as easily be “Aries” and “Virgo” and “Capricorn.” But this racial neutrality is only in theory; things change once the users’ own opinions, and not just the color-blind workings of an algorithm, come into play. Given the full profile, with the photo dominating the page, this is how OkCupid’s users rate each other by race: ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1290))

But to make the trends easier to see, I’m going to take that same matrix and “normalize” each row. In the table below, each entry is the percentage difference (+/-) from the average (the “normal”) in the row. It’s the same information, just phrased a bit differently. Think of the normalized number as the men’s relative preference for women.

- I’ll soon move beyond OkCupid, and when I present similar matrices later, I’ll go directly to the normalized scores. But for now, the two essential patterns of male-to-female attraction are plain: men tend to like women of their own race. Far more than that, though, they don’t like black women. Message data is highly correlated with these ratings, so they follow the pattern as well.2 Just to show that these voting trends aren’t being thrown off by some obscure statistical artifact, I’ve put the raw per capita vote numbers in what’s called a box plot—it tells you where the bulk of a data set lies.

- Mathematically, this is a complete discount—being black basically costs you about three-quarters of a star in your rating, even if you’re at the top. Further, when you do this analysis in reverse, and look at the people actually casting the votes, you see a similar wholesale pattern. The broad majority of non-black men apply that three-quarters reduction to black women. There is no cadre of racists single-handedly bringing everything down. However startling this may be, it only reflects one data set, the thoughts of one group of people.

- it. In a digital world that’s otherwise compulsively networked, there’s an old-school solitude to online dating. Your experience is just you and the people you choose to be with; and what you do is secret. Often the very fact that you have an account—let alone what you do with it—is unknown to your friends. So people can act on attitudes and desires relatively free from social pressure. In the layperson’s mind, Facebook, “the social network,” is the sine qua non of online data sources. And it’s easy to see why: Facebook is huge and pervasive, and a sample of their users is pretty much a sample of people worldwide who have Internet access—in other words, you can easily get a representative corpus for whatever you want. And they have such robust and diverse data: they know who you went to high school with, what song you just listened to on Spotify, where your parents live, and so on. But as often as it is an asset, that richness can be a liability. You rarely meet a stranger on Facebook. The site is, by design, people you already know and whom you’ve already made up your mind about—they’re your friends, after all. Facebook’s data on race is the embodiment of the “But I have black friends” solipsism you often hear. How you treat your friends is, by definition, the exception to how you treat the rest of humanity. And you and your friends’ relationships were formed outside of the network first. Moreover, people become inhibited when their friends are watching. This fishbowl aspect is why the first step of most ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1344))

- dating apps on Facebook is to get you off Facebook—your existence there is fully chaperoned. Long ago, we tried “social” features on OkCupid, and they bombed, as did similar features when Match.com gave them a go. For whatever reason, people don’t want their network along for online dating. The desire for solitude comes from the same place, I imagine, as the claustrophobia that would grip most of us if, on a promising first date at some restaurant, two old friends posted up at a nearby table. This is to take nothing away from the business or the community Facebook has created, but the “real life” relationships that both undergird and overarch the site give a different power to their data. When you want to look at something like race, where, at least among decent people, there’s pressure to behave a certain way in public, dating sites provide a uniquely powerful data set: everyone’s a stranger, alone, and there to tell you who they like and who they don’t.3 ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1356))

- side, women clearly prefer men of their own race—they’re more “race-loyal” than men—but they also express a preference for white men. Another way to dig into racial hierarchies is open to us on OkCupid, and it reinforces this “white preference.” Because the users are able to select more than one ethnic identity, we can study racial blends in an almost laboratory-like way. For example, we have men who check “Asian” as their ethnicity. We also have men who check both “Asian” and “white.” Comparing the two groups gives us some sense of what adding “whiteness” gets a person. It turns out: quite a bit. When you add white, ratings go up, across the board. I’ve just spilled out the complete data here. It’s a big, messy table, but it’s worth exploring. Down the right-hand column you see the improvement in scores created by whiteness in a person’s racial makeup. The biggest takeaway is that the racial discount applied to black men and women and Asian men in the tables above is significantly undone here. It’s the reverse of the old “one-drop” rule. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough people who select “black” and “Latino” or “Asian” and “black” to fully flesh out this alchemy, but it’s an intriguing glimpse at how we view the ethnic spectrum: ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1378))

Most of us—almost all, in fact—recognize that racism is wrong. But it is still implicit in many of the decisions we make.4 Psychologists have a name for the interior patterns of belief that help a person organize information as he encounters it: schema. And our schema is still out of step with how most of us know the world should be. By hundreds of small, everyday actions, none of them made with racist intent or feeling, we reflect a broader culture that is, in fact, racist. As we’ve seen, the pattern is so woven-in that relatively recent additions to our society, Asians and Latinos, have adopted it, too.

- Sociology professor Osagie K. Obasogie recently produced some ingenious research—he interviewed people blind from birth and found the same attitudes about race as in the sighted world. His sample was relatively small—just 106 individuals, but he found my OkCupid data in the flesh. He cites numerous examples of a young blind person being happy on a date until some “tell”—usually the feel of the hair but occasionally a whisper from a stranger—revealed that the other person was black. The date was then over. Obasogie asserts that blind people’s attitudes on race reflect a lifetime of cultural absorption, as opposed to any visual reality. From his data, it seems impossible to argue otherwise. Moreover, he observed that sex is the locus of the sharpest discord between what we’re looking at and what our culture tells us we see. As he puts it to the Boston Globe, he was struck by the vigilance with which, even among his blind subjects, “racial boundaries get patrolled, primarily in the realm of dating.” To take his metaphor one step further, a patrol protects the interior, and here dating is just the frontier of a vast cultural mass that will take decades to rearrange.

- It is hardly fresh intellectual ground that beauty matters, and that it matters more for women. For example, a foundational paper of social psychology ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1518))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is called “What Is Beautiful Is Good.” It was the first in a now long line of research to establish that good-looking people are seen as more intelligent, more competent, and more trustworthy than the rest of us. More attractive people get better jobs. They are also acquitted more often in court, and, failing that, they get lighter sentences. As Robert Sapolsky notes in the Wall Street Journal, two Duke neuropsychologists are working on why: “The medial orbitofrontal cortex of the brain is involved in rating both the beauty of a face and the goodness of a behavior, and the level of activity in that region during one of those tasks predicts the level during the other. In other words, the brain … assumes that cheekbones tell you something about minds and hearts.” On a neurological level, the brain registers that ping of sexual attraction—Ooh, she’s hot—and everything else seems to be splash damage. To my second point, that beauty affects women in particular, Naomi Wolf’s bestseller The Beauty Myth showed that better than I ever could. In short, my raw findings here are not new. What is new is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions. That granularity gives strength and nuance to previous work, and even suggests ways to build on it. The paper “What Is Beautiful” was based on a research sample of only 60 subjects—barely adequate to prove the effect, let alone its many facets.2 But now we can go from “What Is Beautiful Is Good” to asking “How Good?” and in what contexts. In sex, beauty is very good. In friendship, it’s only somewhat good, and when you’re looking for a job, the effect really depends on your gender. As for Wolf’s seminal work, we can confirm the truth behind her broad observation that “today’s woman has become her ‘beauty’ ”—three robust research sets agree that the correlation is strong. And, better, we can extend some of her most cogent arguments about beauty being a means of social control. Think about how the Shiftgig data changes our understanding of women’s perceived workplace performance. They are evidently being sought out (and exponentially so) for a trait that has nothing to do with their ability to do a job well. Meanwhile, men have no such selection imposed. It is therefore simple probability that women’s failure rate, as a whole, will be higher. And, crucially, the criteria are to blame, not the people. Imagine if men, no matter the job, were hired for their physical strength. You would, by design, end up with strong men facing challenges that strength has nothing to do with. In the same way, to hire women based on their looks is to (statistically) guarantee poor performance. It’s either that or you limit their opportunities. Thus Ms. Wolf: “The beauty myth is always actually prescribing behavior and not appearance.” She was speaking primarily in a sexual context, but here, we see how it plays out, with mathematical equivalence, in the workplace.

- had elected a black governor, Tom Bradley, by a significant margin, but in the privacy of the ballot box they had actually given his white opponent a narrow victory. Throughout the ’80s and ’90s, black candidates often received more support in polls than in actual elections. Problems beyond racism, like depression and addiction, are similarly difficult to diagnose at a societal level because people can’t be honest about them. Even on OkCupid’s match questions—which are by and large unseen by anyone but the answerer—the users are just unwilling to own up to certain attitudes, even ones they in fact act upon elsewhere on the site. The mere act of asking elicits self-censoring. Almost every site that registers opinions or collects descriptive data has the same problem. But there is one place that doesn’t need to ask for anything, and so the data is set free: With search, there is no ask. You just tell. Google’s only prompt is that famously open page, with its lone entry form—that slim rectangle of emptiness, cursor parked and ready, just waiting for your thoughts. The company’s business is to help people find stuff in the vast thicket of the Internet, and it’s done that spectacularly.

- The government has the greatest vested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models already exist to predict the outcome of armed conflict—how long it will last, who will win, and how many people will die—and the models of late have learned to accommodate guerrilla warfare, since that’s the shape of today’s war. But armed insurgency is often preceded by unarmed unrest—which itself is often propagated, even coordinated, through social media.5 Those nascent movements, being digitized, have attracted the attention of researchers. Using Western movements as his test subjects, MIT’s Peter Gloor has developed software to track the ebb and flow of sentiment in a network of protestors. He calls it Condor, because that’s what projects like this always seem to be called: Condor, spirit-bird of government grants. In any event, the software first establishes a group’s central personalities by looking at its social graph—much like we portrayed a marriage as edges and nodes before, the software lays out the network, then algorithmically determines its most important dots. Next, it looks at what those dots are saying. Condor has found that while the foci of a movement are positive in their word choice, the movement is vibrant. But negative words like “hate,” “not,” “lame,” and “never” signal decline, and when, as The Economist put it, “complaints about idiots in one’s own movement or such infelicities as the theft of beer by a fellow demonstrator” begin to appear, the movement is all but over. Oh, Occupy! As for deciphering the aims of unrest, which is where this technology can move beyond mere spying and into doing some good, similar kinds of textual analysis have been used to determine, for example, which Egyptian towns will be most upset by border incidents with Israel, and to pinpoint water insecurity in a drought-stricken countryside. Any software that follows the thread of a thought through a network must track not only the idea but the “susceptibility” of people exposed to it. It must see what takes hold, what gets repeated, and who moves it along. Relaying someone else’s opinion isn’t unique to the Internet any more than negativity is: television and radio made “talking points” into a phrase long before AOL came along, let alone Twitter. Rush Limbaugh’s staunchest fans call themselves “Dittoheads”—but nothing makes parroting an idea more simple, or more trackable, than the Like, the Ping, the Reblog, or the Retweet button. Remember: 27.5 percent of Twitter’s 500 million tweets a day are retweets, people just passing along someone else’s thought. Facebook’s data team investigated their version of the phenomenon, tracing the evolution of a single status update from the health-care debates in 2009 through the network: ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=1890))

Someone who didn’t quite feel that the update spoke for him would change it slightly, and versions spread outward into different social circles. When you put each version against the political bias of the people posting it (–2.0 is maximally liberal, +2.0 conservative), not only do you get an interesting look at the American political spectrum—extremes of right and left, plus a center that has opted-out of the discussion—but you also see how political belief translates into words.

And, above all, it runs to ground our age-old desire to raise ourselves up by putting other people down. Scientists have established that the drive is as old as time, but this doesn’t mean they understand it yet.

- Now, twenty years later, I find myself sitting on millions of essays—billions of words—more or less written to answer that same prompt: “Who are you?” And this body of text actually allows me to do the inverse of the college application process. Instead of matching essays one at a time against a preconceived ideal (i.e., “college material”), I can mush all the essays together and see what ideals they reveal to me. There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don’t need to ask it questions—it just tells you everything anyway. How do people describe themselves? What’s important, what’s typical, what’s atypical? When everyone else gets a turn to put down in words who they are, what identities do they sketch? We’re going to look at broad categories here: black people, white people, Asians, females, males, and so on. A problem in studying any particular group is that you always bring your own prejudices and preconceptions along with you. What you choose to notice, remember, and transcribe is as much a matter of how you look as what’s actually there. In social science, knowledge, like water, often takes the shape of its vessel. So if we want to take all the self-statements I’ve collected and pull from them a sense of who the writers are—what makes ethnicities and sexes and orientations unique—we’ll need to develop an algorithm that takes the “us” out of it and leaves just the “them.” OkCupid’s user-submitted profile essays are as close to personal self-summaries as you’ll find.

Adding a few more words to the chart will give you a sense of how the geometry translates before I zoom out to the full corpus. I’ve added a diagonal, yet again, to show parity in the data. The words near the line are important to everyone equally. And the farther up and to the right the words go, the more universally important they are. But remember, we’re not looking for universals. We’re looking for particulars. We want to know what is special to the people we’re considering: here, white guys. For that we need to look to the upper left: the farther in that direction a word appears, the more often white men use it, and the less often everyone else does. In fact, the closer a word is to that remotest reach of white maleness, the top-left vertex of the square, the more it typifies them and only them. Imagine a dot all the way in the corner: to be there, the word would have to appear on every single white male profile and at the same time never appear… ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2044))

- Because every data set has its quirks, researchers must often build tools from scratch, as we have here. Whenever you do this, it’s good to check your method against some familiar outcomes. Imagine a shipwright with a new boat: who knows what’ll happen once it’s out on the open ocean—so best to check for holes close to shore.

- Phish might’ve already given it away, but inside the white man rages a music festival for lumberjacks. As for the other three lists, I had never heard of Zane or Anthony Hamilton or The Coldest Winter Ever or Chungking Express or Dash Berlin or a lot of the above before my scripts coughed them up, and I’m not going to pretend that a few minutes with Wikipedia can stand in for an understanding of a culture. These are users speaking in their own voice, and I’m going to let them do just that, but I will point out a few broad trends: white people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know. Of course, we’re all familiar with Spike Lee and Beijing and Shanghai, but these lists give us the “insiders’ ” view of a culture. It’s stuff an outsider can’t get from autocomplete, or in any other top-down way, because you can’t wonder at what you don’t realize is out there. “Why do Asian people like Norwegian Wood?” isn’t a stereotype because not enough non-Asians are familiar with the book (by Haruki Murakami) and movie.

- The opposite-of-Latino list I found most surprising. Hispanic and white identities are often conflated by demographers; for example, the US Census has struggled for years to separate one from the other. But they can only use checkboxes on paper. Latinos’ “most typical” list above and their “opposite” one here define the extremes. That first gives you the furthest reaches of Latin culture (music and language) and this second gives the “corn-fed” Midwestern white stereotype, which is one of the few white subcultures with no Latin influence. Also, please notice that the “least Asian” things are all misspellings, working-class occupations, and other underachievements, like single fatherhood. And of course there’s “64.” The women’s lists are equally rich, and I again suggest you take in every word.

- And the data I have is ideal for tackling taboos. But sex is the single-most important grouping that humanity has. It’s existed forever, even stretching back to when we were just one people, and perhaps because of those deep-time roots, gender roles are more universal and more stubborn than any other. It’s easy to forget, given how ineradicable the color line can seem, that ideas of race are a product of time and place. The Irish and eastern Europeans weren’t considered “white” until the 1900s; in Mexico, the indigenous Mayans and the mestizos with Spanish blood have been distinct ethnic groups (and political opponents) for centuries. Yet to most people from the United States, they’re both just “Hispanic.” But sexual division is a given in human culture—every culture, every time. Paradoxically, OkCupid isn’t the best place to explore the differences between men and women, at least through the method we’ve developed here. Your sex is built into how you use a dating site, so, for example, the most salient thing you find about (straight) women from their profile text is that they’re looking for men, and so on. Sex and profile text are inextricable, and analysis gets you little more than tautologies. The ideal… ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2107))

- This gives you the distilled essences of men and women—read and grow stupider. Remember, before you get depressed, that the method is designed to find what’s unique about each group, find the things they don’t have in common and bring them to the fore. It’s the mathematical version of the guy at the state fair: caricature by algorithm instead of airbrush. These are the words at the extremes, but for men and women, as for the ethnic groups before, the essential vocabulary (“the,” “pizza,” and so on) is shared. In fact, there’s a growing consensus among psychologists that men and women are fundamentally very similar, despite the popular cosmology that has them on different planets. Researchers at the University of Rochester recently pronounced “Men Are from Mars Earth, Women Are from Venus Earth,” concluding: From empathy and sexuality to science inclination and extroversion, statistical analysis of 122 different characteristics involving 13,301 individuals shows ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2138))

- that men and women, by and large, do not fall into different groups. And yet, though my method is built to tease out differences, it’s hard to imagine two more opposite sets of interests than the ones listed above. I can’t tell which side to root for here—on the one hand, it’s surely a worse world where women fixate on their appearance and men live the beef jerky lifestyle. On the other hand, if men and women were exactly alike, life wouldn’t be much fun. Same goes for the by-race lists above. Cultural differences, even if they’re occasionally laughable, make the world a richer place. The Mars/Venus thing, metaphor though it is, reminds me that the heavens are an ancient reference point for science. Aristotle looked to the emptiness overhead to verify his aether. Newton confirmed his law of inverse squares through the motion of Mars. Even Einstein wasn’t truly Einstein until the sun and moon said so, in a 1919 eclipse that confirmed the theory of General Relativity. Even though we’re working on nothing so grand as all that here, I have to say I hope that paper’s snarky strikeout typeface is premature, at least for the things we like and talk about and the ways we spend our time. Look at it this way: if there were no planet out there but Earth, it would be a very boring universe. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2146))

- A few years ago a couple of MIT students, as a class project, used Facebook’s data to create a working “gaydar.” It was a simple piece of software that behaved a lot like any human trying to make an educated guess about somebody: it looked at who the person’s friends were. The program quickly learned to recognize that a certain balance of gays and straights in a guy’s social circle reliably indicated his sexuality; it didn’t need to know anything directly about him at all. As the Boston Globe put it at the time, “People may be effectively ‘outing’ themselves just by the virtual company they keep.” After the students had trained it on known profiles, the software was able to correctly predict if a man was gay 78 percent of the time, just from the nature of his social graph. That’s a highly robust result when you consider that the expected success rate, if the program were just guessing blind, would’ve been only … uh, like … 10 percent? 2 percent? 8? π/2?

- After you get past questions of “outness,” gay users look a lot like everyone else on OkCupid. In the match questions, the site’s gay users show the same rates of drug use, racial prejudice, and horniness as the straights, and gays want the same types of relationships. In fact, for sexual attitudes, if any group is an outlier, it’s straight women. They’re comparative prudes: 6.1 percent of straight men, 6.9 percent of gay men, and 7.0 percent of lesbians are on OkCupid explicitly looking for casual sex. Only 0.8 percent of straight women are, which probably says more about the ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2247))

- lists are all single-mindedly concerned with the person’s (potential) partner. Every last entry for straight women is focused on the guy she’s looking for (I’m counting Jesus here; he’s single), and the men’s only departure from talking about women is to note the presence or absence of children. These lists together read like “Me Tarzan, you Jane” in long form. Or maybe as adapted by Nicholas Sparks. The lesbian list is more inward-looking, with more self-description, but it’s still quite similar to the straight lists. Like straight women, lesbians are very much typified by the relationship they’re looking for (you’re femme, my future wife); they’re just using different words. The gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family. Anything on Bravo has to be the most spot-on generalization of all time. That said, it’s interesting that gay men are the least sex- and sexual identity–focused of all three groups. Or rather, they get their identity from something besides sex. This method is, again, made to emphasize differences between the groups, but other data shows that the boundaries are porous. One of the most intriguing findings from OkCupid is the answer to this match question, asked only of the site’s self-identified straight users.

- That is, 51 percent of women and 18 percent of men have had or would like to have a same-sex experience. Those numbers are far higher than any plausible estimate of the true gay population, so not only do we find that sexuality is more fluid than the categories a website can accommodate, we see that sex with someone of the same gender is relatively common, whether people consider it part of their identity or not. The above data is from users who chose “straight” when signing up, but in that same pull-down menu OkCupid offers “bisexual” as an option. About 8 percent of women and 5 percent of men choose it. I have seen much frustration among bisexuals both on OkCupid and elsewhere with the idea that bisexuality is not a “real” orientation—that, for example, bisexual men are just gay men who haven’t come to grips with it yet. Many gay people see bisexuality as a hedge. A recent study by the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health puts it well, if a bit dryly: “Respondents who identified as gay or lesbian responded significantly less positively toward bisexuality … indicating that even within the sexual minority community, bisexuals face profound stigma.” Gerulf Rieger of the University of Essex, working with psychologists from Northwestern and Cornell, concluded in a 2005 paper that in terms of genital reaction to stimulus, almost all self-reported bisexual men were gay, some were straight, and very few were physically aroused by both sexes. He thus described male bisexuality as a “style” of interpreting arousal rather than arousal itself. Understandably, this infuriated the bisexual community; Rieger later revisited the topic to conclude that male bisexuality might be “a matter of curiosity”—that “interest in seeing others naked, observing someone else having sex, watching pornographic movies, or taking part in sex orgies” explained the apparent disconnect… ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2280))

- To land in either of the “message only” swaths, a user had to send 95 percent or more of his or her contacts to that sex, so the threshold there is quite high; this isn’t an accounting trick. Only a fraction of the bisexual user base has any significant contact with both sexes. Whatever the mechanism, Rieger’s claim that self-reported bisexuality doesn’t reflect observed behavior appears correct in this case. Interestingly, for men, messaging changes over time. In that change we find plausible evidence for the hedge narrative: more than half of younger bisexual men message only other men, and that percentage drops steadily until the mid-thirties, at which point most of the male bisexual user base is messaging only women. This is what you would expect to see if men interested in men stop identifying themselves as bisexual as they get older and become more comfortable with being called “gay.” But this question takes longitudinal data to fully answer, which we don’t have yet. That said, who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things, and the latter shouldn’t automatically disqualify the former.

Earlier that same month, Germany was divided into zones of occupation that reflected, more than anything else, whose troops ([Location 2392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2392))

- were standing where at the time. Many of our own American states were created by royal charter or act of Congress, their borders drawn by people who would never see the land in person. Absentee mapmaking was and still is a much more pernicious problem in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East—and everywhere else the tread of Empire has stamped the soil. Only very occasionally have maps been drawn to reflect “the will of the people,” and even in those cases, as we’ve seen in Israel, which began its modern history as, officially, the British Mandate for Palestine, the question naturally becomes: which people, whose will. For websites, political and natural borders are just another set of data points to consider. When information—fluid, unbounded, abstract—is your currency, the physical world with its many arbitrary limits is most often a nuisance. At OkCupid, rivers are an endless irritant to the distance-matching algorithms. Queens is both a half mile and a world away from Manhattan. Try explaining that to a computer. The problem is that when a person is online, he or she is both of the world and removed from it. But that duality also means we can remix our physical spaces along new lines, ones perhaps more meaningful than those drawn by plate tectonics or the dictates of some piece of parchment.

- On the next page I’ve plotted the two hundred most popular topics, and this is something you could properly call “the United States of Reddit.” It’s a geography like the Craigslist division we saw before—made, in fact, by a similar algorithm—but instead of physical geography, it plots a geography of interests, of the collective Reddit psyche. And it shows distinct yet connected communities. The size of each state corresponds to the popularity of the topic, and the software put “like with like,” according to cross-commenting between subreddits. As we did before when we encountered an unfamiliar way to present verbal data, you should search out a few known terms to get a feel for how everything fits together. For me, this was easy. My favorite game, Magic: The Gathering (magicTCG), is correctly surrounded by its unfortunate natural friends MensRights, whowouldwin, and mylittlepony. Similarly, many sports (nfl, nba, formula1, and so on) are grouped at the bottom. Everything pokemon is clustered over to the left. Britishproblems, along the right edge, is next to australia and soccer. It also makes sense that the most popular subreddits are in the center—that is, not too far from anything. The red tint corresponds to how tight-knit each subreddit is. It shows the degree to which the people posting post only there. The darker the red, the more isolated the thread. This whole thing is an abstraction, but it shows how people can locate themselves by what they find interesting or funny or important rather than where they ([Location 2519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2519))

I was supposed to read it for a college class and didn’t, but through all my moves over the years I’ve carried it with me; it’s been a stowaway in every U-Haul. The book’s called Imagined Communities, and I opened it recently because the title finally seemed applicable. Anderson’s main topics are nationalism and nation-building and he suggests that a nation “is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.” He was writing in 1981, but he could have been talking about the Internet. I don’t know if Reddit is a nation, but it’s got plenty of communion. And it’s interesting to see another purely digital community define its burgeoning identity. Earlier we saw the ancient rush to communal violence, as directed at Safiyyah, Natasha, and Justine on Twitter.

We know that those numbers keep our users interested, especially when they go up. Without little bits of excitement, a webpage or an app seems dead and people drift off. The broad term for this is “user engagement,” how many people check in every week, every day, every hour. It’s basically how fast they are running in the hamster wheel that’s been set down for them there in cedar filings, and it’s one of the most obsessed-over measures in the industry. Sites show you counts, totals, badges, because they know you’ll come back to see them tick up. Then they can put your increased engagement on a slide to impress their investors.

- But given that Klout uses many of the same reductive tools that I myself have employed to gather data, where does that leave you and me and the book we’ve both spent all this time with? Well, the short answer is: right there with Klout and Salesforce. Reduction is inescapable. Algorithms are crude. Computers are machines. Data science is trying to make digital sense of an analog world. It’s a by-product of the basic physical nature of the microchip: a chip is just a sequence of tiny gates. Not in the way that the Internet is a “series of tubes” but in actuality. The gates open and close to let electrons through, and when one of these gates wants to know what state to be in, it’s all or nothing—like any door, a circuit is open or it isn’t; there are no shades of maybe. From that microscopic reality an absolutism propagates up through the whole enterprise, until at the highest level you have the definitions, data types, and classes essential to programming languages like C and JavaScript. Thus, information is reduced by necessity. But fundamentally the objections to the Klout-score requirement were about the people being reduced to digits, not just their information. And here’s where Dataclysm diverges from Salesforce’s job post, and indeed Klout’s whole business model. As many numbers as there are here, they’re not meant to stand in for any one person. A single number never could. It’s a truth summed up by the apocryphal story that Einstein flunked math in high school. He didn’t. But he could’ve, and if he had, who cares? If he got a 35 in Algebra II, so what? Is he suddenly not smart? No number, no test, no single measurement—not IQ, not height, and certainly not a Klout score or friend count or reply percentage on OkCupid—is a whole person, which is exactly why, beyond illustration, individual users ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2732))

Imagine a mysterious die—you can’t count the sides but you can roll it and see what comes up. Roll once and you could get any number, you learn nothing. Roll it a bunch of times, you get the distribution, you get the average—and that defines the die right there. You know the shape only through aggregation.

- you need the whole story to get it right—I’m pulling from the undifferentiated whole. We focus on the dense clusters, the centers of mass, the data duplicated over and over by the repetition and commonality of our human experience. It’s science as pointillism. Those dots may be one fractional part of you, but the whole is us. Aggregation and reduction also allow us to deal in broad trends, the smooth flow of which might not have the peaks and troughs of the usual hero narratives but which are all the more applicable for it. The fact that Paul McCartney and John Lennon practiced rock music for 10,000 hours and then became the Beatles does say something about the value of rehearsal and persistence, but that number itself means nothing. I myself have put in that kind of time playing guitar, as have many others whose music you’ll never hear. Whatever it was that allowed Lennon and McCartney to turn practice into genius, it’s unique to them. On the other hand, every number in this book has many hundreds, often many thousands, of people behind it, none of them famous. Here’s the kernel of it: the phrase “one in a million” is at the core of so many wonderful works of art. It means a person so special, so talented, so something that they’re practically unique, and that very rareness makes them significant. But in mathematics, and so with data, and so here in this book, the phrase means just the opposite: 1/1,000,000 is a rounding error. But if simplifying is what it takes to understand large data sets, I do worry ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2757))

- about a different kind of reductionism: people becoming not a number exactly, but a dehumanized userid fed into the grind of a marketing algorithm; grist for someone else’s brand. Data takes too much of the guesswork out of the sell. It’s a rare urban legend that turns out to be true, but Target, by analyzing a customer’s purchases, really did know she was pregnant before she’d told anyone. The hitch was that she was a teenager, and they’d started sending maternity ads to her father’s house. In some ways, that kind of corporate intrusion is better than brands actually trying to “relate.” Last summer, a Jell-O marketing campaign co-opted (tagjacked?) the hashtag #fml, which is Internet shorthand for “fuck my life.” Their social media people began responding to tweets that contained the tag with an unsolicited offer to “fun” the person’s life instead, with coupons. Thus people in extremis received jaunty offers from a gelatin, as in this exchange: Pyrrhus Nelson @suhrryp Seeing my bank account disappear at the dr office #fml JELL-O @JELLO @suhrryp Fun My Life? Of course we will. In fact, we’d be happy to. prmtns.co/dkTq Exp. 48hrs This kind of unwanted intercession is all too easy on social media because everything is so quantified.

A few years ago, McDonald’s sent out a couple tweets, feel-good stories about their suppliers, with the tag #McDStories, and they got #fml’d in reverse. This is just one of many responses: MUZZAFUZZA @Muzzafuzza I haven’t been to McDonalds in years, because I’d rather eat my own diarrhea. #McDStories McDonald’s had paid to promote the hashtag and pulled the campaign after only a couple hours when it quickly spiraled out of their control. A week later, the repurposed #McDStories was still going strong. Their social media strategists should’ve known what to expect: a few months before, Wendy’s had tried to push #HeresTheBeef, and their catchphrase was ripped completely free of the intended context. People used it to complain about anything they didn’t like (had a beef with), ignoring the brand: Remi Mitchison @RemiBee #HeresTheBeef when a chick see another chick doin better and has more than she does … so she wanna stunt and #GetThatAssBeatUp Jeremy Baumhower @jeremytheproduc ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2782))

Reddit and 4chan got ahold of it, and “Hitler did nothing wrong” led the voting for a while, until at the last minute “Diabeetus” swooped in and the people’s voice was heard: Dub yourself, motherfucker. The Internet can be a deranged place, but it’s that potential for the unexpected, even the insane, that so often redeems it. I can’t imagine anything worse for You! The Brand! than upvoting Hitler. Plus, what a waste of time, because obviously Mountain Dew isn’t going to print a single unflattering word in the style of its precious and distinctive marks.

In Manhattan, just below Fourteenth Street, there are 4,176. Satellites and drones complete the picture beyond the asphalt. Though there’s no telling what each one sees, it’s safe to say: if the government is interested in your whereabouts, one sees you.

- This data, despite the “mining” metaphor, isn’t a naturally occurring resource; it comes from somewhere—and that somewhere is you. The companies and the government are collecting disparate pieces of your private life and trying to fashion them back into an image they can master. The more privacy you lose, the more effective they are. The fundamental question in any discussion of privacy is the trade-off—what you get for losing it. We make calculated trades all the time. Public figures sell their personal lives to advance their careers. Anyone who’s booked a hostel in Europe or bought a train ticket in India has had to decide if the private room is worth the extra money. And not to confuse the issue here, but many people, men and women, trade on privacy when they walk out the door in the evening, giving it away, via a hemline or a snug fit, for attention. So the exchange isn’t new. But our trading partners, and their terms, are.

- I point this out because, to many people, government workers have an indifferent reputation—bureaucrats, functionaries, whatever. And certainly the average person working in data analytics in the private sector is as likely to be competent as not. But the people spying on us are extremely, extremely smart. We can hope that they, like Feynman and Einstein before them, are able to temper their work with a farsighted humanity, but we can know, for sure, that, like Feynman and Einstein before them, what they’re working on is inhumanly powerful. Insofar as algorithms are fed by data, Mr. Snowden has revealed that the NSA’s are fatted on superfood. Or rather … all the food. They gather phone calls, e-mail, text messages, pictures, basically everything that travels by electric current.

- People leave some amazing breadcrumbs for anyone interested in following them. You’ve seen plenty already—200 pages’ worth. Even so, there are just as many trails we haven’t followed. For example, a little text file called the Exif is attached to all images taken with a digital camera, from high-end SLRs to your iPhone. The file encodes not only when the picture was taken but miscellany like the f-stop and shutter speed for the photo and, often, the latitude and longitude of where it was taken. Exif is how programs like iPhoto can effortlessly sort your pictures into “moments” and place little pins all over the map to show you where you’ve been. There are other things the Exif can tell you, though. Take the profile photos on OkCupid. The better-looking a photo is, the better chance it has of being outdated. That is, people find that one “great picture” and just lock it in forever. We know this because of the Exif, which ([Location 2927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2927))

- tells us when the picture was taken. This kind of data tagalong is common. GPS coordinates ride shotgun over the network whenever you open your favorite app. Almost every web page you’ve ever loaded has dozens of one-pixel images (just a single transparent dot) buried in the margins that, by being loaded alongside the “real” page, register your visit; the pixels can’t tell what you’re doing, just when and where you’ve gone. This simple stuff, just whens and wheres can give a company a good guess at your whole demographic profile. What about the people who don’t want to share like this? The people who would rather shop and preen alone? I myself know the value of privacy. That’s part of the reason I’m not a big social-media user, frankly. I have never posted a picture of my daughter on the Internet. I started using Instagram in earlyish 2011 when the service wasn’t big yet, and I used it as just a photo gallery app because I liked the filters. I thought it was like Hipstamatic, not really social—I know this makes me sound like a grandfather. When my wife realized what her fuddy-duddy husband was doing, she pointed out that I could connect my account to other people’s accounts, which I did, because hey, look: a button to click. But once it wasn’t just me on my own with my pictures, it lost all appeal. This kind of reticence is unusual. For all the hand-wringing, it’s hard to argue that most users are anything but blasé about privacy.

- reach deeper into our data, we rage in circles for a day, then are on the site the next, like so many provoked bees who, finding no one to sting, have nowhere to go but back to the hive. Because tech loves to push boundaries and the boundaries keep giving, software has gotten almost aggressively invasive. There are weight-loss apps. Heart-rate apps. Rate-my-outfit apps—submit your ensemble to the crowd for fashion advice. Women are using apps to predict and manage their menstrual cycle: “The market is flooded with them,” as Jenna Wortham writes, before adding, “nearly every woman I know uses one.” You let the app know when your period starts, and it’ll alert you when you’re at peak fertility, to avoid or embrace as you wish. Of course, self-reported data not being quite invasive enough, there’s a startup that says it can infer when a woman is having her period from her link history. Any of these menstruation apps—at least if they have a competent data scientist behind them—will of course also know when a user is pregnant, overexercising, getting older, or having unprotected sex, since when you’re late, you’ll check the thing unusually often. But despite some, even many, people’s cavalier attitude toward privacy, I didn’t want to put anyone’s identity at risk in making this book. As I’ve said, all the analysis was done anonymously and in aggregate, and I handled the raw source material with care. There was no personally identifiable information (PII) in any of my data. In the discussion of users’ words—their profile text, tweets, status updates, and the like—those words were public. Where I had user-by-user records, the userids were encrypted. And in any analysis the scope of the data was limited to only the essential variables, so nothing could be tied back to any individual. I never wanted to connect the data back to individuals, of course. My goal was to connect it back to everyone. That’s the value I see in the data and therefore in the privacy lost in its existence: what we can learn. Jaron Lanier, author of Who Owns the Future? and a computer scientist currently working at Microsoft Research, wrote in Scientific American that “a stupendous amount of information about our private lives is being stored, analyzed and acted on in advance of a demonstrated valid use for it.” He’s unquestionably right about the “tremendous amount,” but I take issue with his… ([Location 2945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J1IQUX8&location=2945))

- people won’t use them. OkCupid asks women: Have you ever had an abortion?—it’s the 3,686th match question; I told you they truly cover everything. Right beneath the question, there’s a checkbox to keep your answer private. Of the people who answer in the affirmative, fewer than half check the box. So most people won’t use the tools you give them, but maybe “most people” is the wrong goal here. For one thing, providing ways to delete, or even repossess, data is the right thing to do, no matter how few users take you up on it. For another, it’s possible that privacy has changed, and left the people writing about it behind. Lanier and I are old men by Internet standards, and it’s not just in armies that “generals always fight the last war.” My expectations of what is correct and permissible might be wrong.

- In fact, I would argue that people are already compensated for their data: they get to use services like Facebook and Google—connect with old friends, find what they’re looking for—for free. As I’ve said, I give these services little of myself; but I get less out of them too. People have to decide their own trade-off there. Soon, though, there might be only one decision to make: am I going to use these services at all? The analytics are becoming so powerful that it may not matter what you try to hold back. From only the barest information, algorithms are already able to extrapolate or infer much about a person; that’s after only a few years of data to work on. Soon the half measures provided by menu options as you “manage your privacy settings” will give no protection at all, because the rest of your world won’t be so withholding. Companies and the government will find you through the graph. This whole debate could soon be an anachronism.

- It’s old hat now, but the app Shazam was, to me, one of the first great wonders of the iPhone. It’s a little program for identifying music—if some song is playing, and you want to know what it is, you just turn on the app and hold up your phone. Shazam listens through the microphone, and, like, two seconds later, it tells you what you’re listening to. The first time someone did it in front of me, I was just blown away, not only at how little the software needed to get the song right (it can often work through walls or above the din of a bar), but at how fast it worked. It was the closest thing I’d seen to magic, at least until I came to know a certain able necromancer who, at a whim, could summon fees and add them to my goddamn kitchen renovation.

This melodic contour is called the song’s Parsons code, named after the musicologist who developed it in the 1970s. The code for the first two lines of “Happy Birthday” is •RUDUDDRUDUD, with U meaning “melody up,” D meaning “melody down,” and R for “repeated note.” The dot • just marks the beginning of the tune, which of course isn’t up or down from anything.
