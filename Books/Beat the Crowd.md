## Highlights
- In investing, the crowd is wrong much more often than right. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ635DU&location=315))

- No approach works all the time, including assuming the crowd is wrong. Sometimes, they’re right! The market usually doesn’t do what everyone expects, but there are always exceptions. If TGH didn’t let the crowd be right sometimes, there wouldn’t be a crowd! ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ635DU&location=373))

- Very well-read, bright people who pay close attention to the market often make pretty bad investing decisions! There is usually one simple reason for this: They inadvertently get sucked into consensus views. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ635DU&location=398))

- lawyers are logicians by trade and nature—they expect markets to follow rules, processes and simple logic. Most engineers, too. They expect markets to be linear and rational, just like the systems they build and work with daily. Rules-based investors usually use similar logic and reach similar conclusions. They use the same patterns, the same if-then assumptions. They end up expecting similar things, and it morphs into a consensus viewpoint. It usually ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ635DU&location=407))

- The playbook also doesn’t pass a basic logic test—one of the true contrarian’s favorite tools, as we’ll see in Chapter 4. It includes familiar adages, like “buy on the dips”—when stocks are on sale, snap ’em up at a bargain! But that’s also when the playbook would tell you to “cut your losses”—get out of that dog before it goes to zero, and ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ635DU&location=421))

Yet the next page tells you to “take some profits off the table.” Which do you choose? Both sound intuitive! If a stock is running, you want to let it run. But you know it could easily run off a cliff, plummeting with legs churning like Wile E. Coyote, so pocketing some of those gains seems wise! The playbook doesn’t tell you which play to run.

- focused on this year’s or next year’s earnings per share, always thinking in calendar years! If they were private, he said, they’d think much longer term. If they had the chance to make an investment with a sky-high return over 20 years, they’d care less about up-front costs, business cycles and the reality of short-term losses. They’d care much more about the total return at the end of those 20 years, net of all those occasional big losses. When a business starts a plant, the project bleeds cash—planning, architecture and construction drain capital. Businesses hyper-focused on calendar-year earnings might not take the plunge, regardless of how much it could enhance growth and earnings down the line. So how’d we get so taken with calendars? We bred it into ourselves centuries ago. It all ties back to our agricultural roots, where the calendar really does matter. Weather patterns are seasonal, harvest time comes every year, and in the nineteenth century, one year’s results mattered. Whether we’re talking farming, ranching or logging and milling, harvest time is harvest time. It comes once a year. Go back to the dawn of markets, and most American employment was in agriculture. Manufacturing was tiny, and service was scant. You had merchants and banks, but not the huge service industries of today. Agriculture dominated and so did its mindset—so we applied calendars to everything with rigor. Survival depended on it. It evolved into our core. Those who didn’t failed to pass their genes on. Breaking free of Wall Street’s love of calendars helps you think differently. Calendar-year returns aren’t important. Whether a bull market lasts two years or 10 years, that’s important! Returns in each of those calendar years, not so much. The overall return, net of all the corrections and pullbacks, is what gets you to your goals. If you measured market returns in rolling 14-month periods instead of rolling 12-month segments, it would be just as valid.

- As a result, everything the pros agree on is priced. Their expectations for how events and developments will impact stocks? Priced! Perceived risks discussed in reports and articles? Priced! Market reality is exceedingly unlikely to occur as they expect. Even if certain events follow their predictions to a T, the market reaction probably won’t. Contrarians get this.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It might. But probably not! Wouldn’t be nearly fun enough! Here’s the secret: The actual number isn’t so important. Markets look more at the general bucket. A 6% forecast is really just a prediction for returns somewhere in the low to mid-single digits. The difference between a 6% and 8% forecast largely is without meaning.

If you ever have the chance to observe this training, you’d see the cubs out front and the mom following at a distance, watching them work.

In investing, that means we want every stock we own to be up. When we fire up our account online, we want an entire column of green arrows and unrealized gains—no red, no losses.
