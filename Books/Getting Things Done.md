## Highlights
- Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=148))
- The hurrier I go, the behinder I get. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=204))
- Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=255))
- Anything that causes you to overreact or ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=280))
- underreact can control you, and often does. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=280))
- Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop” pulling on your ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=305))
- attention. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=305))
- The ancestor of every action is a thought. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=345))
- You can fool everyone else, but you can’t fool your own mind. It knows whether or not you’ve come to the conclusions you need to, and whether you’ve put the resulting outcomes and action reminders in a place that can be trusted to resurface appropriately within your conscious mind. If you haven’t done those things, it won’t quit working overtime. Even if you’ve already decided on the next step you’ll take to resolve a problem, your mind can’t let go until and unless you write yourself a reminder in a place it knows you will, without fail, look. It will keep pressuring you about that untaken next step, usually when you can’t do anything about it, which will just add to your stress. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=359))
- Rule your mind or it will rule you. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=377))
- Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=436))
- There is usually an inverse proportion between how much something is on your mind and how much ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=461))
- it’s getting done. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=462))
- There is no reason ever to have the same thought twice, ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=468))
- unless you like having that thought. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=469))
- The big problem is that your mind keeps reminding you of things when you can’t do anything about them. It has no sense of past or future. That means that as soon as you tell yourself that you need to do ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=484))
- something, and store it in your RAM, there’s a part of you that thinks you should be doing that something all the time. Everything you’ve told yourself you ought to do, it thinks you should be doing right now. Frankly, as soon as you have two things to do stored in your RAM, you’ve generated ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=485))
- personal failure, because you can’t do them both at the same time. This produces an all-pervasive stress factor whose source can’t be pin-pointed. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=487))
- As you proceed in your career, for instance, you’ll probably notice that your best ideas about ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=598))
- work will not come to you at work. The ability to leverage that thinking with good collection devices that are always at hand is key to increased productivity. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=598))
- Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It Once you’ve decided on the next ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=659))
- action, you have three options: 1. | Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it is defined. 2. | Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=660))
- yourself, Am I the right person to do this? If the answer is no, delegate it to the appropriate entity. 3. | Defer it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the right person to do it, ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=662))
- you will have to defer acting on it until later and track it on one or more “Next Actions” lists. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=664))
- Your mind goes through five steps to accomplish virtually any task: 1. | Defining purpose and principles 2. | Outcome ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=990))
- visioning 3. | Brainstorming 4. | Organizing 5. | Identifying next actions ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=992))
- If you’re waiting to have a good idea before you have any ideas, you won’t have many ideas. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1053))
- And if you’re not totally clear about the purpose of what you’re doing, you have no chance of winning. Purpose defines success. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1119))
- Often the only way to make a hard decision is ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1130))
- to come back to the purpose. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1130))
- It Motivates Let’s face it: if there’s no good reason to be doing something, it’s not worth doing. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1136))
- If you’re not sure why you’re doing something, you can never do enough of it. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1147))
- When you focus on something—the ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1183))
- vacation you’re going to take, the meeting you’re about to go into, the product you want to launch—that focus instantly creates ideas and thought patterns you wouldn’t have had otherwise. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1184))
- Just like a computer, your brain has a search function—but it’s even more phenomenal than a computer’s. It seems to be programmed by ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1194))
- what we focus on and, more primarily, what we identify with. It’s the seat of what many people have referred to as the paradigms we maintain. We notice only what matches our internal belief systems and identified contexts. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1195))
- Suffice it to say that something automatic and extraordinary happens in your mind when you create and ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1200))
- focus on a clear picture of what you want. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1200))
- you won’t see how to do it until you ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1203))
- see yourself doing it. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1203))
- You often need to make it up in your mind before you can make it happen in your life. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1208))
- Once you know what you want to have happen, and why, the “how” mechanism is brought into play. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1230))
- The basics principles, however, can be summed up as follows: • Don’t judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize. • Go for quantity, not quality. • Put analysis and organization in the background. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1270))
- A good way to find out what something might be is to uncover all the things it’s probably not. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1280))
- If the outcome/ vision is unclear, you must return to a clean analysis of why you’re engaged in the situation in the first place (purpose). ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1365))
- You need no new ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1387))
- skills to increase your productivity—just a new set of behaviors about when and where to apply them. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1388))
- You increase your productivity and creativity exponentially when you think about the right things at the right time and have the tools to capture your value-added ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1429))
- thinking. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1430))
- Keep in mind, you can feel good about what you’re not doing, only when you know what you’re not doing. ([Location 1726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=1726))
- If the next action can be done in two minutes or less, do it when you first pick the item up. ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2166))
- The two-minute rule is magic. ([Location 2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2184))
- You’ll be surprised how many two-minute actions you can perform even on your ([Location 2193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2193))
- most critical projects. ([Location 2194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2194))
- Too many sophisticated professionals are seriously hamstrung because they still hunt and peck and try to use their mouse too much. More work could be dispatched faster by combining the two-minute rule with ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2203))
- improved computer skills. I’ve found that many executives aren’t resisting technology, they’re just resisting their keyboards! ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2204))
- If the next action is going to take longer than two minutes, ask ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2206))
- yourself, “Am I the best person to be doing it?” If not, hand it off to the appropriate party, in a systematic format. ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2206))
- As you develop your own customized system, what you eventually hand off and then track could look like a list in a planner, a file folder holding separate papers for each item, and/or a list categorized as “Waiting For” in your software. For now, if you don’t have a trusted system ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2226))
- set up already, just put a note on a piece of paper—“W/F: reply from Bob”—and put that into a “Pending” stack of notes in a separate pile or tray that may result from your processing. ([Location 2228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2228))
- It’s important that you record the date on everything you hand off to others. This, of all the categories in your personal system, is the most crucial one to keep tabs on. The few ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2233))
- times you will actually want to refer to that information (“But I called and ordered that on March 12”) will make it worth establishing this as a lifelong habit. ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2235))
- Airtight organization is required for your focus to remain on the broader horizon. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2269))
- There are seven primary types of things that you’ll want to keep track of and manage from an organizational ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2280))
- perspective: • A “Projects” list • Project support material • Calendared actions and information • “Next Actions” lists • A “Waiting For” list • Reference ([Location 2281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2281))
- material • A “Someday/Maybe” list ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2285))
- The categories must be kept visually, physically, and ([Location 2289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2289))
- psychologically separate. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2290))
- The calendar should show only the “hard landscape” around which you do the rest of your actions. ([Location 2329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2329))
- It requires much less energy to maintain e-mail at a zero base than at a thousand base. ([Location 2509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2509))
- “Out of sight, out of mind” is not really out of mind. ([Location 2516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2516))
- It’s OK to decide not to decide—as long as you have a decide-not-to-decide system. ([Location 2809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2809))
- One elegant way to ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2817))
- manage nonactionable items that may need an action in the future is the “tickler” file.12 A three-dimensional version of a calendar, it allows you to hold physical reminders of things that you want to see or remember—not now, but in the future. It can be an extremely functional tool, ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2817))
- allowing you to in effect set up your own post office and “mail” things to yourself for receipt on a designated future date. I myself have used a tickler file for years and can’t imagine being without it. ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2819))
- Setting Up a Tickler File ([Location 2835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2835))
- Checklists can be highly useful to ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2900))
- let you know what you don’t need to be concerned about. ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2900))
- THE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow management ([Location 2923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2923))
- is not to let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to move toward more elegant and productive activity. In order to earn that freedom, however, your brain must engage on some consistent basis with all your commitments and activities. You must be assured that you’re ([Location 2923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2923))
- doing what you need to be doing, and that it’s OK to be not doing what you’re not doing. Reviewing your system on a regular basis and keeping it current and functional are prerequisites for that kind of control. ([Location 2925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2925))
- There are two major issues that need to be handled at this point: • What do you look at in all this, and when? • What do you need to do, and how often, to ensure that all of it works as a consistent ([Location 2932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2932))
- system, freeing you to think and manage at a higher level? ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2934))
- Your personal system and behaviors need to be established in such a way that you can see all the action options you need to see, when you need to see them. This is really just common sense, but few people actually have their processes and their organization honed to the point where they ([Location 2938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2938))
- are as functional as they could be. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2940))
- A few seconds a day is usually all you need for review, as long as you’re looking at the right things at the right time. ([Location 2946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2946))
- People often ask me, “How much time do you spend looking at your system?” My answer is simply, “As much time as I need to to feel comfortable about what I’m doing.” ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2947))
- The Power of the Weekly Review ([Location 2979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2979))

- through the five phases of workflow management—collecting, processing, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding involvements—until you can honestly say, “I absolutely know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to.” ([Location 2992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2992))
- From a nitty-gritty, practical standpoint, here is the drill that can get you there:   Loose Papers Pull out all miscellaneous scraps of paper, business cards, receipts, and so on that have crept into the crevices of your desk, clothing, and ([Location 2994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2994))
- accessories. Put it all into your in-basket for processing.   Process Your Notes Review any journal entries, meeting notes, or miscellaneous notes scribbled on notebook paper. List action items, projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and someday/ maybes, as ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2996))
- appropriate. File any reference notes and materials. Stage your “Read/Review” material. Be ruthless with yourself, processing all notes and thoughts relative to interactions, projects, new initiatives, and input that have come your way since your last download, and ([Location 2998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=2998))
- purging those not needed.   Previous Calendar Data Review past calendar dates in detail for remaining action items, reference information, and so on, and transfer that data into the active system. Be able to archive your last week’s calendar with ([Location 3000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3000))
- nothing left uncaptured.   Upcoming Calendar Look at future calendar events (long- and short-term). Capture actions about arrangements and preparations for any upcoming events.   Empty Your Head Put in ([Location 3002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3002))
- writing (in appropriate categories) any new projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/maybes, and so forth that you haven’t yet captured.   Review “Projects” (and Larger Outcome) Lists Evaluate the status of projects, goals, and outcomes one by one, ([Location 3004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3004))
- ensuring that at least one current kick-start action for each is in your system.   Review “Next Actions” Lists Mark off completed actions. Review for reminders of further action steps to capture. ([Location 3007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3007))
- Review “Waiting For” List Record appropriate actions for any needed follow-up. Check off received items.   Review Any Relevant Checklists Is there anything you haven’t done that you need to do? ([Location 3009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3009))

([Location 3013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3013))
- This review process is common sense, but few of us do it as well as we could, and that means as regularly as we should to keep a clear mind and a sense of relaxed control. ([Location 3016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3016))
- Your best thoughts about work won’t happen while you’re at work. ([Location 3049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3049))
- Ultimately and always you must trust your ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3078))
- intuition. There are many things you can do, however, that can increase that trust. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3079))
- As I explained earlier, during the course of the workday, at any point in time, you’ll be engaged in one of three types of activities: • Doing predefined work • Doing work as it shows up • Defining your work You may be doing things on your action lists, doing things as... they come up, or processing incoming inputs to determine what work that needs to be done, either then or later, from your lists. This is common sense. But many people let themselves get wrapped around the second activity—dealing with things that show up ad hoc—much... too easily, and let the other two slide, to their detriment. ([Location 3153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WH7PKY&location=3153))

- not doing the work you have defined on your lists can be tolerated only if you know what you’re not doing.
