- Good question. Basically, I had no real grasp of trading principles; I was doing everything wrong. Then in October 1971, while at my broker’s office, I met one of the people to whom I attribute my success. Who was that?

- I think the secret is cutting down the number of trades you make. The best trades are the ones in which you have all three things going for you: fundamentals, technicals, and market tone. First, the fundamentals should suggest that there is an imbalance of supply and demand, which could result in a major move. Second, the chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the fundamentals suggest. Third, when news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the right psychological tone. For example, a bull market should shrug off bearish news and respond vigorously to bullish news. If you can restrict your activity to only those types of trades, you have to make money, in any market, under any circumstances.

- There will always be trades that meet those requirements, but there may be fewer of them, so you have to be much more patient. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1143))

- Yes, much more. Are trend-following systems then doomed to mediocrity? I believe so. I believe that the era of trend following is over until and unless there is a particular imbalance in a market that overrides everything else. [The 1988 drought in the grain belt, which developed shortly after this interview, provides a perfect example of the type of exception Marcus is describing.] Another exception would be if we were to enter a major inflationary or deflationary environment. In other words, unless there is some very powerful force that can overwhelm everything else. Yes. Have the markets changed during the past five to ten years because professional money managers now account for a much greater proportion of speculative trading activity, as opposed to the small speculators who tend to make all the mistakes? The markets have changed. The proof is that Richard Dennis, who has done well for many years, lost over ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1174))

- 50 percent on the funds he was managing in 1988. The trend-following systems approach doesn’t work anymore. The problem is that once you have defined a trend and taken a position, everyone else has taken a position as well. Since there is no one left to buy, the market swings around in the other direction and gets you out. One reason we don’t have many good trends anymore is that the central banks are preventing currency moves from getting out of hand by taking the other side of the trend.

- That is right. For example, I remember one time, during late 1978, the dollar was getting battered, falling to new lows every day. This was during a period when I was cooperating and trading as a colleague with Bruce Kovner. We used to talk hours every day. One day, we noticed that the dollar got mysteriously strong. There was an intense price movement that couldn’t be explained by any known information. We just bailed out of our long currency positions like crazy. That weekend, President Carter announced a dollar support program. If we had waited until the next U.S. trading session, we would have been annihilated.

- That situation illustrates one of the principles we believed in—namely, that the big players, including the governments, would always tip their hand. If we saw a surprise price move against us that we didn’t understand, we often got out and looked for the reason later. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1219))

- I remember that market well. The currency futures markets were locked limit-down for several days in a row after that announcement. You must have gotten out right near the top of that market. We made a great exit on that trade. Anyway, my point is that I believe, as a courtesy, the European central banks are notified about major changes we are going to make, and they often act ahead of U.S. policy announcements. Consequently, the price move shows up in Europe first, even if it is because of something we initiate. If it’s an action initiated by the Europeans, the price move is certainly going to occur there first. I think the best hours to trade are often in Europe. If I had a period in which I was going to devote my life to trading, I would want to live in Europe. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1223))

- you had to make 30 percent a year to keep your account level. You must have had some incredible return years, given the growth of your account—particularly under that handicap. I was making at least 100 percent a year for years and years. What was your best year? My best year must have been 1979. It was an incredible year. I caught gold when it went up to over $800.

- All in all, you got out very well. What tipped you off that we were near a top? At that time, we had many wild markets. One of my rules was to get out when the volatility and the momentum became absolutely insane. One way I had of measuring that was with limit days. In those days, we used to have a lot of situations when a market would go limit-up for a number of consecutive days. On the third straight limit-up day, I would begin to be very, very cautious. I would almost always get out on the fourth limit-up day. And, if I had somehow survived with any part of my position that long, I had a mandatory rule to get out on the fifth limit-up day. I just forced myself out of the market on that kind of volatility. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1282))

- Why do you think you did so poorly on your investments? I would do everything emotionally. I didn’t analyze anything. In a sense, you were repeating the mistake of your early trading experience: getting involved in something you knew nothing about and then losing money. Didn’t any bells go off? It almost sounds like you had a self-destructive instinct in losing your money elsewhere. Yes, absolutely. I probably lost more than half the money I made. During this period when you were doing all these unwise things, didn’t anybody try to grab you by the shoulders and say, “Do you realize what you’re doing?” Yes, but any time someone on my staff did, I would fire them. At one time, I was employing sixty or seventy people. In addition to all my money-losing businesses, I had a huge nut to make to just support the ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1337))

- payroll. Frankly, a lot of the money I made just went down the drain. Did these losses have any of the emotional impact of losses in the market? The reason I ask is that you seem to talk about these investment losses very dispassionately. Yes, it hurt to realize what a fool I had been, but I have learned not to be as attached to material things. I accepted it as a life lesson. I learned I don’t have to own a house in every beautiful place in the world; I can stay at a hotel and walk on the beach or climb a trail there. Or, if I really feel like spoiling myself, I can charter a plane; I don’t have to own one. Right, that certainly makes sense, but what I am getting at is that I suspect that if you had lost the same amount of money trading, it would have been a much more traumatic experience. Is that because your ego wasn’t attached to these other ventures? Yes, I’m sure that’s true. I always felt that, at least, I was smart at one thing. I feel like trading is the only thing I am really good at. If not for that, I probably would have wound up shining shoes.

- Having been through the whole trading experience from failure to extreme success, what basic advice could you give a beginning trader or a losing trader? The first thing I would say is always bet less than 5 percent of your money on any one idea. That way you can be wrong more than twenty times; it will take you a long time to lose your money. I would emphasize that the 5 percent applies to one idea. If you take a long position in two different related grain markets, that is still one idea. The next thing I would advise is to always use stops. I mean actually put them in, because that commits you to get out at a certain point. Do you always pick a point where you will get out before you get in? Yes, I have always done that. You have to. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1365))
- When you place an order to get into a position, is it accompanied by an order to get out? That’s right. Another thing is that if a position doesn’t feel right as soon as you put it on, don’t be embarrassed to change your mind and get right out. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1378))

- What other advice would you give the novice trader? Perhaps the most important rule is to hold on to your winners and cut your losers. Both are equally important. If you don’t stay with your winners, you are not going to be able to pay for the losers. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1390))

- assume that we are talking about very talented traders, and it still doesn’t make a difference. If it is not your own idea, it messes up your trading? Right. You need to be aware that the world is very sophisticated and always ask yourself: “How many people are left to act on this particular idea?” You have to consider whether the market has already discounted your idea. How can you possibly evaluate that? By using the classic momentum-type indicators and observing market tone. How many days has the market been down or up in a ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1408))

- row? What is the reading on the sentiment indexes? Can you think of any good examples of market tone tipping you off on a trade? The most classic illustration I can think of is one of the soybean bull markets in the late 1970s. At the time, soybeans were in extreme shortage. One of the things pushing the market up was the weekly government reports indicating strong export commitments and sales. I was holding a heavy long position in soybeans and someone from Commodities Corporation called me with the latest export figures. He said, “I have good news and I have bad news.” I said, “OK, what is the good news?” “The good news is that the export commitment figure was fantastic. The bad news is that you don’t have a limit position [the maximum permissible speculative position size].” They were expecting the market to be limit-up for the next three days. Actually, I wound up being a little depressed that I didn’t have a larger position. The next morning, I entered an order to buy some more contracts on the opening, just in case I got lucky and the market ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1415))

- traded before locking limit-up. I sat back to watch the fun. The market opened limit-up as expected. Shortly after the opening, I noticed a lot of ticks being recorded, as if the market was trading at the limit-up. Then prices eased off limit-up just as my broker called to report my fills. The market started trading down. I said to myself, “Soybeans were supposed to be limit-up for three days, and they can’t even hold limit-up the first morning.” I immediately called my broker and frantically told him to sell, sell, sell! Did you get out of your whole position? Not only that, but I was so excited that I lost count of how much I was selling. I accidentally wound up being short a substantial amount of soybeans, which I bought back 40 to 50 cents lower. That was the only time I made a lot of money on an error.

- Is the implied rule that if you find a common behavior between markets, you want to sell the one that is lagging as soon as it starts heading down? You absolutely want to put down a bet when a market acts terribly relative to everything else. When the news is wonderful and a market can’t go up, then you want to be sure to be short. What kinds of misconceptions about the markets get people into trouble? ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1444))

- trading. Have you, in turn, taught other traders? Yes. My best result, in terms of his becoming the best trader I ever worked with, as well as being a close friend, is Bruce Kovner. How much of his success do you attribute to your training, and how much of it was just his own talent? When I first met Bruce, he was a writer and a professor; in his spare time, he was doing some trading. I was staggered by the breadth of trading knowledge he had accumulated in such a short time. I remember the first day I met Bruce I tried to impress him with complicated concepts. Here I was, a professional trader who, in those days, spent fifteen hours a day trading and analyzing the markets, and I couldn’t come up with anything that he couldn’t understand. I recognized his talent immediately. That relates to his intellect, but was there something about him that told you that he was going to be a good trader? Yes, his objectivity.

What I tried to do was convey to Bruce the principles that Ed and Amos had taught me, along with some of my acquired skills. My best trading occurred when Bruce and I were collaborating; we did some phenomenal trading. There were years when I was up 300 percent and he was up 1,000 percent. He had a very great gift.

- You are one of the most successful traders in the world. There are only a small number of traders of your caliber. What makes you different from the average guy? I’m not sure one can really define why some traders make it, while others do not. For myself, I can think of two important elements. First, I have the ability to imagine configurations of the world different from today and really believe it can happen. I can imagine that soybean prices can double or that the dollar can fall to 100 yen. Second, I stay rational and disciplined under pressure.

- So where was he going wrong? Position size. He traded much too big. For every one contract I traded, he traded ten. He would double his money on two different occasions each year, but still end up flat. Do you always use fundamental analysis in forming your trading decisions? I almost always trade on a market view; I don’t trade simply on technical information. I use technical analysis a great deal and it is terrific, but I can’t hold a position unless I understand why the market should move. Is that to say that virtually every position you take has a fundamental reason behind it? I think that is a fair statement. But I would add that technical analysis can often clarify the fundamental picture. I will give you an example. During the past six months, I had good arguments for the Canadian dollar going down, and good arguments for the Canadian dollar going up. It was unclear to me which interpretation was correct. If you had put a gun to my head and forced me to choose a market direction, I probably would have said “down.” ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1805))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is the generalization of that example that when an important fundamental development occurs, the initial direction of the market move is often a good tip-off of the longer-term trend? Exactly. The market usually leads because there are people who know more than you do. For example, the Soviet Union is a very good trader. Good trader in which markets? In currencies, and grains to some degree. How does one know what the Soviets are doing? Because the Soviets act through commercial banks and dealers, and you hear about it.

- It seems rather contradictory to me that a country that is so poor in running its own economy should be a good trader. Yes, but if you ask people in the business, you will find out that they are. Why, or how? It is a joke, but perhaps they do read some of our mail. The Soviets (and other governments) occasionally have advance information. Why shouldn’t they? They have the best developed intelligence service in the world. It is a well known fact in the intelligence community that the Soviets (and others) are capable of eavesdropping on commercial communication. That is why the large commodity trading firms sometimes use scramblers when they are making very sensitive calls. My point is that there are thousands of difficult-to-understand mechanisms that lead the market, which come into play before the news reaches some poor trader sitting at his desk. But the one thing that does hit the market is a huge sale or purchase. Isn’t that the basic rationalization for technical analysis?

- Technical analysis, I think, has a great deal that is right and a great deal that is mumbo jumbo. That’s an interesting statement. What’s right and what’s black magic? There is a great deal of hype attached to technical analysis by some technicians who claim that it predicts the future. Technical analysis tracks the past; it does not predict the future. You have to use your own intelligence to draw conclusions about what the past activity of some traders may say about the future activity of other traders. For me, technical analysis is like a thermometer. Fundamentalists who say they are not going to pay any attention to the charts are like a doctor who says he’s not going to take a patient’s temperature. But, of course, that would be sheer folly. If you are a responsible participant in the market, you always want to know where the market is—whether it is hot and excitable, or cold and stagnant. You want to know everything you can about the market to give you an edge. Technical analysis reflects the vote of the entire marketplace and, therefore, does pick up unusual ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=1856))

- behavior. By definition, anything that creates a new chart pattern is something unusual. It is very important for me to study the details of price action to see if I can observe something about how everybody is voting. Studying the charts is absolutely crucial and alerts me to existing disequilibria and potential changes. Do you sometimes put on a trade because you look at a chart and say, “I’ve seen this pattern before, and it is often a forerunner of a market advance.” That is, even though you may not have any fundamental reasons? Yes, I will do that sometimes. I would only add that, as a trader who has seen a great deal and been in a lot of markets, there is nothing disconcerting to me about a price move out of a trading range that nobody understands. Does that imply you usually go with breakouts? Sure. But the markets are often prone to false breakouts. There has to be more to it than that.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Tight congestions in which a breakout occurs for reasons that nobody understands are usually good risk/reward trades. How about breakouts that occur because there is a story in the Wall Street Journal that day? That would be much less relevant. The Heisenberg principle in physics provides an analogy for the markets. If something is closely observed, the odds are it is going to be altered in the process. If corn is in a tight consolidation and then breaks out the day the Wall Street Journal carries a story about a potential shortage of corn, the odds of the price move being sustained are much smaller. If everybody believes there is no reason for corn to break out, and it suddenly does, the chances that there is an important underlying cause are much greater. It sounds like you are saying that the less explanation there is for a price move occurring, the better it looks. Well, I do think that. The more a price pattern is observed by speculators, the more prone you are to have false signals. The more a market is the product of nonspeculative activity, the greater the significance of technical breakouts.

- What eventually tells you that you are wrong on a major position trade? Your stop point will limit your initial loss, but if you still believe in the fundamental analysis underlying the trade, I assume that you will try it again. If you are wrong about the general direction of the market, won’t you take a series of losses? At what point do you throw in the towel on the trade idea? First of all, a loss of money itself slows me down, so I reduce my positions. Secondly, in the situation you described, the change in the technical picture will give me second thoughts. For example, if I am bearish on the dollar and a major intermediate high has been penetrated, I would have to reevaluate my view.

- Was it a matter of becoming complacent about markets always being in an uptrend? No, the problem was that the principal characteristic of a bear market is very sharp down movements followed by quick retracements. I would always sell too late and then get stopped out in what subsequently proved to be part of a wide-swinging congestion pattern. In a bear market, you have to use sharp countertrend rallies to enter positions. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2014))

- I assume that the price for a market on any given day is the correct price, then I try to figure out what changes are occurring that will alter that price. One of the jobs of a good trader is to imagine alternative scenarios. I try to form many different mental pictures of what the world should be like and wait for one of them to be confirmed. You keep trying them on one at a time. Inevitably, most of these pictures will turn out to be wrong—that is, only a few elements of the picture may prove correct. But then, all of a sudden, you will find that in one picture, nine out of ten elements click. That scenario then becomes your image of the world reality. Let me give you an example. The Friday after the October 19 stock market crash, I had trouble sleeping, which is very unusual for me. But I am sure I wasn’t the only trader to lie awake that night. All week long, I struggled with how the events of that week were going to impact the dollar. I was trying on different visions of the world. One of these pictures was total panic—the world coming to an end, financially. In this scenario, the dollar becomes the safest political haven, and as a result, there could be a tremendous rise in the dollar. In fact, on Tuesday of that week, the dollar did rise dramatically as many people withdrew their money from other places. During the next three days, there was tremendous confusion. By the end of the week, the dollar had started to give ground again. It was then that it all coalesced in my mind. It became absolutely clear to me that given the combination of a need for stimulative action, dictated by the tremendous worldwide financial panic, the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and German Bundesbank to adopt potentially inflationary measures, and the continuing wide U.S. trade deficits, the only solution was for Treasury Secretary Baker to let the dollar go. Someone had to play the stimulative role, and that someone would be the United States. As a result, the dollar would drop and it would not be in the interest of the other central banks to defend it. I was absolutely convinced that was the only thing that Baker could do. You realized all this late Friday. Was it too late to take action in the markets? Yes, and it was a very tense weekend because I realized that the dollar might open sharply lower. I waited for the Far East markets to open Sunday night.

- I try not to be too much of a wise guy because during major price moves, they will be right for a portion of it. What I am really looking for is a consensus that the market is not confirming. I like to know that there are a lot of people who are going to be wrong. So if you see that most of the members on your guru list are bullish at a time when the market is not moving up, and you have some fundamental reason to be bearish, you will feel stronger about the trade? Yes, much stronger. Do you think people can trade profitably by just following the gurus? Probably, but my impression is that to make money, you have to hold a position with conviction. That is very difficult when you are following someone else. There are some good gurus, however. For example, in the stock market, I like Marty Zweig. He uses excellent risk control. Unlike some other gurus, he doesn’t believe he is predicting the future; he is simply observing what is happening and making rational bets.

- You talk about both the importance of risk control and the necessity of having the conviction to hold a position. How much risk do you typically take on a trade? First of all, I try very hard not to risk more than 1 percent of my portfolio on any single trade. Second, I study the correlation of my trades to reduce my exposure. We do a daily computer analysis to see how correlated our positions are. Through bitter experience, I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large. Does that mean if you are bullish in both the Deutsche mark and Swiss franc, then you decide which one you like better and place your entire long position in that currency? Yes, that is definitely true. But even more important is the idea of trading a long in one market against a short in a related market. For example, right now, although I am net short the dollar, I am long the yen and short the Deutsche mark. In all my trading, if I am long something, I like to be short something else.

- Do the cross rates like the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen move slower than the individual currencies themselves? Not necessarily. For example, recently the sterling/mark cross rate was in a yearlong congestion between approximately 2.96 and 3.00. It finally broke out about a month ago. The day it broke out, it challenged the top of the range about twenty times. The Bank of England kept on defending it. Finally the Bank of England gave in. As soon as the cross rate pierced the 3.01 level, there were no trades. In fact, there were no trades until it hit 3.0350. So it moved virtually a full 1 percent without trading. Is that unusual for the interbank market? Very unusual. It meant everybody was watching the 3.00 level. Once everyone realized the Bank of England was not… ([Location 2175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2175))

- Terrible fills. The worse the fills are, the better your trade. In that case, after trading for a couple of hours between 3.04 and 3.02, the rate went straight up to 3.11. Do you believe that the cross rates provide better trading opportunities in currencies than net short or long positions against the dollar? Yes, because there are a lot fewer people paying attention to the cross rates. The general rule is: The less observed, the better the trade. Your trading style involves a synthesis of fundamental and technical analysis. But if I were to say to you, Bruce, we are going to put you in a room and you can have either all the fundamental information you want, or all the charts and technical input you want, but only one, which would you choose? That is like asking a doctor whether he would prefer treating a patient with diagnostics or with a chart monitoring his condition. You need both. But, if anything, the fundamentals are more important now. In the 1970s, it was a lot easier to make money using technical analysis alone. There were far fewer false breakouts. Nowadays, everybody is a chartist, and there are a huge number of technical trading systems. I think that change has made it much harder for the technical trader. Do you think that the trend-following system approach will eventually self-destruct under the weight of its own size and the fact that most of these systems are using similar approaches? I think that is true. The only thing that will save those technical systems is a period of high inflation, when simple trend-following methodologies will work again. However, there is no question in my mind that if we have stable, moderate rates of inflation, the technical trading systems… ([Location 2189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2189))

Undertrade, undertrade, undertrade is my second piece of advice. Whatever you think your position ought to be, cut it at least in half.

My own personal experience underscores that there is probably no class of trades with a higher failure rate than impulsive (not to be confused with intuitive) trades. Regardless of the approach used, once a strategy is selected, the trader should stick to his or her game plan and avoid impulsive trading decisions (for example, putting on an unplanned trade because a friend has just recommended it; liquidating a position before the predetermined stop point is reached because of an adverse price movement).

- I have a partner who has been a friend since high school. We have had philosophical disagreements about everything you could imagine. One of these arguments was whether the skills of a successful trader could be reduced to a set of rules—that was my point of view—or whether there was something ineffable, mystical, subjective, or intuitive that made someone a good trader. This argument had been going on for a long time, and I guess I was getting a little frustrated with idle speculation. Finally, I said, “Here is a way we can definitely resolve this argument. Let’s hire and train some people and see what happens.” He agreed. It was an intellectual experiment. We trained them as well as we could. That was the way to do the experiment right, I thought. I tried to codify all the things I knew about the markets. We taught them a little bit about probability, money management, and trading. It turned out I was right. I don’t say that to pat myself on the back, but even I am surprised how well it worked. It’s frightening how well it worked. Is your basic contention that you can take almost any reasonably intelligent individual and turn him into a successful trader?

- No. We screened for people we thought would be right. We received 1,000 applications and narrowed it down to forty people whom we interviewed. Then we picked ten. What qualities were you looking for? I don’t like to discuss that because if I told you one of the things we looked for was chess players, and we ever do it again, we would be inundated by résumés from chess players. Was intelligence one of the key items? It was one of the traits, but it wasn’t the essential item. To find the things that we were looking for, we could choose from intelligent or extremely intelligent people. We picked the ones with extreme intelligence just because they were available. Didn’t you have any reluctance about giving away trade secrets? Sure, but I don’t think trading strategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about them, as most traders believe. If what you are doing is right, it will work even if people have a general idea about it. I always say that you could publish trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are 80 percent as good as what we taught our people. What they couldn’t do is give them the confidence to stick to those rules even when things are going bad. How long was the training process? Shockingly short. In the first year, it took two weeks.

When I decided to do the trader-trainee program, I had just returned from a trip to the Far East. In telling someone about the program I said, “We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles in Singapore.” I had visited a farm there and seen a huge vat with thousands of squirming turtles; that became my image of growing traders.

- In the long run, zero. Absolutely zero. I don’t think anybody winds up making money in this business because they started out lucky. But on individual trades, obviously, it makes a difference? That is where the confusion lies. On any individual trade it is almost all luck. It is just a matter of statistics. If you take something that has a 53 percent chance of working each time, over the long run there is a 100 percent chance of it working. If I review the results of two different traders, looking at anything less than one year doesn’t make any sense. It might be a couple of years before you can determine if one is better than the other. ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2545))

- You are one of the few people who is both a discretionary trader and a systems trader. How would you compare the two approaches? Professional traders may do some very intelligent things, but they have a tendency not to think systematically about what they are doing. For example, most traders who do a trade that works will not think: Why did it work? What did I do here that I might be able to do in another market, at another time? There is not a lot of reflection on the process of trading. In contrast, I think I always have been analytical about trading, even before I ever researched a mechanical system. On the opposite extreme, you have the academic types who research before they have ever traded. They lack the seat-of-the-pants knowledge necessary to develop good trading systems. Mercifully, I did the trading first. Therefore, the research we do is more applicable to the real world. Can you give me an example of how the lack of real world experience would hurt the researcher? As an example, assume I develop a mechanical system that often signals placement of stops at points where I know there will tend to be a lot of stops. In the real world, it is not too wise to have your stop where everyone else has their stop. Also, that system is going to have above-average skids. If you don’t understand that and adjust the results accordingly, you are going to get a system that looks great on paper, but is going to do consistently poorer in the real world. You mentioned that before you developed a mechanical trading system, you paid close attention to the trading process. Did you keep a log of what you did right and wrong, or was it a matter of memory? Yes, I would write down observations and think about them. I thought about everything I was doing. ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2552))

- So, by definition, they will never be in the right direction at market turns. Yet you, as an experienced trader, may sense when a market may be prone for a turn. In a situation like that, would you be willing to buy because of what you see as a trader even though your system is short? I would probably want to be flat, since I tend to weigh the psychological, opinion-oriented segment of trading about equal with the technical and trend-following element. So you want to see the market display some signs of turning around before you’ll commit? What is more likely is that I will be positioned in the right direction of a trend and decide to liquidate faster than a trend-following system would because of the intuitive factor. What about entering a new trade counter to a prevailing trend? I’ve certainly done it—that is, made countertrend initiations. However, as a rule of thumb, I don’t think you should do it. Do those type of trades do more poorly than other trades? Generally, yes, although every now and then they may give you a great story like going short sugar at 60 cents, which I did. [Sugar plummeted from a high of 66 cents in November 1974 to a relative low under 12 cents only seven months later. Each 1-cent move in sugar is worth $ 1,120 per contract. A large trader like Dennis will often trade positions measured in thousands of contracts.] I’ve got ten stories like that. But I have to tell you in all honesty, I don’t think the broad class of trades I have done like that have been profitable. The short sugar trade is a great example because the market had witnessed an incredibly explosive upmove and it took a lot of courage to step in as a seller at 60 cents. But take the flip side when sugar is in a real bear market and is down to 5 cents; every trend-following system in the world is going to be short. Yet, if conditions are such that the fundamentals are in transition and the market price is only a little over the cost of the bag it’s packed in, would you make an exception? Actually, I’ve lost more money in situations like that because all the market has to do is go down one more cent and you are out of there. I made a lot of money going short sugar at 60 cents, but I lost much more going long sugar at 6 cents. When you do a trade like that, that is, buying a market because the downside is so-called “limited,” do you just ride it out, or do you eventually throw in the towel? You throw it in. Because how do you know? Maybe it is going to 2 cents; maybe it is going to 1 cent. ([Location 2588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2588))

- So don’t be too tied to history? Right. And yet, all your rules are based on history. Is there a contradiction there? No, because a good trend-following system will keep you in the market until there is evidence that the trend has changed. If you had been doing your historical research on soybeans in 1972, you would have concluded that any time soybeans advance by 50 cents, you might as well get out, because the market had never moved up or down by significantly more than that. Obviously, that was the wrong conclusion because it went up another $8. A good trend-following system, however, would have kept you in for most of the move. So you don’t want to draw boundaries from history over market behavior? Right. The correct approach is to say: This structure means up, and this structure means up no more, but never that this structure means up this much and no more.

- Why would you say that is true? Well, my research on individual stocks shows that price fluctuations are closer to random than they are in commodities. Demonstrably, commodities are trending and, arguably, stocks are random. Do you have an explanation for that phenomenon? I believe that there is not enough fundamental information per stock to create sufficient trends to move them from their random character. There aren’t as many commodities as there are stocks. In other words, there is not the same flow of information as in the commodity markets? There is not enough information, not enough fundamentals. Just nothing going on. In the commodity markets, technical information is basically confined to price, volume, and open interest. Since there is so much more technical information available for stock indexes—advance/decline ratios, various sentiment indicators, relationships between different groups of stocks, etc.—do ordinary trend-following systems start off at a big disadvantage because they don’t use enough information? I’m not sure that is the disadvantage. I think the disadvantage is that stock index prices are too close to random to develop enough clear-cut trends because the inputs—the individual stocks—are mostly random.

Of course, it’s bad for those people who pretend they are value investors, but are really traders. How do you handle a losing streak? Cut back. If it is really bad, stop and get out. Do you sometimes need to get away from the markets for a few days? Generally, it just takes a day or two, but you do need to stop for a period of time. It is almost like a pitcher not balking. Before he throws the ball, he has to stop at least for that second. That is what I try to do—at least have a pause. It could be for just one day.

- Why do you handle other people’s money? You are doing very well on your own. Well, there is one big advantage: managed money offers potential return with no risk. For ten years, people have been asking me if I’m getting tired of all the risk. Do I think I’m going to burn out? Do I think I’m going to stop? For the longest time I didn’t understand what they were talking about. But I have to admit, at this point, I understand the value of cutting down your own risk. I could have traded smaller and had a smaller profit and smaller risk. But if customer money comes in, I could use that to supplement the profitability and still keep my risk lower. It just gives you a better deal. In a later interview, Dennis changed his mind on this subject, possibly influenced by the aggravation related to large losses in his public funds. Dennis decided to extricate himself gradually from the money management business, saying: “I found that it was more trouble than it was worth. The costs were not financial; they were psychological.” The material that follows is from that second interview.

- Even if you think the dollar is going to collapse, that doesn’t affect your basic trading pattern? I would like to say it doesn’t, and I don’t think it should, but it probably has in the past. The worst thing you can do is miss a profit opportunity (assuming you are already disciplined enough to cut your losses short). And if you think about it, rigid long-term views are the kind of thing most likely to lead you to that mistake. For example, if I believe the dollar is going to weaken, and because of this I ignore a sell signal in the foreign currencies, I might risk missing a large profit. What is my reward if my view was right? Avoiding a small loss. Therefore, the risk/reward is all wrong for my type of trading. Acknowledging that caveat, as a long-time market observer, what major trends do you see shaping up over the coming years? I bet we will be at record levels of inflation by the end of 1990. [This interview was conducted in mid-1988.] What is going to be the driving force behind that inflation? It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a deep recession. The recession is going to be caused by the federal budget deficit as investors require higher and higher levels of real interest rates to buy the debt. The government will try to avoid the recession by stimulating the economy, a tactic which essentially doesn’t work. In other words, fear of a recession will cause tremendous monetary easing, which in turn will lead to inflation? It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whether you like it or not, the financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and business will not buy monetary easing as a solution to a recession. Are you implying that the deficit problem is just a time bomb, which will eventually shatter the economy? Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a problem now, that means it won’t be. We expect continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more discontinuous than continuous. And you are saying that people look at the deficit year after year and think, “Well, it can’t be so bad, the economy is strong,” and one day everybody wakes up— It is like having termites in the foundation of your house. You may not notice them until one day they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapses. I don’t think anybody should take a large amount of comfort in the fact that things appear to be holding together. Hypothetically, if you were President and could influence change, would the deficit be the first thing you would change?

- Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrats, since they were the first ones to pick up the banner of Keynesianism [the advocacy of government programs to increase employment], to admit that while it may be a great theory, it doesn’t work in the real world. I don’t think Keynes ever proposed using deficit spending in strong economic times. No, that’s true. He proposed surpluses that were supposed to be countercyclical to deficits. Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have only one side of that equation because of the lack of political will to create the surpluses when times are good. So what we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money, overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just admit that the government is a debt junkie and the whole concept of deficit spending is flawed in practice. You mean Keynesianism as it is being applied, not Keynesian economics as he himself purported it? The theory is fine, it just doesn’t work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn’t use it. Besides, Keynesian economics was a solution to the problem of oversaving and underconsumption, which was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem now is the exact opposite: undersaving and overconsumption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you still need a different solution because you have the exact opposite problem. Is there an economic theory that you feel fits the times and makes sense? We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the federal government should have to balance its budget just as the states do. At that point, Milton Friedman’s proposal for a constant money supply adjusted by a growth factor would probably be a good idea. What is the most important advice you could give the novice trader? Trade small because that’s when you are as bad as you are ever going to be. Learn from your mistakes. Don’t be misled by the day-to-day fluctuations in your equity. Focus on whether what you are doing is right, not on the random nature of any single trade’s outcome. ([Location 2888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=2888))

My major problem was not the number of points I lost on the trade, but that I was trading far too many contracts relative to the equity in the accounts that I handled. My accounts lost something like 60 to 70 percent of their equity in that single trade. ([Location 3097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3097))

- One aspect of your trading style is a contrarian attempt to buy and sell turning points. Let’s say you are looking for a top and go short with a close stop when the market reaches a new high. You then get stopped out. On a single trade idea, how many times will you try to pick a turning point before you give up? Until I change my mind, fundamentally. Otherwise, I will keep cutting my position size down as I have losing trades. When I am trading poorly, I keep reducing my position size. That way, I will be trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst. ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3141))

- Don’t ever average losers. Decrease your trading volume when you are trading poorly; increase your volume when you are trading well. Never trade in situations where you don’t have control. For example, I don’t risk significant amounts of money in front of key reports, since that is gambling, not trading. If you have a losing position that is making you uncomfortable, the solution is very simple: Get out, because you can always get back in. There is nothing better than a fresh start. Don’t be too concerned about where you got into a position. The only relevant question is whether you are bullish or bearish on the position that day. Always think of your entry point as last night’s close. I can always tell a rookie trader because he will ask me, “Are you short or long?” Whether I am long or short should have no bearing on his market opinion. Next he will ask (assuming I have told him I am long), “Where are you long from?” Who cares where I am long from? That has no relevance to whether the market environment is bullish or bearish right now, or to the risk/reward balance of a long position at that moment.

- The most important rule of trading is to play great defense, not great offense. Every day I assume every position I have is wrong. I know where my stop risk points are going to be. I do that so I can define my maximum possible drawdown. Hopefully, I spend the rest of the day enjoying positions that are going in my direction. If they are going against me, then I have a game plan for getting out. Don’t be a hero. Don’t have an ego. Always question yourself and your ability. Don’t ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead. ([Location 3157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3157))

- In other words, it makes a better story to say, “Paul Jones buys the T-bond market 2 ticks from the low,” rather than, “On his fifth try, Paul Jones buys the T-bond market 2 ticks from its low.” I think that is certainly part of it. The other part is that I have always been a swing trader, meaning that I believe the very best money is to be made at the market turns. Everyone says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve years, I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have caught a lot of bottoms and tops. If you are a trend follower trying to catch the profits in the middle of a move, you have to use very wide stops. I’m not comfortable doing that. Also, markets trend only about 15 percent of the time; the rest of the time they move sideways. ([Location 3182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3182))

- How do you keep all these other opinions from confusing your own vision? Let’s say you are bearish on a market and 75 percent of the people you talk to about that market are bullish. What do you do? I wait. I will give you a perfect example. Until last Wednesday, I had been bearish on crude oil, while it was in the midst of a $2 advance. The best crude oil trader I know was bullish during that period. Because he was bullish, I never went short. Then the market started to stall and one day he said, “I think I am going to go flat here.” I knew that instant—particularly, given the fact that bullish news was coming out of OPEC right at that time—that crude oil was a low-risk short. I sold the hell out of it, and it turned out to be a great trade. Are there any market advisors that you pay attention to? Marty Zweig and Ned Davis are great; Bob Prechter is the champion. Prechter is the best because he is the ultimate market opportunist. What do you mean by opportunist? ([Location 3207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3207))

I went into the money management business because if I lost money, I wanted to be able to say that I had not gotten compensated for it.

- You did extraordinarily well during October 1987, a month which was a disaster for many other traders. Could you fill in some of the details? The week of the crash was one of the most exciting periods of my life. We had been expecting a major stock market collapse since mid-1986 and had contingency plans drawn up because of the possibility we foresaw for a financial meltdown. When we came in on Monday, October 19, we knew that the market was going to crash that day. What made you so sure? Because the previous Friday was a record volume day on the downside. The exact same thing happened in 1929, two days before the crash. Our analog model to 1929 had the collapse perfectly nailed. [Paul Jones’ analog model, developed by his research director, Peter Borish, superimposed the 1980s market over the 1920s market. The two markets demonstrated a remarkable degree of correlation. This model was a key tool in Jones’ stock index trading during 1987.] ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=3261))

When I trade, I don’t just use a price stop, I also use a time stop. If I think a market should break, and it doesn’t, I will often get out even if I am not losing any money.

- I turned really bullish in May 1984, when they auctioned off five-year notes at a 13.93 yield. I had been involved in banking since 1974, and at the time, we couldn’t find any qualified borrowers for three-year loans at 13 percent. Yet here were government five-year notes selling at nearly a full percentage point above that level. Moreover, this was at a time when we were at the height of a recession in Peoria: Unemployment was approaching 20 percent and the farm crisis was worsening. I felt that interest rates had probably gone high enough. From that point on through April 1986, I traded T-bonds heavily from the long side. There is no question that that was my best trade and longest trend ever. What are the elements of good trading?

Also, it helps greatly to have a long-term objective that you have derived by really doing your homework. You combine that long-term objective with a protective stop that you move as the position goes your way. Alternatively, you could use a trend-following system to signal when you should get out of the trade.

He tells me, “We only buy blue chips for our clients.” Not having a financial background, I was unfamiliar with the term “blue chip,” but it sounded odd to me in the context of a staid investment firm. So after the interview, I looked up its derivation. I found that ([Location 4149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4149))

- the origin of the term could be traced to the color of the most expensive chip in Monte Carlo. I said to myself, “Aha, now I know what this game is all about—gambling.” I threw away my copy of Graham and Dodd [Principles of Security Analysis, considered by many to be the “bible” of stock market analysis] and bought a book called Beat the Dealer. I came away with the idea that successful investment was really a matter of odds, and if you could compute the odds, you could find and test methods that could beat the market. What made you believe that you could develop methods to put the odds in your favor? I don’t know that I understood it all then, but over the years I came to realize that the markets are inefficient. I have a friend who is an economist. He would try to explain to me, as if talking to a child, why what I was trying to do was futile, because “the markets are efficient.” I have noticed that everyone who has ever told me that the markets are efficient is poor. He argued that if I could develop a winning system on a computer, so could others, and we would all cancel each other out. What is wrong with that argument?

- Because people develop systems and people will make mistakes. Some will alter their system or jump from system to system as each one has a losing period. Others will be unable to resist second-guessing the trading signals. Whenever I go to a money management conference and sit down with a group to have some drinks at night, I always hear the same story. “My system worked great, but I just didn’t take the gold trade, and that would have been my biggest winner.” There is a very important message here: People don’t change. That is why this whole game works. In 1637, tulips in Holland traded for 5,500 florins and then crashed to 50, a 99 percent loss. Well, you might say, “Trading was relatively new then; these people were primitive; capitalism was still in its infancy. Today we are much more sophisticated.” So you go to 1929 and find a stock like Air Reduction which traded at a high of $233 and after the crash fell to $31, a decline of 87 percent. OK, you might say, “The Roaring ’20s were crazy… ([Location 4166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4166))

- to do is look at silver prices, which in 1980 reached a peak of $50 and subsequently fell to $5, a 90 percent decline. The point is that because people are the same, if you use sufficiently rigorous methods to avoid hindsight, you can test a system and see how it would have done in the past and get a fairly good idea of how that system will perform in the future. That is our edge. Isn’t it possible that the markets can change and the future will be very different from the past? The markets may change, but people won’t. When we were still in the testing stage, before we actually started managing any money, my partner Michael Delman came up with the concept of using holding periods as a measure of system performance. Evaluating systems solely on a calendar year basis is very arbitrary. What you really want to know are the odds for profitable performance in a holding period of any length.

There is a fellow who works for us who used to be a colonel in the British army. His service specialty was dismantling bombs all over the world. I asked him, “How did you do it?” “It wasn’t that difficult,” he says. “There are different styles of bombs; a bomb in Malaysia is different from a bomb in the Middle East. You go there and see what kind of bomb it is and take it apart.” I said, “Let me ask you a question. What happens when you come across a bomb that you don’t know?” He looks me in the eye and says, “You record your first impression and hope it is not your last.” I came into the office one day and found this same steel-nerved individual virtually on the brink of tears. I asked him what was wrong. It turned out that the Fed had made a major policy change, which dramatically… ([Location 4186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4186))

When I called prospects and they complained about their broker, I would say, “Oh, how could he put you in that trade?” So I get the account on the phone and explain that our simulations show that this type of event will occur once every few years and that I am confident that in nine months the fund will be back to a new high. “In fact,” I said, “I have just borrowed some money to add to my own investment in the fund.” “You really did that?” he asked in a surprised tone.

Take one sixty-year-old guy and you have absolutely no idea what the odds are that he will be alive one year later. However, if you take 100,000 sixty-year-olds, you can get an excellent estimate of how many of them will be alive one year later. We do the same thing; we let the law of large numbers work for us. In a sense, we are trading actuaries. I have a friend who went broke trading futures. He can’t understand how I can trade by following a computerized system religiously. We were playing tennis one day and he asked me, “Larry, how can you trade the way you do; isn’t it boring?” I told him, “I don’t trade for excitement; I trade to win.” It may be very dull, but it is also very lucrative.

- Mint different? How have you been able to achieve return/risk ratios far above the industry average? Because we know that we don’t know. No matter what information you have, no matter what you are doing, you can be wrong. I have a friend who has amassed a fortune in excess of $100 million. He taught me two basic lessons. First, if you never bet your lifestyle, from a trading standpoint, nothing bad will ever happen to you. Second, if you know what the worst possible outcome is, it gives you tremendous freedom. The truth is that, while you can’t quantify reward, you can quantify risk. I will give you an example how important this advice is. One of the world’s largest coffee traders invited me to his house in London. When I walked into his library, I noticed he had just about every book ever written on power. He took me to one of the finest restaurants I have ever been at. At dinner, he asked me, “Larry, how can you know more about coffee than me? I am the largest trader in the world. I know where the… ([Location 4217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4217))

- Five times he asked me what I did, and five times I told him that I managed the risk. Three months later I heard that he had blown $100 million in the coffee market. He obviously didn’t get the message. And you want to know something? He does know more about coffee than I do. But the point is, he didn’t look at the risk. So the very first rule we live by at Mint is: Never risk more than 1 percent of total equity on any trade. By only risking 1 percent, I am indifferent to any individual trade. Keeping your risk small and constant is absolutely critical. For example, one manager I know had a large account that withdrew half the money he was trading. Instead of cutting his position size in half, this manager kept trading the same number of contracts. Eventually, that half of the original money became 10 percent of the money. Risk is a no-fooling-around game; it does not allow for mistakes. If you do not manage the… ([Location 4229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4229))

- trades are all the same. That is the reason why we have never had a bad trade at Mint. There are really four kinds of trades or bets: good bets, bad bets, winning bets, and losing bets. Most people think that a losing trade was a bad bet. That is absolutely wrong. You can lose money even on a good bet. If the odds on a bet are 50/50 and the payoff is $2 versus a $1 risk, that is a good bet even if you lose. The important point is that if you do enough of those trades or bets, eventually you have to come out ahead. The third thing we do to reduce risk is diversify. We diversify in two ways. First, we probably trade more markets worldwide than any other money manager. Second, we don’t just use a single best system. To provide balance, we use lots of different systems ranging from short term to long term. Some of these systems may not be that good by themselves, but we really don’t care; that is not what they are there for. The fourth thing Mint does to manage risk is track… ([Location 4238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4238))

- the light is green, we take all signals. When the light is yellow, we will liquidate an existing position on a signal, but we will not put on a new position. Finally, when the light is red, we liquidate existing positions automatically, and we do not take any new positions. For example, in 1986, when coffee went from $1.30 to $2.80 and back to $1.00, we got out of our long positions on the way up at $1.70 and didn’t trade the market for the rest of the price climb and subsequent collapse. Now, while we may have lost some additional profits, being out of markets like that is one of the ways we are able to achieve such rigid risk control. So one of the key differences between you and other trend-following managers is that you have developed a way of defining when not to play? In any situation or game, you can define a positional advantage for any player—even the weakest one. In trading, you can define three categories of players: the trade, the… ([Location 4249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4249))

They were worth billions.” Let’s say you have a billion dollars, and you buy $20 billion worth of silver—I am making these numbers up for the sake of the example—you are in exactly the same risk position as the guy with $1,000 who owns $20,000 worth of silver. I have a good friend who started from very humble beginnings; his father was a sanitation man. Anyway, he is a very bright guy and he got into option arbitrage. He was extremely good at it and made a fortune. I remember visiting him at a palatial estate he bought in England. Well, he may have been a great arbitrageur, but he turned out to be a bad trader. He developed a trading system that made money. One day he said to me, “I am not taking the sell signal in gold; it doesn’t look right to me. Besides, almost 50 percent of the signals are wrong anyway.” Not only didn’t he take the sell signal, he actually wound up going long. Sure enough, the market went down. I told him, “Get out!” but he insisted, “The market will come back.” ([Location 4299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4299))

To this day, I still remember the name of his estate: “Beverly.” He is still one of my best friends, and his loss of that huge house had an enormous emotional impact on me. He had it and lost it all! And all because of one trade. The irony is that if he had followed his system, he would have made a fortune on that trade. I will tell you another story. I have a cousin who turned $5,000 into $100,000 in the option market. One day I asked him, “How did you do it?” He answered, “It is very easy. I buy an option and if it goes up, I stay in, but if it goes down, I don’t get out until I am at least even.” I told him, “Look, I trade for a living, and I can tell you that strategy is just not going to work in the long run.” He said, “Larry, don’t worry, it doesn’t have to work in the long run, just till I make a million.

How could you have a deficit of $10,000?” He said, “I originally bought the options at $4½ . When the price went down to $1, I figured out that if I bought another 20,000, all it had to do was go back to $2¾ for me to break even. So I went to the bank and borrowed $10,000.” Respect for risk is not just a matter of trading; it applies to any type of business decision. I once worked for a firm where the company president, a very nice guy, hired an option trader who was brilliant, but not stable. One day the option trader disappeared, leaving the firm stuck with a losing position. The president was not a trader, and he sought my advice. “Larry, what do you think I should do?” I told him, “Just get out of the position.” Instead, he decided to hold on to the trade.

Less than one year later, this same man had to liquidate a huge delta neutral spread position in options [a balanced position whose value will change very little for small price moves in either direction]. Instead of just getting out, he decided to get out of the position one leg at a time. By the time he finished liquidating that position, he had gone through all of the firm’s capital. Besides errors in risk control, why do people lose money trading? Sometimes, because their trades are based on a personal bias, instead of a statistical approach.

He practically shouted back at me, “You mean to tell me that you don’t see any difference between gold and cocoa?” I think if it wasn’t for the fact that he liked Mickey so much, he would have thrown me out of his office.

The second item is something that Ed Seykota taught me. When a market makes a historic high, it is telling you something.

Second, Mint trades in an extraordinarily wide spectrum of markets (nearly sixty in all), encompassing exchanges in the U.S. and five foreign countries and diverse market groups including stock indexes, interest rates, currencies, raw industrial goods, and agricultural commodities. Volatility is continually tracked in each market in order to generate signals to liquidate or temporarily suspend trading in those markets where the risk/reward ratio exceeds well-defined limits.

- What are the major elements of your trading philosophy? The word “trading” is not the way I think of things. I may be a trader in the sense that my frequency of transactions is relatively high, but the word “investing” would apply just as much, if not more. In my mind, trading implies an anticipation of a sale at the time of purchase. For example, if I go long stock index futures tonight because I expect tomorrow’s trade number will be bullish for the market, and I plan to sell my position tomorrow—that is trading. The bulk of what I do is for a much longer duration and for more complex reasons. For example, when I went long the debt markets in 1981, I held that position for two and a half years.

- I make two key distinctions. First, a trader will go short as readily as long. In contrast, the investor—for example, the portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund—will always be long. If he is uncertain about the market, he may be only 70 percent invested, but he is always long. The second distinction I make is that a trader is primarily concerned about the direction of the market. Is the market, or stock, going up or down? The investor is more concerned about picking the best stocks to invest in. There is no value judgment involved in my distinction between traders and investors, it is merely a matter of maintaining a certain thematic focus for this book. In any case, on both counts, I would certainly qualify you as a trader. To get back to my original question: How would you define your philosophy of trading? My particular style is a bit different from that of most people. Concept number one is variant perception. I try to develop perceptions that I believe are at variance with the general market view. I will play those variant perceptions until I feel they are no longer so. ([Location 4468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4468))

- If you are very negative and short in a particular stock, but are not necessarily bearish on the industry, might you sometimes hedge yourself by buying another stock in that group against your short position? I have tried that at times, but have generally found it to be unsuccessful. What it tends to do is give me two problems instead of one. Usually, your knowledge about the second stock on the other side will tend to be relatively skimpy because you are just grasping at it to use as a hedge. If your problem is so great that you need to hedge it, why not address the problem directly rather than taking on a totally separate position? Let’s say you are short a paper stock and the paper stocks are roaring, so you buy another paper stock against it. Maybe your short stock will go up more; maybe the other stock will go up more.

My reasoning was that if the plaintiffs won the case, the stocks would go down a lot, but if the plaintiffs lost, the stocks wouldn’t go up too much, since the tobacco companies had never lost a case and winning another one wouldn’t really be news. That is an example of a variant perception. It will be interesting to see how much I will lose, because my original theory was that it wouldn’t be much.

How would you know when your analysis is wrong because you have overlooked some unknown important element? That situation happens fairly often. You buy or sell a stock and it doesn’t act the way you think it should. I go through my portfolio six times a day. There are many stocks in the portfolio that I am not directly responsible for. For example, someone else is short Time, Inc. They are short because the magazine business is lousy, and this or that. But the stock is acting really strong and is up 10 percent from where we shorted it.

If there is a problem with a position I will go through it very regularly. That makes me a very difficult person here, because I only talk to people when things are lousy or when their stocks are not acting like they should. If a stock is not acting like it should based on its fundamentals, would that be the type of market action that would change your thinking? I try to assume that the guy on the other side of a trade knows at least as much as I do. Let’s say I buy Texaco at $52 and it suddenly goes down to $50. Whoever sold Texaco at $52 had a perception that was dramatically different from mine. It is incumbent on me to find out what his perception was. What if you can’t explain it? The explanation might be superficial or serious, but you can usually get something. Let’s take the situation of the tobacco companies. On balance, the news that came out after the close sounded bearish. If the tobacco stocks go down only modestly tomorrow and then come right back, would you cover your position? I would cover it anyway. I would cover the position on the news. So once the news is out, the game is over for you. Right. That was the only reason I was short. OK, that answers the question too simply. Assume you wanted to be short the tobacco stocks as a longer-term position and the market shrugged off today’s news and closed higher tomorrow.

So, if one balanced long positions in stocks that were perceived to be relatively strong with short positions in stocks expected to act poorly, the market risk would be totally eliminated. For example, if you loved Ford and hated General Motors, and for every dollar long Ford you were short a dollar of General Motors, you might lose on your shorts, but if your judgment was good, you would come out ahead. So, the original concept of a hedge fund totally emphasized the ability to pick stocks. Does anyone still trade that way? No, today, the term hedge fund is somewhat of a misnomer. The term now refers to a limited partnership in which the general partner is typically paid on a performance basis, as opposed to more traditional money managers who are paid on assets managed.

- As I look back on the past twenty-one years, there is no set pattern of successful activity. In some years, we did particularly well on the strength of a few well-chosen stocks. In other years, we did exceptionally well because we were on the right side of the market. For example, in 1973–1974, when the market went down enormously, we were up substantially, largely because we were net short. There were other periods when the bulk of our money was made in bonds. I think there is a message in the fact that there is no real pattern: Anyone who thinks he can formulate success in this racket is deluding himself, because it changes too quickly. As soon as a formula is right for any length of time, its own success carries the weight of its inevitable failure.

- Not as strongly. But in 1981 and 1982, I made an enormous amount of money by having a leveraged position in treasury notes. Although one couldn’t predict the end of the rise of interest rates timing-wise, it was clear that unless interest rates came down, other areas had to be relatively unattractive. When you could get 14 percent in long-term treasury securities, in order to be competitive, stocks had to sell so much lower than they were selling at that it wasn’t even worth focusing on which stocks to buy—although you might focus on the short side. What was unique in that period was the inevitability of a turn in interest rates in order for anything else to be worthwhile; it was simply a matter of timing that turn. In contrast to most other periods, this period had a clear unidirectional message: U.S. Treasury fixed income securities were by far the quintessential value of the time.

- Anyone with any sense of contrarian mentality had to look at interest rates in the early 1980s as presenting a potentially great opportunity. You knew the Fed would have to ease as soon as business started to run into trouble. In addition, we had already seen an important topping in the rate of inflation. So, some of the pieces of the puzzle were already in place? Yes, and that is as much as you can hope for, because when they are all in place, it is too late. You mention a contrarian mentality, but that type of thinking could have justified trying to pick a top at much lower rates. Absolutely. People think that being a contrarian implies victory. After all, what is a contrarian but someone who goes against the crowd. It is almost a cliché that the crowd is always wrong—so the guy who stands against the crowd must always be right. Well, life doesn’t work that way. There were plenty of contrarians who bought bonds when interest rates went to 8 percent for the first time, and 9 percent, and 10 percent. There was a great deal of money lost by people buying bonds at what were then all-time high yields. There is a very important difference between being a theoretical contrarian and dealing with it in practical terms. In order to win as a contrarian, you need the right timing and you have to put on a position in the appropriate size. If you do it too small, it’s not meaningful; if you do it too big, you can get wiped out if your timing is slightly off. The process requires courage, commitment, and an understanding of your own psychology. ([Location 4695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4695))

- One of your basic principles seems to be that as long as you believe you are fundamentally right, you will stay with a position. Have there been any exceptions—that is, markets in which you didn’t change your fundamental view, but the loss just got too big? There have been some situations when I was short and simply didn’t have enough courage to hang in with the full-boat of the position. That was particularly true in 1972, at the height of the “Nifty-Fifty” phenomenon. With the exception of October 1987, that was probably the worst period in my investment life. At the time, there was a theory that as long as a company continued to sustain substantially above-average secular growth, it didn’t matter how much you paid for it. Many growth stocks traded at multiples that were just crazy. We went short Polaroid when it was selling at sixty times earnings, which we thought was absurd; it then went to seventy times earnings. The market seemed to lose track of reality, and we found ourselves asking, “What is the difference between forty times earnings and eighty times earnings?” By putting a different number on the secular growth rate estimate, you could justify almost any multiple. That is how people were thinking in those days. So you backed off during that period? At times we did, because we were losing a lot of money. Did that prove to be the right move, because stocks eventually went to much higher multiples, or would you have been better off if you had held on? In hindsight, in almost all cases, I would have been better off sticking it out. ([Location 4738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4738))

The market has become institutionalized. Individuals buy stock through mutual funds. Brokerage firms don’t sell customers stocks so much as they sell those horrible mutual funds and other awful things they call “financial products.” Perhaps the most important change is that the world has become much more short term oriented.

- One of the allures of this business is that sometimes the greatest ignoramus can do very well. That is unfortunate because it creates the impression that you don’t necessarily need any professionalism to do well, and that is a great trap. So the major advice I would give anybody is: Recognize that this is a very competitive business, and that when you decide to buy or sell a stock, you are competing with people who have devoted a good portion of their lives to this same endeavor. In many instances, these professionals are on the opposite side of your trades and, on balance, they are going to beat you. Is the implicit message that, most of the time, the novice trader would be better off having his money professionally managed?

- The term professionally managed implies a credit I am not sure I would give the average professional in this business. My point is that you should have a good reason to assume that you are going to achieve a significantly superior return for investing in stocks. If you can get 9 percent or 10 percent by investing in T-bonds and 7 percent or 8 percent by investing in T-bills, what should you get in stocks to offset the incremental risk? Probably something much higher. You have to decide what that number should be, and whether you have a realistic chance of achieving it. Don’t underestimate the difficulty of the game. Right, and forget the shibboleth that stocks are going to give you a higher rate of return because they are more risky. That is not true. They are more risky; therefore, you have to be convinced that you are going to get a higher rate of return in order to play the game. Don’t assume that by investing in some mutual fund, you are going to get a higher rate of return. Isn’t that true, though? Historically, hasn’t the stock market significantly beat interest rate returns? True, but there is a lot of statistical mumbo jumbo involved. Average return calculations depend heavily on the starting date. If you start in 1968 or 1972, for example, the numbers look a lot less appealing. What are the elements of good trading? Good trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow your ideas and the flexibility to recognize when you have made a mistake. You need to believe in something, but at the same time, you are going to be wrong a considerable number of times. The balance between confidence and humility is best learned through extensive experience and mistakes. There should be a respect for the person on the other side of the trade. Always ask yourself: Why does he want to sell? What does he know that I don’t? Finally, you have to be intellectually honest with yourself and others. In my judgment, all great traders are seekers of truth. ([Location 4887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4887))

- I use the easy-to-remember acronym CANSLIM. Each letter of this name represents one of the seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages, just before they made huge advances. The “C” stands for current earnings per share. The best performing stocks showed a 70 percent average increase in earnings for the current quarter over the same quarter in the prior year before they began their major advance. I am continually amazed by how many individual investors, and even pension fund managers, buy common stocks with unchanged or lower current quarter earnings. There is absolutely no reason for a stock to go up if the current earnings are poor. If, as our research demonstrated, the best stocks had large profit increases before they advanced rapidly in price, why should anybody settle for mediocre earnings? So, our first basic rule in stock selection is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year. The “A” in our formula stands for annual earnings per share. In our studies, the prior five-year average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early ([Location 4987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=4987))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- emerging stage was 24 percent. Ideally, each year’s earnings per share should show an increase over the prior year’s earnings. It is a unique combination of both strong current earnings and high average earnings growth that creates a superb stock. The EPS rank, which is published in Investor’s Daily, combines a stock’s percent earnings increase during the past two quarters with the past five-year average percent earnings and compares that figure to every other stock we cover. An EPS rank of 95 means that a company’s current and five-year historical earnings have outperformed 95 percent of all other companies. The “N” in our formula stands for something new. The “new” can be a new product or service, a change in the industry, or new management. In our research we found that 95 percent of the greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories. The “new” also refers to a new high price for the stock. In our seminars we find that 98 percent of investors are unwilling to buy a stock at a new high. Yet, it is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower.

- The “S” in the formula stands for shares outstanding. Ninety-five percent of the stocks that performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance. The average capitalization of all of these stocks was 11.8 million shares, while the median figure was only 4.6 million. Many institutional investors handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies. By doing so, they automatically eliminate some of the best growth companies. The “L” in our formula stands for leader or laggard. The 500 best-performing stocks during the 1953–1985 period had an average relative strength of 87 before their major price increase actually began. [The relative strength measures a stock’s price performance during the past twelve months compared to all other stocks. For example, a relative strength of 80 would mean that the given stock outperformed 80 percent of all other stocks during the past year.] So, another basic rule in stock selection is to pick the leading stocks—the ones with the high relative strength values—and avoid the laggard stocks. I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks above 80. The “I” in the formula stands for institutional sponsorship. The institutional buyers are by far the largest source of demand for stocks. Leading stocks usually have institutional backing. However, although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general. This is why the most widely owned institutional stocks can be poor performers. By the time a company’s performance is so obvious that almost all institutions own a stock, it is probably too late to buy. The “M” in our formula stands for market.

- Another way to determine the direction of the general market is to focus on how the leading stocks are performing. If the stocks that have been leading the bull market start breaking down, that is a major sign the market has topped. Another important factor to watch is the Federal Reserve discount rate. Usually, after the Fed raises the rate two or three times, the market runs into trouble. ([Location 5055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5055))
- Does the element of unlimited risk present any special problem in short selling? No, because I never take unlimited risk. If a short position goes against me, I will be out after the first 6 or 7 percent loss. Before you sell any stock short, you should decide the price at which you will cover that short position if a loss occurs. Besides the CANSLIM formula, which is critical to your stock selection process, risk control obviously plays an important role in your overall strategy. Can you talk a little bit more about that element of trading? My philosophy is that all stocks are bad. There are no good stocks unless they go up in price. If they go down instead, you have to cut your losses fast. The secret for winning in the stock market does not include being right all the time. In fact, you should be able to win even if you are right only half the time. The key is to lose the least amount of money possible when you are wrong. I make it a rule never to lose more than a maximum of 7 percent on any stock I buy. If a stock drops 7 percent below my purchase price, I will automatically sell it at the market—no second-guessing, no hesitation.

- OK, you use your CANSLIM methodology for selecting stocks, and your 7 percent rule for getting out if you are wrong. How do you decide when to liquidate a winning stock position? First, you should hold a stock as long as it is performing properly. Jesse Livermore said, “It is never your thinking that makes big money, it’s the sitting.” Second, you have to realize that you will never sell the exact top. Therefore, it is ridiculous to kick yourself when a stock goes higher after you sell. The goal is to make substantial profits on your stocks and not be upset if the price continues to advance after you get out.

- Your writings express disdain for a number of factors that many people consider important, including P/E ratios, dividends, diversification, and overbought/oversold indicators. Could you explain what you think is wrong with the conventional wisdom regarding these subjects. Let’s start with P/E ratios. To say that a stock is undervalued because it is selling at a low P/E ratio is nonsense. In our research, we found there was a very low correlation between the P/E ratio and the best-performing stocks. Some of these stocks had P/E ratios of 10 when they started their major advance; others had P/E ratios of 50. During the thirty-three years in our survey period [1953–1985], the average P/E ratio for the best-performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 20, compared to an average P/E ratio of 15 for the Dow Jones Average during the same time. At the end of their expansion phase, these stocks had an average P/E ratio of approximately 45. This means that if, in the ([Location 5110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5110))

- past, you were not willing to buy stocks with above-average P/Es, you automatically eliminated most of the best-performing securities. A common mistake a lot of investors make is to buy a stock solely because the P/E ratio looks cheap. There is usually a very good reason why a P/E ratio is low. Many years ago, when I was first beginning to study the market, I bought Northrop at four times earnings and watched in disbelief as the stock eventually declined to two times earnings. Another common mistake is selling stocks with high P/E ratios. I still remember in 1962 when an investor barged into my friend’s brokerage office, declaring in a loud voice that Xerox was drastically overpriced because it was selling at fifty times earnings. He went short at $88. Xerox eventually went to $1,300, adjusting for stock splits. Your thoughts on dividends? There is no correlation between dividends and a stock’s performance. In fact, the more a company pays in dividends, the weaker their posture, because they may have to pay high interest rates to replace funds paid out in dividends. It is naive to hold stocks that are going down because they pay dividends. If ([Location 5117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5117))

For an investor with $5,000, one or two; $10,000, three or four; $25,000, four or five; $50,000, five or six; and $100,000 or more, six or seven. Aside from the subjects we have just discussed, is there anything else you consider a major public misconception? Most investors think that charts are hocus-pocus. Only about 5 to 10 percent of investors understand charts. Even a lot of professionals are totally ignorant about charts.

High volume at a key point is an extraordinarily valuable tip-off that a stock is ready to move. Volume can also be used in a reverse manner.

During a consolidation, declining volume is generally constructive. How do you handle a losing streak?

- To continue the screening process, after checking the stock’s relative strength, the EPS, and the industry relative strength, what is your next step? I check the number of shares outstanding. I am looking for stocks with less than thirty million shares and preferably only five to ten million shares. Stocks with more than thirty million shares are more mature; they have already split a few times. It is a case of supply and demand: Because you have more supply, it takes a lot more money to move those stocks. What else do you look at? You want some institutional ownership, because they really power a stock higher, but you don’t want too much sponsorship. I would say 1 percent to 20 percent mutual fund sponsorship is the ideal range. Are there any other important elements that go into the stock selection process? Yes.

- I usually hold my big winners for about six to twelve months, stocks that aren’t that strong about three months, and my losers less than two weeks. Do you pick an objective on the stocks you buy? No. I usually wait until the stock runs up, builds another base, and then breaks down. That is when I liquidate. Do you think people should only use market orders? In a dull market that is just trading back and forth, you could put in a limit order. But if you really think the stock is going to make a big move—and that should be the only reason you are buying the stock to begin with—then there is no reason to haggle over an eighth of a point. Just buy the stock. The same thing applies to the downside; if you think the stock is going to drop, just sell it.

- One element of your trading style is buying a stock when it makes a new high. Wouldn’t the fundamental screening conditions you use have been in place well before that point? In some cases, they might have been. But I am trying to buy a stock when you have the most chance of making money. When a stock is coming off the low end of a base back to the high end, there will be a lot of people who bought it near the highs and sat with a loss for months. Some of those people are going to be happy to get out at even, and that creates a lot of overhead resistance. So, a stock which is at new highs has much more of an open running field? Right, because no one ahead of you is at a loss and wants to get out at the first opportunity. Everybody has a profit; everybody is happy. But the downside of that is if you wait for a breakout to new highs, a lot of… ([Location 5497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5497))

If the stock moves to new high ground, but the volume is only up 10 percent, I would be wary. Do you buy it the first day the stock breaks out to new highs, or do you wait for it to consolidate for a few days? I want to buy it as soon as it goes to new highs. If you buy a stock at new highs and it then pulls back into the range, at what point do you decide it was a false breakout? For example, assume a stock that has been trading between $16 and $20 goes to $21 and you buy it. What do you do if two days later the stock is back to $19? If it reenters its base, I have a… ([Location 5510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5510))

- No, if it just reenters the base. In some cases, it will break out and come back to the top of the base, but not reenter. That’s fine, and I will stay with the stock. But if the top of the base was $20 and it breaks back to $19¾, I want to sell at least half of the position because the stock didn’t keep on moving. Frequently, when a stock drops back into its base, it goes all the way back down to the lower end of the base. In the example, if it goes from $21 down to $19¾, it will often go all the way back down to $16. Therefore, you want to cut your losses quickly. From a technical perspective, is the price going back into the base a bearish indicator? Yes. Stocks should be at a profit the first day you buy them. In fact, having a profit on the first day is one of the best indicators that you are going to make money on the trade.

After I have done my weekly screen to select the stocks I am interested in buying, I sometimes wait for the stock to hit that column as a timing signal. Can you elaborate on using volume as a trading tool? When a stock that has been moving up starts consolidating, you want to see volume dry up. You should see a downtrend in volume. Then when volume starts picking up again, it usually means the stock is ready to blast off. So, in the consolidation phase, decreasing volume is good. If you continue to see very high volume, do you start thinking potential top? Yes, because that shows that a lot of people are getting out of the stock. You want an increase in volume when the stock breaks out, but you… ([Location 5539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5539))

- What was your experience during the week of the October 19 stock crash? I came in long. I have thought about it, and I would do the same thing again. Why? Because on October 16, the market fell 108 points, which, at the time, was the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the stock exchange. It looked climactic to me, and I thought that was a buying opportunity. The only problem was that it was a Friday. Usually a down Friday is followed by a down Monday. I don’t think Monday would have been nearly as bad as it was, if Treasury Secretary James Baker had not started verbally bludgeoning the Germans about interest rates over the weekend. He was so belligerent. Once I heard Baker, I knew I was dead. So, you knew that you were in trouble over the weekend? Yes. Also, Marty Zweig, who is a friend of mine, was on “Wall Street Week” on Friday evening, talking about a possible depression. I called Marty the next day, and he said he thought there was another 500 points risk in the market. Of course, he didn’t know it was going to happen in one day.

- One of the most suicidal things you can do in trading is to keep adding to a losing position. Had I done that, I could have lost $5 million that day. It was painful, and I was bleeding, but I honored my risk points and bit the bullet. That’s another example where my Marine training came into play. They teach you never to freeze when you are under attack. One of the tactics in the Marine Corps officer’s manual is either go forward or backward. Don’t just sit there if you are getting the hell beat out of you. Even retreating is offensive, because you are still doing something. It is the same thing in the market. The most important thing is to keep enough powder to make your comeback. I did real well after October 19. In fact, 1987 was my most profitable year. You liquidated your long position very well on October 19. Did you think about actually going short? I thought about it, but I said to myself, “Now is not the time to worry about making money; it is the time to worry about keeping what you have made.” Whenever there is a really rough period, I try to play defense, defense, defense. I believe in protecting what you have. The day of the crash, I got out of most of my positions and protected my family. Then at 1:30 P.M., with the Dow down 275 points, I went to my safe deposit box and took my gold out. Half an hour later, I went to another bank and started writing checks to get my cash out. I started buying Treasury bills and preparing for the worst. I had never seen anything like what was going on. You were seriously worried about the banks going under?

I think my fear of a depression is related to my father graduating college in 1929. If you talk to people who got out of college at that time, it is as though a ten-year period is missing from their lives. There was just nothing substantial going on in this country. That always stuck with me, because I feared it so much. I think that is one of the reasons why I don’t try to increase my earnings geometrically. On the day of the crash, when I looked at my son in his crib, I thought, I don’t want him ever to ask me, “Dad, why didn’t you do everything you could have done?” ([Location 5909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=5909))

Whenever you try to get all your losses back at once, you are most often doomed to fail. That is true in everything—investments, trading, gambling. I learned from the crap table at Las Vegas to keep only X dollars in my pocket and never to have any credit, because the worst thing you can do is to send good money after bad.

- From time to time, you have alluded to your trading rules. Can you list them? [Reading from a list and extemporizing] I always check my charts and the moving averages prior to taking a position. Is the price above or below the moving average? That works better than any tool I have. I try not to go against the moving averages; it is self-destructive. Has a stock held above its most recent low, when the market has penetrated its most recent low? If so, that stock is much healthier than the market. Those are the types of divergences I always look for. Before putting on a position always ask, “Do I really want to have this position?” After a successful period, take a day off as a reward. I’ve found it difficult to sustain excellent trading for more than two weeks at a time. I’ve had periods where I can be profitable for twelve days in a row, but eventually you just get battle fatigue. So, after a strong run of profits, I try to play smaller rather than larger. My biggest losses have always followed my largest profits. This next rule is a major problem for me; I’m always trying not to break it. The rule: Bottom fishing is one of the most expensive forms of gambling. It’s OK to break this rule on occasion if you have sufficient justification. For example, today, I bought the S&Ps when they were down sharply. Two weeks ago, I had written down the number 248.45 as the best entry for the S&P. The low today was 248.50. Consequently, I was able to buy into weakness today and make a good deal of money. I had a plan, I carried it out, and it worked. It doesn’t always work. It was risky, but I wasn’t pyramiding wildly into it, and I knew how much I was risking. That brings me to my next rule: Before taking a position, always know the amount you are willing to lose. Know your “uncle point” and honor it. I have a pain threshold, and if I reach that point, I must get out. When T-bonds and T-bills differ in respect to their individual relationship between price and the moving average—one above the moving average, the other below—have no position until one confirms the direction of the other. [Generally speaking, a price above its moving average implies a price uptrend, while the reverse case implies a price downtrend.] Then, the last words I have at the bottom of the page are: Work, work, and more work. Is there anything to add to that list? The most important thing is money management, money management, money management. Anybody who is successful will tell you the same thing. The one area that I am constantly trying to improve on is to let my gains run. I’m not able to do that ([Location 6027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=6027))

- well. I’m always working on it. To my dying day, I’ll probably still be working on it. Is that because you do something wrong? I just love to take profits. I hear music when the cash register rings. The irony is: How can I be willing to risk 400 points on the downside and only take 200 points of a 1,000-point move on the upside? On the risk side, you have a method, a plan. Have you experimented with trying to use similar discipline on the profit side? Yes, but I haven’t been able to perfect it. I have had varying degrees of success, but it is my greatest criticism of myself. Why the difficulty in this area? I think it all relates to my fears of some cataclysmic event. I’m like W. C. Fields: I have several bank accounts and a few safe deposit boxes with gold and cash. I’m extremely well diversified. My thought process is that if I screw up in one place, I’ll always have a life preserver someplace else. Any other rules you can think of?

- Yes. If you’re ever very nervous about a position overnight, and especially over a weekend, and you’re able to get out at a much better price than you thought possible when the market trades, you’re usually better off staying with the position. For example, the other day I was short the S&P and got nervous because the bond market was very strong on the night session. The next morning, the stock market was virtually unchanged. I was so relieved that I could get out without a loss, I covered my position. That was a mistake. A little later that day, the S&P collapsed. When your worst fears aren’t realized, you probably should increase your position. What has been your worst drawdown percentagewise? My records were just evaluated for a money management deal. Over my entire career as a full-time trader, based on month-end data, my biggest drawdown was 3 percent. I had my worst two months around the birth of my two children, because I was worried about whether I was going to get the tennis ball in the right place in Lamaze class. My philosophy has always been to try to be profitable every single month. I even try to be profitable every single day. And I’ve had some extraordinary runs—over 90 percent of my months have been profitable. I’m particularly proud of the fact that, in virtually every year, I didn’t have a losing month before April. I probably don’t make as much money as I could because of that, but I’m more concerned about controlling the downside. You start off every year with a clean slate? That’s my philosophy: January 1, I’m poor. Do you trade smaller in January? Not necessarily. It is just that my attention is greater.

- Risk control is an essential element of Schwartz’s trading style, as attested to by his incredibly low drawdowns. He achieves this risk control by always knowing his “uncle point” on any trade. No doubt, his approach of sharply reducing position size after large losses, as well as extended winning streaks, contributes heavily to his success. The rationale for reducing position size after a destabilizing loss is apparent. However the reason for taking the same action after a winning streak deserves further elaboration. As Schwartz explains it, he has always experienced his biggest losses after his biggest gains. I suspect this is true for the majority of traders. Winning streaks lead to complacency, and complacency leads to sloppy trading. ([Location 6144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=6144))

- Yes, I usually do; otherwise, I don’t bother doing it. One of the best rules anybody can learn about investing is to do nothing, absolutely nothing, unless there is something to do. Most people—not that I’m better than most people—always have to be playing; they always have to be doing something. They make a big play and say, “Boy, am I smart, I just tripled my money.” Then they rush out and have to do something else with that money. They can’t just sit there and wait for something new to develop. Do you always wait for a situation to line up in your favor? Don’t you ever say, “I think this market is probably going to go up, so I’ll give it a shot”? What you just described is a very fast way to the poorhouse.

That brings to mind a classic example of hysteria. In late 1979–early 1980, the gold market witnessed an incredible accelerated advance. Did you go short that market? Yes, I sold gold at $675. That was almost $200 too early! I told you I’m not a good trader. I’m nearly always too early, but it was only about four days before the top.

Was that a matter of recognizing the fingerprint of a market in its final blowoff, or was it a matter of gold being overpriced? Both. Gold was overpriced, but basically it was—I like your terminology—the “fingerprint” of hysteria. Just about every time you go against panic, you will be right if you can stick it out. So when you see panic, do you automatically go against it? The panic, the hysteria, in and of itself is only a catalyst to make me look to see what is going on.

Whenever you see that in a market, you are near a top. So, I went into the summer positioned for a collapse. ([Location 6318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=6318))

- When did you cover your positions? During the week of October 19. If you remember, by that time, everybody thought that the financial structure of America was over. Did you cover then because we had hysteria going the other way? That is exactly right. That week was a textbook case of hysteria. Under those kind of conditions, if you are still solvent, you have to step in there and go against it. Maybe that was going to be the one time it was the end of the world, and I would have been wiped out too. But 95 percent of the time when you go against that kind of hysteria, you are going to make money. ([Location 6331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=6331))

- A lot of people blame the October 1987 break on program trading. Do you consider that scapegoatism? Absolutely. The people who blame it on that do not understand the market. Politicians and people who lose money always look for scapegoats. In 1929, they blamed the crash on short sellers and margin requirements. There were lots of good reasons why the stock market went down. What they should focus on is why there were sellers on October 19, but no buyers. I remember why I became even more bearish on the weekend before October 19. The week before, [Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan Greenspan announced that the balance of trade was getting much better and things were under control. Two days later, the balance of trade figures came out, and they were the worst in the history of the world. Right away I said, “This guy is either a fool or a liar. He doesn’t have any idea what is going on.” Then on the weekend before October 19, you had [Treasury Secretary] Baker telling the world we were going to stick it to the Germans by letting the dollar go, because the Germans weren’t loosening monetary and fiscal policy as Baker had demanded. It looked like the trade wars of the 1930s all over again. I was in a panic—and I was already short! I called Singapore that Sunday night to add to my shorts. [Singapore opens earlier than we do.] So all those guys who came in on Monday to sell had very, very good reasons to sell, and there were no buyers around. There were no buyers, because there was no reason for people to buy. Even the buyers were scared and bearish that Monday.

- You talk about the collapse of the dollar as if it’s an inevitability. In 1983, we were the largest creditor nation in the world. In 1985, we became a debtor nation for the first time since 1914. By the end of 1987, our foreign debts were greater than all of the foreign debts of every nation south of the Rio Grande put together: Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, and all the rest. Can I paraphrase the chain of events you imply as follows: Nothing meaningful will be done to change the budget deficit situation. The continued budget deficit will guarantee that the trade deficit situation stays bad or even gets worse. That, in turn, guarantees that sooner or later, the dollar will come under extreme pressure. Absolutely. That’s why I’m not long the dollar. How does the bond market fit into this scenario? ([Location 6467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=6467))

- At some point, foreigners are going to stop putting money into this country because of the weakening dollar. That means the American public will have to finance the debt. We have only a 3 to 4 percent savings rate. To get the American public to finance that debt, interest rates would have to be very high. If the Federal Reserve tries to avoid high rates by printing more money, then the dollar just disappears and the Fed loses control completely. That is the case where you get hyperinflation and 25 to 30 percent interest rates. Either way, we are going to have high rates. You might start out with lower rates first if the politicians decide to bite the bullet by having a recession. But then, they will eventually give up and start printing money. But, sooner or later, the bond market collapses. Absolutely. Sooner or later, we repeat the English experience of not having a long-term bond market. But I don’t know when sooner or later is. It could be three years; it could be ten. How far did British bonds fall in the situation you are referring to? About 70 percent.

When we bought something and ran out of money, we would look at the portfolio and push out whatever appeared to be the least attractive item at that point. For example, if you wanted to buy corn and ran out of money, you either had to stop buying corn or sell something else. It was an amoebic process. You know how amoebas grow—they grow out this way, then they run into pressure so they grow out the other way. It was a very amoebic portfolio.

- I have lived through or studied hundreds, possibly even thousands, of bull and bear markets. In every bull market, whether it is IBM or oats, the bulls always seem to come up with reasons why it must go on, and on, and on. I remember hearing hundreds of times, “We are going to run out of supply.” “This time is going to be different.” “Oil has to sell at $100 a barrel.” “Oil is not a commodity [he laughs].” “Gold is different from every other commodity.” Well, damn, for 5,000 years it has not been different from every other commodity. There have been some periods when gold has been very bullish, and other periods when it has gone down for many years. There is nothing mystical about it. Sure, it has been a store of value, but so has wheat, corn, copper—everything. All these things have been around for thousands of years. Some are more valuable than others, but they are all commodities. They always have been, and they always will be. I guess the 1987 stock market is a prime recent example of the “this time is going to be different” complacency. Right. There was going to be a shortage of stocks again. In 1968, one of the major Wall Street houses published a great learned thesis on why there was a shortage of stocks developing, and why the bull market had to keep going up for years—right at the top. In 1987, you started hearing it all over again: “There is a shortage of stocks, because everybody is buying in all this stock.” At the bottom of the bear market [he begins a laugh that builds steadily] there is going to be a shortage of money—I assure you—with a gigantic surplus of stocks.

- Is that a general principle: When government measures are implemented to counteract a trend, you should sell the rally after the government action? Absolutely. It should be written down as an axiom that you always invest against the central banks. When the central banks try to prop up a currency, go the other way. What is the biggest public fallacy regarding market behavior? That the market is always right. The market is nearly always wrong. I can assure you of that. What else? Never, ever, follow conventional wisdom in the market. You have to learn to go counter to the markets. You have to learn how to think for yourself; to be able to see that the emperor has no clothes. Most people can’t do it. Most people want to follow a trend. “The trend is your friend.” Maybe that is valid for a few minutes in Chicago, but for the most part, following what everyone else is doing is rarely a way to get rich.

- But actually, your whole style of trading involves staying with a trend for years. So isn’t what you are saying contradictory? That kind of trend—a trend that is economically justified—is different. You have to see the supply/demand balance change early, buy early, and only buy markets that are going to go on for years. By “trend following,” I meant buying a market just because it goes up and selling it just because it goes down. What trading rules do you live by? Look for hysteria to see if you shouldn’t go the opposite way, but don’t go the opposite way until you have fully examined the situation. Also, remember that the world is always changing. Be aware of change. Buy change. You should be willing to buy or sell anything. So many people say, “I could never buy that kind of stock,” “I could never buy utilities,” “I could never play commodities.” You should be flexible and alert to investing in anything. If you were counseling the average investor, what would you tell him? Don’t do anything until you know what you are doing. If you make 50 percent two years in a row and then lose 50 percent in the third year, you would actually be worse off than if you just put your money in a money market fund. Wait for something to come along that you know is right. Then take your profit, put it back in the money market fund, and just wait again. You will come out way ahead of everybody else. Are you ever wrong on a major position play? That is, are one of your almost sure shots ever wrong, or are they so well selected that they just invariably go?

- But you don’t ever look at charts and say, “I’ve seen this type of pattern before and it usually means the market is topping.” I look at charts to see what has happened. Not what will happen? What has happened. If you don’t know what has happened, you’ll never know what is going to happen. The charts say to me that there is a runaway bull market. They give me facts, but that’s it. I don’t say—what is that term you used earlier, reversal?—there is a reversal here. I don’t even know what a reversal is. A reversal simply is— Don’t tell me. It might mess up my mind.

No. They may not always have been on a computer, but there always have been systems. I guarantee that you can go back 100 years in the market and not find a single decade where there hasn’t been some kind of system, some kind of new formula developed to play the markets. So the markets today are basically the same as the markets in the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s. The same as the markets in the nineteenth century. The same things make markets go up and down.

To avoid tying up your money in a dead market, wait until there is a catalyst to change the market direction. Sell hysteria. This principle is sound, but its application is far from easy.

And, even if you can predict long-term economic trends with a sufficient degree of accuracy, there still remains the problem of being able to sit tight, particularly when the financial steamroller of market hysteria is running counter to your position. For example, I doubt many traders would have been able to sell gold at $675, stay short while it surged to $875 in only four days, and then hold the position through the subsequent long-term collapse, eventually liquidating at a large profit. Even if you have the steel nerves necessary to duplicate this feat, you probably lack the financial resources to outstay this type of market or the same high degree of accuracy in picking your shots. Perhaps this particular concept should come with a caution label attached: Warning! Any attempts by the unskilled practitioner to apply the method described herein can lead to financial ruin. Be very selective. Wait for the right trade to come along. Never trade for trading’s sake. Have the patience to sit on your money until the high probability trade sets up exactly right. Be flexible.

- running racks. If my gut feel of market conditions is not right, I don’t trade. My timing is a combination of experience and my nervous system. If my nervous system tells me to get out of the position, it is because the market action triggers something in my knowledge and experience that I have seen before. I also don’t lose much on my trades, because I wait for the exact right moment. Most people will not wait for the environment to tip itself off. They will walk into the forest when it is still dark, while I wait until it gets light. Although the cheetah is the fastest animal in the world and can catch any animal on the plains, it will wait until it is absolutely sure it can catch its prey. It may hide in the bush for a week, waiting for just the right moment. It will wait for a baby antelope, and not just any baby antelope, but preferably one that is also sick or lame. Only then, when there is no chance it can lose its prey, does it attack. That, to me, is the epitome of professional trading. When I trade at home, I often watch the sparrows in my garden. When I feed them bread, they take just a little piece at a time and fly away. They keep on flying back and forth, taking small bits of bread. They may have to make a hundred stabs at a piece of bread to get what a pigeon gets at one time, but that is why a pigeon is a pigeon. You will never be able to shoot a sparrow, it is just too fast. That is the way I day trade. For example, there are times during the day when I am sure that the S&P is going up, but I don’t try to pick the bottom, and I am out before it tops. I just take the mid-range where the momentum is greatest. That, to me, is trading like a sparrow eats. Am I paraphrasing you correctly? The cheetah is your analogy for position trading and the sparrow is your analogy for day trading. The common denominator is that both animals wait for can’t-lose circumstances. Exactly. How do you pick your trades? I use many different types of technical input: charts, Elliott Wave and Gann analysis, Fibonacci numbers, cycles, sentiment, moving averages, and various oscillators. People think that technical analysis is unreliable because they tend to pick the one thing they are comfortable with. The problem is that no single technical approach works all the time.

- Is there anything you can single out as the most important element in deciding to put on a trade? I am always looking for a market that is losing momentum, and then go the other way. Having traded both the stock and commodity markets, would you say they behave differently? Absolutely. In contrast to the commodity markets, the stock market very rarely gives you the opportunity to enjoy a meaningful trend. Why is that? Because when institutions and specialists sell out, they don’t sell out at one price level, they scale out as the market goes up. Similarly, when they buy, they scale in as the market goes down. This leads to choppier price action and is the reason why many good commodity traders that I know lose every time they go into the stock market. But you win consistently in the stock market, as well. What are you doing differently? I don’t try to figure out where the market is going before the action; I let the market tell me where it is going. Also, there is such a variety of technical input in the stock market (divergence, advance/decline, sentiment, put/call ratios, and so on), that you will almost always get a signal before the market is about to do something. Is your method of technical analysis therefore different in the stock market than in the commodity markets? I look at the individual stocks; they all have their own personalities. For example, IBM and General Motors will usually rally before a major market bottom and fail to rally before a major market top. As another example, I have never seen a real good rally without the utilities leading the market. The utilities go up when interest rates are expected to come down, and when interest rates come down, portfolio managers jump into stocks. I have done extremely well trading the indexes, because before I ever traded index futures, I had become a very experienced trader of stocks and options. What do you think is the public’s biggest misconception about the markets? That people who trade the markets gamble. I know floor traders that have made money for twenty straight years. You can’t call that gambling. Another major misconception is that people always expect the market to react to news. For example, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the market initially broke very sharply, but then quickly rebounded to new highs. This price action baffled many people. Investors who sold on the news only to watch the market reverse blamed the institutions for pushing the market higher. What they failed to realize is that a market that is fundamentally and technically poised to move higher is not going to reverse direction because of a news item—even a dramatic one. Another item I would place under the category of misconceptions is the way the media reports the reasons for the market being down. They are always saying that the market is down because of profit taking. I think it would be wonderful if everybody was always taking profits. But, the truth is, most people lose money, and the reason… ([Location 7318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=7318))

- In response to a query regarding other traders I was interviewing, I mentioned that one, Tony Saliba, had made the cover of the current issue of Success magazine. Gelber asked me if I had a copy. I pulled out the magazine from my attaché case and handed it to him. He smiled as he read the bold headline describing Saliba’s experience during the week of the October 19, 1987, stock market crash: “Victory! He Made $4 Million in Seventy-Two Hours.” Jokingly, Gelber asked, “I made $4 million in twenty minutes on that day; how come I’m not on a magazine cover?” It was not meant to be boastful. It did, however, very specifically summarize a basic truth about great traders: Many, if not most, maintain relatively low profiles and are therefore virtually unknown to the public.

- Did your customers lose because the research was wrong? No. They lost because their time horizon was mostly day to day, while the research was longer term. So there was a mismatch? Exactly.

- Absolutely. As I tell the people I hire, “If you are a broker, you are not a trader; if you are a trader, you are not a broker.” But you were. It was a wild time. I was the biggest trader and the biggest broker in the same market. I worked very long hours and was totally exhausted when I went home. Then I would just get up the next day and do it again. This went on for three years, and while it was a great experience, I really shouldn’t have done it. You can’t be a great broker and a great trader. I did a good job, but it probably took years off my life. Are most of the significant size traders on the floor just traders, or do some also handle customers? They all are either brokers or traders now. That is the only way to go; there is no doubt about it. Is that true of most floors, or just the T-bond floor? Primarily, the T-bond floor. In the S&P and in the New York markets, some of the big brokers are also big traders. Given today’s increased scrutiny, are people who violate the confidence of dual trading [handling customer orders and trading one’s own account] likely to get caught? It is still very difficult to create a flawless audit trail in an open outcry market. ([Location 7507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=7507))

- I’ll give you an example. I think I’m a good trader, but there is a guy working for me who is better. I could go out there and beat my head against the desk and try to outdo him, or I can just be myself. Let him make whatever he can, and I’ll make whatever I can. This is my view of a year in the life of a trader: Four out of twelve months you are hot. You are so excited that you can’t sleep at night. You can’t wait to get to work the next day; you’re just rolling. Two months out of the year, you are cold. You are so cold, you are miserable. You can’t sleep at night. You can’t figure out where the next trade is going to come from. The other six months out of the year, you make and lose, make and lose. You can’t sleep, because you are trying to figure out how you are going to make money. The net result is that you never sleep, because you are constantly thinking too much about trading. It is an all-consuming thing. That is why you need to know yourself—to moderate your emotions. If you don’t, then after a big success, you are high as a kite. You are not prepared when just around the corner, the market suddenly brings you back to earth. Or, in the opposite situation, when you are consistently losing, you might end up jumping out of a window. Why did I leave the floor? Again, because I know myself. I need to interact with people and that doesn’t happen there. ([Location 7630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=7630))

- What does that tell you? If it is in line with what the other traders I talk to are doing, it tells me the market will probably go higher. So if you talk to twenty-five people, and twenty of them are nervous about the market going higher because implicitly they are short, does that tell you that you should be trading on the long side? Yes. I know a large number of people in the industry and that is a big plus. I listen to them. I go with the people who are hot. Sure, I can form my own opinion, but that is not what makes me do the things I do in the market. Sometimes, I know my opinion is right, and I’ll go with it. Sometimes, I know somebody else is hot, and I’ll go with their opinion. I’m not picky about how I make my money. It doesn’t matter if my opinion is right or wrong. All that matters is whether I make money. Doesn’t it get confusing when you talk to twenty-five people and fifteen are bullish and ten are bearish? Sometimes, but I’ve been doing this since 1976. I’ve always been able to read people very well, even though no one thinks I listen. For example, I have one trader here who is cold as ice right now. All I have to do is listen to him. Last night, he told me he wanted to be short. I knew that I was going to be long. As long as he is cold? Right, and the one time he gets hot, fine. When the guy is cold, he is cold. You can’t say to a trader, “You’re cold, you can’t trade.” You have to let them run their course. Is reading other traders a key component of your personal trading right now? Yes, I’m pliable. I know these people, so I understand how to read them. I don’t want to hear what Jack Schwager says, because I don’t know him. I only want to talk to people I know very well. What other things are important to your trading success? The realization that when you don’t care, you do well, and when you try too hard, you don’t do well. By “trying too hard,” do you mean pressing when there is no trade? Pressing is one of the reasons I’m sitting in here with you for so long during trading hours.

- Do you use trading systems? No, we are “discretionary traders.” We only use technical indicators and systems as trading tools. One particularly interesting system we have developed is based on quirks related to volatility. Our belief is that volatility offers clues to trend direction. Although we’ve found through backtesting that this system gives you good signals, we do not blindly follow the trades. For an automated, computerized system, what would you consider good results in terms of average annual return? About 40 to 50 percent, with maximum equity drawdowns under 10 percent. But systems will always have larger maximum drawdowns than that. That is why we haven’t directly traded money on them.

- Do you think any system can compete with a good trader? I haven’t seen one yet, although there may be one somewhere. There are some traders who have the skills, but who don’t succeed. What is it that keeps them from becoming successful? Most traders who fail have large egos and can’t admit that they are wrong. Even those who are willing to admit that they are wrong early in their careers can’t admit it later on. Also, some traders fail because they are too worried about losing. In other words, successful trading is a matter of trying to avoid losses, but not being afraid of them. That is a good way to put it. I’m not afraid to lose. When you start being afraid to lose, you’re finished. Is the ability to accept losses a characteristic of a winning trader? Yes. Tom Baldwin is a good example. He only trades the market; he doesn’t trade size or equity. By that I mean, he doesn’t say to himself, “I am long 2,000 contracts. Oh my God, that is too many, I have to sell ([Location 7750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=7750))

In your trading experience, is there one particular trade that stands out as the most dramatic? In 1986, when the long bond was being cornered by the Japanese, there was a big, emotional rally on a Monday morning. I had thought the market was too high at 90.00, and here it was trading over 91.00. So I sold 1,100 contracts scale-up above that level. The market backed down and was offered 1,000 lots at 91.00. Just as I was thinking that I had this trade nailed, in less than five minutes the market reversed and soared to 92.00. I was down $1 million, and the market was only a few ticks away from limit bid. I had never lost so much money, so fast, and it was… ([Location 7765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=7765))

Anyway, I sold a little bit more up at the highs, and from that point on, I was only concerned with covering. I waited patiently, and the market started coming back down. I ended up losing only $400,000 for the day, not all that bad considering where I was earlier. But that trade had a big emotional impact on me. I was flabbergasted by the market action. I had forgotten that markets could run away like that. I couldn’t believe how wrong I had been. What did you mean earlier when you said the Japanese cornered the market?

- Are the Japanese smart traders then? No, they just have a style. They are cannonball traders. They go one way, and they all go together. A friend of mine at one of the Japanese shops told me about a Japanese trader who bought just about every long bond on the screen. About fifteen minutes later he called back and asked, “Why is the basis [the price spread between cash, T-bonds and T-bond futures] going out?” Naively, the Japanese trader had noticed that cash prices had gone way up, while futures didn’t go up very much. My friend told him, “Well, you just bought every bond available. Of course, the basis is going to go out.” They didn’t really understand the impact of their trading. The Japanese did much the same thing in the U.S. equity market in 1987 as they did in bonds in 1986. They practically took control of it, buying because prices kept going higher. I’ll never forgive myself for not buying stocks and selling bonds in 1987. That was going to be my number one trade in 1987. Was the reasoning that the bond market had already run way up, while stocks hadn’t? Did you just believe the two markets were out of line valuewise? That’s right. Also, we knew the Japanese were buying the high-capitalization U.S. stocks. Having already learned their buying style in the bond market, the trade was even more obvious.

- On a more practical note, one of the primary caveats provided by Gelber concerned the misuse of brokerage research. He noted a tendency for the broker and client to use longer-term research for short-term trading. This misapplication of information often leads to trading losses, even when the research is right. Clearly, flexibility and suppression of ego are key elements of Gelber’s success. Referring to hot traders, he notes, “I’ll go with their opinion. . . . It doesn’t matter if I’m right.

No. Paying attention to what other markets are doing, such as the Dow Jones or gold. Watching the traders in the pit. Patterns? Yes. In other words, they are not paying enough attention. They are standing there trying to pick a trade here and there, but they are not absorbing everything that is going on. Right. Also, their expenses are usually way too high. They can’t stand there and hack it long enough to pick it up. Because it is like any job, if you stand there long enough, you have to pick it up. It is just a matter of how long you can afford to stand there before you do. Do you really believe that? Well, the average guy might not be a million-dollar trader, but if he stands there for five years, he would have to pick it up. It is just like a job. You don’t start any job and feel comfortable in the first six months. You did. Yes, but I did start as a one-lot trader. And I wasn’t really comfortable, because I had to make money. I only had $25,000 to my name. At what point were you confident that you were going to be successful at it? That is an interesting question. You are never really confident in this business, because you can always be wiped out pretty quickly. The way I trade is: Live by the sword, die by the sword. There is always the potential that I could get caught with a big position in a fluke move with the market going the limit against me. On the other hand, there is no doubt in my mind that I could walk into any market in the world and make money.

- From your perspective, what does the average trader—that is, public trader—do wrong? They trade too much. They don’t pick their spots selectively enough. When they see the market moving, they want to be in on the action. So, they end up forcing the trade rather than waiting patiently. Patience is an important trait many people don’t have. Waiting for the right spot? Right, I bet most people are probably ahead after their first five trades. They think, “This is great, like free money.” But then they forget that the reason they made money on their early trades was because they waited a long time. They said, “I bet this is a good spot to buy it because I’ve seen the market act this way a lot of times.” And they made money. But all of a sudden, they are doing a trade every day. The next thing that happens is they lose on a few trades, and invariably don’t know how to take a loss. They made money to start, and before they know it, they are even. Now they hesitate. “Where do I get out?” The minute they hesitate, the market just keeps going. Now they are losing money and they say, “If I sell it here, I’m going to lose $1,000.” They don’t like to lose $1,000, when they’re getting paid $500 a week. Now, all of a sudden, they are thinking about the money. Once you think about the money, you are dead? Yes. That is what usually happens to the public. What is your own way of handling losses?

Does luck have anything to do with trading? Trading is like any other job. You work hard, put in the time and effort, and make your own luck. I was lucky that the first 100-lot I sold was a winner. But why was I lucky? Because I stood there all day for over six months, developing and honing market feeling. When the opportunity occurred, I didn’t hesitate. You have to pay your dues to get the luck. Right. Are there people on the floor who are not good traders, but are way ahead because they just happened to do a couple of big trades on the right side of the market? Can anybody really get by just on luck? No, not for long. The rule of thumb is if you have lasted a year, you will make it, but it is hard.

- To my surprise, the interview yielded some relevant insights. Perhaps the most important point made by Baldwin was his emphasis on not viewing trading in terms of money. To him, money is only a means of keeping score. By contrast, most traders tend to think of gains and losses in terms of their monetary implications—a frame of mind that only gets in the way of making trading decisions. For example, assume you originally planned to risk up to $5,000 on a trade, and quickly find yourself down by $2,000. If, at this point, you start to think of the trade in terms of money (for example, “the extra $3,000 can pay for my vacation”), you might well liquidate the position, even though you still believed in the trade. It is one thing to get out because you no longer like the position, but it is quite another matter to liquidate on impulse simply because you have translated the risk into tangible terms. Another interesting point made by Baldwin is an unconventional one: Don’t get out of a losing trade too hastily; instead, wait and choose your time. This advice seems to fly in the face of most trading advice. After all, isn’t one of the basic tenets of trading success to cut your losses quickly? However, I don’t think Baldwin’s statement contradicts the rule. I believe he is saying that often the worst time to bail out of a position is during a violent price move against you. Baldwin’s point is that by bearing the pain just a little longer, you may be able to find a more favorable circumstance for liquidating. Of course, this philosophy should be applied only by disciplined traders: those with the ability to maintain a risk control strategy.

- Yes, if I’m trading, I’m on the floor. But that article is completely misleading. They wrote it that way to sell magazines. They make it sound like I planned and plotted to avoid the floor that day. That’s not the story. I was concerned about the positions held by my clearing firm. One guy in particular had a huge position, which he wasn’t closing, and I had to spend a great deal of time on the phone. Now, that’s not as dramatic as the way the magazine wrote it up, but that’s what really happened. Didn’t you also sell your seat that day? You must have been really confident the market was going down to sell a seat. I hit that seat before the market opened. I figured if I didn’t hit the bid for the seat, someone else would. Anyway I had seven seats; I just sold one. Was this the first time you traded a seat? I mean seats aren’t exactly a liquid market. Yes, it was the first time I did it like that: trading the seat round turn in one day. But I have traded seats before. I trade them depending on my mood in the market. On balance though, I want to be long seats. I believe in our industry. But in that circumstance, it did seem like a good trade? I figured, “Hey, I have a lot of exposure in seats—a few million dollars worth—I better take some protection.” I sold that seat for $452,000 in the morning and bought it back the next afternoon for $275,000.

- How much did you make that Monday? That has caused me a lot of headaches. I would rather not say. Obviously, your big money was made in the out-of-the-money puts. What percentage of that position did you keep as of Monday’s close? About 95 percent. You kept most of it! But the profits were so huge. Wasn’t it tempting to just take it? The reason I didn’t cover was because I felt my long puts hadn’t gone up enough. They all went to parity. The puts that were thirty points in-the-money were trading at $30. In other words, the option premiums consisted almost entirely of intrinsic value; the market wasn’t giving them any time value premium. Given the enormous market volatility, I thought that was crazy. So, you figured you would wait till the next day. Yes, and do you know what I did to hedge myself? I bought more insurance at the close on Monday. I covered hundreds of my short calls. You were basically buying more volatility. ([Location 8541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8541))

- It was the best thing I could have done. The next day they didn’t know what they wanted more of: Half the world wanted puts, and half the world wanted calls. But everybody wanted volatility. That’s when the register really started ringing. It was the day that the sun was so close to the earth that everybody needed zinc ointment, and I was the only guy who had some left. Let’s take the other side of the fence: What did the traders who got buried in October do wrong? They took for granted that Monday would be a normal day. They started out long, thinking the market was just correcting and was due for a bounce. Then they bought on the way down; they bought every dip. Did some traders just freeze? Sure, some did. I have one friend, who is a million-dollar annual earner. On Tuesday morning, I walk in and say, “Hey, Jack, what do you think? Are you going to get them today?” But he just stood there. He didn’t say a word to me. He looked shell-shocked. He just kept going over his sheets, looking for something to do, but not knowing what to do. So he missed all the opportunity. Why was the way you responded to the market so different from the way your friend responded? He wasn’t sure what his position risk was. I always define my risk, and I don’t have to worry about it. I walk into the pit every day with a clean slate, so that I can take advantage of what is going on. A clean slate sounds like you come in with a flat position every day, but you obviously hold positions overnight.

- I think the biggest problem with some traders who come on the floor is that they think they are bigger than the market. They don’t fear the marketplace, and they lose sight of their discipline and the hard work ethic. Those are the traders who get blown out. But most guys on the floor really work hard. What is the biggest misconception the public has about the marketplace? The idea that the market has to go up for them to make money. You can make money in any kind of market if you use the right strategies. With futures, options, and the underlying markets, there are enough tools available to set up a game plan for any situation. In other words, the public has too much of a bullish bias? Yes, it is the American way: The market has to go up.

- For the average person, like my mom or dad and their relatives, the biggest misconception is that they think when the market goes up, you make money, and when it goes down, you lose. People need to approach it from a more neutral standpoint and say, “I’m going to be a little long in this category and short in this category, but limit my short-side risk because it is infinite.” How do you handle a losing period? How do you lose money? It is either bad day trading or a losing position. If it’s a bad position that is the problem, then you should just get out of it. Is that what you do? Yes. I either liquidate it or neutralize it, because then you are back afloat. When you are in a boat that springs a leak, you don’t drill another hole to let the water out.

- What are the elements of good trading? Clear thinking, ability to stay focused, and extreme discipline. Discipline is number one: Take a theory and stick with it. But you also have to be open-minded enough to switch tracks if you feel that your theory has been proven wrong. You have to be able to say, “My method worked for this type of market, but we are not in that type of market anymore.” Trading rules you live by. I scale in and scale out of my positions, so that I can spread out my risk. I don’t like to do all of a large order right up front. What else? Always respect the marketplace. Never take anything for granted. Do your homework. Recap the day. Figure out what you did right and what you did wrong.

- This same Teledyne example also illustrates another important characteristic of the superior trader: the maintenance of rigid risk control, even in difficult circumstances. It must have been very tempting for Saliba to trade a larger position size in the Teledyne pit when he was being derided as “one-lot.” Instead, he maintained his discipline and continued to trade small until his capital had grown sufficiently to allow him to increase his position size. Working hard and examining many different scenarios so that he is prepared for all contingencies is a critical element of Saliba’s success. By anticipating all the “what-ifs,” he can take advantage of situations such as the October 19 stock slide, instead of being immobilized by such events. For many people, the concept of a great trader conjures up an image of someone using a shoot-from-the-hip approach, moving in and out of markets with great agility and a near sixth sense. The reality is far less glamorous. In the majority of cases, exceptional traders owe their success to hard work and preparation. In fact, similar to Tony Saliba, many of the very successful traders will do their “homework” every night, not allowing leisure or other business from interfering with their daily regimen of market analysis. When they stray from that discipline, it usually ends up costing them money. In Saliba’s own words, referring to a recently missed trade due to his failure to have his orders in while on a business trip, “It cost me ten grand, and all those little ten grands can add up.” ([Location 8677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8677))

- Dr. Van K. Tharp is a research psychologist who received his Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, in 1975. He has spent his career studying how stress affects human performance. His strongest interest is in the psychology of winning—especially as winning applies to the markets.

- After I interviewed Dr. Tharp, he asked whether he could do a videotape interview of me as part of his ongoing research. Since I thought such an interview might be helpful in improving my own trading performance, I eagerly agreed. The interview lasted for over four hours. Dr. Tharp has a particularly probing questioning style. After an initial response to a question, he would ask, “What else?” and repeat this process several times. When I could no longer think of any additional responses, he would have me shift the direction of my gaze (he later explained this instruction was intended to facilitate accessing different parts of my brain), and sure enough I would think of another point I had somehow overlooked. I felt that this interview yielded some important personal insights. (One of these self-realizations is briefly discussed in the next chapter.)

- What did you learn in analyzing the responses to your test? Were there any major surprises? I had several measures of success built into the test, so I could rank the responses according to “success level.” The investment literature suggested ten different areas that might be important. As a result, I designed questions to measure each of those areas. I did a number of statistical analyses of the data and found a significant correlation between each area and investment success. In addition, I found that those ten areas could be grouped into three major clusters, which I label the psychological factor, the management and discipline factor, and the decision-making factor. Although I’ve since refined the test, I still use the same three major ([Location 8736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8736))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- clusters. In addition, I still keep the ten original areas, and I’ve added an extra one—intuition. What are the eleven areas you measure? Well, the psychological factor has five areas. These include a well-rounded personal life, a positive attitude, the motivation to make money, lack of conflict, and responsibility for results. Motivation to make money is not significantly correlated with success, but I keep it in the test because lack of such motivation plus high conflict is very significant. There are three factors in the decision-making area. These include a solid knowledge of technical factors in the market, an aptitude for making sound decisions without common biases, and the ability to think independently. Incidentally, knowledge of technical factors has little relationship to success based on the test scores. Also, there are three management-discipline factors. One needs risk control and the ability to be patient. In addition, I also include intuition in this category. Although I have not found any relationship between intuition and trading success, I keep the factor in the test because it is interesting to me.

- I designed the test to predict who could win and who couldn’t. Now, I believe that anyone can win if they are committed to do so. Primarily, it’s just a matter of learning how. Too many people get stuck by the beliefs they hold, yet they continue to cling to those old beliefs. My beliefs, in contrast, are constantly evolving, and I think it’s because I value them according to their utility. Thus, I’m willing to admit most of my beliefs are probably wrong. For example, there may be people who could not be successful in trading even if they were committed to doing so. But right now, it’s most useful for me to believe that anyone can win. When I hold that belief, I am much more effective at helping people become winners. ([Location 8771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8771))

- In the case of a trader who uses a nonquantifiable approach (for example, “I buy or sell whenever I get a feeling about the market’s impending direction from the chart patterns”), how do you distinguish whether trading problems are related to lack of skill or to psychological impediments to success? Before I take someone on as a client, I need to know that they have some sort of methodology that they think works. I determine what evidence they have of that. Can they, for example, convince me? Have they tested that methodology? Does their testing amount to a hindsight evaluation, or is it based on actual trading signals that one can follow? I also am convinced that it is difficult to make money day trading or trading in a short time frame, so I am skeptical about anyone who wants me to help them day trade successfully.

- One of the basic problems that most traders face is dealing with risk. For example, two primary rules to successful speculative trading are: Cut your losses short and let your profits run. Most people cannot deal with those two rules. For example, if making money is important to you—as it is to most people who play investment games—then you will probably have trouble taking small losses. As a result, small losses turn into moderate losses, which are even harder to take. Finally, the moderate losses turn into big losses, which you are forced to take—all because it was so hard to take a small loss. Similarly, when people have a profit, they want to take it right away. They think, “I’d better take this now before it gets away.” The bigger the profit becomes, the harder it is to resist the temptation to take it now. The simple truth is that most people are risk-aversive in the realm of profits—they prefer a sure, smaller gain to a wise gamble for a larger gain—and risk-seeking in the realm of losses—they prefer an unwise gamble to a sure loss. As a result, most people tend to do the opposite of what is required for success. They cut their profits short and let their losses run. If you think of trading as a game and that a mistake is not following the rules of the game, then it becomes much easier to follow these two rules. You should review your rules at the beginning of the day and review your trading at the end of the day. If you followed your rules, even if you lost money, pat yourself on the back. If you didn’t follow your rules, then mentally rehearse what you did and give yourself more appropriate choices in the future. The second major problem people have is dealing with stress. Stress really takes two forms: worry and the biological fight/flight response. Our brains have a limited capacity for processing information. If your mind is preoccupied with worry, that worry takes up most of the decision space, and you don’t have enough capacity left to perform effectively. One aspect of the fight/flight response is that it causes people to narrow their focus. They revert to earlier well-practiced response patterns. For example, a common decision… ([Location 8813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8813))

- faced with stressful events, people give more effort to the few alternatives they do consider. They keep on doing what they were doing—only they do it harder. Putting more energy into trading decisions does not help you make more money. Instead you will tend to make quick, irrational choices, which use up some of that excess energy. You probably put more energy into a losing position by actively resisting closing it out. The result is a bigger loss. In summary, the fight/flight response will decrease your performance by causing you to narrow your choices and concentrate more energy on the remaining alternatives. The solution for dealing with stress is to work on the causes and to develop stress protectors. I would recommend that people with this problem go into a stress management program. Also, it is important to understand that many stressful events are such because of the way you perceive them. Change those perceptions and you will change the event itself. For example, winners typically differ from losers in their attitude about losses. Most people become anxious about losses, yet successful speculators have learned that an essential ingredient to winning is to make it OK to lose. Since most people in our culture are taught that only winning is acceptable, most investors must change their beliefs about losses to become successful. The third major problem that people have is dealing with conflict. People have different parts of themselves, each of which has a positive intention. For example, someone might have a part to make money, a part to protect him from failure, a part to make him feel good about himself, a part which looks after the welfare of the family, etc. Now, once you establish these parts, you usually allow them to operate subconsciously. What happens is the parts continually adopt new behaviors to carry out their intentions.… ([Location 8835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8835))

- Are you implying that some people actually want to lose on a subconscious level because it fulfills some other positive intention? How common is that? Half the traders I work with have problems of this nature. I think it’s very common. So far, you’ve cited poor risk attitudes, stress, and conflict as impediments to trading success. Are there any other major problems people have with the markets? A fourth major problem is that many people allow their emotions to control their trading. In fact, most trading problems appear to involve emotional control in some manner. I know of at least ten methods of helping people control their mental states. An easy method that people can adopt right away is simply to control posture, breathing, and muscle tension. If you change those factors, you will probably find that you change your emotional state.

- So what does it take to duplicate successful trading? There are three primary factors involved in duplicating success—beliefs, mental states, and mental strategies. If you duplicate the way the best traders use those three factors for every aspect of the trading task, then you can duplicate their results. As a nontrading example, most martial arts experts believe that it takes years of practice to break a board with your bare hand. I was able to observe someone for about fifteen minutes and then break two ½-inch pine boards with my hand. I even showed my son (who was ten at the time) how to do it. That’s the power behind modeling. ([Location 8891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X50OPW&location=8891))

- If I miss a shot, it has something to do with my performance. One of the two top shooters, when they were in competition together, always won. And you could tell the difference between the two in accordance with their beliefs. For example, the best shooter believed that it was important to rehearse an entire 1,000-round match the prior evening, whereas the second best shooter only believed that mental rehearsal was important. In addition, the best shooter believed that it was important to hit the center of the bull’s eye on each shot (even though you didn’t get extra points for that), whereas the second best shooter believed that it was only important to hit the bull’s eye. Can you understand why one was better than the other just from their beliefs? Now, contrast the beliefs of top shooters with the beliefs of new recruits coming into the Army. The latter might believe: Guns are evil; they kill people. If they shoot this weapon too many times, they might go deaf. If they miss the target, it means the gun is misaligned.

- Now, let me explain some of my findings in working with top traders. You might find some of these beliefs confirmed in other interviews in your book. Generally, I find that top traders believe: Money is NOT important. It is OK to lose in the markets. Trading is a game. Mental rehearsal is important for success. They’ve won the game before they start. Although there are a lot more than five critical beliefs, I think these five are among the most important. Most people approach trading to make a lot of money, and that is one of the primary reasons they lose. Because money is so important, they have trouble taking losses and letting profits run. In contrast, when you think of trading as a game and play by certain rules, then it becomes much easier to follow those two golden rules.

- Can you give a practical example of how someone can control their mental state? Well, mental state manipulation is what most people call discipline. I teach people a very simple procedure that they can use right away. For example, suppose you are at your desk and you become aware that you are in a mental state that you would like to change. Get up out of the chair. Walk away about four feet and then look at how you looked in that chair. Notice your posture, your breathing, your facial expressions. Then imagine how you would look if you had the sort of mental state you would like. When you can see that clearly, sit down in the chair again and assume the position that you just imagined. That exercise works for almost any situation as it involves several important principles—changing your body posture, seeing yourself from a more objective viewpoint, and imagining a more resourceful state.

- Final Word There is no holy grail to trading success. The methodologies employed by the “market wizards” cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundamental—and everything in between. The length of time they typically hold a trade ranges from minutes to years. Although the styles of the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident: All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders—in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned.

- The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself. The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game. They all love what they are doing.

I strongly suspect that when these time-separated opinions overlap in subject, they will be harmonious, not because I am overly rigid—although perhaps I may be (“What do you mean, perhaps?” I can hear my wife saying)—but because there is a timelessness to market truths. The markets are a reflection of human nature, and I believe it is the constancy of human emotions that explains why the same rules that applied when Market Wizards was published still apply today, as they did a century earlier and as they will a century from now.
