## Highlights
- I often say investing success is two-thirds ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=180))
- avoiding mistakes, one-third doing something right. If you can just avoid mistakes, you can lower your error rate. That alone should improve your results. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=181))
- Maybe you think avoiding mistakes is easy. Just don’t make mistakes! Who sets out to make them, anyway? But investors don’t make mistakes because they know they’re mistakes. They make them because they think they’re making ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=183))
- smart decisions. Decisions they’ve made plenty of times and have seen other smart people make. They think they’re the right decisions because they don’t question. After all, what sense does it make to question something that “everyone ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=185))
- knows”? Or something that’s common sense? Or something you learned from someone supposedly smarter than you? Waste of time, right? No! You should always question everything you think you know. Not once, but every time you ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=187))
- make an investing decision. It’s not hard. Well, functionally it’s not hard, though emotionally and instinctually, it might be. What’s the worst that can happen? You discover you were right all along, which is fun. No harm done. No humiliation! ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=191))
- Most people prefer the easy route of never questioning and never being humiliated.) ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=198))
- The first, most basic step. If you can’t do this, you can’t move to later steps. Being counterintuitive. If “everyone knows” something, ask if the reverse might be true. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=220))
- But overall, as a broader category, bonds typically aren’t as volatile as stocks—over shorter time periods. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=252))
- You probably don’t hear this often (if ever), but data prove stocks have been less volatile than bonds historically over longer periods—and with superior returns. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=296))
- Investing is about probabilities, not certainties. There are no certainties in investing—not even in Treasurys, which can lose value in any given year. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=333))
- But there’s an additional reason to believe stocks are likely to have superior returns over long periods moving forward: Stocks evolve. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=352))
- Businesses and, hence, stocks adapt. Some businesses don’t survive. They fail—but ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=356))
- get replaced by something newer, better, more efficient. That’s creative destruction, and it’s a powerful force for societal good. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=357))
- That transformational power unleashed by profit motive is encapsulated by stocks. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=394))
- If you think today’s electronic gadgets represent the pinnacle of human ingenuity, you’ll be proven wrong. I don’t know when or how, but I needn’t know—I can just own stocks and benefit. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=405))
- Human ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=407))
- nature hasn’t changed enough that folks won’t be self-motivated to use their ingenuity to devise solutions to profit from problems. Always been that way. And those who profit most from innovation aren’t the technologists. No, they’re those who learn to package, ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=407))
- market and sell those innovations—and their shareholders. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=409))
- A popular short-cut in financial planning circles is the idea you can take 100, subtract your age, and that’s how much you should have in stocks. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=435))
- But be wary of anything regarding your long-term financial planning that seems fast and easy. More broadly, investing ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=441))
- rules of thumb should be regarded with severe cynicism, if not ignored outright. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=441))
- That cookie-cutter way of thinking presumes everyone of a same age is ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=459))
- identical. I can think of few rules of thumb more potentially injurious. This ignores things like investors’ goals, how much cash flow they may need now or in the future and how much growth is appropriate for their goals. It ignores current circumstances, portfolio size, ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=459))
- whether the investor is still working or not. It ignores myriad more details unique to that investor. And it ignores the spouse! ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=461))
- I’ve learned a tremendous amount in my long professional investing career—perhaps one of the more important lessons is never forget the spouse. That’s a ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=462))
- good rule for your personal life, too. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=463))
- (For more, see my 2012 book, Plan Your Prosperity.) ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=466))
- Time horizon isn’t the period of time between now and some milestone. Time horizon is how long you need your assets to work for you. For many individual investors, this is often their whole life and that of their spouse. Never forget the spouse. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=475))
- What you don’t want to do is plan for a 25-year ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=493))
- time horizon, get to 85 and discover the money has largely run out. You won’t enjoy that. And if your spouse lives to 95, he or she really won’t enjoy that—aged poverty is cruel. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=493))
- A body that moves has a healthier heart. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=520))
- And, as said earlier, ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=523))
- time horizon is just one key consideration in determining an appropriate long-term asset allocation (i.e., benchmark). It’s an important factor, but not the sole factor and must be considered alongside return expectations, cash flow needs, current circumstances and any other unique ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=523))
- personal factors. Which makes determining asset allocation by age and age alone a rule of thumb you can give the boot. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=525))
- Our research shows that the way people think about food and investing often parallels. In food, ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=589))
- folks want multiple things at the same time. They don’t just want nutrition—they want food to look good and taste good. And they want to eat food at the right time of day. Cereal is a breakfast food—eating it at night is just sad. And diners want prestige! Packaging matters. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=590))
- What folks want from food can shift, fast. And what they feel as risk is what they want at a point in time that they think (or fear) they’re not getting. They don’t think about the things they are getting. For example: Maybe they’re forced to eat cereal at night—nothing else in the ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=592))
- house. They don’t like that they’re eating something in the wrong order, and they feel foolish for it. Won’t admit it at work the next day! Those are two risks. They don’t think about the need that’s being fulfilled, i.e., basic sustenance. How does that relate ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=594))
- to investing? As with dining, what folks feel as risk is often that which investors aren’t getting at a point in time—never mind if their other objectives are being met. You might hear investors say something like, “I don’t want any downside volatility!” They’re feeling volatility and want ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=597))
- protection from it. Then, if stocks go on a long, sustained tear, they might feel like they’re missing out—and missing out is felt as another kind of risk. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=599))
- That risk is called opportunity cost—the risk of taking or failing to take actions now that results in lower returns than you would have ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=602))
- gotten otherwise. And it can be a killer. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=603))
- For example, you may have a longer investing time horizon, but perhaps you’re mostly concerned about shorter-term volatility and not any other form of risk. You may then choose to have too large a permanent ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=604))
- allocation of fixed income than would otherwise be appropriate for your long-term objectives. Over your longer time horizon, because you don’t have enough exposure to equities, you likely get lower returns and increase the likelihood you miss your long-term objectives—maybe by ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=606))
- a wide margin. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=608))
- That can hurt—a lot. Particularly if you’re depending on your portfolio to provide cash flow in retirement. If you’re planning on a certain level of cash flow, but your portfolio suffers from opportunity cost over a long period, you may find you ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=608))
- must ratchet back your spending. What makes opportunity cost such a killer is its deleterious impact may not be obvious for some time. You may have a 20- or 30-year time horizon—or more! Twenty years from now, if you look back and discover you ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=610))
- really needed to annualize 9% or 10% on average, but your lower short-term volatility portfolio yielded much less, that’s a massive portfolio error that may simply be beyond help. Twenty years of too-low returns is hard (if not impossible) to make up—particularly if ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=613))
- you’re now taking cash flow. To reduce the odds you run out of money too soon, you may have to cut your spending. And that can be hard to do, even dispiriting, if you’ve been counting on a larger income—particularly if you’re already retired or nearing retirement—more so if your ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=614))
- spouse was also counting on that income. That’s tough enough to take, and tougher still to explain to your spouse. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=617))
- But typically, investors default to focusing most on ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=623))
- volatility and less (or not at all) on opportunity cost. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=623))
- And by and large, investors tend to disbelieve bull markets as they run. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=626))
- long term. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=632))
- Many posit the onset of high-frequency trading and speculators have contributed to increasing levels of ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=639))
- stock volatility. Don’t believe it—it’s a myth. First, volatility is itself volatile. It’s normal to go through periods of higher and lower volatility. Second, it’s a fallacy to assume higher volatility spells trouble. Third—volatility in recent ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=640))
- years (as I write) isn’t all that unusual and is well within normal historical ranges. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=643))
- Standard deviation is just what it sounds like—a measure of how much something deviates from its average. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=653))
- It’s also important to remember standard deviation is inherently backward looking. It’s a useful tool but tells you ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=668))
- nothing about how volatile or unvolatile anything will be immediately ahead. It describes how stocks behaved in the past on average. Like all historical data, it’s a useful guide—it gives you a range of what’s reasonable to expect. But volatility is never a forecasting tool. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=669))
- stock market volatility is itself volatile. Some years, market volatility is vastly above average. Some years, it’s vastly below average. And some years, both happen! ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=673))
- What’s more, stocks can rise and fall on both above- and below-average volatility. There’s no predictive pattern. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=676))
- Big volatility doesn’t ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=687))
- mean stocks must fall. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=687))
- In 1998, standard deviation was 20.6%. Way above average, yet stocks were up 28.6%.6 In 2010, standard deviation was 18.4% and stocks rose 15.1%.7 In 1980, standard deviation was 17.4% and stocks boomed 32.3%. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=687))
- There is nothing ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=703))
- about any level of volatility that is predictive. Rather, standard deviation is descriptive of the past—and the past doesn’t dictate the future. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=703))
- Speculators aren’t bad. In fact—if you buy a stock, you are, in a sense, a speculator! Even if you hold it for a long period—a year or 10 or 50—when you buy a stock or sell it short, you speculate it’s ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=734))
- going to do something. There’s nothing wrong with that. But that’s not what folks usually mean when they talk about speculators—they’re typically referring to futures traders. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell something at an ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=736))
- agreed-upon price at a future date—a commodity, a stock index, interest or exchange rate, whatever. Effectively, it’s a bet on future price direction. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=738))
- When you think “futures trader” it probably doesn’t conjure an image of American Gothic—but maybe it should. But futures contracts—and those speculators—play an ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=752))
- important role in capital markets. They increase liquidity. They also increase transparency and speed price discovery—also good things. Folks often overlook the benefit of increased liquidity—but again, the mere fact there are more transactions happening can ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=754))
- actually reduce volatility. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=756))
- Remember that the next time someone says the cure to the market’s ills is banning speculators. Such a move wouldn’t necessarily reduce ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=770))
- volatility, and it may well increase it—along with reducing transparency and slowing price discovery. (Politicians cannot and will not ever understand how free markets work. I’m convinced it’s a virus that destroys part of their brains in the 12 to 24 months after being elected to ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=771))
- major office.) So thank a speculator, and don’t fear volatility. It’s not predictive, you can’t get upside volatility without the downside, and over time, upside volatility happens more often. Embrace it. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=773))
- If someone offered you a “capital preservation and growth” strategy, would you take it? Sounds pretty good. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=812))
- Who doesn’t want all the benefit of equity-like upside growth with downside capital protection? Both at the same darn time! And who doesn’t want to eat rib-eyes and ice cream sundaes every night but never gain weight? The idea you can ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=813))
- pursue capital preservation and growth at the same time as a unified goal is no different than the notion of a low-cal, fat-free, guilt-free rib-eye-and-sundae dinner. It’s a fairytale. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=816))
- First, let’s clear up common misperceptions about capital preservation. It’s a goal likely appropriate for fewer people than you think. And if you think it’s something you want (or need) long term, ask yourself why. True capital preservation means your ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=820))
- portfolio’s absolute value should never fall. And to do that—true capital preservation—you must eliminate most all volatility risk. (As discussed in Chapter 3, volatility isn’t the only risk investors must consider.) But if you eliminate volatility ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=821))
- risk, you not only avoid the times stocks are down, you avoid the 72% of all years stocks are up! Effectively, you’re limited to cash or near-cash vehicles, which means likely seeing purchasing power eroded over time by inflation. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=824))
- That’s capital preservation—the absence of volatility risk. Which means true capital preservation is rarely appropriate for investors with long ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=837))
- time horizons. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=838))
- On the other hand, ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=840))
- growth—even mild growth—requires some volatility risk. It’s the opposite of capital preservation. I can’t say it enough: Without downside volatility, there is no upside. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=840))
- Which means, as a unified goal, you simply cannot have capital preservation and growth at the same time. It would be a physical impossibility. You cannot have upside volatility with no downside volatility. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=843))
- If ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=845))
- someone tells you otherwise, they’re lying to you. Maybe unintentionally, which is bad. Maybe intentionally, which is worse! The more growth appropriate for you, the more shorter-term volatility you should expect. No way around that. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=845))
- Let me seemingly reverse myself for a moment. You can’t have capital preservation and growth as a single, combined goal. However, as a result of a long-term growth goal, you very likely will have preserved capital over the long ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=850))
- term ahead. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=852))
- Human nature hasn’t changed enough and won’t change enough in your lifetime (or your children’s or their children’s or for many millennia) to diminish the power of profit motive. As such, it’s very likely stocks continue to net superior returns over very long periods ahead. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=854))
- Which means it’s very likely, over the next 20 years, your well-diversified equity portfolio will have grown—maybe a lot. Maybe doubled two or three times or thereabouts. So you will have gotten growth and preserved your initial capital with volatility along the way. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=857))
- But that is all the result of having a growth goal. If you pursue capital preservation as a goal, after 20 years, you likely have your starting value and not much more. Which means anyone selling you capital preservation and growth as a single, ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=862))
- combined goal either doesn’t know much about finance theory or is trying to fool you. Either one is bad. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=864))
- Every now and then, some talking head will bluster that stock returns are unsustainable and must crash because they far outpace the US economy’s growth rate. It’s true! Long term, US GDP real growth has averaged about ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=874))
- 3%. But US stocks have appreciated at an annualized 10% average.1 That’s a major gap betwixt. And if you believe (as many do), over time, the two rates should roughly match, then you may fear the margin between represents some sort of phantom returns. If ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=877))
- our country’s output grows about 3% a year on average, then where the heck is that excess return coming from? Viewed that (incorrect) way, that gap is worrisome. Stocks would have to crash a long way to close that long-term annualized gap. Yikes! ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=879))
- Except stock returns and the GDP growth rate aren’t linked. They don’t match because they shouldn’t match. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=882))
- Stocks can, should and probably will continue annualizing a materially higher rate of return than GDP growth. And that makes sense, if you think about what GDP ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=883))
- GDP is an attempt to measure national output—a wonky and imperfect one at that. It’s built on surveys and assumptions and is often restated—even years later. It doesn’t measure national assets or national wealth and ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=886))

That, coupled with its uncompetitive economy, caused debt buyers to demand ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=1775))

Second, whether the dollar was up or ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B021KQK&location=1977))
