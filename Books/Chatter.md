He liked to tell me, “Ask yourself the question.” The exact question he was referring to eluded me, though on some level I understood what he was pushing me to do: Look inside yourself for answers.

- Chatter consists of the cyclical negative thoughts and emotions that turn our singular capacity for introspection into a curse rather than a blessing. It puts our performance, decision making, relationships, happiness, and health in jeopardy. We think about that screwup at work or misunderstanding with a loved one and end up flooded by how bad we feel. Then we think about it again. And again. We introspect hoping to tap into our inner coach but find our inner critic instead. The question, of course, is why. Why do people’s attempts to “go inside” and think when they experience ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=192))

I’ve spent my career examining these questions. I’ve learned that the answers hinge on changing the nature of one of the most important conversations of conscious life: the ones we have with ourselves.

- we encounter difficult emotions that call for the utmost poise. Sometimes this chatter takes the form of a rambling soliloquy; sometimes it’s a dialogue we have with ourselves. Sometimes it’s a compulsive rehashing of past events (rumination); sometimes it’s an angst-ridden imagining of future events (worry). Sometimes it’s a free-associative pinballing between negative feelings and ideas. Sometimes it’s a fixation on one specific unpleasant feeling or notion. However it manifests itself, when the inner voice runs amok and chatter takes the mental microphone, our mind not only torments but paralyzes us. It can also lead us to do things that sabotage us.

- The rest of the chapters will describe scientific techniques that can reduce our chatter—techniques that are rapidly helping us solve the puzzle of our own minds. The key to beating chatter isn’t to stop talking to yourself. The challenge is to figure out how to do so more effectively. Fortunately, both your mind and the world around you are exquisitely designed to help you do precisely that. But before we get into how to control the voice in our head, we need to answer a more basic question. Why do we have one in the first place?

- Our inner voice, it turns out, is likewise a prodigious multitasker. One of the brain’s essential tasks is powering the engine of what is known as working memory. Humans have a natural tendency to conceptualize memory in the romantic, long-term, and nostalgic sense. We think of it as the land of the past, teeming with moments, images, and sensations that will stay with us forever and constitute our life’s narrative. But then there’s the fact that every minute of the day, amid an ongoing rush of stimulation that can be quite distracting (sounds, sights, smells, and so on), we have to constantly recall details to function. That we’ll likely forget most of the information after it’s no longer useful doesn’t matter. For the brief time that information is active, we need it to function. Working memory is what allows us to participate in work discussions and have impromptu dinner conversations. Thanks to it, we’re able to remember what someone said a few seconds earlier and then incorporate it into the evolving discussion in a relevant way.

- memory is what allows us to read a menu and then order food (while also keeping up one of those conversations). It’s what allows us to write an email about something urgent but not meaningful enough to get filed away in long-term storage. In short, it’s what allows us to function as people out in the world. When it stops working or operates suboptimally, our capacity to perform even the most ordinary daily activities (like bugging your kids to brush their teeth while making them pack lunches and also thinking about what meetings you have later that day) fails. And connected to working memory is the inner voice. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=367))

- Our verbal development goes hand in hand with our emotional development. As toddlers, speaking to ourselves out loud helps us learn to control ourselves. In the early twentieth century, the Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky was one of the first people to explore the connection between language development and self-control. He was interested in the curious behavior of children who talk to themselves out loud, coaching themselves along while also doling out self-critiques. As anyone who has spent significant time around kids knows, they often have full-blown, unprompted conversations with themselves. This isn’t just play or imagination; it’s a sign of neural and emotional growth. Unlike other leading thinkers of the time who thought this behavior was a sign of unsophisticated development, Vygotsky saw language playing a critical role in how we learn to control ourselves, a theory that would later be borne out by data. He believed that the way we learn to manage our emotions begins with our relationships with our primary caretakers (typically our parents). These authorities give us instructions, and we repeat those instructions to ourselves aloud, often mimicking what they say. At first, we do this audibly. Over time, though, we come to internalize their message in silent inner speech. And then later, as we develop further, we come to use our own words to control ourselves for the rest of our lives. As we all know, this doesn’t mean ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=379))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- our verbal stream eventually develops its own unique contours that creatively direct our behavior—but these early developmental experiences influence us significantly. Vygotsky’s perspective doesn’t merely explain how we learn to use our inner voice to control ourselves; it also provides us with a way of understanding how our internal conversations are “tuned” in part by our upbringing. Decades of research on socialization indicate that our environments influence how we view the world, including how we think about self-control. In families, our parents model self-control for us when we’re children, and their approaches seep into our developing inner voices. Our father might repeatedly tell us never to use violence to resolve a conflict. Our mother might repeatedly tell us to never give up after a disappointment. Over time, we repeat these things to ourselves, and they begin to shape our own verbal streams. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=390))

- Our verbal stream plays an indispensable role in the creation of our selves. The brain constructs meaningful narratives through autobiographical reasoning. In other words, we use our minds to write the story of our lives, with us as the main character. Doing so helps us mature, figure out our values and desires, and weather change and adversity by keeping us rooted in a continuous identity. Language is integral to this process because it smooths the jagged and seemingly unconnected fragments of daily life into a cohesive through line. It helps us “storify” life. The words of the mind sculpt the past, and thus set up a narrative for us to follow into the future. By flitting back and forth between different memories, our internal monologues weave a neural narrative of recollections. It sews the past into the seams of our brain’s construction of our identity. The brain’s multitasking abilities are varied and vital, as is the inner voice. But to truly understand its profound value, we must contemplate what it would be like if our verbal thoughts were to disappear. As improbable as this may sound, we don’t have to merely imagine this scenario. In some cases, it actually happens.

- Her working memory wasn’t working, making it impossible to complete the simplest tasks. Her phonological loop, it seemed, had unraveled. Her self-talk was silenced. She was no longer a mental time traveler capable of revisiting the past and imagining the future. She felt vulnerable in a way she had never even imagined possible, as if she were spinning by herself in outer space. She wondered, wordlessly, if words would ever return in full to her mental life. Without verbal introspection, she ceased to be human in the previous sense she had ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=467))

- known. “Devoid of language and linear processing,” she wrote, “I felt disconnected from the life I had lived.” Most profoundly of all, she lost her identity. The narrative her inner voice had allowed her to construct over nearly four decades erased itself. “Those little voices inside your head,” as she put it, had made her her, but now they were silent. “So, was I really still me? How could I still be Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, when I no longer shared her life experiences, thoughts, and emotional attachments?” When I imagine what it would be like to go through what Jill Bolte Taylor experienced, it fills me with panic. Losing the ability to talk to myself, to use language to tap into my intuitions, stitch together my experiences into a coherent whole, or plan for the future, sounds much worse than a letter from a deranged stalker. Yet it’s here where her story gets stranger and even more fascinating. Bolte Taylor wasn’t frightened the way I imagine I or anyone else in her situation would feel. Remarkably, she found a comfort like nothing she had ever felt before when her lifelong internal conversation vanished. “The growing void in my traumatized brain was entirely seductive,” she later wrote. “I welcomed the reprieve that the silence brought from the constant chatter.” She had gone, as she put it, to “la-la land.” Being robbed of language and memory, on the one hand, was terrifying and lonely. On the other hand, it was ecstatically, euphorically liberating. Free from her past identity, she could also be free from all her recurring painful recollections, present stresses, and looming anxieties. Without her inner voice she was free from chatter. To her, this trade-off felt worth it. She later reflected that this was because she hadn’t learned to manage her buzzing inner world prior to her stroke. Like all of us, she had trouble controlling her emotions when she got sucked into negative spirals. Two and a half weeks after her stroke, Bolte Taylor would have surgery to remove a golf-ball-sized blood clot from her brain. It would take her eight years to fully recover. She continues to conduct research on the brain while also sharing her story with the world. She emphasizes the overwhelming sense of generosity and well-being she felt when her inner critic was muted. She is now, as she describes it, “a devout believer that paying attention to our self-talk is vitally important for our mental health.” What her experience shows us in singularly vivid terms is how deeply we struggle with our inner voice—to the point where the stream of verbal thoughts that allows us to function and think and be ourselves could lead to expansively good feelings when it’s gone. This is striking evidence of how influential our inner voice can be. Research bears out this phenomenon in less exceptional circumstances. Not only can our thoughts taint experience. They can blot out nearly everything else. A study published in 2010 drives home this point. The scientists found that… ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=471))

Time and again, people who have spent years mastering a talent watch it break down like a decrepit old Chevy when chatter hijacks their inner voice. This phenomenon isn’t restricted to athletes. It can happen to anyone who has become skilled at a learned task—from teachers who memorize their lesson plans, to start-up founders with rehearsed spiels they pitch to investors, to surgeons who perform complex operations that took them years to master. The explanation for why these skills fail ultimately relates to how the conversations we have with ourselves influence our attention.

- When you’re completing your taxes, it pays to double-check your calculations to make sure you’ve done everything right, even if you’re an experienced accountant. But for well-worn, automatic behaviors that you’re trying to execute under pressure, like pitching, this very same tendency leads us to break down the complicated scripts that we’ve learned to execute without thinking. This is exactly what our inner voice’s tendency to immerse us in a problem does. It overfocuses our attention on the parts of a behavior that only functions as the sum of its parts. The result: paralysis by analysis. Chatter ruined Ankiel’s career as a pitcher, but automatic behaviors aren’t the only kind of skill that can backfire when our inner voice betrays us. After all, one of the things that distinguishes us from every other animal species is our ability not just to execute automatic behaviors but to use our mind to consciously focus our attention. It is our ability to reason logically, solve problems, multitask, and control ourselves that allows us to manage work, family, and so many other crucial parts of our lives with wisdom, creativity, and intelligence. To do this, we have to be deliberate and attentive and flexible, which we are capable of doing thanks to what we can think of as the CEO of the human brain—our executive functions, which are also vulnerable to the incursions of an unsupportive inner voice. Our executive functions are the foundation of our ability to steer our thoughts and behavior in the ways ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=582))

- we desire. Supported largely by a network of prefrontal brain regions located behind our forehead and temples, their job is to intervene when our instinctual processes aren’t sufficient and we need to consciously guide our behavior. They allow us to keep relevant information active in our mind (working memory is a part of executive functions), filter out extraneous information, block out distractions, play with ideas, point our attention where it needs to go, and exercise self-control—like helping us resist the temptation to open a new browser tab and go down a tangential Wikipedia rabbit hole. In short, without our executive functions we wouldn’t be able to function in the world. The reason your brain needs this type of neurological leadership is that paying attention, reasoning wisely, thinking creatively, and executing tasks often require you to leave automatic mode and exercise conscious effort. And doing this asks a lot of your executive functions because they have a limited capacity. Like a computer that slows down when it has too many programs open, your executive functions perform worse as the demands placed on them increase. The classic illustration of this limited capacity, known as the magical number four, has to do with our ability to hold between three and five units of information in the mind at any given time. Take an American phone number. Memorizing the number 200-350-2765 is much easier than memorizing 2003502765. In the first instance, you’ve grouped the numbers, so you’re memorizing three pieces of information; in the latter, you’re trying to memorize an unbroken string of ten pieces of information, placing more demands on the system. Your labor-intense executive functions need every neuron they can get, but a negative inner voice hogs our neural capacity. Verbal rumination concentrates our attention narrowly on the source of our emotional distress, thus stealing neurons that could better serve us. In effect, we jam our executive functions up by attending to a “dual task”—the task of doing whatever it is we want to do and the task of listening to our pained inner voice. Neurologically, that’s how chatter divides and blurs our attention. All of us are familiar with the distractions of a negative verbal stream. Have you ever tried to read a book or complete a task requiring focus after a bad fight with someone you love? It’s next to impossible. All the resulting negative thoughts consume your executive functions because your inner critic and its ranting have taken over corporate headquarters, raiding your neuronal resources. The problem for most of us, however, is that usually we’re engaged in activities with much higher stakes than retaining information in a book. We’re doing our jobs, pursuing our dreams, interacting with others, and being evaluated. Chatter in the form of repetitive anxious thought is a marvelous saboteur when it comes to focused tasks. Countless studies reveal its debilitating effects. It leads ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=593))

One study found, for instance, that anxiety led people to make low initial offers, exit discussions early, and earn less money. This is a very nice way of saying they failed at their jobs—because of chatter. On any given day, the keel of our inner voice can be thrown askew by an infinite number of things. When this happens, we have trouble focusing our minds to address the inevitable daily challenges we face, which often produces still more turbulence in our inner dialogues. Quite naturally, when we’re floundering like this, we look for a way out of our predicament. So, what exactly do we do?

- Over the course of several studies, Rimé brought people into his laboratory and asked them whether they talked about negative experiences from their past with others. Then he turned his focus to the present and asked people to record in diaries over the course of several weeks each time they confronted an upsetting situation and whether they discussed it with members of their social networks. He also ran experiments in which he provoked participants in the lab and then watched if they shared their reactions with others nearby. Again and again, Rimé landed on the same finding: People feel compelled to talk to others about their negative experiences. But that wasn’t all.

- While this sounds normal and harmless, repeatedly sharing our negative inner voice with others produces one of the great ironies of chatter and social life: We voice the thoughts in our minds to the sympathetic listeners we know in search of their support, but doing so excessively ends up pushing away the people we need most. It’s as though the pain of chatter makes people less sensitive to the normal social cues that tell us when enough is enough. To be clear, this doesn’t mean that talking to others about your problems is harmful per se. But it highlights how chatter can transform an otherwise helpful experience into something negative.

- In other words, the more I stew over what you did to me, the more I keep those negative feelings alive, and the more likely I am to act aggressively against you as a result. Chatter also leads us to displace our aggression against people when they don’t deserve it. Our boss upsets us, for example, and we take it out on our kids. But none of this research considers our digital lives. In the age of online sharing, Rimé’s work on emotions and our social lives has acquired a new urgency. Facebook and other social media applications like it have provided us with a world-altering platform for sharing our inner voice and listening in on the inner voices of others (or at least what other people want us to think they’re thinking about). Indeed, the first thing people see when they log in to Facebook is the prompt asking them to broadcast their answer to this question: “What’s on your mind?” And broadcast we do. In 2020, close to two and a half billion people use Facebook and Twitter—almost a third of the world’s population—and they frequently do so to share their private ruminations. It’s worth highlighting that there’s nothing inherently bad about sharing on social media. In the long historical timeline of our species, it’s simply a new environment that we find ourselves spending a great deal of time in, and environments aren’t good or bad per se. Whether they help or harm us depends on how we interact with them. That said, there are two features of social media that are worrying when you consider the intense drive we have to air our stream of thoughts: empathy and time. It’s hard to overstate the importance of empathy both individually and collectively. It’s what allows us to forge meaningful connections with others, it’s one of the reasons why we so often find ourselves venting (we seek the empathy of others), and it’s also one of the mechanisms that holds communities together. It’s a capacity we evolved because it helps our species survive. Research shows that observing other people’s emotional responses—seeing someone wince or hearing a quiver in a voice—can be a potent route to triggering empathy. But online, the subtle physical gestures, micro-expressions, and vocal intonations that elicit empathic responses in daily life are absent. As a result, our brains are deprived of information that serves a critical social function: inhibiting cruelty and antisocial behavior. In other words, less empathy all too frequently leads to trolling and cyberbullying, which have grave consequences. Cyberbullying, for example, has been linked to longer episodes of depression, anxiety, and substance ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=665))

- abuse, as well as several toxic physical effects like headaches, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal ills, and changes in how well stress-response systems operate. The passage of time is likewise essential to helping us manage our emotional lives, especially when it comes to processing upsetting experiences. When we identify someone to talk to off-line, we often have to wait until we see the person or until they’re available to chat. While one waits for that person, something magical happens: Time passes, which allows us to reflect on what we’re feeling and thinking about in ways that often temper our emotions. Indeed, research supports the common idea that “time heals” or the advice to “just give it time.” Now let’s transplant ourselves to the parallel world of digital life and our ability to access it anytime thanks to our smart devices. Social media allows us to connect with others in the immediate aftermath of a negative emotional response, before time provides us with the opportunity to rethink how we’re feeling or what we’re planning to do. Thanks to twenty-first-century connectivity, during the very peak of our inner flare-ups, right when our inner voice wants to rant from the rooftops, it can. We post. We tweet. We comment. With the passage of time and physical elicitors of empathy removed, social media becomes a place amenable to the unseemly sides of the inner voice. This can lead to increased conflict, hostility, and chatter for both individuals and arguably society as a whole. It also means that we overshare more than ever before. Similar to talking for too long and too frequently to others about your problems, overly emotional posts irritate and alienate others. They violate unspoken norms, and users wish people who overshare online would look for support from friends off-line. Unsurprisingly, people with depression—which is fueled by the verbal stream—share more negative personal content on social media yet actually perceive their network as less helpful than nondepressed people do. But social media doesn’t just provide us with a platform to (over)share the thoughts and feelings streaming through our head, and the ways it derails our internal dialogues don’t exclusively relate to empathy and time. Social media also allows us to shape what we want other people to believe is happening in our lives, and our choices about what to post can fuel other people’s chatter. The human need to self-present is powerful. We craft our appearances to influence how people perceive us all the time. This has always been the case, but then along came social media to give us exponentially more control over how we do this. It allows us to skillfully curate the presentations of our lives—the proverbial photoshopped version of life, with the low points and less aesthetically pleasing moments left out. Engaging in this self-presentation exercise can make us feel better, satisfying our ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=686))

- own need to appear positively in the eyes of others and buoying our inner voice. But there’s a catch. Although posting glamour shots of our lives may lead us to feel better, that very same act can cause the users who view our posts to feel worse. That’s because at the same time that we are motivated to present ourselves positively, we are also driven to compare ourselves with others. And social media switches the social-comparison hardware in our brain into overdrive. A study my colleagues and I published in 2015 demonstrated, for example, that the more time people spent passively scrolling through Facebook, peering in on the lives of others, the more envy they experienced and the worse they subsequently felt. If broadcasting our feelings on social media and participating in its culture of self-curation have so many chatter-inducing effects, it’s reasonable to ask why we continue to share. One answer to that question has to do with the trade-off that often comes from engaging in behaviors that feel good in the moment but have negative consequences over time. Research shows that the same brain circuitry that becomes active when we are attracted to someone or consume desirable substances (everything from… ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=709))

- in other words, is like a neuronal high, a delicious hit for our dopamine receptors. The point of all this is to say that both online and off-line, when we let our chatter drive social behaviors, we frequently crash into a range of negative outcomes. The most damaging one for internal and external conversations is that, quite often, we end up finding less support. This starts a vicious cycle of social isolation, which further wounds us. In fact, if you stop and listen, you’ll notice that many people actually use the language of physical “pain” to describe how they feel when they’re rejected by others. In languages across the globe, from Inuktitut to German, Hebrew to Hungarian, Cantonese to Bhutanese, people use words related to physical injury to describe emotional pain—“damaged,” “wound,” “injured,” among many others. It turns out the reason they do so is not just that they have a knack for metaphorical expression.

In other words, we lose perspective.

- attention isn’t a problem in and of itself. To the contrary, it’s often essential to helping us address challenging situations and the feelings that arise from them. But when we find ourselves stuck on our problems and lose the ability to flexibly zoom out—to gain perspective—that’s when our inner voice turns into rumination. When our internal conversation loses perspective and gives rise to intensely negative emotions, the brain regions involved in self-referential processing (thinking about ourselves) and generating emotional responses become activated. In other words, our stress-response hardware starts firing, releasing adrenaline and cortisol, flooding us with negative emotions, which only serve to further rev up our negative verbal stream and zoom us in more. As a result, we’re unable to get a wider-angle view that might reveal more constructive ways of handling the emotionally trying situations we encounter. But our brains evolved not just to zoom in when we confront difficulties but also to zoom out, though the latter is much more challenging during times of stress. The mind is flexible, if we know how to bend it. If you have a fever, you can take something to bring it down. Likewise, our mind has a psychological immune system: We can use our thoughts to change our thoughts—by adding distance. Psychological distance, of course, doesn’t eliminate a problem. If, for instance, Tracey had been able to step back from her high-pressured predicament and settle into a less anguished state, she nonetheless would still have been in debt to the NSA, with her future hanging in the balance. Similarly, even if Rick Ankiel had been able to retain his pitch, he still would’ve been standing on the mound pitching in the playoffs on national television. Distance doesn’t solve our problems, but it increases the likelihood that we can. It unclouds our verbal stream.

- It was around 1010 b.c.e. The maternal dreams of a woman in Jerusalem, named Bathsheba, finally came true. After the loss of her first child as an infant, she now gave birth to a second child: a healthy young baby boy whom she named Solomon. As the Bible tells us, this was no ordinary baby. The son of David (of Goliath fame), Solomon grew up and went on to become king of the Jewish ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=978))

- people. A peerless leader, he was respected not only for his military might and economic acumen but also for his wisdom. People would travel from distant lands to seek his counsel. The dispute he most famously settled was between two women who both claimed to be the mother of the same child. He suggested that they cut the child in half, and when one of the women protested, he was able to identify her as the true mother. In an ironic twist of fate, however, when it came to Solomon’s own life, he wasn’t so savvy. Amorous and shortsighted, he married hundreds of women from different faiths and went to great lengths to please them, building elaborate temples and shrines so they could worship their gods. This eventually alienated him from his own God, and the people he ruled, which would finally lead to his kingdom’s demise in 930 b.c.e.

- Before we look at how distancing can lead to wisdom, it’s worth taking a moment to ask what wisdom actually is in practice. In a rigorous field like psychology, an amorphous-seeming concept like wisdom at first appears hard to define. Nonetheless, scientists have identified its salient features. Wisdom involves using the mind to reason constructively about a particular set of problems: those involving uncertainty. Wise forms of reasoning relate to seeing the “big picture” in several senses: recognizing the limits of one’s own knowledge, becoming aware of the varied contexts of life and how they may unfold over time, acknowledging other people’s viewpoints, and reconciling opposing perspectives.

- In one large-scale experiment, a group of scientists gave people a choice: do nothing and have a 10 percent chance of dying from cancer, or undergo a novel treatment that has a 5 percent chance of killing you. Obviously, the second option is better, because the risk of death is 5 percent less. And yet, consistent with prior research indicating that people often choose to do nothing rather than something when it comes to their health, 40 percent of participants chose the more life-threatening option. But—and this is a big but—when the same people were asked to make this decision for someone else, only 31 percent made the bad choice. When you frame this percentage difference in terms of the number of cancer diagnoses per year—18 million—that adds up to more than 1.5 million people who could sabotage their own best course of treatment. But this lack of wisdom, brought about by a lack of mental distance, can also influence other areas of our life.

- But the benefits of mental time travel aren’t restricted to adopting a bird’s-eye view of the past to weave together a positive story about the present. You can also benefit by mentally time traveling into the future, a tool called temporal distancing. Studies show that when people are going through a difficult experience, asking them to imagine how they’ll feel about it ten years from now, rather than tomorrow, can be another remarkably effective way of putting their experience in perspective. Doing so leads people to understand that their experiences are temporary, which provides them with hope. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1079))

- Alongside her family history project, Tracey also kept a journal as her college years progressed. This, too, became a medium for gaining distance. Although journaling has surely been around nearly as long as the written word, it is only in the past few decades that research has begun to illuminate the psychological consolation it provides. Much of this work has been pioneered by the psychologist James Pennebaker (yes, he has the word “pen” in his name). Over the course of a long and distinguished career, he has shown that simply asking people to write about their most upsetting negative experiences for fifteen to twenty minutes—to create a narrative about what happened, if you will—leads them to feel better, visit the doctor less, and have healthier immune function. By focusing on our experiences from the perspective of a narrator who has to create a story, journaling creates distance from our experience. We feel less tied to it. Tracey journaled for years, and it helped her immensely. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1094))

- The strange thing about being a psychologist, especially one who studies how to control the inner voice, is that no matter what insights your research yields, you still can’t escape being yourself. Which is to say, when I “go inside,” I can still get lost, in spite of everything I know about how to distance. There’s no other way of explaining what happened to me when I received the threatening letter from my stalker. I was aware of a variety of distancing tools to calm my chatter: adopting a fly-on-the-wall perspective, assuming a detached observer’s perspective, imagining how I’d feel in the future, writing in a journal, and so on. And yet… I was immersed. I was all chatter. I was living Solomon’s Paradox. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1111))

On the one hand, there was the uncomfortable irony that I was a psychologist who specializes in self-control and yet I had lost my self-control, never mind my rationality, albeit briefly. On the other hand, there was the scientifically intriguing observation that I had somehow regained control of my emotions and internal conversation by talking to myself as if I were another person. Normally, using one’s own name is associated with eccentricity, narcissism, or sometimes mental illness, but I didn’t identify with any of these. For me, at least in that moment of crisis, I had somehow managed to subdue my inner voice…with my inner voice. And I had done so without even meaning to.

- There was already a term for talking about oneself in the third person, “illeism,” which was frequently used to describe the literary device Julius Caesar had employed to narrate his work on the Gallic Wars, in which he had participated. He wrote about himself by using his own name and the pronoun “he” instead of the word “I.” And then there was the American historian Henry Adams’s Pulitzer Prize–winning autobiography, published in 1918, which he narrated entirely in the third person. In keeping with this stylistic approach, he didn’t title the book My Education or something similar. He called it The Education of Henry Adams.

For years my colleagues and I had been studying approaches to distancing, yet all the techniques we had uncovered required both time and concentration, whereas using one’s name to mentally speak to oneself in a moment of distress had taken neither.

- “Are you serious?” the participant in our experiment asked. “Yes,” the experimenter told him. “Follow me.” She led him down the hallway. Like the other volunteers who had come into our lab, he had known only that he was going to participate in an experiment on language and emotion. What none of the volunteers knew until they arrived for the study was the method we would be using, one of the most powerful techniques scientists have at our disposal for stressing people out in the lab: We asked them to engage in public speaking in front of an audience without giving them sufficient time to prepare. In doing so, we hoped to gain a better understanding of how silently referring to ourselves using our own names (and other non-first-person pronouns like “you”) might help people control an inner voice agitated by circumstances like the ones we had concocted. When they arrived, we told the volunteers that they would have to deliver a five-minute speech to a group on why they were qualified to land their dream job. Then we escorted them into a small windowless room, where they had five minutes to prepare their presentations without being able to take any notes. Our idea was that if we asked some participants to use non-first-person language while thinking to themselves before the speech, they would have more mental distance, which would help them manage their nerves. Our theory wasn’t based only on my experience or the words of Malala, LeBron James, and others. Previous research had indicated that a high usage of first-person-singular pronouns, a phenomenon called I-talk, is a reliable marker of negative emotion. For example, one large study performed in six labs across two countries with close to five thousand participants revealed a robust positive link between I-talk and negative emotion. Another study showed that you can predict future occurrences of depression in people’s medical records by computing the amount of I-talk in their Facebook posts. All of which is to say, talking to oneself using first-person-singular pronouns like “I,” “me,” and “my” can be a form of linguistic immersion. A natural question arose: What would happen if you not only reduced a person’s tendency to think about themselves in the first person but actually had them refer to themselves as if they were interacting with someone else? Our idea was that using your own name, while also employing the second and third person, created emotional distance because it makes you feel as if ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1189))

- you were talking to another person when you’re talking to yourself. For example, rather than thinking to oneself, Why did I blow up at my co-worker today? a person could think, Why did Ethan blow up at his co-worker today? After the five-minute speech preparation period was over, we randomly divided the participants into two groups: one in which they reflected on their anxieties surrounding their upcoming speech using the first-person pronoun “I”; and the other in which they did the same but only using non-first-person pronouns and their own name. After they were done, we took them down the hall to deliver their presentations in front of a panel of judges who were trained to maintain stoic facial expressions and a large video camera that was distractingly positioned right in front of them. It was showtime. As we predicted, participants who used distanced self-talk reported that they experienced less shame and embarrassment after giving their speech compared with participants who used immersed self-talk. They also ruminated less about their performance afterward. In their descriptions of their mental experiences, instead of highlighting their nervousness or the difficulty of the task, they said that their… ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1208))

- people in the distanced self-talk group performed better on the task as well. We had uncovered a novel distancing tool hidden in the mind: distanced self-talk. As our experiments and others later demonstrated, shifting from the first-person “I” to the second-person “you” or third-person “he” or “she” provides a mechanism for gaining emotional distance. Distanced self-talk, then, is a psychological hack embedded in the fabric of human language. And we now know that its benefits are diverse. Other experiments have shown that distanced self-talk allows people to make better first impressions, improves performance on stressful problem-solving tasks, and facilitates wise reasoning, just as fly-on-the-wall distancing strategies do. It also promotes rational thinking. For instance, during the height of the 2014 Ebola crisis, some people were terrified about contagion in the United States. So we ran a study over the internet with people across the United States. We found that people who were anxious about Ebola and were asked to switch away from using “I” to using their own names to reflect on how the Ebola scare would play out in the future found… ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1220))

- I found most interesting about saying my own name to calm myself down was how remarkably easy it was. Normally, it takes time to regulate our emotions. Just think of the effort involved in mentally traveling through time to imagine how you’ll feel differently about something in the future, or writing a journal entry to contemplate your thoughts and feelings, or even closing your eyes to picture a past experience from a fly-on-the-wall perspective. These are all empirically validated self-distancing tools. Yet, because of the effort they require, they’re not always easy to implement in the heat of the moment. Now think about my experience. All I did was say my name, and it put my inner voice on a totally different trajectory, almost like switching the direction a train goes when it comes to a Y-juncture. Distanced self-talk appeared to be quick and powerful, unlike so many other emotion-regulation strategies. How could that be? In linguistics, “shifters” refer to words, like personal pronouns (such as “I” and “you”), whose meaning changes depending on who is speaking. For example, if Dani asks, “Can you pass me the ketchup?” and Maya answers, “Sure, here you go,” the person that “you” addresses changes. It refers to Maya initially but then Dani. Most children figure out that language works this way by the time they are two years old and can switch perspectives in this way incredibly fast, within milliseconds. The concept of shifters demonstrates how powerful certain words can be for switching our perspectives.

- I have the personal resources to cope with what’s required? If we scan the situation and conclude that we don’t have the wherewithal needed to handle things, that leads us to appraise the stress as a threat. If, on the other hand, we appraise the situation and determine that we have what it takes to respond adequately, then we think of it as a challenge. Which way we choose to talk about the predicament to ourselves makes all the difference for our inner voice. And unsurprisingly, the more constructive framing of a challenge leads to more positive results. In Mr. Rogers’s case, it allowed him to acknowledge the difficulty of creation, and then keep creating. Several studies back up what Mr. Rogers’s letter embodies. From taking math exams to performing in pressure-filled situations to coping with the toxic effects of stereotyping, people think, feel, and perform better when they frame the stressor at hand as a challenge rather than a threat. But as Mr. Rogers’s use of his own name to motivate himself suggests, distanced self-talk can be the pivotal shove that sends you down the path of the challenge mindset. Research shows that distanced self-talk leads people to consider stressful situations in more challenge-oriented terms, allowing them to provide encouraging, “you can do it” advice to themselves, rather than catastrophizing the situation.

- The first thing we know about the universal “you” is that people use it to talk about norms that apply to everyone, not personal preferences. For instance, if a child holds up a pencil and asks, “What do you do with this?” an adult will typically respond, “You write with it” (not “I write with it”). In contrast, if that same child holds up a pencil and asks, “What do you like to do with this?” an adult will typically respond in a personal first-person fashion, saying, “I write with it.” In other words, the generic usage of the word “you” allows us to talk about how things function generally, not our specific idiosyncratic proclivities.

- or think about the lessons they could learn from the event. Participants were almost five times more likely to use the universal “you” when they were trying to learn from their negative experience than when they simply rehashed what happened. It connected their personal adversity more generally to how the world works. Participants who were asked to learn from their experience wrote statements like “When you take a step back and cool off, sometimes we see things from a different perspective,” and “You can actually learn a lot from others who see things differently than you.” These kinds of normalizations provide us with the perspective we lack when mired in chatter. They help us learn lessons from our experiences that contribute to us feeling better. In other words, our use of the universal “you” in speech isn’t arbitrary. It’s one more emotion-management gadget that human language provides. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1383))

- Two weeks after the shootings, roughly three-quarters of the students in the two samples displayed symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress. This was to be expected. Most of them were grappling with the most disturbing experience of their lives. Tragedies of the sort that the students had gone through in both Illinois and Virginia challenge a person’s worldview. When that happens, some people try to avoid focusing on their traumatic memories to blunt the pain. But others actively try to make sense of their feelings, and a principal way of doing so is by communicating with others, which is what the students did. Eighty-nine percent of them joined a Facebook group to talk and read about what happened. Seventy-eight percent, meanwhile, chatted online about it, and 74 percent texted about it using their cellphones. Most of the students found this way of releasing their chatter comforting. It allowed them to express their thoughts and feelings with others who were dealing with a similar experience, which can be a valuable form of normalization. As one Virginia Tech student said, “When I have a bout of loneliness, I can log on to Facebook or send someone an IM and I’ll feel just a little more connected to people.” ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1421))

- None of this was particularly surprising. As we already know, people are naturally disposed to sharing their thoughts with others when they are struggling with chatter, and social media and other forms of virtual connectivity provide convenient avenues for doing so. What was surprising was what Vicary and Fraley discovered when the study ended two months after the shootings. While the students at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University thought that expressing their emotions to others made them feel better, the degree to which they shared their emotions didn’t actually influence their depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. All that emoting, writing, connecting, and remembering—it hadn’t been beneficial. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1430))

- The people who shared their thoughts and feelings about 9/11 right after it happened didn’t feel better. In fact, on the whole, they fared worse than the people in the study who didn’t open up about how they felt. They experienced more chatter and engaged in more avoidant coping. Moreover, among those who did choose to express their feelings, the people who shared the most had the highest levels of general distress and worst physical health. Once again, sharing emotions didn’t help. In this case, it hurt. Of course, both the college shootings and 9/11 were rare acts of extraordinary violence, which might lead you to think that sharing emotions with others is only unhelpful in the wake of tragic events. That brings us back to the work of the Belgian psychologist Bernard Rimé. Recall the fundamental pattern in human behavior that Rimé uncovered. When people are upset, they are strongly driven to share their feelings with others; emotions act like jet fuel that propels us to talk to other people about the thoughts and feelings streaming through our heads. But alongside this discovery, he uncovered something equally important—and certainly ([Location 1443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1443))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- more surprising—which confirms that these studies on the emotional fallout of major tragedies aren’t isolated cases. In study after study, Rimé found that talking to others about our negative experiences doesn’t help us recover in any meaningful way. Sure, sharing our emotions with others makes us feel closer to and more supported by the people we open up to. But the ways most of us commonly talk and listen to each other do little to reduce our chatter. Quite frequently, they exacerbate it. Rimé’s finding, along with many others, clashes dramatically with conventional wisdom. Talking, we are often told by popular culture, makes you feel better. Much self-help literature tells us this, as do many of the people around us. We hear that venting our emotions is healthy and supporting others is indispensable. It’s not that simple, though there are reasons it might seem that it is. The idea that talking about negative emotions with others is good for us isn’t a recent development. It has been a part of Western culture for more than two thousand years. One of the earliest proponents of this approach was Aristotle, who suggested that people need to purge themselves of their emotions after watching a tragic event, a process he called catharsis. But this practice didn’t really gain traction more broadly until two millennia later. As modern psychology was bursting to life in Europe in the late 1890s, Sigmund Freud and his mentor Josef Breuer picked up Aristotle’s thread and argued that the path to a sound mind required people to bring the ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1452))

- dark pain of their inner lives into the light. You can think of this as the hydraulic model of emotion: Strong feelings need to be released like the steam escaping from a boiling kettle. While these cultural trappings urge us from a young age to talk to others about our feelings, the underlying drive to air our inner voice is actually implanted in our minds at an even earlier stage of our development—when we are drooling, screaming babies. As newborns, helpless to care for ourselves or manage our emotions, we signal our distress to our caretakers, usually by wailing like little banshees (or at least my daughters did). After we get our needs met and the feeling of threat passes, our physiological arousal levels return to normal. Engaging in this process establishes an attachment to the caretaker, who often talks to the baby even before the infant can understand words. Over time, our rapidly developing brains acquire language and soak up what our caregivers tell us about cause and effect, how to remedy our problems and deal with our emotions. This not only provides us with useful information for managing how we feel; it also provides us with the storytelling tools we need to talk to others about our… ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1464))

- minds are bathed in chatter, we display a strong bias toward satisfying our emotional needs over our cognitive ones. In other words, when we’re upset, we tend to overfocus on receiving empathy rather than finding practical solutions. This dilemma is compounded by a commensurate problem on the helper side of the equation: The people we seek out for help respond in kind, prioritizing our emotional needs over our cognitive ones. They see our pain and first and foremost strive to provide us with love and validation. This is natural, a gesture of caring, and sometimes even useful in the short term. But even if we do signal that we want more cognitive assistance, research demonstrates that our interlocutors tend to miss these cues. One set of experiments demonstrated that even when support providers are explicitly asked to provide advice to address cognitive needs, they still believe it is more important to address people’s emotional needs. And it turns out that our attempts to satisfy those emotional needs often end up backfiring in ways that lead our friends to feel worse. Here’s how talking goes wrong. To demonstrate that they are there to offer emotional support, people are usually motivated to find out exactly what happened to upset us—the who-what-when-where-why of the problem. They ask us to relate what we felt and tell them in detail what occurred. And though they may nod and communicate empathy when we narrate what happened, this commonly results in ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1497))

- leading us to relive the very feelings and experiences that have driven us to seek out support in the first place, a phenomenon called co-rumination. Co-rumination is the crucial juncture where support subtly becomes egging on. People who care about us prompt us to talk more about our negative experience, which leads us to become more upset, which then leads them to ask still more questions. A vicious cycle ensues, one that is all too easy to get sucked into, especially because it is driven by good intentions. In practice, co-rumination amounts to tossing fresh logs onto the fire of an already flaming inner voice. The rehashing of the narrative revives the unpleasantness and keeps us brooding. While we feel more connected and supported by those who engage us this way, it doesn’t help us generate a plan or creatively reframe the problem at hand. Instead, it fuels our negative emotions and biological threat response. Harmful co-ruminative dynamics emerge out of otherwise healthy, supportive relationships because our emotional, inner-voice mechanics aren’t actually like a hydraulic system, as Freud and Aristotle and conventional wisdom suggest.

- and so on. These dominoes continue to hit one another in a game where there is a potentially infinite supply of tiles. That is because our memories of emotional experiences are governed by principles of associationism, which means that related concepts are linked together in our mind. To illustrate this idea, take a moment to imagine a cat. When you read the word “cat,” you probably thought of cats you have known or seen, or actually pictured them in your mind. But you also had thoughts and images of purring sounds, soft fur, and, if you’re allergic like me, bouts of sneezing. Now take this associative neural dominoing and apply it to the realm of talking about our emotions. It means that when our friends and loved ones ask us to recount our troubles in detail, related negative thoughts, beliefs, and experiences also spring to mind, which reactivate how bad we feel. The associative nature of memory, combined with the bias we have to prioritize emotional needs over cognitive ones when we’re upset, is why talking often fails to lift our troubled internal dialogues into a more tranquil state.

- Our discussion of whom we go to for support and how they verbally engage us when we’re dealing with chatter raises a question about therapy and its effectiveness, because it obviously involves lots of talking. Does the talking cure, as it is sometimes called, truly cure? The first thing to keep in mind is that there are countless forms of talk therapy and they often differ drastically in approach. Many empirically validated forms of therapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy employ precisely the kinds of techniques we’ve been talking about throughout this chapter; they provide clients with emotional support while also crucially helping them engage in cognitive problem solving. Yet some interventions continue to focus on in-depth emotional venting as a tool for mitigating chatter. Case in point: psychological debriefing, an approach that emphasizes the value of emotional unburdening in the immediate aftermath of negative experiences despite overwhelming evidence arguing against its benefits. The take-home point is that if you find yourself needing more than a conversation with a friend or loved one to deal with your chatter, given what you now know, have a conversation with your prospective mental-health providers to learn about their approach and find out whether it is empirically supported.

- The study revealed that helping without the recipient being aware of it, a phenomenon called “invisible support,” was the formula for supporting others while not making them feel bad about lacking the resources to cope on their own. As a result of receiving indirect assistance, the participants felt less depressed. In practice, this could be any form of surreptitious practical support, like taking care of housework without being asked or creating more quiet space for the person to work. Or it can involve skillfully providing people with perspective-broadening advice without their realizing that it is explicitly directed to them. For example, asking someone else for input that has implications for your friend or loved one in the presence of the person who needs it (a kind of invisible advice) or normalizing the experience by talking about how other people have dealt with similar experiences. Doing these things transmits needed information and support, but without shining a spotlight on the vulnerable person’s seeming shortcomings. Since Bolger’s first experiment pioneered this domain, other research has converged to validate the effectiveness of invisible support. A study on marriages, for example, found that partners felt more satisfaction about ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1624))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- their relationships the day after receiving invisible support. Another experiment found that people were more successful in meeting their self-improvement goals if the support they received from their partner toward those goals was delivered under the radar. Further research has yielded insights into the circumstances in which such invisible support is most effective: when people are under evaluation or preparing to be. For example, when they’re studying for exams, preparing for interviews, or rehearsing the talking points of a presentation. During such times people feel most vulnerable. In contrast, when people want to manage their chatter as quickly and efficiently as possible, it’s not necessary to be subtle or crafty in how you support. In this case, direct advice that blends Kirk and Spock is most needed, appropriate, and likely to succeed. Along with the forms of invisible support we’ve discussed, there is one other pathway for subtly aiding people we are very close to who find themselves submerged in chatter, and it’s completely nonverbal: affectionate touch. Touch is actually one of the most basic tools that we use to help those we care most about turn a negative internal dialogue around. Like language, it is inseparable from our ability to manage our emotions from infancy onward, because our caregivers use affectionate physical contact to calm us from the moment we leave the womb.

- welcome, affectionate touch or embrace of those they are close to, they often interpret that as a sign that they are safe, loved, and supported. Caring physical contact from people we know and trust lowers our biological threat response, improves our ability to deal with stress, promotes relationship satisfaction, and reduces feelings of loneliness. It also activates the brain’s reward circuitry and triggers the release of stress-relieving neurochemicals such as oxytocin and endorphins. Affectionate touch is so potent, in fact, that one set of studies found that a mere one second of contact on the shoulder led people with low self-esteem to be less anxious about death and feel more connected with others. More striking still, even the touch of just a comforting inanimate object, like a teddy bear, can be beneficial. This is most likely a result of the brain coding contact with a stuffed animal similar to how it codes interpersonal touch. Indeed, many scientists consider the skin a social organ. In this sense, our contact with others is part of an ongoing nonverbal conversation that can benefit our emotions.

In other words, their behavior was more positive; their thinking was calmer and more challenge oriented.

- In the 1970s, Stephen and Rachel Kaplan, both psychologists at the University of Michigan, had begun to advance an intriguing idea: that nature could act like a battery of sorts, recharging the limited attentional reserves that the human brain possesses. They called it attention restoration theory. Sure, most people knew that a painterly sunset, mountain view, walk in the woods, or day at the beach usually left a person feeling good, but was there more to it? The Kaplans thought that there was because of a distinction related to human attention that William James, one of the founders of modern-day psychology in the United States, put forth more than a hundred years ago. James separated the ways we paid attention into two categories: involuntary and voluntary. When we involuntarily pay attention to something, it’s because the object of our attention has an inherently intriguing quality that effortlessly draws us to it. In a real-life scenario, you can imagine, say, a talented musician playing on a street corner while you’re walking around a city, and you feel yourself notice the sound and gravitate toward it to stop and listen for a few minutes (and then maybe toss some money into the instrument case before you keep walking). Your attention has been gently reeled in by a process the Kaplans called “soft fascination.” ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1731))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Voluntary attention, in contrast, is all about our will. It captures the amazing capacity that we human beings have to shine our attentional spotlight on whatever we want—like a difficult math problem or dilemma we’re trying to stop ruminating on. As a result, voluntary attention is easily exhausted and needs continual recharging, while involuntary attention doesn’t burn as much of our brain’s limited resources. The Kaplans believed that nature draws our involuntary attention because it is rife with soft fascinations: subtly stimulating properties that our mind is pulled to unconsciously. The natural world delicately captures our attention with artifacts such as big trees, intricate plants, and small animals. We may glance at these things, and approach them for greater appreciation like that musician playing on the corner, but we’re not carefully focusing on them as we would if we were memorizing talking points for a speech or driving in city traffic. Activities like those drain our executive-function batteries, whereas effortlessly absorbing nature does the opposite: It allows the neural resources that guide our voluntary attention to recharge.

- Nature’s impact on human feelings made sense given how critical the ability to maintain our attention is for helping people manage their inner voice. After all, many of the distancing techniques we’ve examined rely on focusing the mind; it’s hard to keep a journal, “time travel,” or adopt a fly-on-the-wall perspective if you can’t concentrate. Moreover, the ability to divert our internal conversations away from things that are bothering us, or reframe how we’re thinking about stressful situations, likewise requires that our executive functions not be running on empty. But Ming and other scientists never tested the idea that nature could reduce rumination directly. This occurred in 2015 at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

- Thankfully, the answer is no. You don’t need to be surrounded by nature to “green” your mind. Recall that the underlying idea in the Kaplans’ attention restoration theory is that the subtle perceptual features of nature act as a battery of sorts for the brain. Well, the visual characteristics that create this pleasing soft fascination don’t just have this effect when you’re physically close to nature. Secondhand exposure to the natural world through photos and videos also restores attentional resources. This means that you can bring nature and its sundry benefits into your urban environment—or any environment, for that matter—by glancing at photos or videos of natural scenes. Virtual nature is, incredibly, still nature as far as the human mind is concerned. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1782))

- While the bulk of the research done on the psychological benefits of nature focuses on visual exposure, there’s no reason to think that our other senses don’t also provide pathways for these startling effects. In 2019, a study found that exposing people to natural sounds, such as rainfall and crickets chirping, improved performance on an attentional task. Such sonic forms of nature may also constitute a soft fascination. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that nature provides humans with a tool for caring for our inner voice from the outside in, and the longer we’re exposed to nature, the more our health improves. It offers us a playbook for structuring our environments to reduce chatter. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1792))

- When you’re in the presence of something vast and indescribable, it’s hard to maintain the view that you—and the voice in your head—are the center of the world. This changes the synaptic flow of your thoughts in similar ways as other distancing techniques we’ve examined. In the case of awe, however, you don’t have to focus your mind on a visual exercise or on reframing an upsetting experience. In this sense, it’s similar to saying your own name: You just have the experience, whatever it happens to be, and relief follows. When you feel smaller in the midst of awe-inspiring sights—a phenomenon described as a “shrinking of the self”—so do your problems.

- There is an important caveat to consider when thinking about the role that awe plays in our emotional lives. While the bulk of research links it with positive outcomes, scientists have shown that a subset of awe-inducing experiences can trigger negative feelings. Let’s call these encounters “awful” in the negative sense: the sight of a tornado, a terrorist attack, or believing in a wrathful God. (Research shows that approximately 80 percent of awe-related incidents are uplifting and 20 percent aren’t.) These kinds of experiences are considered awe inspiring in the sense that they, like a majestic sunset, are so vast and complex that we can’t easily explain them. The difference is that people perceive them as threatening.

- into the awe equation, that can, perhaps not surprisingly, turn thoughts into chatter. The operative power of awe is its ability to make us feel smaller, nudging us to cede control of our inner voice to a greater grandeur. But there is another lever that our physical environments can pull to improve our internal dialogues that is the opposite of giving in to life’s wild vastness—a lever that doesn’t help us cede control but rather helps us regain it.

- Although you might think that competing against world-class athletes and making sure you don’t pull a muscle are the most essential parts of professional tennis, that’s not true for Nadal, one of the greatest players in history. “What I battle hardest to do in a tennis match,” he says, “is to quiet the voices in my head.” And his quirky customs on the court, which many of his fans find amusing but strange, provide him with a perfectly reasonable method of doing so. By always placing his ID faceup, carefully arranging his water bottles so they are perfectly aligned in front of his bench, and making sure that his hair is just right before a serve, Nadal is engaging in a process called compensatory control; he’s creating order in his physical environment to provide him with the order he seeks internally. As he puts it, “It’s a way of placing myself in a match, ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.” This tendency to structure elements in our environment as a buffer against chatter goes beyond contexts in which our performance is being evaluated. It extends to any of the spaces that we occupy. As a result, humans infuse order into their external surroundings—and by extension their minds—in a variety of ways. Some are very similar to Rafael Nadal’s. This might explain the global influence of Marie Kondo and her 2014 best-selling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Her philosophy of decluttering our homes by only retaining objects that give us joy is a strategy for influencing how we feel by imposing order on the environment. But how does the ordering of our surroundings influence what’s happening inside our minds? To answer this question, it’s crucial to understand the pivotal role that perceptions of control—the belief that we possess the ability to impact the world in the ways we desire—play in our lives. The desire to have control over oneself is a strong human drive. Believing that we have the ability to control our fate influences whether we try to achieve goals, how much effort we exert to do so, and how long we persist when we encounter challenges. Given all this, it is not surprising that increasing people’s sense of control has been linked to benefits that span the gamut from improved physical health and emotional well-being, to heightened performance at school and work, to more satisfying interpersonal relationships. Conversely, feeling out of control often causes our chatter to spike and propels us to try to regain it. Which is where turning to our physical environments becomes relevant.

- What scientists have discovered, however, is that just like Nadal we can simulate a sense of order in the world—and by extension in our own minds—by organizing our surroundings and making sure that our physical environments conform to a particular, controllable structure. The fascinating thing about seeking compensation for chaos in one area (that is, our minds) by creating order in another (that is, the physical environment) is that it doesn’t even have to have anything to do with the specific issue that is throwing off our inner voice. This is why imposing order on our environments is so useful; it’s almost always easy to do. And the value of ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1926))

- engaging in this practice is impressive. For instance, one experiment demonstrated that just reading about the world described as an orderly place reduced anxiety. Unsurprisingly, research indicates that people who live in more disadvantaged neighborhoods—such as the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, and likely the areas of Iraq where Suzanne Bott worked—experience more depression, in part because of disorder they perceive in their surroundings. In contemporary culture, many people view overly frequent attempts to order one’s environment as a sign of pathology. Consider, for example, a subset of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder who are strongly motivated to arrange things so they are orderly. What this research on compensatory control suggests is that these people may simply be taking the strong desire people have to establish order in their surroundings—in order to gain a sense of control—to an extreme. There is logic to what they do, even if restraint is lacking. What makes OCD harmful—a psychological disorder—is that the need that people with this condition display for order in the environment is excessive and interferes with their normal daily functioning. As a parallel case, our need for order can also get out of control in our larger social surroundings. Just look at the recent proliferation of conspiracy theories online, in which the chaos and upheaval of events are attributed to the shadowy (and orderly) plan of diabolical forces. In this case, people are grasping for order through a narrative mechanism, ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=1930))

- but often to the detriment of others (the conspiracies are, after all, usually false and based on an absence of evidence). What research on our need for order and the benefits of nature and awe makes clear is how closely intertwined our physical environments are with our minds. They’re part of the same tapestry. We’re embedded in our physical spaces, and different features of these spaces activate psychological forces inside us, which affect how we think and feel. Now we know not only why we are drawn to different features of our environment but also how we can make proactive choices to increase the benefits we derive from them.

The methods at our disposal are often so strange, and their effects so strong, that they almost seem like magic.

- While Mesmer was indeed peddling a force that didn’t exist, more than two hundred years later we now know that he provided the world with a valuable peek into a unique tool for combating chatter, which scientific research has only recently caught up to: the magical-seeming power of what we believe, and the profound implications it has for our minds and bodies.

- Study after study demonstrates that simply believing that a placebo—a charmed object, healing human presence (like a shaman or trusted physician), or special environment—is going to make us feel better actually does. For example, fewer stomach cramps for irritable bowel syndrome patients, less frequent headache attacks for migraine sufferers, and improved respiratory symptoms for asthmatics. Though the amount of relief that placebos provide varies notably across diseases and patients—like Mesmer’s patients, some people are more naturally sensitive to placebos than others—in some cases it can be substantial.

- The wide-ranging effects of placebos raise the question of why they work so miraculously. As it turns out, the explanation isn’t miraculous at all.

- You walk. You move. You speak. Now think for a second about how you are able to engage in these actions. How do you determine where to put your foot when you walk, where to run to catch a ball, or how to project your voice when you’re speaking to a large group? We are able to do these things because we are constantly, both consciously and subconsciously, making predictions about what we expect is going to happen next, and our brain prepares to respond accordingly. The brain is a prediction machine that is constantly trying to help us navigate the world. The more we are able to bring our prior experiences to bear on what is required of us, the better we should be at this. And this isn’t just relevant to our behaviors. It generalizes to our internal experiences in our bodies as well, which is where placebos come into play. They are a hack for harnessing the power of expectations to influence our minds and physical health. When a doctor tells you that you’ll feel better, this provides you with information you can use to predict how you’re actually going to fare over time, especially if she has fancy medical degrees, wears a white coat, and talks with authority. That’s not a joke. Research shows that features that you might think are peripheral—if a physician wears a lab coat or not, whether she has acronyms attached to her name placards, and even whether the pills you take are referred to as “brand-labeled” or generic—subconsciously strengthen our beliefs.

- Over the course of our lives, we develop automatic beliefs about how certain objects and people influence our health. Like Pavlov’s salivating dogs, we see a pill and we reflexively expect that consuming it will lead us to feel better, often without even knowing what it is or how it works. This pathway for expectations, and by extension placebos, is preconscious. It’s not a product of careful thought but rather an automatic, reflexive response. Perhaps unsurprisingly, studies show that rodents and other animals respond to placebos via this same automatic channel. This type of response is adaptive. It provides us with very good guesses about how to react quickly and effectively across a variety of situations. Yet we also evolved an additional pathway in the brain that guides our responses: our conscious thought. When my head aches and I take a painkiller, I remind myself that swallowing the pill will make me feel better. This simple awareness provides my brain with something invaluable: It helps silence all the doubts I may have about whether the headache will ever go away. What if nothing will help? I say to myself. This hurts so bad. What can I do? Taking the pill offers me hope that my discomfort is going to diminish and in doing so shifts my internal conversation. Indeed, research indicates that these conscious appraisals draw on the same default system in the brain where our inner voice makes its home.

- In a simpler sense, what’s going on is that I have a belief. This belief shapes my expectations, which in turn makes me feel better.

- Because our beliefs pertain to so many different kinds of emotions, physiological responses, and experiences, there is no single neural pathway that creates the placebo effect. For instance, while believing that you’ll feel less pain is linked with lower levels of activation in pain circuitry in the brain and spinal cord, thinking that you’re drinking an expensive wine can increase activation in the brain’s pleasure circuitry. Believing you’re consuming a fatty (versus healthy) milk shake even leads to lower levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin. In effect, once you believe something, your neural machinery brings… ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=2113))

- If placebos are fundamentally about changing beliefs, then what if we could identify other ways of altering people’s expectations that don’t involve lying? Information from trusted sources is a potent persuasive device. If I want to convince you of something that you’re skeptical of, facts and science often help. Ted Kaptchuk and his team at Harvard capitalized on this idea in 2010 when they published a study that shattered how the scientific world thought about placebos. First, they settled on a common illness that had already been shown to respond well to placebos: irritable bowel syndrome. After Kaptchuk and his colleagues brought participants with IBS into the medical center where they were performing their study, they explained to them what placebos are and how and why they work. In theory, just learning about the placebo pill should have changed the participants’ expectations, which in turn should have spurred their IBS symptoms to wane. And that’s exactly what happened. Over the course of the twenty-one-day experiment, the participants who were educated about the science behind ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=2128))

- Many of our beliefs are transmitted by the culture we come from, such as the expectations we have about doctors and lucky charms and all sorts of other superstitious influences in our environments. In this sense, the families, communities, religions, and other forms of culture that shape us also provide us with tools for dealing with chatter. Yet beliefs aren’t the only “magical” tool that our cultures pass down to us. They offer another approach too: rituals.

- They were engaging in ritual—another tool for mitigating chatter. When people are filled with grief, religious institutions prescribe mourning rites to engage in, such as ritual bathing, burying the dead, and having funerals or memorial services. When cadets attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point experience stress before an exam, they are told that dressing up in their uniform and walking across campus to spin the spurs on the back of a bronze statue of a Civil War general named John Sedgwick will improve their exam performance. We see rituals increasingly finding their ways into the business world as well. When Southwest Airlines rebranded in 2014 with a new heart-shaped logo on the sides of its planes, pilots began touching it as they stepped on board, and this spread throughout the company, presumably as a source of comfort when facing the daily, inescapable risks of flight.

- To cite another example, for thirty-three years Steve Jobs would look at himself in the mirror each morning and ask himself if that day was the last day of his life whether he’d be happy with what he was going to do. Idiosyncratic rituals of this sort are by no means restricted to famous people. In one study, the Harvard organizational psychologists Michael Norton and Francesca Gino found that the majority of rituals people performed after experiencing a significant loss, such as the death of a loved one or the end of a romantic relationship, were unique. Regardless of whether the rituals we engage in are personalized or collective, research indicates that when many people experience chatter, they naturally turn to this seemingly magical form of behavior and it offers relief for the inner voice.

One memorable experiment had participants sing the band Journey’s epic song “Don’t Stop Believin’ ” in front of another person.

- It’s important to point out that rituals aren’t simply habits or routines. Several features distinguish them from the more prosaic customs that fill our lives. First, they tend to consist of a rigid sequence of behaviors often performed in the same order. That’s different from a habit or routine, in which case the sequence of steps composing those behaviors can be looser or frequently change. Take one of my daily routines as an example. When I wake up every morning, I do three things: I pop a thyroid pill (my gland is just a teeny bit underactive), brush my teeth, and drink a cup of tea. While my physician would prefer I take my medication first (it metabolizes better on an empty stomach), that doesn’t always happen. Some days the tea comes first. On others, I’ll brush as soon as I wake up. And that’s okay. I don’t feel compelled to repeat the sequence of behaviors if I don’t do them in a particular order, and I know that their order won’t have a significant effect on me for good or ill.

- Rituals are infused with meaning. They are charged with significance because they have a crucial underlying purpose, whether it’s putting a small rock on a cemetery headstone to honor the dead, engaging in a rain dance to nourish crops, or taking Communion. Rituals take on a greater meaning in part because they help us transcend our own concerns, connecting us with forces larger than ourselves. They simultaneously serve to broaden our perspective and enhance our sense of connection with other people and forces. The reason rituals are so effective at helping us manage our inner voices is that they’re a chatter-reducing cocktail that influences us through several avenues. For one, they direct our attention away from what’s bothering us; the demands they place on working memory to carry out the tasks of the ritual leave little room for anxiety and negative manifestations of the inner voice. This might explain why pregame rituals abound in sports, providing a distraction at the most anxiety-filled moment. Many rituals also provide us with a sense of order, because we perform behaviors we can control. For example, we can’t control what will happen to our children throughout their lives, and we can protect them only to a limited degree, which is a source of chatter for many parents. But when they are born, we can baptize them or ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=2211))

- perform any other of a variety of birth rituals that provide us with an illusion of control. Because rituals are infused with meaning, and often connect to purposes or powers that transcend our individual concerns, they also make us feel connected to important values and communities, which fulfill our emotional needs and serve as a hedge against isolation. This symbolic feature of rituals also often furnishes us with awe, which broadens our perspective in ways that minimize how preoccupied we are with our concerns. Of course, rituals also frequently activate the placebo mechanism: If we believe they will aid us, then they do.

- This organic emergence of rituals is seemingly a product of the brain’s remarkable ability to monitor whether we are achieving our desired goals—for our purposes, the goal of avoiding an inner voice that turns painfully negative. According to many influential theories, your brain is set up like a thermostat to detect when discrepancies emerge between your current and your desired end states. When a discrepancy is registered, that signals us to act to bring the temperature down. And engaging in rituals is one way that people can do this. I should stress that we don’t have to wait to be subconsciously prompted to engage in rituals when we experience chatter. We can engage in them deliberately as well, as I now do whenever I’m feeling stuck at work (my kitchen and home office have never been so clean). There are multiple ways to do so. One approach involves creating our own rituals to engage in before or after a stress-inducing event or to help us deal with chatter. Experiments show that cuing people to engage in completely arbitrary acts that are nevertheless rigid in structure has benefits. For instance, in the karaoke study in which participants had to sing Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’,” they were asked to draw a picture of their feelings, sprinkle salt on it, count to five aloud, then ball up the paper and toss it in the trash. This mere onetime reliance on a ritual improved their performance. Rituals that we see people engage in in lab settings, however, are stripped of their cultural meaning, which we know has additional benefits because it provides a sense of awe, social connection, and feelings of transcendence. With this in mind, another ready avenue for taking advantage of rituals when facing chatter is to lean on those transmitted by our cultures—our families, workplaces, and the broader social institutions we belong to. You might draw on your religion and go to a service, or even the quirky but meaningful rituals of your family. For instance, I make waffles for my kids every Sunday morning after I get back from working out at the gym. It doesn’t matter where rituals come from or how exactly they form; they just help.

- As soon as class began, Arielle had shot her hand up, urging me to call on her first. I obliged, but I didn’t understand what she was asking. “Can you be more specific?” I said. “We’ve spent this whole semester learning ways to feel better and be more successful,” she said, “but most of us are going to graduate this year. Why didn’t anyone teach us about these things earlier, when we could have really benefited from them?” After you teach a class a few times, you usually know what questions to expect. But this one was new. I felt as if I had just run face-first into a wall I hadn’t known was there. I deflected Arielle’s question onto the rest of the class (yep: classic professor technique). Students started raising their hands and offering ideas. But I was barely listening. I was stuck inside my head, fixated on what she had said. The truth was, I didn’t have an answer. Eventually, class time wound down, I said goodbye to the students, and off they went into their futures. But what Arielle had been getting at lodged itself in my mind like a splinter. Throughout my career—and throughout that semester too—I have met people desperate to escape their inner voice because of how bad it makes them feel. This is understandable. As we know, chatter can pollute our thoughts and fill us with painful emotions that, over time, damage all that we hold dear—our health, our hopes, and our relationships. If you think of your inner voice as an inner tormentor, then it’s natural to fantasize about permanently muting it. But losing your inner voice is, in fact, the last thing you would ever want if your aim is to live a functional life, much less a good one. While many cultures today celebrate living in the moment, our species didn’t evolve to function this way all the time. Quite the contrary. We developed the ability to keep our inner worlds pulsing with thoughts and memories and imaginings fueled by the inner voice. Thanks to our busy internal conversations, we are able to hold information in our minds, reflect on our decisions, control our emotions, simulate alternative futures, reminisce about the past, keep track of our goals, and continually update the personal narratives that undergird our sense of who we are. This inability to ever fully escape our minds is a main driver of our ingenuity: the things we build, the stories we tell, and the futures we dream. It is a mistake, however, to value our own inner voice only when it buoys our emotions. Even when the conversations we have with ourselves turn negative, that in and of itself isn’t a bad thing. As much as it can hurt, the ability to experience fear, anxiety, anger, and other forms of distress is quite useful in small doses. They mobilize us to respond effectively to changes in our environments. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087PL8YVQ&location=2270))

- During the days and months that followed, I reflected on the rich and startling variety of ways to distance, to talk to oneself, to leverage and improve personal relationships, to benefit from our environments, and to use placebos and rituals to harness the ability of the mind to heal itself. These techniques had been hidden in plain sight inside us and around us. And while no specific tool is a panacea, they all have the potential to bring down the temperature of our inner voice when it runs too hot. But these findings didn’t seem to be penetrating into the world. So I got to work and recruited a group of like-minded scientists and educators to translate what we know about the science of managing emotion into a course that could be weaved into middle and high school curricula.

So is distanced self-talk: You can talk to yourself or about yourself using non-first-person pronouns or your own name, and you can normalize your challenges with the universal “you.” We can be an inner-voice tool for the people grappling with chatter in our lives—and they can do the same for us—by avoiding co-rumination and finding a balance between providing caring support and helping others constructively reframe their problems when their emotions cool.

- just as important to avoid: passive instead of active use of social media, and doing things lacking empathy that we wouldn’t do off-line. Another subset of tools comes from the complex world around us. Mother Nature is a veritable toolshed for our minds, containing pleasant and effective ways of restoring the attentional tools that are so helpful for reducing chatter and bolstering our health. It can fill us with awe, as can plenty of experiences found not on mountaintops but at concerts, in places of worship, and even in special moments in our own homes (just remembering when each of my daughters said “Dada” for the first time rekindles awe in me). Imposing order on our surroundings likewise can be comforting and allow us to feel better, think more clearly, and perform at higher levels. Then there are our beliefs, whose malleability can work to our advantage. Through the neural apparatus of expectation, sugar pills that we know are just sugar pills can improve our health, as can the exercise of rituals, both those that are culturally ordained and those we create ourselves.
