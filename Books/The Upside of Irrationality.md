## Highlights
- This is the real goal of behavioral economics: to try to understand the way we really operate so that we can more readily observe our biases, be more aware of their influences on us, and hopefully make better decisions.

- In the end, this is what behavioral economics is about—figuring out the hidden forces that shape our ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=165))
- decisions, across many different domains, and finding solutions to common problems that affect our personal, business, and public lives. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=166))
- We are usually quick to assume that there is a link between the magnitude of the incentive and the ability to perform better. It seems reasonable that the more motivated we are ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=234))
- to achieve something, the harder we will work to reach our goal, and that this increased effort will ultimately move us closer to our objective. This, after all, is part of the rationale behind paying stockbrokers and CEOs sky-high bonuses: offer people a very large bonus, and they will be ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=235))

- Yerkes and Dodson’s experiment should make us wonder about the real relationship between payment, ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=253))

- After all, their experiment clearly showed that incentives can be a double-edged sword. Up to a certain point, they motivate us to learn and perform well. But beyond that point, motivational pressure can be so high that it ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=254))
- actually distracts an individual from concentrating on and carrying out a task—an undesirable outcome for anyone. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=255))
- The conclusion was clear: paying people high bonuses can result in high performance when it comes to simple mechanical tasks, but the opposite can happen when you ask them to use their brains—which is ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=452))
- usually what companies try to do when they pay executives very high bonuses. If senior vice presidents were paid to lay bricks, motivating them through high bonuses would make sense. But people who receive bonus-based incentives for thinking about mergers and ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=453))
- acquisitions or coming up with complicated financial instruments could be far less effective than we tend to think—and there may even be negative consequences to really large bonuses. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=455))
- To summarize, using money to motivate people can be a double-edged sword. For tasks ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=456))

But when the incentive level is very high, it can command too much attention and thereby distract the person’s mind with thoughts about the reward. This can create stress and ultimately reduce the ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JBHVZY&location=457))
