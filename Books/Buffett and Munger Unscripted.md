## Highlights
- CM: “There are a few simple tricks that work well, particularly if you have a temperament that has a combination of patience and opportunism in it. And I think that’s largely inherited, although I suppose it can be learned to some extent. Then I think there’s another factor that accounts for why Berkshire has done as well as it has: We’re really trying to behave well. “I had a great-grandfather; when he died, the preacher gave the talk, and he said, ‘None envied this man’s success, so fairly won and wisely used.’ That’s a very simple idea, but it’s exactly what Berkshire’s trying ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=568))

- to do. There are people who make a lot of money and everybody hates them; they don’t admire the way that they earned the money. I do not particularly admire making money running gambling casinos. We don’t own any. And we’ve turned down certain businesses, including a big tobacco business. I don’t think Berkshire would work as well if we had just been terribly shrewd and didn’t have a little bit of what the preacher said about my grandfather. We want to have people think of us as having won fairly, and used wisely.” ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=573))

- “That’s mostly, I think, because we never thought that we would be managing $500 billion. But I would argue that there’s going to be plenty of opportunities … What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. And I’d say that in the fifty-eight years that we’ve been running Berkshire, there’s been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things. “They do big, dumb things. And the reason they do it, to some extent, is because they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started. You could start ten or fifteen dumb insurance companies in the last ten years, and you could become rich if you were adroit at it. Whether the business succeeds or not, the underwriters and the lawyers got paid. It couldn’t be done fifty-eight years ago; you couldn’t get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do, fortunately. “The big money now is in selling other people’s ideas. It isn’t in outperforming. If you run small amounts of money, I think the opportunities will be greater. But Charlie and I have always differed on this subject. He likes to tell me how gloomy the world is. I like to tell him, ‘We’ll find something.’ So far, we’ve both been kind of right. Charlie, will you budge an inch or not?” CM: “There is so much money now in the hands of so many smart people all trying to outsmart one another and out promote one another, getting more money out of other people. It’s radically different from the world we started in. I suppose it will have its opportunities, but it’s also going to have some unpleasant episodes.” WB: “But they’re trying to outsmart each other in arenas that you don’t have to play in. “The world is overwhelmingly short-term-focused. If you go to a quarterly call, they’re all trying to figure out how to fill out a sheet to show earnings for the current year, and the management team is interested ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=604))

- in feeding them expectations that will be slightly beaten. That is a world that is made to order for anybody just trying to think about what you can do that should work over five, ten, or twenty years. I would love to be born today, to go out with not too much money and—hopefully—turn it into a lot of money. Charlie would, too, actually. He would find something to do, I guarantee you. It wouldn’t be exactly the same as before, but he would end up with a big, big, big pile.” CM: “I would not like the thrill of losing my big pile. I like my big pile the way it is.” WB: “We agree on that incidentally.” ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=621))

- WB: “The criteria for selecting a stock is really the criteria for looking at a business. We are looking for a business we can understand. They sell a product that we think we understand, or we understand the nature of the competition and what could go wrong with it over time. And then we try to figure out whether the economics, the earnings power, over the next five, ten, or fifteen years is likely to be good and getting better, or poor and getting worse. Then we try to decide whether we’re getting in with people that we feel comfortable being in with. And then we try to decide what’s an appropriate price for what we’ve seen up to that point in the business. “What we do is simple, but it is not necessarily easy. The checklist that we go through in our minds is not very complicated. Knowing what you don’t know is important; knowing the future is impossible in many cases, and difficult in others.… ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=630))

The checklist that we go through in our minds is not very complicated. Knowing what you don’t know is important; knowing the future is impossible in many cases, and difficult in others.

- WB: “The ideal business is one that earns very high returns on capital and can keep using lots of capital at those high returns. That becomes a compounding machine. If you can put $100 million into a business that earns 20% on capital, ideally it would be able to earn 20% on $120 million the following year, $144 million the following year, and so on. You could keep redeploying capital at these same returns over time. But there are very, very, very few businesses like that. “Unfortunately, good businesses like Coca-Cola or See’s Candies don’t require much capital. And the incremental capital doesn’t ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=675))

- produce anything like the returns produced by some great intangible [asset]. We would love a business that could redeploy all of its earnings, or even well beyond the earnings: We’d love to have a business earning 20% on $100 million where, if we put another $1 billion in, it would earn 20% on that $1 billion. But those businesses are so rare … “Most of the great businesses generate a lot of money; they do not generate lots of opportunities to earn high returns on incremental capital. We can deploy X at See’s and earn a lot of money, but if we put 5× in we don’t earn any more money to speak of. We can earn high returns on X at The Buffalo News, but if we try to make it 5× we don’t earn any more money. They just don’t have the opportunities to use incremental capital. We look for them, but they don’t exist … “We’ve largely bought businesses that earn good returns on capital, but which have limited opportunities to earn anything like the returns on their base business with incremental capital. “The good thing about our structure at Berkshire is that we can take businesses ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=680))

- that earn good returns on capital, but which don’t have the opportunity for returns of a similar magnitude on incremental money, and move that money around to buy other businesses. Take the newspaper publishing business, which has been a fantastic business over the years: You earned terrific returns on your own invested capital, but if you went out to buy other newspapers, you had to pay a very fancy price, and you didn’t get great returns on incremental capital. But the people in that business felt the only thing they knew was newspaper publishing or media, so their options were limited. We can move money any place that it makes sense, and that’s an advantage of our structure … See’s has produced probably $1 billion of pre-tax earnings for us. If we tried to employ that in the candy business we would have gotten terrible returns over time. But because we moved it around,… ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=690))

- of the year, and you can take it out of the business and it will do just as well without it as it would if that cash stayed in the business. The second business is one that reports the 12% return on capital but there’s never any cash. It reminds me of the used construction equipment business. My old friend, John Anderson, used to say, ‘In my business, every year you make a profit, and there it is, sitting in the yard.’ There are an awful lot of businesses like that; the money is needed just to keep going, to stay in place, so there’s never any excess cash. That business doesn’t enable headquarters to drag out all the cash and invest it elsewhere. We hate that kind of business.” WB: “It would be terrific if every one of our great businesses had ways to deploy additional capital at great rates, but it doesn’t happen. Gillette has a great razor and blade business, but there’s no way they can keep putting those profits… ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM7HSBQV&location=698))

- So we’ve had to learn a different game. And that’s a lesson for all the young people in the room. If you’re going to live a long time, you have to keep learning. What you formerly knew is never enough. If you don’t learn to constantly revise your earlier conclusions and get better, you’re like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.” WB: “If anybody has suggestions for another metaphor, send them to me. Graham, incidentally, was not scalable. You could not do it with really big money. When I worked for Graham-Newman [investment partnership], Graham was the dean of all analysts. He was an intellect above all others around that time. But the investment fund was $6 million, and the partnership that worked in tandem with the investment company also had about $6 million, so we had $12 million that we were working with. You can make adjustments for inflation and everything, but it was just a tiny amount. It wasn’t really scalable.
