- The lessons I’ve taken to heart from nearly 60 years in business and philanthropy are ones I still use every day: ask a lot of questions, pursue the untried, revise expectations upward, take risks, be restless, and most important, seek out the best in your work—the best deal, the best investment, the ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=431))

- If you’ve never heard my name pronounced, you probably think it rhymes with rod. When my father immigrated to the United States, he added the a to his Lithuanian surname, Brod. He thought the extra vowel would make Brod seem less strange. Unfortunately, neither he nor the rest of his family—who happily adopted the new spelling and rod pronunciation—could foresee just how much fun the guys in my junior high school would have calling me “broad.” Then I had an idea: Why not change my name?

- Broad, however, was my family’s name. It was the name on the sign above the Detroit five-and-dime my father owned. Legally changing my name would also involve a trip to court, which would trigger more ridicule when the other kids found out I had done something so drastic just to avoid teasing. So, I thought, why not alter just the pronunciation? “Broad, rhymes with road,” I started telling people, from teachers on down to my classmates. I told my parents about the switch one evening at dinner. They just smiled and shook their heads. They knew even then that there wasn’t a lot they could do to change my mind—and I learned the advantage of reframing the facts in a way nobody had considered before. The name stuck. I became “Eli Broad, rhymes with road.” Some of the teasing continued, but it didn’t really sting anymore. I had changed myself. I liked my new name. To me it seemed strong and refined. I still say, “Rhymes with road,” when I introduce myself to people for the first time, and I’m still happy with the way it sounds. I even enjoy the ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=442))

- Children instinctively ask, “Why not?” Adults soon lose the habit, in large part because they have accepted the status quo. But that’s exactly when you need to ask the question with greater force. The questions you’re willing to ask when others think they have all the answers are doors to discovery. Asking “Why not?” worked for my parents. Both were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Too often, age and experience become an excuse for accepting the status quo without question. Instead of asking “Why not?” you become overwhelmed with all the reasons something can’t be done. “Of course not” becomes your automatic response. You grow fearful of making mistakes. You rely on conventional wisdom because that’s what everyone else does, and there’s safety in consensus. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=491))

- When you have done the unreasonable thing, which is what most people call thinking for yourself, and asked the forbidden question “Why not?” you’ve empowered yourself with conventional wisdom’s polar opposite: unconventional insight. That’s the quality you always need to start a business, take a risk, or make any major decision. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=549))

- pricing might have slowed sales, but it would have been financially smarter. We could have covered any unexpected changes in our materials and labor costs while boosting our profits. Pricing can be a big tripping point for a new business, especially because it can seem as if the only way into a market is to slash the price and make it up in volume. We stuck to our pricing strategy too long. We set the price according to our costs, which we kept low. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=652))

- The intervening 27 years were filled with hard work—most of it directed toward an end I couldn’t see but one I hoped would be profitable. I had been prepared for that sort of marathon effort by personal experience. When I was a kid, I had fought a lonely struggle with a problem whose name—dyslexia—I wouldn’t learn until doctors diagnosed our son with it decades later. As a boy, all I knew was that it was hard for me to read, and there was no way around that except to read a lot, and slowly, until I got the hang of it. It wasn’t easy. But I got to the point that, as an adult, I could read—and enjoy—four newspapers each morning before work. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=718))

- Conventional wisdom was—and is—that the safest diversification is into an industry closely related to your own. For Kaufman and Broad the safe plays would have been a lumber or furniture company. But I wanted something that would see us through the worst imaginable downturn, so I set our team to researching what sort of companies survived the Great Depression. Banks, of course, didn’t do well at all. Depositors drained them of liquidity and, at the time, no federal protections existed to keep them afloat. Mortgage companies, left with huge unpaid home loans when borrowers couldn’t afford payments, tanked. The companies that seemed to do the best were life insurers. We discovered that even in bad times, everyone who can afford to holds on to their life insurance to provide security for their family, meaning insurance companies kept getting business ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=734))

- through the Depression. Those who couldn’t afford their premiums simply let their policies lapse. That meant the insurance company got to hold on to all the earlier payments but had no obligation to pay out on any future liability. Insurance companies could rest on their cash holdings, even if premiums declined and they had fewer customers on their books. After we figured out that insurers survived the Depression relatively well, we started another exhaustive study: Which was the best insurance company to buy? I wanted one we could afford but with a long and solid reputation. The stable, family-run Sun Life Insurance Company of America fit the bill. In 1974, Kaufman and Broad suffered its worst year to date and posted its first loss. The decade would only get worse for the economy, with a crushing energy crisis, inflation, and high unemployment that made buying a home impossible for many families. The malaise of the 1970s was quite different from the low of the 1930s. It was caused by an entirely new and, at the time, poorly understood set of circumstances that came to be ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=740))

- called stagflation. But the key lesson of the 1930s, that insurers could ride out a severe downturn, still applied. By studying the past, I learned how to give our company, its employees, and its stockholders a better future. No matter how much our economy evolves, some things never change. If you know history, you know the indicators of a downturn, whether it’s the 1970s or 2009: job creation slows, consumer confidence dips, businesses don’t know how to move toward growth,… ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=749))

- and thinks with the herd never would have bought Sun Life. Life insurance was about as different from homebuilding as an industry could be. Wouldn’t this new endeavor just become a dangerous distraction that we might mismanage while neglecting our primary business? I seriously considered the question, but if I had reasoned according to conventional logic, I never would have strayed from my “core competency” in accounting and still would be back in Detroit doing other people’s taxes. Sometimes you can mistake what you’re comfortable with for what you’re good at. Unreasonable thinking is your ticket out of that trap. As I came to realize, our company’s core competency wasn’t in building homes. It was in serving customers, particularly baby boomers. It was in meeting consumer needs at a price… ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=756))

- Like Alan, I make it a habit to ask everyone around me a lot of questions so I always know what’s going on. Some people find this very unreasonable. They’re used to the boss walking into a meeting and saying, “What’s this all about?” Some CEOs think they can get away with that because they’re at the top. Perhaps being underprepared is their way of showing how important they are. In fact, the boss should be the best informed person in the room and should have the good sense to ask questions when necessary. Even in the thick of things it’s important to keep asking questions—and you won’t be able to ask the right ones if you haven’t done your homework. That’s how you turn experience, yours or others’, into an education. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=815))

- deeper, and, thanks to the Internet, more accessible. A first mover can sometimes fall in love with its product and fail to realize when technology evolves and consumers want something different. This leaves the field wide open for somebody new. The Big Three automakers were all second movers, improving manufacturing methods and offering a better product. General Electric wouldn’t have become one of this country’s largest companies if it had stuck to only manufacturing light bulbs. And Apple, the world’s most valuable tech firm, has been a second mover several times. The company was not the first to sell mp3 players, smartphones, or even personal computers. Apple just did it better than anybody else. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=862))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Low prices and attention to your own costs won’t matter much, however, if you can’t make the sale. Finding customers who aren’t being served by the first mover allows second movers to get a foothold in the market. Look for needs your competitors don’t satisfy. Look for disgruntled customers who deal with your competitor not out of loyalty but because there’s no other option. Make yourself an attractive alternative.

- If you’re the second mover and the first mover has failed—whether you’re starting a company, taking over a project, or pursuing a social or civic reform—you’re in something of a dangerous position. People tend to think one failure follows another, or that it’s contagious. They might assume that the first mover struck out because there was no way to succeed. That’s what many people whispered about ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=904))

- Disney Hall—that L.A. didn’t care enough about its symphony, that none of the city’s rich were willing to open their wallets for the project. I didn’t believe that. Failure is never preordained. Along with my friend Dick Riordan, then L.A.’s mayor, and our fellow fund-raiser, Andrea Van de Kamp, wife of the former California attorney general and head of the Music Center board, we found a smarter way to sell Disney Hall. We saw clearly that sniffing around all the philharmonic’s old sources of funding just wasn’t working. Instead, we proclaimed that Disney Hall, when built, would be “the heart of the city,” a defining landmark like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Big Ben in London, the Statue of Liberty in New York, and the opera house in Sydney. I also argued that it would reinvigorate L.A.’s center, a place whose world-class potential was going almost wholly unrealized. Suddenly, Disney Hall was no longer about a symphony orchestra, the arts, or even philanthropic generosity. It was about Los Angeles’s right to call itself a world-class city. We raised that $200 million and ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=907))

- then some, and Disney Hall has become exactly what we promised. Often, when a problem seems insoluble, it’s because somebody needs to come along and reframe it. The second mover has the best perspective to do it. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=916))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Innovation is especially important in today’s most dynamic economic sectors. Barriers to entry are low. Initial costs might be nothing more than registering a domain name and getting a decent server. It took decades for Johnson & Johnson to gain its nationwide prominence in the consumer goods market. It took Google only a few years to completely marginalize every other search engine. The point is to keep moving, especially now, when everything moves faster.

- Not everyone can be an original thinker, but everyone can be a rational one. Innovation doesn’t always mean creating something from thin air that needs a patent or a copyright. It just means always looking for ways to improve, sharpen, and evolve what you do—whether it’s refining a product, keeping up with new technologies in your line of work, or reaching new customers in new ways, all based on the lessons of the first mover. As I often say, let someone else go first and get the arrows in their back. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=933))

- A lot of people want to take your time from you. They want to bend your ear about something that you’ve already talked over. They’re dreading starting some task and they want you to become their accomplice in procrastination. You’ve probably done this yourself. But every moment of your time matters. I try to be in control of all of my time—from the first hours after I wake, to the slower hours before bed, to all those little minutes that get eaten up by idle chatter during meetings. Being stingy with your time is the key to working 24/7 but still getting 8 hours of sleep, as I do almost every night.

- Work Doesn’t Have to Be Your Life, But Your Life Is Your Work As my wife, Edye, often says, I am not great at the so-called work-life balance. I work all the time. I’ve even pursued my hobbies with the same intensity I apply to my work, from stamp collecting as a kid to art collecting as an adult. I never play golf because it takes too long, and the business connections it produces can be made just as easily over an early breakfast. I never stay anywhere—parties, museums,… ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=949))

- The work-life balance seems to be a favorite topic of life coaches, therapists, and self-help books. They believe it counteracts “workaholism,” the damaging addiction to work. Some managers argue it’s increasingly important to keep in mind as technology allows work to seep into all of our hours, wherever we are. I’m not suggesting we should bark like Pavlov’s dogs every time our BlackBerrys buzz, or sacrifice a weekend hike for a conference call that could have waited until Monday. And I do understand that as companies cut jobs in tough times, the employees who remain sometimes have to pull more weight than they can carry. That’s when it’s particularly important to enforce the 8 hours of sleep rule and to get peaceful time away from the office. But I also know I’m happiest when my work and my life feel like one and the same,… ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=955))

- Know What You Have to Do, Which Is Less Than You Think The best way to take control of your time is to know what you must do. Sometimes it can seem like we have to do absolutely everything. We have to exercise an hour a day, seven days a week. We have to reply immediately to every e-mail and phone call. Thinking that everything is important, that every request from other people has to be answered with a yes, will make 24 hours seem inadequate. In fact, there are very few things that you truly have to do. This category should include only the things that make you run—the things you couldn’t live or work without. Nothing else comes close to being crucial. When I launched Kaufman and Broad, I knew there were two things I absolutely had to do. One was to get 8 hours of sleep. Without that, my other 16 hours just wouldn’t be what they could be. The second was to make all the decisions about land, particularly when we began to treat it as a raw material. Picking land to buy is the biggest decision a… ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=968))

From the time we were a local builder buying a few dozen lots to our years as an international company building thousands of houses a year, I signed off on every land decision. I made sure always to know where we were buying, what the market was like there, and what each lot would do for us. Anyone in any job can narrow his or her task list to the one that really matters.

- Prioritizing isn’t just about making a list and checking off the boxes. It is something you should be doing constantly. Circumstances change throughout the day—emergency meetings are called, colleagues dream up new initiatives, a sudden inspiration comes to you at the coffeemaker—and your priorities can’t stay rigid. Be flexible but also keep in mind what’s most important. Being unreasonable will help you set your priorities. Keep them constantly in mind. Doing that will make a stray chat with a colleague who habitually interrupts you seem a lot less necessary, no matter how much you convince yourself that you’re just being a team player or trying not to hurt anyone’s feelings.

- The only thing you shouldn’t delegate are your crucial tasks. The one time I did that at Kaufman and Broad, handing the reins to the wrong person, I paid for it dearly. I picked a very smart guy to take over as CEO for a few years while I focused on our insurance business. But he wasn’t the strongest manager. He didn’t keep as close an eye on land decisions, and some of his executives were roped into poor investments. They didn’t control their costs—something I had insisted on with near-religious zeal when I headed the company. If you’re afraid to delegate, or if you delegate incorrectly, it’s not your employees’ fault—it’s yours. It’s up to you to recognize when an employee just isn’t up to the task. In that case, cut your losses quickly. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1033))

- To some extent, taking risks is a matter of temperament, the willingness to dare big. But everyone can train themselves to try it. The first risk is exhilarating, not because it’s big but because you have nowhere to go but up. Legendary entrepreneurs from Andrew Carnegie to Bill Gates all made one starting gamble and won a lifetime of reward. From the moment you take your first risk—starting a business, embarking on a new career, or making a new investment—you’ll start to learn how to manage risk. The good news is nothing will seem as scary as that initial leap. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1192))

- I keep a copy of Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk by Peter L. Bernstein in my office. As the book shows, our concept of risk as something to be managed is old, but not ancient. It arose when humans realized the future is not just the whim of some divine force. Risk grew more predictable with the invention of probability theory, but it remained—and will always be—a gamble against larger forces, like economics, politics, technology, and sometimes what passes for common sense. Still, in the face of less-than-divine power, risk has become ever more manageable. Whether you’re naturally inclined toward risk or you’re not, “managing risk” can sound quite unreasonable, or even like an oxymoron. If you love the thrill, you’re not going to like the idea of managing it. And if you hate risk, you’re not going to believe it can be managed. But taking carefully measured and balanced risks has allowed me to take big gambles without losing sleep. At SunAmerica we incorporated risk management into the way we calculated our investment income. We managed risk by having a diversified portfolio and by limiting the amount of noninvestment-grade high-yield bonds. This method let us take on risky investments without becoming a risky company. We took as many different kinds of risks as we could—risks that weren’t correlated, new asset classes, securities we originated. It’s a popular way to build a portfolio now, although it was less tried then. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1200))

- Ask yourself two questions before you take on a risk: What do I have to lose? And what’s the worst that can happen? I always ask these questions, and I take them seriously. When I started Kaufman and Broad, the answers were my father-in-law’s capital, and I could return to accounting (which would allow me to pay back my father-in-law). When I’m considering investing in a company or a fund, asking these questions reminds me that I can always sell.

- I have to sell my investment at a loss, I can make it up in the future. By asking these questions, you’ll often see the real potential cost of a risk you shouldn’t take—like investing in a dubious type of security or buying a home you can’t quite afford. But a lot of times you’ll realize that you don’t have much to lose, and the worst-case scenario is something you can overcome. Asking and answering these questions can help you transform yourself from an “Of course not” thinker into a “Why not?” thinker. Holding on to “Of course not” thinking can paralyze you in the face of risk. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1221))

Your confidence can make whatever you’re trying to sell—whether it’s a business plan to investors, an idea to your boss, or a product to a customer—sound irresistible. I also learned that confidence may get you one sale, but overconfidence can lead you to forget to ask yourself: What do customers want and need? That’s the key to marketing. It was the first thing we considered at Kaufman and Broad, and I continued to ask it throughout my business career. The answer we came up with—and this is always the answer—is value. No matter how much money your customers have, they still want value. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1463))

- Once you know your customers, you can start to figure out what value you can provide them. In the early years of Kaufman and Broad, there was no way we could offer a customized house with a lot of frills because our customers couldn’t afford one and we couldn’t build one. But we could offer a great first home for a low price. Our defining goal would be to provide our customers the best product they could afford. That should be the guiding principle for most any company. ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1476))

- want and what you can offer. And, I suppose, don’t name things after your family members. You’ll never be able to look at the product with a clear head. To figure out what our customers could afford, we just had to look at their rent. When Kaufman and Broad started, owning a home meant being part of a neighborhood, establishing some stability, improving your credit, and achieving part of the American dream. No one was in the game of buying and selling homes quickly—what’s called flipping today. Although a lot of people wanted to own a home, they generally weren’t willing to overextend themselves to make the payments. (That came later, when bubbles deluded people into thinking real estate never goes down in value.) We decided to price our houses so that the mortgage payments would be less than the average monthly rent on an apartment. For many Americans, that remains the only way to make buying a home appealing, particularly after a market crash.

- Value is one thing you never can afford to sacrifice. Sometimes you have to go to extremes to reassure your customers that what you’re selling really is worth what you’re asking them to pay. Kaufman and Broad became the talk of the housing industry by doing just that when we hit our first major slowdown in the 1960s. The California housing market, one of our strongest through the middle of that decade, began contracting. Rather than lower our prices, we sold our customers a secure investment along with a place to live, demonstrating our confidence in our product, our company, and the economy.

- In full-page newspaper ads, we made our customers an unprecedented (and, our competitors thought, quite unreasonable) offer: We guaranteed a roughly 7 percent increase in home value in the first year and offered to refund the difference to anyone who wanted to sell at the one-year mark. We promised to cover the mortgage payments for anyone who got laid off or was otherwise incapacitated. In other words, we reassured our customers that the new home they wanted really was a safe investment. And we made sure to assess our risk and to purchase insurance for ourselves beforehand in case our calculations were off. Fortunately, they weren’t. Buyers flocked to us, we never once had to make a mortgage payment, and our homes appreciated more than 7 percent. The downturn wasn’t deep, it was just some jitters, as we had predicted through our research. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1498))

We did, however, help our customers imagine what sort of life they could live in our homes: happy and fulfilling ones. We were selling a backdrop for the good life. To give anyone a clear sense of how successful we were and how fast we moved, I came up with a great way to pitch our company. I made a calculation, based on how many houses we sold each year, and came up with the line that somebody bought a Kaufman and Broad home every 30 minutes of every working day. That thrilled shareholders, and customers knew they were buying from a strong company, not a fly-by-night operation.

In investing, as in life, it’s sometimes better to be lucky than smart. I never saw the precipitous fall of AIG coming—and to this day, it troubles me that a legendary company could drop in value as it did in 2008. Fortunately, our foundations had none of their funds in AIG. These days I am highly diversified. Name an asset class and I probably have some exposure to it. Between my portfolio and that of the foundations, we have more than 200 investments, none of which amounts to more than 5 percent of our holdings.

Apply it to all your home maintenance—painting, carpet cleaning, roofing, tiling, landscaping, plumbing—and to buying a house or car. Sometimes people will say flat out, no negotiation—in fact, at Kaufman and Broad, we made sure not to let our buyers bargain or pick and choose options because standardization was the only way we could offer homes at a low price. But if the other party doesn’t say that up front, it’s an open field. There’s never any harm in trying. The last question I always like to ask, when I’ve asked all the rest and we’ve had a back-and-forth but I’m not quite happy with my negotiating partner’s last offer, is this: “Is that the best you can do?” ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=1734))

The count agreed but wanted more money up front. That’s when it came to me. If we gave the count an even bigger lump-sum payment up front, he would have to convert it to Italian lira. Going from dollars to lira was a losing proposition. The lira was inflating fast. If he converted more right away, he would end up with less money than if we paid him some now and some later. If you can find an incentive like this—something the other party hasn’t yet figured out—it can change the tenor of your negotiation. It will immediately be clear to them that you’re not trying to trick or manipulate them and that you just want everyone to get a fair deal. It’s the most powerful tool in any negotiator’s bag.

All of a sudden, we were all over the press, Sun Life’s David battling toe-to-toe with Met Life’s Goliath. Soon the “little guy” image was discarded and we were being mentioned in the same breath as Met’s competitors. Everyone sat up and took notice.

- often do. After our Baldwin struggle was over, then Governor Clinton told me that we hadn’t gotten what we wanted in Arkansas because the insurance commissioner was predisposed in Metropolitan’s favor. (Not long after, he joined the law firm that represented Met.) In short order, I realized that the lessons I shared with you in the chapters on negotiation and leverage were just as applicable to politics, though in politics, you often have to be a lot more persistent.

- Knowing when to quit is tricky, but if you are certain something is not going to work, you have to cut your losses immediately. Trying to avoid an inevitable loss isn’t persistence—it’s desperation. Sometimes you have to accept a loss so you can put all your energies, time, and money into the next project. As in negotiation, it’s important to set a limit on what you’re willing to expend—time, money, and pain—on reaching your goal. If you reach those limits, it’s time to throw in the towel.

- Sometimes you walk away so that you can have a second shot down the line to return. That’s something to remember when your loss stings the most. There will be another day and, as long as you stay on the hunt, it will bring its own opportunities. ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=2063))

- I still believe the same thing I said to Jay Wintrob when he first started: “Show me a person with an unblemished track record and I’ll show you a person who has dramatically underachieved.” There is a lot to be said for batting .600. If you’re doing 10 things and only 4 are failing, that’s pretty good. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=2152))

- And trust me, nothing patches over bruised egos and imagined slights like success. When your unreasonable focus accomplishes something, suddenly everyone is glad to be around you and eager for a share of the credit. Be as generous with credit as you are tight-fisted with your time. It doesn’t cost you anything and leaves people eager for future collaborations. ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=2316))

- As much as my candor may have initially angered those with a stake in the school’s status quo, I eventually was named chairman of the board for my work. That was an expression of respect for what I had been able to do for a terrific college. I’ll take that over first place in a popularity contest any day. If you stop and think about it, I’ll bet you would too. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=2351))

- At The Broad Foundations, we give where we believe we can be game changers. Edye and I had the good fortune to be advised by our board member Larry Summers, the former Harvard president, U.S. Treasury secretary, and economic advisor to President Barack Obama. He helped us define our three criteria for making a philanthropic investment: 1. Will it make a difference in 20 years? 2. Would it happen anyway without our support?

- 3. Do we have the right people to make it happen? Those three tests have helped set a course for our philanthropic investments. The best illustration is the Broad Institute in Cambridge. We added to our work in education reform and the arts and decided to invest in the field of scientific and medical research, because we saw opportunities in genomics and stem cell research that passed our three tests.

- Lines from a poem by William Butler Yeats, “The Choice,” have always given me some small solace when I reflect on my family life: The intellect of man is forced to choose perfection of the life, or of the work. By now, you know which I chose. Although I am proud of my accomplishments, I sometimes wonder whether I should have chosen differently. But perhaps Yeats’s choice is too stark. If I could do it again, I would have tried to find perfection in a balance between the two, as I hope you will try to do. An unreasonable life can take you far in your career, but sometimes it can take you too far from home. ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007WLU96A&location=2873))

I’m proud of making life better for people by building affordable homes for families, creating secure futures for retirees, generating high-performing returns for shareholders and employees, boosting the education of American children, improving the health of people around the globe, and broadening the perspective of museum-goers with the chance to appreciate the art of their own time.
