## Highlights
- It is now a decade since The Money Game was written. Ben Graham, the classics scholar who was the dean of security analysis, started his text with a quote from Horace: “Many shall come to honor that now are fallen, and many shall fall that are now in honor.” That is certainly true for the players of the money game over the decade, as it probably will be in any decade. Not only did some of the players fall, but the names of some of the companies in The Money Game have become one with those of the harness makers and the locomotive kings. Any book written in the sixties is going to have some images that become the nostalgic amber of old tintypes. This edition of The Money Game is the same as the first—not a word changed, as they say. There are other conventions which could be brought up-to-date, should the author choose to meddle. For example, Cassius Clay has become Muhammed Ali, and so on. But the book stands as it did.

- Only a longer time span reveals the truly Prudent Man, who knows that the first rule of making money is not to lose it. The implication in The Money Game is that the professional investors, who have access to all the information, whose computers can churn out ratios at fingertip touch, are smarter than the small investor. They are not smarter, they merely have more information. That does not protect them from the compulsions of theology; witness the wonderful Two Tier market of the seventies, with the so-called Nifty Fifty growth stocks selling all by themselves, supported by the religion of the managers, until they collapsed. The small investors without theology fared better. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=80))

- Then there was the visiting Zen practitioner, disciple of a famous master, who said the axioms of detachment were appropriate to his own discipline. “The stock doesn’t know you own it,” he said. “Prices have no memory, and yesterday has nothing to do with tomorrow. If you really know what’s going on, you don’t even have to know what’s going on to know what’s going on.” ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=127))

- Dr. Thomas Schelling, a Harvard economist and the author of a number of works on military strategy, goes a lot further. Writing on “Economics and Criminal Enterprise,” Dr. Schelling says: The greatest gambling enterprise in the United States has not been significantly touched by organized crime. That is the stock market.… The reason is that the market works too well. Federal control over the stock market, designed mainly to keep it honest and informative … makes it a hard market to tamper with.

- The irony is that this is a money game and money is the way we keep score. But the real object of the Game is not money, it is the playing of the Game itself. For the true players, you could take all the trophies away and substitute plastic beads or whale’s teeth; as long as there is a way to keep score, they will play.

- So let us heed, for a moment, Mr. Gerald Loeb, longstanding champion tape-reader and author of The Battle for Investment Survival: There is no such thing as a final answer to security values. A dozen experts will arrive at 12 different conclusions. It often happens that a few moments later each would alter his verdict if given a chance to reconsider because of a changed condition. Market values are fixed only in part by balance sheets and income statements; much more by the hopes and fears of humanity; by greed, ambition, acts of God, invention, financial stress and strain, weather, discovery, fashion and numberless other causes impossible to be listed without omission.

- The one thing we have, whether or not we ever find true Value, is liquidity—the ability to buy and sell momentarily and relatively effortlessly. Liquidity is the cornerstone of Wall Street. It is what makes it the financial capital of the world, for it is, except for rare, odd moments of panic, a truly liquid market. It is liquid and it is run honestly, and there are so few places like that in the world that if you are a rich foreigner who wants to be able to cash in on any given day and yet wants to make capital gains, you have virtually only one place ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=341))

- “The market,” says Mister Johnson, “is like a beautiful woman—endlessly fascinating, endlessly complex, always changing, always mystifying. I have been absorbed and immersed since 1924 and I know this is no science. It is an art. Now we have computers and all sorts of statistics, but the market is still the same and understanding the market is still no easier. It is personal intuition, sensing patterns of behavior. There is always something unknown, undiscerned.” ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=382))

- Mister Johnson went to The College, which is how they refer to Harvard, and The Law School, and when he left Cambridge he went to work for Ropes Gray, the biggest Boston law firm, and got intrigued by The Witch on the side. He didn’t get into the fund business except as a lawyer until 1943. “The fellow who was running Fidelity couldn’t support his family on it, so I took it over,” says Mister Johnson. “It had three million dollars. Gee, it’s nice to see something grow geometrically. The last ten years have been the best, because I could interest myself in the managers. You can’t just graduate an analyst into managing funds. What is it the good managers have? It’s a kind of locked-in concentration, an intuition, a feel, nothing that can be schooled. The first thing you have to know is yourself. A man who knows himself can step outside himself and watch his own reactions like an observer. Gee, I don’t think I did a thing to develop good managers. It’s just that I was oriented to a big law firm and in a law firm every associate handles his own clients. So I let the managers develop and handle their own funds. Each one had his own responsibilities. He could walk down the hall for a chat if he wanted to consult, but the show was his own. Positive decisions have to be made by an individual; groups can’t do it. And I think a lot of the investment business was committee-oriented. Then you know a man is really at his best, his most fulfilled, when he’s on the way to becoming what he’s going to become. After he’s become it, he loses ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=402))

- an infinitesimal bit of sharpness, like a star after his best role, and we’ve been lucky enough to hit a couple of fellows like that. With the good men, you can see the learning juices churning around every mistake. You learn from mistakes. When I look back, my life seems to be an endless chain of mistakes.” I told Mister Johnson what interested me was his concern with the mass-psychology aspects of the market. “As a lawyer,” Mister Johnson said, “I had no time to check individual companies; it was a matter of trying to sense behavior patterns. The market is a crowd, and if you’ve read Gustave Le Bon’s The Crowd you know a crowd is a composite personality. In fact, a crowd of men acts like a single woman. The mind of a crowd is like a woman’s mind. Then if you have observed her a long time, you begin to see little tricks, little nervous movements of the hands when she is being false. “You know, I’ve talked to a lot of psychiatrists. I wanted them to do some work for us because the market is a composite personality, sometimes manic, sometimes despairing, sometimes overcome in lassitude. But the problem with the psychiatrists was they worked on a priori reasoning, and it won’t work. Good market work, I think, like successful psychiatry, has to work on emotional rapport. You can have no preconceived ideas. There are fundamentals in the marketplace, but the unexplored area is the emotional area. All the charts and breadth indicators and technical palaver are the statistician’s attempts to describe an emotional state. “I once thought maybe these fellas that have worked on the Eastern sense of consciousness—you know, Alan Watts’ studies of Zen—I thought maybe there would be some answers there.” Maybe Mister Johnson knows. The Zen Buddhist approach to the market! “Oh, gee, no. There are individual perceptions. If you remember The Wisdom of Insecurity, you know we need obstacles. We need toughness for the extra reach. Something is going to be lost in this national obsession for security when you have full employment, even overemployment. But Zen, I am just a reader, not a student, and the market is too complex for Zen. “I think the dominant note of our time is unreality. The thin air of the music we all heard has died away. It lasted a long time, certainly several decades, but the best rule is: When the music stops, forget the old music. Why unreality? Times of crusading spirit are times of unreality. In much of history the crusading spirit is a subject of lampoon, Don Quixote, but now we have mass emotion moving, trying to change the folkways of the world. The Vietnam war and the civil rights movement are both examples. I am not making judgments on these things. I am just saying that the attitude of mind in approaching these problems is a crusading attitude, and crusades do not have the elements of durability. In good times it’s not hard to make money, but in times of unreality the market is saying, ‘You don’t understand me any more; don’t trust me… ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=414))

A series of market decisions does add up, believe it or not, to a kind of personality portrait. It is, in one small way, a method of finding out who you are, but it can be very expensive. That is one of the cryptograms which are my own, and this is the first Irregular Rule: If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.

- Other tests with pen and pencil peel away other veils. John has four apples, Mary has three oranges, and they both get on a train that is going forty miles an hour which left the station at 2:10. When the train arrives, John has two apples and Mary has six oranges. What time is it? The analyst is inductive. He will break the problem into its components and work away at each, building up to the answer. The old portfolio manager will settle happily into the problem; he loves it. The aggressive portfolio manager says, “What the hell kind of stupid question is that, and how is that going to make me any money?” and goes into the same kind of rage he did when his wife wouldn’t leave the party. He has to get the Concept in one fell swoop or he is very restless. While the analysts can do the problems, they make a lot of arithmetic errors, unlike the accountants, who get everything right to the decimal point. But good analysts have high aptitude with both words and numbers. They shine best in Vocabulary. It is when the functioning gets abstract, both numerically and verbally, that they begin to fade.

- In short, if you really know what’s going on, you don’t even have to know what’s going on to know what’s going on. All you need is a hell of an aperceptive mass, an IQ of 150, and a dollop of ESP, and you can ignore the headlines, because you anticipated them months ago. There is one requirement that is absolute in money managing, and you have already learned it with the first Irregular Rule: If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out. The requirement is emotional maturity. “You have to use your emotions in a useful way,” says Dr. McArthur. “Your emotions must support the goal you’re after. You can’t have any conflict about what you’re after, and your emotional needs must be gratified by succeeding at what you’re doing. In short, you have to be able to handle any situation without ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=638))

- losing your cool, or letting your emotions take over. You must operate without anxiety.” The psychological tests can’t really tell you whether you are going to be an ace at making money; they are descriptions of existing groups, some of them followed up with later tests for incumbency (how long in the job), contentment, and success. You may be out of the patterns and still succeed, or the world may change to the point where these are not the successful patterns. But given the world as it is, this is the way the Game goes. Some analysts should not manage their own money, some portfolio managers should be running funds with other characteristics, and some investors should be cutting flowers in their garden and letting smart people run the money. You may even come out a fine fellow on tests, but the real test is how you behave when the crowd is roaring the other way. We know a little about some individual types, but the crowd, the elusive Australopithecus, is still largely an unknown, an exercise in mass psychology still not accomplished. But is the market really a crowd? ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=645))

- “Crowds,” says good Dr. Le Bon, “are everywhere distinguished by feminine characteristics.” And now we remember hearing Mister Johnson saying that a crowd of men acts like a single woman. (I know one distinguished senior partner who believes that the study of women is the best preparation for the market. It ought to be easy to recruit apprentices for a serious study.) The crowd, says Dr. Le Bon, does not reason, it only thinks it reasons; what it does actually is to accept a series of images, not necessarily connected by any logical bond of succession, and this explains why contradictory ideas can occur simultaneously. The crowd is suggestible to images, and what produces these images is “the judicious employment of words and formulas. Handled with art, they possess in sober truth the mysterious power formerly attributed to them by the adepts of magic.” What Dr. Le Bon has in mind are words like “liberty” and “democracy” and “fifty-four forty or fight,” but perhaps “growth” and “Xerox” will do just as well. All that is necessary is to recognize “the magical power attached to those short syllables, as if they contained the solution of all problems. They synthesize the most diverse unconscious aspirations and the hope of their realization.” All of this will be no news to many of the players of the Game. Wall Street unconsciously accepts this; the “image” that a company or a stock presents helps its price, and can keep it up long after ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=709))

- the rational factors of earnings and return on invested capital have begun to deteriorate. If a company has a reputation for “continuous innovation” or “creating its own market,” that is exotic fuel. The whole process keeps a lot of public-relations firms in business. “Crowds,” says Dr. Le Bon, “are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution of the problems offered by their psychology or to resign ourselves to being devoured by them.” Or, as Kipling might have said, “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, maybe you haven’t heard the news.” ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=720))

- to do with individuals being part of a multicellular mass that the commentators on Freud go into and that we need not.) And it is certainly better to be comfy, everybody will agree, than not to be. Outside of New York there is an aggressive fund housed in pastoral surroundings, run by a man who won’t go into New York. It is not only that he considers New York a sink, which he does, but that “all those fellas ride into New York on the same train and read the same things and talk to each other all the way in.” This captain of money management doesn’t talk to anybody and doesn’t read anything. “All that is all in the price,” he says. “Eighty percent of the market is psychology. Investors whose actions are dominated by their emotions are most likely to get into trouble.” He has a good record, this urbanthrope, but then so do many of the readers, talkers, and riders of the Penn-Central. There is, one has to conclude, a kind of crowd there, and it is well to be aware of it. If the crowd is so fickle, feminine, and irrational, then does success follow from simply staying out of the crowd? Perhaps sticking to one’s knitting, the rational following of rational choices? Here are the pithy comments of Lord Keynes: … Americans are apt to be unduly interested in discovering what average opinion believes average opinion to be; and this national weakness finds its nemesis in the stock market.… if the reader interjects that there must surely be large profits to be ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=743))

- gained from the other players in the long run by a skilled individual who, unperturbed by the prevailing pastime, continues to purchase investments on the best genuine long-term expectations he can frame, he must be answered, first of all, that there are, indeed, such serious-minded individuals and that it makes a vast difference to an investment market whether or not they predominate in their influence over the game-players. But we must also add that there are several factors which jeopardize the predominance of such individuals in modern investment markets. Investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult today as to be scarcely practicable. He who attempts it must surely lead much more laborious days and run greater risks than he who tries to guess better than the crowd how the crowd will behave; and given equal intelligence, he may make more disastrous mistakes.

- “The very bright people,” says one of my Wall Street philosopher friends, “know how to worm their way around the Street, and they do very well.

- The point all these learned scholars make is that money is useless; that is, it must literally be useless in order to be money, whether money is the stone cartwheels of Yap island, shells, dogs’ teeth, gold stored in Fort Knox, or East African cattle which can’t be eaten because that would be—literally—eating up capital. The thread of thought here goes directly against that of Adam Smith the First, who postulated that money was useful and men rational. The invisible hand of the market brought the cobbler’s boots to market in exchange for the farmer’s cabbages so that, efficiently, the cobbler did not have to farm nor the farmer to cobble. Adam Smith the First’s economic man was a rational man, and much of economics assumes that men will always go in the direction of the maximization of profit or of production. But since we are skittering over the idea that men are not always rational, we have to see where the idea that money is useless, or why it is useless, will lead us.

- Come to think of it, the Federal Reserve Board creates money all the time. It just waves its wand of bill purchases and sales, and presto, there is money where there was none before. This is called regulating the money supply, but it works exactly the same as printing bright new greenbacks, and the Fed doesn’t even have to take the money from somewhere else in order to put that money into the banking system. On the other hand, maybe the members of the Federal Reserve Board feel guilty as hell. So, in a logical sense, perhaps all these investors who come to the marketplace not to make money are free from the guilt and anxieties of money-making, and that’s why they set out not to make money. No? I don’t believe it either. If they were really free, they wouldn’t have even shown up for the Game. Something else must be bugging them. I suppose there does have to be a balance in time, so that we do not have, as Keynes said, quoting Alice, “a case of jam tomorrow and never jam today,” or in Norman Brown’s ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=826))

- “Ninety percent of investors don’t really care whether they make money or not,” I postulated to my friend Harold the Psychiatrist. “They say they do, and that, of course, is the name of the game, but my downtown savants say that they don’t. What do you suppose they are in it for?” “I haven’t a clue,” said Harold the Psychiatrist, over his corned-beef sandwich at lunch. Harold the Psychiatrist and I occasionally retire to a little coffee shop near his office on the West Side of Manhattan. “Practically all of my patients are in the market, and it means something different to each of them. They’re not seeing me because they’re in the market, but people who can afford a psychiatrist can also afford a broker, and money is part of the Geist. I’m working on their personal problems. Why don’t I lend them to you, and you can talk to them about the market.” ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=837))

I have a friend who runs a small clearing-house shop, and this is what he says: “I don’t care whether they’re big investors or little investors. If they make a little money, they’re happy, if they lose a little money, they’re not too unhappy. What they want to do is to call you up. They want to say, ‘How’s my stock? Is it up? Is it down? What about the earnings? What about the merger? What’s going on?’ And they want to do this every day, they want a friend, they want someone on the telephone, they want to be a part of what’s going on, and if you gave them a choice between making money, guaranteed, or staying in the game, and if you ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1080))

- The strongest emotions in the marketplace are greed and fear. In rising markets, you can almost feel the greed tide begin. Usually it takes from six months to a year after the last market bottom even to get started. The greed itch begins when you see stocks move that you don’t own. Then friends of yours have a stock that has doubled; or, if you have one that has doubled, they have one that has tripled. This is what produces bull market tops. Obviously no one rationally would want to buy at the top, and yet enough people do to produce a top. How do they manage it? It must be that element of contagion from Le Bon’s crowd, from the unwillingness to be out of step. It is really quite amazing how time horizons and money goals can change. Investors can start out tentatively after a market bath, and they buy something they hope will go up 50 percent in eighteen months. But as the pace accelerates, 50 percent in eighteen months seems much too slow, when there are stocks around—owned by somebody else—that are going up 100 percent in six months. Finally it all turns into a marvelous carmagnole that is great fun if you leave the party early. The same thing happens in reverse. When stocks start down, the tendency is to wait until they come back a little before lightening up. They head down further, and the idea that you have made a mistake, that you have been betrayed by your own judgment, can be so paralyzing that you wait a little longer. Finally faith evaporates entirely. If stocks were down 10 percent yesterday, they may be down 20 percent today.

- rid of the filthy things which have treated you so cruelly. Again, it all ends in a kind of paroxysm that is no fun unless you have anticipated it. No matter what role the investor has started with, in a climax on one side or the other the role melts into the crowd role of greed or fear. The only real protection against all the vagaries of identity-playing, and against the final role of being part of the crowd when it stampedes, is to have an identity so firm it is not influenced by all the brouhaha in the marketplace. Mr. Linheart Stearns, a New York investment counselor now deceased, wrote a very interesting essay on investing and anxiety, for anxiety is the threat to identity. Mr. Stearns evidently had some clients who were every bit as wacky as the ones we have just met. One of them wouldn’t buy bonds because bonds reminded him of death, an observation perhaps not so far wrong in the light of the discussions of Freud’s Wednesday Evening Psychological Association in Vienna. A dress manufacturer insisted stocks were no different from dresses, to be sold at a profit if possible, but “marked down and sold regardless before the end of the season.” Mr. Stearns must have been a soothing investment counselor to know, for his thesis is that the end object of investment is serenity, and serenity can only be achieved by the avoidance of anxiety, and to avoid anxiety you have to know who you are and what you’re doing. You can see that all this is leading to another of Smith’s Irregular Rules, this one that the identity of the investor and that of the investing action must be coldly separate.

- can be granted right away that if you have been a brilliant decision-maker, over a long enough period of time, maybe that’s who you are, and it won’t hurt you to walk around feeling brilliant. But it is a dangerous procedure, for the market has a way of inducing humility in even its most successful students. It is dangerous because to know what you’re doing, you do have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself objectively, and this is very tough if you think of Comsat as your baby, or even think “That’s mine, and I bought it a lot lower.” A stock is for all practical purposes, a piece of paper that sits in a bank vault. Most likely you will never see it. It may or may not have an Intrinsic Value; what it is worth on any given day depends on the confluence of buyers and sellers that day. The most important thing to realize is simplistic: The stock doesn’t know you own it. All those marvelous things, or those terrible things, that you feel about a stock, or a list of stocks, or an amount of money represented by a list of stocks,… ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1133))

You are ahead because you can change your mind and your actions without regard to what you did or thought yesterday; you can, as Mister Johnson said, start out with no preconceived notions.

You can live up to all those old market saws, you can cut your losses and let your profits run, and it doesn’t even make your scar tissue itch because, being selfless, you are unscarred. It has been my fate to know people who have made considerable amounts of money, sometimes millions, in the market. One is Harry, who made it and blew it and made it again.

- you serenity, there are two things you can do. One is to find a good head doctor and see if you can discover why you think a million dollars will give you this serenity. This will involve lying on a couch, remembering dreams, talking about your mother, and paying forty dollars an hour. If your course is successful, you will realize that you do not want a million dollars but something else which the million dollars represents to you, such as love, potency, mother, or what have you. Released, you can go off about your business and not worry any more, and you will be poorer only by the number of hours you spent in accomplishing this times forty dollars. The other thing you can do is to go ahead and make the million dollars and be serene. Then you will have both a million dollars and serenity, and you do not have to deduct the number of hours times forty dollars unless you feel guilty about making it. It seems simple, and there is indeed a catch. What do you do if the million dollars arrives and serenity does not? Aha, you say, you will worry about that when you get to it, you are sure you can handle it. Perhaps you can. Money, contrary to popular myth, does help people more than it spoils them, simply because it opens up more options. The danger is that when you have your million, you then want two, because you have a button saying I Am a Millionaire and that is who you are, and there are, all of a sudden—as you will notice—so many people with buttons saying I Am a Double Millionaire.

Two different Harrys called me. One said I had gotten his stocks right but his domestic situation wrong, and the other said I was a cad to put in all his leisure-time activities and anyway he had never owned any of those stocks. Recently I was having a drink with a corporate executive in an expensive mid-Manhattan watering hole and he said, “You know, Harry’s made it all back again.” He had somebody else entirely in mind, but when I checked around I realized that that was what time of market it was, all the Harrys had made it all back again. There are new Harrys all the time, and the thing that distinguishes them is that their identities are the sum of a set of numbers. The trouble with Harry is not just the trouble with one man who made and lost a lot of money, nor even that there are hatching, at this very instant, other Harrys who will play out this role next month and next year.

- away, in the long run you can’t go wrong. Well, as Keynes once remarked, “In the long run we are all dead,” and, as the line in the ballad says, everything is born to die. The best anti-testimonial to buying good stocks and locking them away was published by the heirs of one Timothy Bancroft. Mr. Bancroft was shrewd enough to ride out the Panic of 1857, which he diagnosed thus: “I blame the Dred Scott fiasco, the easy money policies of the past few years, and the far, far too overconfident speculation in the railroads and farm lands of the Western states.” What one should do, counseled Mr. Bancroft, is to “buy good securities, put them away, and forget them.” These good securities, of course, should be companies “dealing in essential commodities that the Union and the World will always need in great quantities.” Sounds reasonable enough. Mr. Bancroft died leaving an estate of $1,355,250, and if you remember that those are untaxed mid-nineteenth-century dollars, and that a full eight-course meal at Delmonico’s cost less than a dollar at the time, that is quite a fortune. Where Mr. Bancroft erred was in the locking up and putting away, for by the time his descendants managed to get their fingers on the portfolio, Mr. Bancroft’s Southern Zinc, Gold Belt Mining, Carrell Company of New Hampshire, and American Alarm Clock Company were all worth 0, and in fact, so was the estate, an event which prompted one of the descendants to take to print as a warning to his fellow heirs.

- Some people can make money by anticipating the swings in interest rates. There is a whole group of stocks which are sensitive to fluctuations in the bond markets and to the course taken by the Federal Reserve, in which you anticipate whether money is getting cheaper or dearer. Nice profits can be made in bank stocks, finance company stocks, savings and loans, and utilities by those whose fingertips are sensitive to this sort of thing. The swings in these stocks are frequently greater than those in the base companies which are so thoroughly a part of the business cycle, but you do have to know not only the anticipated action of interest rates but the degree to which these moves have been discounted.

- Still other investors can do well in securities which are basically commodity plays, that is, the investors can determine, let us say, that the demand for copper is going to exceed the supply for several years, that copper production will not increase proportionately, and that the therefore inevitable rise in the price of copper will flow through as profits to certain copper companies, and that this future increase has not yet been discounted. One of the most riskless forms of investment is the Turnaround, that is, a company whose fortunes have soured and consequently the market has sold it and sold it and sold it. Finally all the sellers who react to the souring fortunes have sold, and the stock finds a level and quietly goes to sleep. Then a new management comes in, and Does Something; it sells off the unprofitable divisions, it acquires new ones, it changes the programs and the point of view. If you buy the Turnaround after a long sleep, there is little risk to it, and if whatever it is that is changing works, you can do well. But somebody does have to do the work of finding this animal and working through enough to make sure that the story is valid. And, of course, that bottom to which the sea sludge has floated has to be a real one and not just a ledge somewhere halfway down.

My friend believed in growing earnings and he went out with a missionary zeal and preached this idea in the wilderness of mutual and pension funds, and at his untimely death he had a great following among them and a sizable fortune for himself.

- With a little bit of arithmetic, you can figure the rate at which earnings growth is compounding. The higher the rate, the more the market will pay for it in terms of a price; that is, the multiplier placed by the market on the earnings increases not only with the earnings growth but with the rate of earnings growth. Given a number of other assumptions—which we won’t go into at the moment—the market will pay more for earnings growing at a 30-percent rate than at a 15-percent rate, and more for a 50-percent rate than a 30-percent rate. When the market finds a 100-percent rate of growth, it flips, and the rules go out the window. ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1522))

- What you want is the company which is about to do that over the next couple of years. And to do that, you not only have to know that the company is doing something right, but what it is doing right, and why these earnings are compounding. Earnings do not grow automatically, even when business is good and markets are increasing. The copying business has been growing frenetically for most of this decade, and yet one could have been severely mauled in a number of copying stocks. Sometimes earnings can grow for a couple of years because business is so good that none of the competitors have gotten around to cutting prices, stealing salesmen, and in general creating the competitive fester that is good for the consumers but bad for the profit margins. Any company whose earnings are growing consistently—or more important, are likely to grow consistently—has something unique about it. The competition can read these earnings records too, and fat earnings records are an invitation to come in and sample the cream. So a company that has something unique about it has something the competition cannot latch on to right away.

- of the little darling you just discovered, you do not really know how the market will capitalize that growth. Sometimes the market will pay twenty times earnings for a company growing at an annual compounded rate of 30 percent; sometimes it will pay sixty times earnings for the same company. Sometimes the market goes on a growth binge, especially when bonds and the more traditional securities do not seem to offer intriguing alternatives. At other times the alternatives are enticing enough to draw away some of the money that goes into pursuing growth. It all depends on the psychological climate of the time. Obviously you are safer buying compounded earnings cheap than dear, because if you have a stock at eighteen or fourteen or eleven times earnings, and it takes a very damp climate indeed to suppress a record at those ratios. But since you will never be first on the scene, there will always be something to make your little darling seem expensive: Competition is lurking imminently, the stock has already run up, or the market is going to hell in a handbasket. If IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid have that required Something Unique, could we not just buy them and lock them away? Certainly, in the past, one would have prospered by buying them either in times of general market disenchantment or in times when there are so many alternatives to growth that the market is indifferent to it—in short, at the low end of the price-earnings pendulum.

- corporation by legal definition may be bloodless and immortal, but everything is born to die even in spite of legal definitions. Companies which have had something unique do not always run head-on into disaster; more frequently they are simply debutantes who had a rosy glow of beauty for a time and have become respectable middle-aged matrons much like the matrons who were never belles at all. For a time, the market will continue to keep them at a premium; the memory of beauty will still be so strong that the gentlemen who were struck first by the beauty cannot see the lines and sags creeping in. As new gentlemen come in, though, there are new beauties to greet them, and memory is not enough to keep the matrons popular. Then they are vulnerable, because the multiples will come down. Chemicals, for example, sold at growth premiums to the market in the 1950s. Currently not only has their premium vanished but they actually sell at a discount to the Dow-Jones average. There is one footnote to this business of looking at past and current success, and it is an arithmetic one. Again, our Senior Sisters may serve as illustration. The point of the footnote is that the more you grow, the harder it is to keep the percentage of growth constant or increasing, because the base gets so big.

- come as a surprise to recent arrivals, since Charting has taken on an air of sophistication. “There is an incredibly large number of traders,” wrote Thomas Gibson in The Pitfalls of Speculation, “who pin their faith to the so-called ‘chart system’ of speculation which recommends the study of past movements and prices, and bases operations thereon. So popular is this plan that concerns which make a business of preparing and issuing such charts do a thriving business.” Mr. Gibson’s book was published in 1906 by Moody’s. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. If you stop to think that Mr. Gibson’s book was published only a few years after the specialist in Northern Pacific literally had the shirt torn off his back on the Exchange floor by frantic short sellers, and a year before J.P. Morgan personally bailed out the Treasury of the United States, and that a dozen oysters cost eight cents at Oscars, you can see that in our vast, myriad, and changing world, some things are constant. Mr. Gibson, not an impartial observer, went on to say, “There are various offshoots and modifications of the system, but the basic plan is founded wholly on repetition, regardless of actual conditions. The idea is untrustworthy, absolutely fatuous, and highly dangerous.” That, as you can see, is some years before Moody’s went into the chart business. What is the whole thing about? Well, without going into collateral lines, such as the charting of the sun and moon, we can determine from anthropologists and spelunkers that about the time of Australopithecus, a caveman made a wall drawing thus: ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1755))

A chart can be a handy way of looking at what has happened; it can tell you what the price range has been, and what the volume has been. These “bars” showed you the range, but by the definition of a bar they must be all straight-line vertical. There is a variation called point-and-figure, which is not a Regency dance but a complete map of all the footprints a stock has made.

- 2) Mark-up. At the stage of accumulation, there were still enough sellers around who were glad to unload the old dog finally to any fool willing to buy it. Now the supply may be a bit thinner, and the stock is more avidly pursued by more buyers, so it moves up more steeply. 3) Distribution. The Smart People who bought the stock early are busy selling it to the Dumb People who are buying it late, and the result is more or less a standoff, depending on whose enthusiasm is greater. 4) Panic Liquidation. Everybody gets the hell out, Smart People, Dumb People, “everybody.” Since there is “no one” left to buy, the stock goes down. (Of course, “someone” has to buy the stock on the way down, or it would go to zero overnight.) Now we come to trickier ground. When the stock doesn’t get anywhere after a rise, but churns around at the same price level, the Chartists call it an Area of Resistance. When a stock drops to a point where it doesn’t drop any more, and churns around, they call this an Area of Support. If one could depend on these charts, it would be a very neat world indeed.

- the stock has already been bombed, but if you are patient long term, you may do all right. That phrase “long term” is the key phrase. It is used probably for 80 percent of all stocks that are not headed for bankruptcy at any given moment. Never mind that the long term is a series of short terms, or that in the long run we are all dead. The phrases “patient investor” and “long-term appreciation” ring with the virtues of capitalist ethos. The assumption of most Wall Street report writers is that their audience consists of millionaires with their own railroad cars who move from Saratoga to Palm Springs amid the muffled sounds of silent servants and distantly ticking clocks. What they really want is to be in the company of other millionaires: They are the true, patient, long-term investors, and, in short, they have so much money they don’t want to be bothered with any more. The Research Departments, of course, don’t really assume that their audience is railroad-car millionaires, if you get them at home on a quiet night. But the language they choose and the conclusions they reach would lead you to think that; such is the ambiguity of the cop-out. It is much easier to say, “While the near term is uncertain, long-term holdings need not be disturbed,” than to say, “Dump this one.” The Chartist has less material to report, and furthermore he does not have the Free Zone of the Long Term to escape into. His thesis is that past patterns tell future patterns; therefore he must say whether the market (a set of Averages) or a particular stock is going to go up or down, and it is very easy to check up on his prediction. So he must say ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1844))

- something like this: We expect no furious advance unless the market is able to break through the overhanging resistance at the 920 level. Recent weakness in oils and strength in aerospace issues indicates leadership is rotating. Support exists at the 885 level, and unless that is pierced on some volume, we would expect it to hold near term. A trading range is indicated. In short, the market will not go up unless it goes up, nor will it go down unless it goes down, and it will stay the same unless it does either. This may not be quite so useless as it seems. The mystery and incantation do get to be rather funny sometimes, especially when Chartists are publishing opposite conclusions from the same chart. But a chart can show you what has been going on, and if this differs from what you think ought to be going on, maybe you ought to think again, even if the future is not there in the tea leaves. The assumption of the chart is that you ought to pay attention to it because the people who have already acted, and therefore created the chart, are smarter than you, or know something you don’t know. You may reject the assumption, but it’s a good check.… ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1855))

- There is one thesis that runs through all of charting which we can isolate and examine. Past patterns help determine future patterns; momentum can be shown on the charts. All Chartists, to extrapolate and visibly to determine motion, must draw some sort of a line between the prices at various times. It may be a mean line, it may be a line connecting the tops or the bottoms or both. Then the thesis is that the stock (or group) is more likely than not to continue along that line. Never mind whether that “more likely” is 51 percent or 99 percent; that is the point at which the enemy attacks. And the enemy is dead serious. There are all kinds of charts, and so far, we have only flipped through the Primer. Let us, for a moment, watch the enemy attack.

- Charting is as old as papyrus; the “random-walk” thesis has ancient origins but, properly worked out, is as new as computers. Charting seeks to find some order in what has happened; the random-walk thesis maintains there is no order. If the random-walk people are right, the Chartists are out of business and all the security analysts are in trouble.

- What is a random walk? I can’t understand half the papers on the subject, since my fluency in Boolean algebra is limited and in stochastic series is nil. But after a number of conversations with random-walk lads, it occured to me that the whole thing could be defined in one sentence, and Professor Cootner later told a friend of mine this was an okay definition, so without any equations, Σs, or Δs, here it is: Prices have no memory, and yesterday has nothing to do with tomorrow. Every day starts out fifty-fifty. Yesterday’s price discounted everything yesterday. To quote Professor Fama, “the past history of the series (of stock price changes) cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way. The future path of the price level or a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers.” ([Location 1901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1901))

- Senate Banking Committee are taking the random walk seriously, everybody had better gird up, because if the random walk is indeed Truth, then all charts and most investment advice have the value of zero, and that is going to affect the rules of the Game. The first premise of the random walk is that the market—say the New York Stock Exchange—is an “efficient” market, that is, a market where numbers of rational, profit-maximizing investors are competing, with roughly equal access to information, in trying to predict the future course of prices. The second premise is that stocks do have an intrinsic value, an equilibrium price in economists’ language, and that at any point in time the price of a stock will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value, the intrinsic value depending on the earning power of the stock. But since no one is exactly sure what the intrinsic value is, “the actions of the many competing participants should cause the actual price of a security to wander randomly about its intrinsic value.” (Fama speaking.)

- Hence the random-walk people would say to the premise that a stock in a trend will more likely than not follow the trend, that that is nonsense, the chances of the stock following the trend are fifty-fifty. You could say the same thing about flipping nickels. If you flip a nickel five times in a row and it comes up heads, what are the chances of its coming up heads the sixth time? If you flip a nickel a hundred times in a row and it comes up heads a hundred times, what are the chances of heads coming up the 101st time? Fifty-fifty either way. “If the random-walk model is a valid description of reality,” says Professor Fama, “the work of the chartist, like that of the astrologer, is of no real value.” The random-walk fellows seem particularly out to get the Chartists. As I said, one random-walk professor choked on his dessert at my house at the very suggestion that charts could be taken seriously. (We now have a rule at my house that all random-walk professors must finish their desserts before the subject of charts is brought up.) Another random-walk professor of my acquaintance had his graduate students flip nickels, assigning a plus to heads and a minus to tails, and they filled an x in the chart up for heads and down for tails, and sure enough, it made a beautiful point-and-figure chart, complete with line formations, ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1959))

- heads and shoulders, reversals, double tops, and the whole thing. But the random-walk fellows are not stopping with the Chartists. They are also going to bring the security analysts up on their toes. And that reasoning runs this way: There are discrepancies between the actual price and the true intrinsic value of a stock. The analyst gathers all his information, applies his training and insight, and plumps for a purchase or sale accordingly. His action helps to close the gap between the price and the intrinsic value. The better the analysts are, the more sophisticated analysts there are, the more they become self-neutralizing, i.e., the more “efficient” the market becomes. An “efficient” market closely conforms to the random-walk model, in which the price reflects the true discount of intrinsic value. Now obviously an analyst who is one step ahead is going to beat the average of analysts in an efficient market, but of course all analysts think they are better than average. An analyst’s insights must be consistently better than a randomly chosen portfolio of the same general flavor, because every analyst has a 50 percent chance of doing better than a random selection, even if he is a complete idiot or uses darts and a dartboard instead of a slide rule. It is a cold, austere world, the world of the random walk, and a negative one. The random walkers do believe in the intrinsic value of a stock, but they have not much help for us on that because a stock only sells for its intrinsic value—whatever that is—whenever the market rushes past it either optimistically or pessimistically, so that intrinsic ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1969))

- value is right like a stopped clock is right twice a day. There are, as we know, sixteen thousand security analysts, and there are certainly thousands of Chartists. The Chartists will not believe in the random walk, because that would make what they were doing meaningless, and no one wants to feel that a dartboard selection will do as well as one with effort. As for the analysts, they will feel the random walk is irrelevant because their insights and information put them ahead. None of them will really follow the mathematical proofs of randomness. If they did, and believed them, they might take a salary cut and switch to teaching at a business school, and no exodus has yet been spotted. In support of the skeptics we can only look again at the premise, that the market is reasonably “efficient,” that it is a market where numbers of rational, profit-maximizing investors are competing. It may just be that investors—even cold, austere, professional money managers—are not rational, or are not 100 percent rational. It may be that they would rather have some profit and a feeling of company than a maximum profit and a feeling of anxiety. The investor in the random-walk model is suspiciously Homo economicus, and we did wander among some thought that Homo is not economicus. “There is nothing… ([Location 1982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=1982))

The prices are there, the coefficients are there, the past is there (or not there, depending on whether you are charting or random walking). Bishop Berkeley’s tree has fallen in the forest, and it has made an awesome noise even though no one has heard it fall. If the market is truly a Game, it would be possible to have the Game without any intrinsic values at all. If part of the Game is that Bishop Berkeley’s tree is down when everyone decides it is down, then there need not even be a tree. If the printers will print stock certificates, the New York Stock Exchange will stay open, and the banks will print out occasional dividends, we can have the whole Game even though all the steel plants and warehouses and railroads have mysteriously disappeared, as long as no one knows they have disappeared.

- answer, in the same language, is probably simmering somewhere even now. The influence of the random walkers must by definition be good because it will make everyone test results and performance instead of accepting myth and generalities. Meanwhile—not that it means anything—there are few rich random walkers, and few rich Chartists. But there are some quite successful investors around who have no particular system. Perhaps they are the lucky holders of serial runs, perhaps they are more rational or have better access to information, and perhaps—something not taken into account in the austere statistical worlds—they are better students of psychology. Random walkers do not unanimously insist that the market is a random walk. It is not a random walk, some of them admit, only because the market strays from the “perfect” or the “efficient”; in short, there are people in it. “My model,” says Professor Cootner, “is perfectly compatible with much of what I interpret Wall Street chart reading to be all about.

- dimension is quite consistent with nonrandom trends in the move dimension,” says Professor Alexander.) To be honest, you must apply the biases recited in the Confessions of Bias in this book to both charts and the random walk. Charts we have only glimpsed, and technical work can cover factors other than price changes (volume, advances and declines, and so on), which charts demonstrate most readily. The bias confessed in the love for those happily compounding earnings comes under the old Fundamentalist concept called The Discounted Present Value of Future Earnings, only one step removed from classic Fundamentalism, The Present Value of Future Dividends. Admittedly, there is the idea of Intrinsic Value woven into these accelerating earnings, but it can all be played as a Game even if there is Intrinsic Value there. And if the market is a Game, then the statisticians’ destruction of charting may not be as important as it sounds. Enough Chartists acting together become a market force themselves. Perhaps the Chartists simply belong to the irrational, as yet unmeasured, Australopithecus side of the market. There is still one other bias extant toward the academics, which should be recorded, and that is the lecture in the language which the listener does not speak, i.e., quadratic equations. “There is a special paradox in the relationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on common stocks,” wrote Benjamin Graham, the dean of all security analysts, in The Intelligent Investor: Mathematics is ordinarily considered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.

If you will look at our notes 1 through 16 in the back, you will see that Zilch’s earnings can be played like a guitar, depending on what we count or don’t count. We picked $1. That is consistent with what other accountants are doing this year. We’ll let next year take care of itself.” Numbers imply precision, so it is a bit hard to get used to the idea that a company’s net profit could vary by 100 percent depending on which bunch of accountants you call in, especially when the market is going to take that earnings number and create trends, growth rates, and little flashing lights in computers from it. And all this without any kind of skulduggery you could get sent to jail for. How can this be? Let’s say you are an airline, and you buy a brand-new, freshly painted Boeing 727. Let’s say the airplane costs you $5 million. At some point in the future the airplane is going to be worth 0, because its useful life will be over. So you must charge your income each year with a fraction of the cost of your airplane. What is the life of your airplane? You say the useful life of the airplane is ten years, so on a straight-line basis you will charge your income $500,000, or 10 percent of the cost, this year. If your net income from ferrying passengers and cargo is $1 million, it will drop by ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2358))

- half when you apply this depreciation charge. Obviously the year you buy the airplane your earnings are going to look worse than they are next year, when you have the full use of the airplane and it is shuttling back and forth all the time. Your profits will certainly look better if you are still running that airplane in eleven years, because that year there will be no charge at all for depreciation; it will have been written off. But that is only the beginning of the complications. Right next door at the airport is another airline. It has also bought a brand-new, freshly painted Boeing 727. So you and your competitor can be compared side by side when you both report your earnings on the same day. Right? Hardly. The airline next door says it can run an airplane twelve years. So it is depreciating its airplane over twelve years, and its depreciation charge this year is 1/12, not 1/10, so it has only penalized its earnings $416,666 instead of $500,000, and for this year on that basis it has made more money than you have. Don’t the accountants make everybody charge the same thing for the same airplane? No, they don’t. It just makes another little bit of work for the security analysts, who have to adjust the varying depreciation rates to constants. Accountants are not some kind of super-authority, they are professionals employed by clients. If you say the life of your airplane is twelve years, you must know your business; the life is twelve years. Delta Airlines depreciates a 727 in ten years; United in sixteen. The airplane example is, of course, a very simple one. ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2375))

- But what about two second-generation computers, say a Honeywell H200 and something in the IBM 1400 series? Do they have the same life? They may, as far as usage is concerned, but if you are going to sell or trade up it may be easier on the IBM. Then there is an investment credit available on new equipment, a tax assist passed to encourage capital expenditures. Is the investment credit “flowed through,” as the jargon says, right to the earnings the first year? Or is the investment credit spread through the whole life of the equipment? If everybody used the same depreciation method but with different periods of use, life would be tough enough. But equipment is not always depreciated straight-line, an equal percentage for each year. Some companies use heavy charges at the beginning, say 150 percent declining. Some use a method with the charming appellation “sum-of-the-years-digits.” If you really want to go into details, call up your accountant and ask him for definitions. This is only the beginning. Look at inventories: Some companies value their inventories last-in, first-out. Some companies charge their research costs as they incur them, some amortize them over several years. Some companies amortize their unfunded pension costs; some… ([Location 2387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2387))

- purchase, a pooling of interests, or a combination of the two. Good will can be amortized or not amortized. The base of depreciation can vary wildly. In short, there is not a company anywhere whose income statement and profits cannot be changed, by the management and the accountants, by counting things one way instead of another. Not too long ago Price Waterhouse did a study captioned with the rhetorical question, “Is Generally Accepted Accounting for Income Taxes Possibly Misleading Investors?” Generally—but not always—a real sleuth of an analyst who doesn’t have to spend time answering his own phone, talking to customers, selling stock to pension funds, and attending meetings, can crack an income statement and balance sheet in a couple of days. This means real donkey work, digging out notes, making comparisons, finding the tunnels, and in general unpainting the carefully painted picture. But most analysts do have to answer their own phones, sell stocks, attend meetings—and still cover all the developments in their areas. So there are not many who can do the job. Even if every analyst could do this job, there are ten times as many brokers as analysts, and 200 times as many eager customers as brokers, so you can see the odds against Truth at… ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2399))

- But they are hired by corporations, not by investors. Not only are they professionals hired by the corporations, but they are frequently further involved in company affairs as tax and management consultants. For years, Wall Street accepted with religious faith an accountant’s certification as the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, especially those of the great national accounting firms, Price Waterhouse, Haskins & Sells, Arthur Andersen, and so on. Then came a couple of cases in which corporations reported profits, had their reports audited and certified, only to come back several years later and say that the original certified reports were, for one reason or another, off by a very wide mark. In the famous and well-publicized instance of Yale Express, the corporation reported profits for the years it was sliding into bankruptcy. (It is now being reorganized under Chapter X of the bankruptcy laws.) The angry stockholders took to the courts, suing not only Yale Express, but Peat, Marwick, the Certified Public Accountants who had put their seal on Yale Express’ reports. The air is now full of litigation, and it is not our purpose here to get into it. Suffice to say that with lawyers and the SEC in full cry, the accountants have begun to try to thread some consistencies, but there is genuine confusion among these accountants as to what earnings really are. Corporations, they say, are not all the same, and there has to be some flexibility just to reflect the differences in businesses. The accountants have my sympathy. But not much of it. I have a lingering skepticism about reported numbers, because I have lost money accepting the reports of accountants, and there is nothing like losing money to burn in a lesson. A leading Wall Street publication says the letters CPA do not stand for Certified Public Accountant but Certified Public Assassin. I will tell you the origins of my own anti-accountant bias in a minute. It may serve you to listen well. If the profit numbers on income statements are treated with such reverence, it was obviously only a question of time before some smart fellows would start building companies not around the logical progression of a business but around what would beef up the numbers. Such a corporation is called a “conglomerate” or a “free-form” company, very popular when the market gets to tulip-time.

- So I suppose there is a right way to do everything, but I was once bitten by an accounting firm. As you know, the price of the stock depends to some degree on numbers, such as the numbers describing the profits. If you are only in the sealing-wax business, there is only so much leeway about what is a profit and what isn’t, short of actually fudging, which is frowned upon. But if you are busy buying and selling companies, every time they pass through your accounting firm you get the chance to try to describe artistically some of the assets as earnings, to capitalize costs that have previously been expensed, and in general to create what Wall Street is looking for, which is a neat pattern of constantly growing earnings. If you really want to know all the accounting tricks, ask your accountant, or if he is loyal to his brethren you can call up Bart Biggs, who runs a hedge fund in Connecticut and is good at spotting tricks.

- If all the numbers, accounting variations, computer systems, and infinite possibilities are beginning to bewilder you, there is one indicator that professionals still use that is simple. That is to find out what the average investor, or the little investor, is doing. Then you do just the opposite. The sophisticates never feel comfortable unless they can be reassured that relatively uninformed investors are going the other way with some conviction. It all has to do with Accumulation and Distribution. When the sophisticates are Accumulating, they have to be Accumulating from someone, and when they are Distributing, somebody has to be there to buy. There is nothing really new about this.

I missed it, every day I wasn’t in it. I enjoy talking to an intelligent broker, exchanging views. The truth is, I can’t stand to stay out of the action. I love the market.” “Tell me something,” I said. “I know it’s hard to keep track, because you’ve taken money out for a new car, and so on, but have you ever added up what your record is?” “Sure,” Robert said. “I started with nine thousand dollars, that I got when my uncle died. And I took some out, for the car and so on, and I’ve learned a lot, and I know what I’ve been doing wrong, and I’m very confident about the future.” “And what is the nine thousand now?” “I still have twenty-one hundred left,” Robert said. I have to confess that Robert can almost make me a believer in a theory that has been quite erratic, and I hope to keep in touch. Actually, Robert is part of a bigger picture; all individuals have been consistent sellers for years now, no matter what the size of their accounts, round lots as well as odd lots, because the pension funds have been the big buyers and there does have to be a seller for each buyer. The volume has been enormous, but part of that has been because some of the institutions forgot how big they had grown and were trying to get out of stocks and into cash and then back into stocks like elephants in a ballet.

The portfolio manager’s charter came from an ancient case, Amory vs. Harvard College, 1831, which ruled that a fiduciary act “as would any Prudent Man.” To be a Prudent Man, one preserved capital, one was conservative, one ate breakfast, lunched at the Club, and died with an estate that won the admiration of the lawyers for its order and efficiency. The Prudent Man managing securities did his business with his classmates who happened to be brokers, and in a radical move he might reduce Steels from 3.3 percent to 2.9 percent of the portfolio, and buy a little more Telephone. Then a couple of things happened. One was that a new group of managers came along. You remember—there is a Missing Generation on Wall Street because nobody went there from 1929 to 1947. The generation that came in during the twenties is now in its sixties and seventies; the next generation is in its thirties or early forties. The difference in the attitudes of the generations is even greater than the usual fracas between fathers and sons. To the elder generation, the Depression of the thirties was a profound, traumatic experience.

- from seventy dollars to fifty cents. American Founders made it to fifty cents from $117. It is a sobering experience to read through—as once I did—all the Wall Street Journals and Barron’s from 1929 to 1933. Quarterly, reports came out saying, “the outlook is favorable,” “a sustained recovery is on its way,” and so on. But nobody was listening. Those on margin had been sold out in 1929 and 1930. But from 1930 to 1933, a real blight of the spirit took place. The Prudent Men, not on margin, believing in the Long-Term Growth of the American Economy, saw their unmargined holdings in the bluest of American blue chips drop by 80 to 90 percent. Professor Irving Fisher of Yale, who had immortalized himself by stating, on October 17, 1929, that “Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau,” had to move the plateau down 90 percent and join the ranks of Gustave Le Bon. “It was the psychology of panic,” he explained. “It was mob psychology, and it was not, primarily, that the price level of the market was unsoundly high.… the fall in the market was very largely due to the psychology by which it went down because it went down.” The senior generation—those who hung on—lived not only to see better days but to see real prosperity. But for most of them, the shadow of Deflation hung always over one shoulder; there was always a chance that it might happen again, and this feeling, even unconscious, took a lot of conscious effort to overcome. To the next generation the Depression was only a dim memory, and Inflation was much more visible: The haircuts that once cost fifty cents cost seventy-five cents and then one dollar and then two. The next generation also arrived at positions of responsibility without the thirty-year apprenticeship that can bank the fires of the most ambitious. So there was the new generation, itching to shake things up because the old boys had been in the wrong game for twenty years. Simultaneously, discretionary income—what is left after the essentials for food, clothing, and shelter are taken out of the paycheck—began to burgeon. Middle-class savings turned into a torrent of money. Investments in mutual funds went from $1.3 billion in 1946 to $35 billion in 1967. Pension funds increased in size to $150 billion. And then one day there was a pool of money $400 billion strong accounting for half the business done on the New York Stock… ([Location 2717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2717))

- of the erosion of the dollar, out of the capital gains available from the companies that had some sort of lock on something, technological or otherwise. You can almost see the point in time when “performance” surfaced. In February, 1966, Gerry Tsai, born in Shanghai and tutored at Fidelity, came to New York. He had been running Fidelity Capital. He had a reputation as a shrewd trader, and he was doing well, but, as he told Mister Johnson, “I want to have a little fund of my own.” Gerry thought maybe he could raise $25 million, and so did the underwriters, Bache & Co. But the spirit was abroad in the land. The orders went over $50 million to $100 million, finally to $274 million on the first day, and within a year to more than $400 million. Gerry Tsai was not the first “performance” manager; Mister Johnson and Jack Dreyfus had pioneered that well. But he was the first real “star.” Joe Namath may not have been the best quarterback in a decade, but the idea that Sonny Werblen had paid $400,000 for a quarterback gave a new dimension to a pro football league because nobody had ever paid that much for a quarterback. So Gerry Tsai became a part of They, and men could sound wise by watching the tape and saying, “Ah, Gerry is buying again.” Once the tide of “performance” started, there was no stopping. More fund managements started aggressive, capital-gains-oriented funds. The officials responsible for pension funds thought they could use a little growth in those funds, instead of sticking to bonds all the time. The University of Rochester and Wesleyan University turned small investments into sizable endowments by aggressive investing, and pretty soon the trustees of other universities were coming into the great trust companies which handled their endowments and saying, “Rochester has come from nowhere to the fifth-richest university, and Wesleyan is building new buildings all over the place, and they did it with Xerox, find us another Xerox.” McGeorge Bundy, head of the Ford Foundation, said, in a blast that is still echoing: It is far from clear that trustees have reason to be proud of their performance in making money for their colleges. We recognize the risks of unconventional investing, but the true test of performance in the handling of money is the record of achievement, not the opinion of the respectable.

- well virtually beg to be dropped off. If you have two hundred stocks, no one of them can make a real difference to you, but if you have only six stocks, you are really going to be watching all six. Furthermore, you are going to be scouting for the best six ideas, because if you find a really good one it may bump one of your other ones off the list. Turnover means how long you hold the stocks. If you buy stocks and put them away, your turnover is 0. If on December 31 you have replaced all the stocks you had the previous January with other stocks, your turnover is 100 percent. It used to be that a bank trust department would have a turnover of 2 percent or so and a mutual fund might turn over at 10 percent. Now the bank trust departments are turning over at 10 percent and the aggressive funds are turning over at more than 100 percent. All that turnover has doubled the volume in the last couple of years, and the brokers are getting very rich. You can see that if the “performance” fund managers like a stock, and it is not a great, broadly traded stock, that stock is going to go up. And if they own it and something turns sour, there can be a stampede for the exits. There were some remarkable examples of this in 1966, when Fairchild camera, up from 28 to 220 in a year, dropped 100 points in six weeks. With all that concentration, the time horizon shortens considerably. If the report for the next quarter is going to be disappointing, you are going to try to beat the other managers out of the stock, perhaps to buy back in some other day. So there derives a great hunger for short-term information. Add to this the “technical” and computer work of Albert and Irwin, which flags every movement, and you can get a very volatile and nervous group of stocks, if not an entire stock market. It all began to bug William Mc-Chesney Martin, the head of the Federal Reserve, last year. He made some headlines with this statement: Increasingly, managers of mutual funds, and portfolio and pension fund administrators, are measuring their success in terms of relatively short-term market performance. In effect, they set a target on a growth stock, attain that target, unload, and then seek other opportunities. Given the large buying power of their institutions, there is an obvious risk that speculative in-and-out trading of this type may virtually corner the market in individual stocks.… ([Location 2778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=2778))

- On the floor of the Stock Exchange stand, at various posts, gentlemen called specialists. They are supposed to make sure the market is orderly and smooth. When a broker arrives with a stock to sell, they buy it from him; if he arrives with cash to buy, they sell stock to him. Perhaps they sell the stock to him out of their own inventory, and when they buy, they use their own capital. Thus they cushion the swings in the market. It all works pretty well for 100- and 500-share orders, although I (and everybody else) have been witness to specialists who do not exactly hold their ground when the first shot is fired. This is not the place for a discussion of the Role of the Specialist, but that Role is the subject of some professional discussion. When three funds, each with 100,000 shares to sell, arrive at the opening on the same morning, the specialist simply cannot handle it. He calls a Governor of the Stock Exchange and asks for time to round up buyers. They “shut the stock down” it simply ceases trading. If you arrive five minutes later with fifty shares to sell, you are out of luck. You might as well sell them to your brother-in-law. The stock may reopen that day, or the next day, or the day after.

Our good Lord Keynes had it all spotted in 1935, in one of the most acute passages ever written: It might have been supposed that competition between expert professionals, possessing judgment and knowledge beyond that of the average private investor, would correct the vagaries of the ignorant individual left to himself. It happens, however, that the energies and skill of the professional investor and speculator are mainly occupied otherwise. For most of these persons are, in fact, largely concerned, not with making superior long-term forecasts of the probable yield of an investment over its whole life, but with foreseeing changes in the conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public.

The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future. The actual, private object of the most skilled investment today is “to beat the gun,” as the Americans so well express it, to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depreciating, half-crown to the other fellow. This battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation a few months hence, rather than the prospective yield of an investment over a long term of years, does not even require gulls amongst the public to feed the maws of the professional; it can be played by the professionals amongst themselves.

- You should make one note of my own bias in this account. From the previous list of biases you can see that anything other than “performance” is, to use the words of the Master, “intolerably boring and overexacting.” The name of the game is making money, not sitting on it. I happen to know a number of fund managers, and they belie the old stereotype of Wall Street. To most Vassar juniors—and to many other people—a money manager has to be a dull fellow. He wears a vest and is boring, pretentious, and pompous. “Performance” managers can be very good company, just as diplomats or foreign correspondents or any group that represents a cross of disciplines can be. They have to be alert, they must keep constantly scanning for changes in the environment and for new ideas, because literally anything that happens can have an effect on all that money. They have to be good brain pickers, and a good brain picker is usually alive enough to be a good dinner companion. Of course, the “performance” funds still represent only a tiny fraction of all the managed money. The influence of the trend extends far beyond the actual amounts of money involved. There are still a lot of vests around, and a lot of bankers who disapprove of everything that swings. It may all go too far, and they may be right. At the moment “performance” seems like the logical reaction to a worldwide inflation, an inflation that reflects the aspirations of much of society running ahead of society’s ability to pay for these aspirations on a current basis, or at least the discipline of paying for aspirations in the traditional way.

- We live in an age of charts and computers, and the thing about charts and computer studies is that they show what is moving, and if everybody plays this game, then what moves is what is already moving. Sort of Newtonian. This may sound simplistic, but that’s the way the game is played. The trouble is that unless you have peripheral vision and extrasensory perception, you get mousetrapped very easily, and a lot of very sophisticated performance fund managers were caught in the Great Mousetrap of 1966.

- I asked Charley why Grenville was suddenly Poor Grenville. “Poor Grenville,” said Charley, “has gotten caught with twenty-five million in cash. It’s a disaster. How would you like to have twenty-five million in cash with the Buy Signals you’ve just seen? Come to lunch. Poor Grenville has to lose his cash, right away.” I know it sounds a little funny that having $25 million in cash is a disaster. It sounds just as funny to me as the phrase “lose cash,” when it isn’t your cash in the first place and all you are doing is taking the cash—somebody else’s—and buying stocks with it. But professional money managers love to say, “We lost five million in cash this afternoon,” meaning they bought stocks with it. I guess ([Location 3018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3018))

- it sounds professional. Just as underwriters say, “We lost two thousand shares to Hutton and four thousand to Hornblower,” when what they mean is they sold these shares and busted a gut trying. As to why Poor Grenville’s $25 million in cash was a major disaster, that is more comprehensible. Grenville should have all $100 million fully invested if the market is coming off the floor, his fund is “performance-oriented,” trying for big capital gains. If Poor Grenville has $25 million in cash he guessed dead wrong at the bottom of the market, and in one career you don’t get too many chances like that. Poor Grenville had gotten himself all ready for a big drop in October and now in January the market turned around and ran away without him. He has to make it up in a hurry. So we slide into this booth at the Lunch Club—Poor Grenville, Charley, myself and two brokers. Poor Grenville’s nails are bitten down to the nubs, a clear sign that he is one of the young gunslingers in trading stocks. To the average observer, Poor Grenville, with his height and his golden locks and his Repp tie, looks like an ad for Establishment splendor. But the nails do not denote serenity; the nails are a gunslinger’s nails. “You’re my friends,” Poor Grenville says to Charley and one of the brokers. “What do I do?” The other broker is along to generate some commissions out of Poor Grenville’s misery if he can. “I have been thinking about your problem,” starts the broker pretentiously. “I have brought along some studies done ([Location 3024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3024))

- by my firm, which I think you will find …” “Who is this guy?” Poor Grenville says, cutting him off. “Cut it out,” Charley says. “You’ll get your commissions if we can help Poor Grenville here.” “We have some very nice aluminums this afternoon, just designed to get you out of the hole,” says the first broker. “Capacity situation good, price rises sticking, stocks fairly well sold out and not too far off the bottom. A lot of funds haven’t bought aluminums yet. You’re safe in the middle. Alcoa, Kaiser, Harvey …” “Not now,” Poor Grenville says. “Earlier, or later. Right now I have to make up for lost time. If we’re really in a bull market.” “It doesn’t matter at this point whether it’s a big rally in a bear market or a new bull market,” says Charley. “If you’re not in it, you’re dead.” “Rubbers,” says the first broker. “We have some very nice rubbers. U.S. Rubber, B.F. Goodrich, replacement demand, adequate price structure …” “Not sexy enough,” says Poor Grenville. “Later. In June. We have two quarters of the year coming up in which everybody will be saying business is going to turn up at the end of the year. So I don’t want business-turning-up stocks. I have two quarters to play.” “Let’s work backwards,” Charley says helpfully. “It’s March thirty-first. You have to put out your quarterly report. What big winners must you have bought? They won’t know whether you ([Location 3037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3037))

- bought them March thirtieth or January second, as long as they’re in there.” “Polaroid,” says Poor Grenville mournfully. “Fairchild.” He coughs, he can barely get the words out, “Solitron.” I nudge Charley and ask him why Poor Grenville is coughing over these words. “Because he just sold them all sixty days ago,” Charley whispers. “And they are up fifty percent since then.” “Can I buy them?” Poor Grenville asks, meaning is the market smooth enough to put a couple million dollars to work without forcing the stock. “In this market you can,” Charley says. “When they’re trading fifty thousand shares a day, you can spoon in okay.” “Okay,” Poor Grenville says. “What else?” “The garbage is moving,” Charley says. “It is the best garbage market since sixty-one.” By garbage Charley means the untried-and-untrue stocks, some of them over the counter, all of them with hairy “stories,” wild gleams in their eyes. “Tell me some stories,” Poor Grenville says. By now both the brokers are just listening to Charley; they are really out of their league. “Well, you know the Itek story,” Charley says. “Another Xerox, as soon as they figure out how to do whatever it is they do cheap enough, and that could be a long time,” says Poor Grenville. Charley shrugs. “You know the EGG story? Edgerton, Germeshausen and Grier? They are going to blow up atomic bombs under exhausted oil wells and bring up more oil that way.” ([Location 3051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3051))

- “What’s it worth without blowing up atomic bombs?” asks Poor Grenville. “There’s already fifteen points of atomic bombs in the stock,” Charley says. Poor Grenville leans forward. “What about the real garbage?” he says. And everybody falls to, like a pack of hounds that has caught up with a rabbit Rumors, tips, remarks from barbers, usually you get this stuff at the tail end of a bull market. It sounds like the fall of 1961 all over again: tetronics, computeronics, New Science Horizons. Charley mentions a brand-new little company on the periphery of the computer business. “What’s it going to earn?” Poor Grenville asks. “Last week it was selling at eight, and I heard it was going to earn forty cents,” Charley says. “This week it is at eleven and I hear it is going to earn seventy cents. By next week it will be selling at fifteen and you will hear they have one dollar in the bag, easy.” Logic, to an outsider, would say that you have a company selling at 10 and you go and do a lot of research on it and figure out the sales and the profits and you figure if they can earn one dollar it will sell at 20. So you buy it and wait and the story gets that they earn… ([Location 3066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3066))

- earnings must be falling apart. If it is going up, the earnings must be better than we thought. Somebody must know something we don’t know. With all the analysts and all the research and all the statistics and all the computers, it is still possible to be 51 percent wrong, and you can do better than that by flipping a coin. Anyway, Poor Grenville got back in the market, $25 million in one big gulp. He bought a mixture of high flyers like Xerox, Polaroid, and garbage. And that was part of the reason for the roily-boily market we had a while ago. The cyclical stocks reflecting business were sold down all they would go. Then along came Poor Grenville and his gunslinger competitors selling stocks because stocks were going down, riding with the trend instead of against it. Some of them must have been reading the charts upside down, or their Chartists have mirror-image reading problems and made the x’s go in the wrong direction. When the gunslingers hit the volatile stocks, Fairchild and Xerox and Polaroid and what have you, they knocked them down 80 hard that the x’s on the chart made downtrend lines and then the downtrend said sell, and then you just didn’t want to show… ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VSLI6NI&location=3078))

- even just some stocks—made spectacular gains, the market took on a very ruddy glow. All the Grenvilles getting in together fired up the market, and then the marks were there on the charts, saying “Up.” Poor Grenville made out all right.
