## Highlights
- The fact is that solving problems is hard. If a given problem still exists, you can bet that a lot of people have already ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=302))

- come along and failed to solve it. Easy problems evaporate; it is the hard ones that linger. Furthermore, it takes a lot of time to track down, organize, and analyze the data to answer even one small question well.* So rather than trying and probably failing to answer most of the questions sent our way, we wondered if it might be better to write a book that can teach anyone to think like a Freak. What might that look like? ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=303))

- While a penalty kick aimed at the center of the goal is significantly more likely to succeed, only 17 percent of kicks are aimed there. Why so few? One reason is that at first glance, aiming center looks like a terrible idea. Kicking the ball straight at the goalkeeper? That just seems unnatural, an obvious violation of common sense—but then so did the idea of preventing a disease by ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=339))

- injecting people with the very microbes that cause it. Furthermore, one advantage the kicker has on a penalty kick is mystery: the keeper doesn’t know where he will aim. If kickers did the same thing every time, their success rate would plummet; if they started going center more often, keepers would adapt. There is a third and important reason why more kickers don’t aim center, especially in a high-stakes setting like the World Cup. But no soccer player in his right mind would ever admit it: the fear of shame. Imagine again you are the player about to take that penalty kick. At this most turbulent moment, what is your true incentive? The answer might seem obvious: you want to score the goal to ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=341))

- win the game for your team. If that’s the case, the statistics plainly show you should kick the ball dead center. But is winning the game your truest incentive? Picture yourself standing over the ball. You have just mentally committed to aiming for the center. But wait a minute—what if the goalkeeper doesn’t dive? What if for some reason he stays at home and you kick the ball straight into his gut, and he saves his country without even having to budge? How pathetic you will seem! Now the keeper is the hero and you must move your family abroad to avoid… ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=348))

If you follow the communal incentive—trying to win the game… ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=354))

- If asked how we’d behave in a situation that pits a private benefit against the greater good, most of us won’t admit to favoring the private benefit. But as history clearly shows, most people, whether because of nature or nurture, generally put their own interests ahead of others’. This doesn’t make them bad people; it just makes them human. But all this self-interest can be frustrating if your ambitions are larger than simply securing some small private victory. Maybe you want to ease poverty, or make government work better, or persuade your company to pollute less, or just get your kids to stop fighting. How are you supposed to get everyone to pull in the same direction when they are all pulling primarily for themselves? We wrote this book to answer that sort of question. It strikes us that in recent years, the idea has arisen that there is a “right” way to think about solving a given problem and of course a “wrong” way too. This inevitably leads to a lot of shouting—and, sadly, a lot of unsolved problems. Can this situation be improved upon? We hope so. We’d like to bury the idea that there’s a right way and a wrong way, a smart way and a foolish way, a red way and a blue way. The modern world demands… ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=360))

- Our first two books were animated by a relatively simple set of ideas: Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, deciphering them—is the key to understanding a problem, and how it might be solved. Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so. There is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction, especially with emotional, hot-button topics. The conventional wisdom is often wrong. And a blithe acceptance of it can lead to sloppy, wasteful, or even dangerous outcomes. Correlation does not equal causality. When two things travel together, it is tempting to assume that one causes the other. Married people, for instance, are demonstrably happier than single people; does this mean that marriage causes happiness? Not necessarily. The data suggest that happy people are more likely to get married in the first place. As one researcher memorably put it, “If you’re grumpy, who the hell wants to marry you?” This book builds on these same core ideas, but there is a difference. The first two books were rarely prescriptive. For the most part, we simply used data to tell stories we found interesting, shining a light on parts of society that often lay in shadow. This book steps out of the shadows and tries to offer some advice that may occasionally be useful, whether you are interested in minor lifehacks… ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=372))

- far from it. The economic approach is both broader and simpler than that. It relies on data, rather than hunch or ideology, to understand how the world works, to learn how incentives succeed (or fail), how resources get allocated, and what sort of obstacles prevent people from getting those resources, whether they are concrete (like food and transportation) or more aspirational (like education and love). There is nothing magical about this way of thinking. It usually traffics in the obvious and places a huge premium on common sense. So here’s the bad news: if you come to this book hoping for the equivalent of a magician spilling his secrets, you may be disappointed. But there’s good news too: thinking like a Freak is simple enough that anyone can do it. What’s perplexing is that so few people do. Why is that? One reason is that it’s easy to let your biases—political, intellectual, or otherwise—color your view of the world. A growing body of research suggests that even the smartest people tend to seek out evidence that confirms what they already think, rather than new information that would give them a more robust view of reality. It’s also tempting to run with a herd. Even on the most important issues of the day, we often adopt the views of our friends, families, and colleagues. (You’ll read more on this in Chapter 6.) On some level, this makes sense: it is easier to fall in line with what your family and friends think than to find new family and friends! But running with the herd means we are quick to embrace the status quo, slow to change our minds, and happy to delegate our thinking. Another barrier to thinking like a Freak is that most people are too busy to rethink the way they think—or to even spend much time thinking at all. When was the last time you sat for an hour of… ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=387))

- We too try to think once or twice a week (though surely not as cleverly as Shaw) and encourage you to do the same. This is not to say you should necessarily want to think like a Freak. It presents some potential downsides. You may find yourself way, way out of step with the prevailing winds. You might occasionally say things that make other people squirm. Perhaps, for instance, you meet a lovely, conscientious couple with three children, and find yourself blurting out that child car seats are a waste of time and money (at least that’s what the crash-test data say). Or, at a holiday dinner with your new girlfriend’s family, you blather on about how the local-food movement can actually hurt the environment—only to learn that her father is a hard-core locavore, and everything on the table was grown within… ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=405))

- like the U.K.’s, health care is virtually the only part of the economy where individuals can go out and get nearly any service they need and pay close to zero, whether the actual cost of the procedure is $100 or $100,000. What’s wrong with that? When people don’t pay the true cost of something, they tend to consume it inefficiently. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=460))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This sort of overconsumption can be more easily tolerated when health care is only a small part of the economy. But with health-care costs approaching 10 percent of GDP in the U.K.—and nearly double that in the United States—you have to seriously rethink how it is provided, and paid for.

- When asked to name the attributes of someone who is particularly bad at predicting, Tetlock needed just one word. “Dogmatism,” he says. That is, an unshakable belief they know something to be true even when they don’t. Tetlock and other scholars who have tracked prominent pundits find that they tend to be “massively overconfident,” in Tetlock’s words, even when their predictions prove stone-cold wrong. That is a lethal combination—cocky plus wrong—especially when a more prudent option exists: simply admit that the future is far less knowable than you think.

- Every time we pretend to know something, we are doing the same: protecting our own reputation rather than promoting the collective good.

- There is one more explanation for why so many of us think we know more than we do. It has to do with something we all carry with us everywhere we go, even though we may not consciously think about it: a moral compass. Each of us develops a moral compass (some stronger than others, to be sure) as we make our way through the world. This is for the most part a wonderful thing. Who wants to live in a world where people run around with no regard ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=632))

- for the difference between right and wrong? But when it comes to solving problems, one of the best ways to start is by putting away your moral compass. Why? When you are consumed with the rightness or wrongness of a given issue—whether it’s fracking or gun control or genetically engineered food—it’s easy to lose track of what the issue actually is. A moral compass can convince you that all the answers are obvious (even when they’re not); that there is a bright line between right and wrong (when often there isn’t); and, worst, that you are certain you already know everything you need to know about a subject so you stop trying to learn more.

- a ship’s compass found it occasionally gave erratic readings that threw them off course. Why? The increasing use of metal on ships—iron nails and hardware, the sailors’ tools and even their buckles and buttons—messed with the compass’s magnetic read. Over time, sailors went to great lengths to keep metal from interfering with the compass. With such an evasive measure in mind, we are not suggesting you toss your moral compass in the trash—not at all—but only that you temporarily set it aside, to prevent it from clouding your vision.

- That is in part because the very words “education reform” indicate that the question is “What’s wrong with our schools?” when in reality, the question might be better phrased as “Why do American kids know less than kids from Estonia and Poland?” When you ask the question differently, you look for answers in different places.

- Here is the broader point: whatever problem you’re trying to solve, make sure you’re not just attacking the noisy part of the problem that happens to capture your attention. Before spending all your time and resources, it’s incredibly important to properly define the problem—or, better yet, redefine the problem.

- Can the success of Takeru Kobayashi, as magnificent as it was, be applied to anything more significant than the high-speed consumption of hot dogs? We believe it can. If you think like a Freak, there are at least two broader lessons to be gleaned from his approach. The first is about problem solving generally. Kobayashi redefined the problem he was trying to solve. What question ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=991))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- were his competitors asking? It was essentially: How do I eat more hot dogs? Kobayashi asked a different question: How do I make hot dogs easier to eat? This question led him to experiment and gather the feedback that changed the game. Only by redefining the problem was he able to discover a new set of solutions. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=993))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The second lesson to be drawn from Kobayashi’s success has to do with the limits that we accept, or refuse to. Over dinner that night at Cafe Luxembourg, Kobayashi said that when he started training, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the existing Coney Island record of 25⅛ HDB. Why? He reasoned that the record didn’t stand ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1003))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- for much since his earlier competitors had been asking the wrong question about eating hot dogs. As he saw it, the record was an artificial barrier. So he went into the contest not thinking about 25⅛ as any sort of an upper bound. He instructed his mind to pay zero attention to the number of dogs he was eating and to concentrate solely on how he ate them. Would he still have won that first contest if he had mentally honored the barrier of 25⅛? Perhaps, but it is hard to imagine he would have doubled the record.

- There is another case—a bizarre one, to be sure—in which the long arm of slavery reaches across history. Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard, is consumed with closing the gap between blacks and whites in education, income, and health. Not long ago, he set out to understand why whites outlive blacks by several years. One thing was clear: ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1147))

- heart disease, historically the biggest killer of both whites and blacks, is far more common among blacks. But why? Fryer crunched all sorts of numbers. But he found that none of the obvious stressors—diet, smoking, even poverty—could account for the entire gap. Then he found something that might. Fryer happened upon an old illustration called “An Englishman Tastes the Sweat of an African.” It showed a slave trader in West Africa who appeared to be licking the slave’s face. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1149))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Why would he do that? One possibility was that he was somehow screening the slave for illness, not wanting to contaminate the rest of his cargo. Fryer wondered if the slave trader was perhaps testing the slave’s “saltiness.” That, after all, is what sweat tastes like. If so, why—and might this answer inform the broader agenda Fryer was pursuing? The ocean journey of a slave from Africa to America was long and gruesome; many slaves died en route. Dehydration was a major cause. Who, Fryer wondered, is less likely to suffer from dehydration? Someone… ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1156))

- die during the Middle Passage. So perhaps the slave trader in the illustration wanted to find the saltier slaves in order to ensure his investment. Fryer, who is black, mentioned this theory to a Harvard colleague, David Cutler, a prominent health economist who is white. Cutler at first thought it was “absolutely crazy,” but upon deeper inspection it made sense. Indeed, some earlier medical research made a similar claim, although it was in considerable dispute. Fryer began to fit the pieces together. “You might think anyone who could survive a voyage like this would be very fit and… ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1161))

And salt sensitivity is a highly heritable trait, meaning that your descendants, i.e., black Americans, stand a pretty good chance of being hypertensive or of having cardiovascular disease.” Fryer looked for further evidence that might support his theory. American blacks are about 50 percent more likely to have hypertension than American whites. Again, this could be due to differences like diet and income. So what did the hypertension rates of other black populations look like? Fryer found that among Caribbean… ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1167))

The evidence was hardly conclusive, but Fryer was convinced that the selection mechanism of the slave trade could be a long-lasting root cause of African-Americans’ higher mortality rates. As you can imagine, Fryer’s theory isn’t universally popular. Many people are uncomfortable talking about genetic racial difference at all. “People e-mail me and say, ‘Can’t you see the slippery slope here!? Can you see the perils of this argument?’” Fresh medical research may prove that the salt-sensitivity theory isn’t even right.

- Consider the kind of questions that kids ask. Sure, they may be silly or simplistic or out of bounds. But kids are also relentlessly curious and relatively unbiased. Because they know so little, they don’t carry around the preconceptions that often stop people from seeing things as they are. When it comes to solving problems, this is a big advantage. Preconceptions lead us to rule out a huge set of possible solutions simply because they seem unlikely or repugnant; because they don’t pass the smell test or have never been tried; because they don’t seem sophisticated enough.* But remember, it was a child who finally pointed out that the Emperor’s new ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1295))

(One trick that works for us is a cooling-off period. Ideas nearly always seem brilliant when they’re hatched, so we never act on a new idea for at least twenty-four hours.

- Let’s consider one situation in which kids are better than adults despite all the years of experience and training that should give adults the edge. Imagine for a moment you are a magician. If your life depended on fooling an audience of adults or an audience of kids, whom would you choose? The obvious answer would be the kids. Adults, after all, know so much more about how things work. But in reality, kids are harder to fool. “Every magician will tell you the same thing,” says Alex Stone, whose book Fooling Houdini explores the science of deception.

- “When you really start to look at magic and how it works—the sort of nuts and bolts of how magic fools us—you start to ask some rather profound questions,” he says. “You know, how do we perceive reality? How much of what we perceive is actually real? How much faith can we have in our memories?” Stone, who holds an advanced physics degree, is himself a lifelong magician. His first gig was his own sixth birthday party. “It didn’t go well,” he says. “I was heckled. It was terrible. I was unprepared.” He got better and has since performed for all types of audiences, including leading scholars in biology,… ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1455))

- “double lift,” a common sleight in which a magician presents two cards as if they are one. That’s how a magician can show you “your” card, then seemingly bury it in the deck and make it reappear back on top. “It’s a devastating move,” Stone says. “Simple but very convincing.” Stone has performed many thousands of double lifts. “I’ve been burned by an adult layperson—i.e., not a magician—maybe twice in the last ten years. But I’ve been burned a bunch of times by kids.” Why are kids so much harder to deceive?

Adults are indeed better than kids at “paying attention,” or focusing on one task at a time. “This is great for getting stuff done,” Stone says, “but it also makes you susceptible to misdirection.” Kids’ attention, meanwhile, “is more diffuse, which makes them harder to fool.”        3.

In Stone’s experience, an adult may be hell-bent on blowing up a trick in order to upstage the magician. (Such people are called “hammers.”) A kid, meanwhile, “is really trying to figure out how the trick works, because that’s what you’re doing as a kid—trying to figure out how the world works.”        5. In certain ways, kids are simply sharper than adults. “We’re getting dumber as we get older, perceptually,” says Stone. “We just don’t notice as much after 18 or so. So with the double lift, kids may actually be noticing the slight difference in thickness between a single card and two cards stuck together.”        6. Kids don’t overthink a trick. Adults, meanwhile, seek out non-obvious explanations. “The theories that people come up with!” Stone says.

You’re back-palming the coin, and if kids are too low they might see it.” So by virtue of being low to the ground, a kid can short-circuit a process that has been laboriously built to be seen from above. Unless you’re a magician yourself, you’d never discover this advantage.

A recording that was widely reported to be a phone call with the driver was broadcast on the news. “If she is dead,” he explained, “I may pay only about 20,000 yuan”—roughly $3,200. “But if she is injured, it may cost me hundreds of thousands yuan.” There are no Good Samaritan laws in China, and compensatory damages for a long-term injury often run higher than death damages.

The most devoted carnivore in the world might well go vegan if the tofu lobby offered him a $10 million stipend. And then there’s the tale of an economist on holiday in Las Vegas. He found himself one night in a bar standing beside a gorgeous woman. “Would you be willing to sleep with me for $1 million?” he asked her. She looked him over. There wasn’t much to see—but still, $1 million! She agreed to go back to his room. “All right then, ” he said. “Would you be willing to sleep with me for $100?” “A hundred dollars!” she shot back. “What do you think I am, a prostitute?” “We’ve already established that.

- How to do this? The key is to learn to climb inside other people’s minds to figure out what really matters to them. Theoretically, this shouldn’t be so hard. We all have a lot of practice thinking about how we respond to incentives. Now it’s time to sit on the other side of the table, as in a good marriage, to understand what someone else wants. Yes, it may be money they’re after—but just as often they are motivated by wanting to be liked, or not be hated; by wanting to stand out in a crowd, or perhaps not stand out. The problem is that while some incentives are obvious, many aren’t. And simply asking people what they want or need doesn’t necessarily work. Let’s face it: human beings aren’t the most candid animals on the planet. We’ll often say one thing and do another—or, more precisely, we’ll say what we think other people want to hear and then, in private, do what we want. In economics, these are known as declared preferences and revealed preferences, and there is often a hefty gap between the two. When trying to figure out what kind of incentive will work in a given situation, it is crucial to keep your eye on this gap.

- Along the way, Brian Mullaney learned a great deal about the incentives that lead people to give money to a charity. This led him to try something so unusual that, as he says, “many people thought we were crazy.” ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1692))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The idea began with a simple question: Why do people give money to charity? This is one of those obvious questions that most smart people might not think to ask. Mullaney became consumed by it. A raft of academic research pointed to two main reasons:        1. People are truly altruistic, driven by a desire to help others.        2. Giving to charity makes them feel better about themselves; economists call this “warm-glow altruism.” Mullaney didn’t doubt these two factors. But he thought there was a third factor, which people didn’t talk about:        3. Once people are asked to donate, the social pressure is so great that they get bullied into giving, even though they wish they’d never been asked in the first place. Mullaney knew that number 3 was important to Smile Train’s success. That’s why their millions of mailings included a photograph of a disfigured child in need of cleft surgery. While no fund-raiser in his right mind would ever publicly admit to manipulating donors with social pressure, everyone knew how strong this incentive was. But what if, Mullaney thought, instead of downplaying the pressure, Smile Train were to highlight it? That is, what if Smile Train offered potential donors a way to alleviate the social pressure and give money at the same time?

- That’s how a strategy known as “once-and-done” was born. Here’s what Smile Train would tell potential donors: Make one gift now and we’ll never ask for another donation again. As far as Mullaney knew, a once-and-done strategy had never been tried before—and with good reason! In fund-raising, acquiring a new donor is difficult and expensive. Almost every charity initially loses money in this phase. But donors, once hooked, tend to give again and again. The secret to fund-raising success is cultivating these repeat givers—so the last thing you’d want to do is set them free as soon as you’ve hooked them. “Why would you ever agree to not harass donors when harassing is the main ingredient for success in direct mail?” Mullaney says.

- Smile Train took this harassment seriously. If you made an initial donation, you could expect an average of eighteen mailings a year. Once you gave to Smile Train, you were getting into a long-term relationship whether you liked it or not. But Mullaney suspected there was a whole universe of other people out there with no interest in a long-term relationship—and, indeed, who might be annoyed by Smile Train’s stalking. These people, he hypothesized, might be willing to pay Smile Train to stop sending them mail.

There’s the financial framework that governs everything we buy, sell, and trade. There’s an “us-versus-them” framework that defines war, sports, and, unfortunately, most political activity. The “loved-one” framework covers friends and family (at least when things are going smoothly; otherwise, look out for “us-versus-them”).

As much as people might like to think charitable giving is all about the altruism, the old ad salesman Brian Mullaney knew better.

- We don’t mean to create the impression that any problem can be fixed with a simple shift of the framework or a clever incentive. It can be frightfully hard to come up with incentives that work and continue to work over time. (Remember how easily a three-year-old girl with a taste for M&M’s played her father?) Plenty of incentives fail—and some fail so spectacularly that they produce even more of the bad behavior they were meant to stop. Mexico City has long suffered from dreadful traffic jams. The pollution is horrendous and it’s hard to get anywhere on time. Out of desperation, the government came up with a rationing plan. Drivers would have to leave their cars home one workday each week, with the particular day determined by the car’s license-plate number. The hope was that fewer cars would clog the roads, more people would use public transportation, and pollution would fall. How did the plan work out? The rationing led to more cars in circulation, no increase in the use of public transportation… ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=1818))

For every ton of carbon dioxide a factory eliminated, it would receive one credit.

Factories around the world, especially in China and India, began to churn out extra HCFC-22 in order to generate extra HFC-23 so they could rake in the cash.

One set of church records from thirteenth-century Hungary included 308 cases that entered the trial-by-ordeal phase. Of these, 100 were aborted before producing a final result. That left 208 cases in which the defendant was summoned by a priest to the church, climbed the altar, and—after his fellow congregants were ushered in to observe from a distance—was forced to grab hold of a red-hot iron bar.

As noted earlier, a guilty person and an innocent one will often respond to the same incentive in different ways. What are the guilty Adams and the innocent Adams thinking in this case?

Nearly every major automaker in the world, as well as Google, has successfully tested cars that use an onboard computer, GPS, cameras, radar, laser scanners, and actuators to do everything a human driver can do—but better. And since roughly 90 percent of the world’s 1.2 million traffic deaths each year—yes, 1.2 million deaths, every year!—are the result of driver error, the driverless car may be one of the biggest lifesavers in recent history. Unlike humans, a driverless car won’t drive drowsy or drunk, or while texting or applying mascara; it won’t change lanes while putting ketchup on french fries or turn around to smack its kids in the backseat. Google has already driven its fleet of autonomous cars more than 500,000 miles on real roads throughout the United States without causing an accident.* But safety isn’t the only benefit.

- So if you are hoping to damage opponents’ mental health, go ahead and tell them how inferior or dim-witted or nasty they are. But even if you are certifiably right on every point, you should not think for a minute that you will ever be able to persuade them. Name-calling will make you an enemy, not an ally, and if that is your objective, then persuasion is probably not what you were after in the first place.

- Why you should tell stories. We have saved for last the most powerful form of persuasion we know. Sure, it’s important to acknowledge the flaws in your argument and keep the insults to yourself, but if you really want to persuade someone who doesn’t wish to be persuaded, you should tell him a story. By “story,” we don’t mean “anecdote.” An anecdote is a snapshot, a one-dimensional shard of the big picture. It is lacking in scale, perspective, and data. (As scientists like to say: The plural of anecdote is not data.) An anecdote is something that once happened to you, or to your uncle, or to your uncle’s accountant. It is too often an outlier, the memorable exception that gets trotted out in an attempt to disprove a larger ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=2394))

- truth. My uncle’s accountant drives drunk all the time, and he’s never even had a fender-bender—so how dangerous can drunk driving be? Anecdotes often represent the lowest form of persuasion. A story, meanwhile, fills out the picture. It uses data, statistical or otherwise, to portray a sense of magnitude; without data, we have no idea how a story fits into the larger scheme of things. A good story also includes the passage of time, to show the degree of constancy or change; without a time frame, we can’t judge whether we’re looking at something truly noteworthy or just an anomalous blip. And a story lays out a daisy chain of events, to show the causes that lead up to a particular situation and the consequences that result from it.

- One reason is that a story exerts a power beyond the obvious. The whole is so much greater than the sum of the parts—the facts, the events, the context—that a story creates a deep resonance. Stories also appeal to the narcissist in all of us. As a story unspools, with its cast of characters moving through time and making decisions, we inevitably put ourselves in their shoes. Yes, I would have done that too! or No no no, I never would have made that decision! Perhaps the best reason to tell stories is simply that they capture our attention and are therefore good at teaching. Let’s say there’s a theory or concept or set of rules you need to convey.

- What the Encyclopedia proved, at least to Steve Epstein and his Pentagon colleagues, is that a rule makes a much stronger impression once a story illustrating said rule is lodged in your mind. The same lesson can be learned from one of the most widely read books in history: the Bible. What is the Bible “about”? Different people will of course answer that question differently. But we could all agree the Bible contains perhaps the most influential set of rules in human history: the Ten Commandments. They became the foundation of not only the Judeo-Christian tradition but of many societies at large. So surely most of us can recite the Ten Commandments front to back, back to front, and every way in between, right? All right then, go ahead and name the Ten Commandments. We’ll give you a minute to jog your memory . . . . . . . . . . . . Okay, here they are:        1. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage.        2.

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.       10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house, nor your neighbor’s wife . . . nor any thing that is your neighbor’s. How did you do? Probably not so well. But don’t worry—most people don’t.

But consider this: in the same survey, 25 percent of the respondents could name the seven principal ingredients of a Big Mac, while 35 percent could name all six kids from The Brady Bunch.

Its two patrons, the British and French governments, suspected the Concorde was not economically viable but had spent too many billions to stop. In simpler times, this was known as throwing good money after bad—but money is hardly the only resource that people toss into the sunk-cost trap. Think about all the time, brainpower, and social or political capital you continued to spend on some commitment only because you didn’t like the idea of quitting.

- quitting is a tendency to focus on concrete costs and pay too little attention to opportunity cost. This is the notion that for every dollar or hour or brain cell you spend on one thing, you surrender the opportunity to spend it elsewhere. Concrete costs are usually easy to calculate, but opportunity cost is harder. If you want to go back to school to get an MBA, you know it’ll cost two years’ time and $80,000—but what might you have done with that time and money had you not been in school? Or let’s say you’ve been a competitive runner for years and it’s still a big part of your identity—but what else might you accomplish if you weren’t slamming your joints into the pavement ten hours a week? Might you do something that makes your life, or others’ lives, more fulfilling, more productive, more exciting? Perhaps. If only you weren’t so worried about the sunk costs. If only you could quit.

- What if there were a way to peek around the corner on any project to see if it’s destined to fail—that is, if you could learn how you might fail without going to the trouble of actually failing?

You gather up everyone connected with a project and have them imagine that it launched and failed miserably. Now they each write down the exact reasons for its failure. Klein has found the premortem can help flush out the flaws or doubts in a project that no one had been willing to speak aloud. This suggests one way to make a premortem even more useful: offer anonymity. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BATINVS&location=2609))

- What you’d really like to do is find thousands of people teetering on the edge of quitting, who just can’t decide on the right path. Then, with one flick of a magic wand, you’d send a randomly chosen portion of those people down the quitting path while the rest carried on—and you’d get to sit back and observe how all their lives unfolded. Unfortunately, no such wand exists. (Not that we know of, at least. Maybe Intellectual Ventures—or the NSA—is working on it.) So we tried the next best thing. We set up a website, named it Freakonomics Experiments, and asked people to put their fate in our hands. Here’s what the home page said: HAVE A PROBLEM? Sometimes in life you face a major decision, and you just don’t know what to do. You’ve considered the issue from every angle. But no matter how you look at it, no decision seems to be the right decision. In the end, whatever you choose will essentially be a flip of a coin.

We ensured their anonymity, asked them to tell us their dilemma, and then flipped the coin. (Technically, it was a digital coin toss from a random number generator, which ensured its fairness.) Heads meant quitting and tails meant sticking it out. We also asked them to check in with us after two months and again after six months so we could see whether quitting made them happier or less happy. And we asked for a third party—a friend or family member usually—to verify that the flipper actually followed the coin flip.

Granted, they wouldn’t have made it to our site if they weren’t already leaning toward making a change. Nor could we force them to obey the coin. Overall, though, 60 percent of the people did follow the coin toss—which means that thousands of people made a choice they wouldn’t have made if the toss had come out opposite. Predictably, the coin toss had less impact on some really big decisions, like quitting a job, but even there it had some power. People were especially willing to follow the coin’s command when it came to the following questions: Should I ask for a raise? Should I quit my bad habit? Should I splurge on something fun? Should I sign up for a marathon? Should I grow a beard or mustache? Should I break up with my boyfriend/girlfriend? On this last question—the romantic breakup—we were responsible for the dissolution of roughly 100 couples. (To the jilted lovers: sorry!) On the other hand, because of the nature of a coin flip, we were also responsible for keeping together another 100 couples who might have broken up had the coin landed on heads.

One example: growing facial hair. (We can’t say this was very surprising.) Some decisions made people considerably less happy: asking for a raise, splurging on something fun, and signing up for a marathon. Our data don’t allow us to say why these choices made people unhappy. It could be that if you ask for a raise and don’t get it, you feel resentful. And maybe training for a marathon is far more appealing in theory than in practice.

Have we definitively proven that people are on average more likely to be better off if they quit more jobs, relationships, and projects? Not by a long shot. But there is nothing in the data to suggest that quitting leads to misery either. So we hope the next time you face a tough decision, you’ll keep that in mind. Or maybe you’ll just flip a coin. True, it may seem strange to change your life based on a totally random event. It may seem even stranger to abdicate responsibility for your own decisions.
