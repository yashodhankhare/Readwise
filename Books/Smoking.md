- Against this, we can celebrate a remarkable change that has come about recently in the smoking habits of middle-class Americans: smoking is disappearing from ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=89))

- their offices, their trains, their restaurants, their friends’ homes—in short, from their lives entirely. This change can truly be described as revolutionary since, to my knowledge, it has no precedent in history anywhere on earth. A shift of this magnitude may breed a false sense, however, that smoking is about to disappear altogether—from America if not from the world. What is actually happening is that smoking is disappearing from one group in one country. Even in the United States, our best estimates are that by the year 2000, about 22 percent of all adult Americans will be smoking (down from about 27 percent today). And in most of the rest of the world, smoking rates are going up, not down. Given this, smoking’s huge toll will continue well into the 21st century.

- What I hope I’ve retrieved from this tonnage is a narrative that helps explain to the average person why people use tobacco. Providing this kind of explanation is at least the nominal goal of this book, but, as will become apparent, this is very much a book about drug use in general. Imbedded in my coverage of this as a subject are primers on such topics as the human ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=97))

- will make the trip through these pages more rewarding. Beyond these things, there is a higher level lesson to be had here, I believe, about the kinds of physical and psychological states that human beings find attractive. I think that we are, at root, less interested in the exotic than in the normal. Our chief concern is not with how we can transform ourselves for discrete periods of time, but rather with how we can remain the same. What is remarkable is the peril we are willing to take on in order to do this. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=100))

- Five hundred years after the tobacco genie was let out of the bottle and into Western life, there still is a bafflement about smoking, one that spills over occasionally into derision or even anger. (The 19th-century American Horace Greeley once defined a cigar as “a fire at one end and a fool at the other.”) ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=142))

- Not so tough a time at all, as it turns out. Even today, however, with centuries of cultural tradition behind it, tobacco still puzzles. The vast majority of nonsmokers think that smoking has the dubious distinction of not providing much pleasure but being addictive all the same.4 Smokers themselves, understandably, tend to see the habit in less negative terms. Only about half of them regard themselves as addicted, and they’re apt to describe smoking in terms of pleasure5-usually as a matter of smoking “calming” them. Yet even smokers seem to have fairly hazy notions of what benefits smoking provides. Britain’s M. A. H. Russell, who has spent a good part of his working life trying to understand the smoking habit, puts it this way: To seek the solution to the question, why do people smoke?, the obvious way to begin would seem to be simply to ask; but if we do this we soon discover that many smokers are at a loss for a satisfactory answer … . When confronted with this question they hesitate, smile foolishly, shrug their shoulders and say something like, “Habit I suppose,” or “I don’t know.” … The simple answer is that they enjoy it, but the simple pleasure principle does not always operate with smoking. There are few who positively enjoy every cigarette and some smokers experience no positive pleasure at all. 6 So what does tobacco do? With its use, there’s none of heroin’s ecstasy, alcohol’s sudden brightening of personality, marijuana’s giddiness, LSD’s visions. The urge to get high is understandable, even to those who disdain it. But what’s to be made of tobacco smoking? To the casual, nonsmoking observer, it’s as if smokers have gotten the worst of both worlds: drug addiction without drug euphoria. Yet smoking’s nebulous benefits come attached to a habit of amazing power. Ninety percent of all drinkers drink alcohol when they feel like it but leave it alone when they don’t, which leaves about 10 percent drinking out of compulsion. These percentages are almost exactly reversed with smoking: only about 10 percent of the smoking population are thought to be “chippers,” who can take smoking or leave it as they please. The Smoking Nag must be served at regular intervals for 90 ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=152))

- percent of the smoking population, and this population amounts to better than one in four adult Americans. Since smokers take about 10 drags per cigarette, a pack-a-day habit, which is about the average, adds up to 200 “hits” of tobacco per day-or about 70,000 hits annually. The number is easy to calculate because there are no vacations from the practice. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=170))

- How amazing, then, that smokers have so little idea of why they do it. Smoking seems to sit, fat and laughing, on one of our cherished assumptions: that we have reasons for doing what we do; that we are purposeful even in our indulgences. People often do things they don’t understand, but what comes close to smoking in terms of an ongoing act that is motivated by forces that are within us, and yet unknown to us? At the conference table of the self, smoking speaks another language; it takes up our time and energy, but is unable to tell us why. If smoking’s consequences were benign, its constancy—hour after hour,… ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=179))

- Smoking research is definitely work in progress. There are a multitude of unanswered questions in the field, and the research results that are obtained often are maddeningly contradictory. Nevertheless, a clearer picture of why people smoke has emerged in recent years, and this work, as we will see, provides some insight into the question of drug use in general.

- The central finding of contemporary scientific research on smoking is straightforward, stands in contradiction to the 1964 Surgeon General’s report, and pretty much confirms what generations of preachers and grandmothers have suspected: people smoke primarily to get nicotine into their bodies. There are other reasons for smoking, as we’ll see, but alone or together it’s unlikely that they could motivate millions of people to regularly draw a somewhat bitter pollutant into their lungs. M. A. H. Russell puts it this way: There is little doubt that if it were not for the nicotine in tobacco smoke, people would be little more inclined to smoke than they are to blow bubbles or to light sparklers.8 Readers may be inclined at this point to say that they knew this all along and to ask why the government has spent so much of their money trying to confirm it. Let me quickly point out, then, that there is a universe of meaning in the phrase “primarily to get nicotine into their bodies,” and that, therefore, some serious misunderstanding may result.

- The likely confusion is that people are apt to think that this explanation of smoking means nothing more than that people are addicted to nicotine. To further compound the trouble, the average person is likely to have a misguided notion of what “addiction” means. The common understanding of addiction is of a one-dimensional craving for a drug: a mental and physical discomfort—perhaps even anguish—that must be endured until more of the drug is taken or the addiction is shaken off. We might call this a “monkey addiction,” since it could just as well be monkeys we’re talking about, there being no human quality to the act under this view. Give drug X to an organism for long enough and the organism will become addicted to it, after which it will have to have a certain amount of the drug running around in its system or suffer the consequences. Note that what’s implied here is a kind of thermostat for an addictive drug: for smokers a nic-o-stat, regulating nicotine; for, say, heroin users a morphine-o-stat. When the amount of the drug in the… ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=208))

- needed” stage.) Thereafter, their need should be a simple function of “drug-supplied or drug-denied.” Given this, their propensity to relapse shouldn’t change depending on the circumstances they find themselves in. But this is precisely what we do not find with cigarettes. We have no reason to believe that smokers relapse in accordance with some chemical clock. They relapse when they get bad news, when they’re stressed, or when they’re at a party. They relapse after they’ve had a good dinner.9 If a monkey addiction theory is true, why should a smoker’s internal state or external surroundings prompt relapse? If we stretch the theory, we might be able to accommodate depressive states. (“The need was constant, but I only gave into it when work got me down.”) But what about relaxing or exuberant states, which also are a minefield for people trying to quit? Moreover, with monkey addiction, we would presume that withdrawal symptoms—irritability, confusion, and so forth—would be the thing that would prompt an… ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=218))

- The problem with the common understanding of cigarette addiction is that it doesn’t begin to tell us enough about why people engage in a behavior that they know stands a good chance of sending them to an early grave. Cigarette smoking does have an element of monkey addiction in it—something that we might do better to call “physical dependence,” as scientists do. But that’s not all there is to it. In the broadest of terms, what’s wrong with this view of smoking is that it sees the cigarette habit as a purely pharmacological process. That in itself is off the mark, but there’s a compound error in monkey addiction: it posits a chemical habit that is all stick and no carrot; it says that smokers who try to quit are physically punished—and that’s why they keep smoking. As we will see, however, there are abundant reasons to believe that cigarettes do things for smokers as well as to them. This duality exists with all addictive drugs, but may be somewhat harder to see with cigarettes. With, say, cocaine or alcohol, we have no problem perceiving their apparent reward: users get high from them. What about smoking? The problem in seeing the commonality between cigarettes and other drugs comes because of our preconceived notions of what addictive drugs do. We need to grasp the fact that a drug can be desirable to people without making them euphoric. It can be rewarding without getting us “high” as that term is commonly understood. Most of the addictive drugs we know about other than cigarettes have an apparent element of euphoria to their use. What’s important to recognize, however, is that being blissed-out is only one of many ways in which drugs can be rewarding. Being mildly stimulated or tranquilized is another. Nicotine seems to be able to do both things, and these are a couple of the reasons it’s attractive. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=233))

- Readers may be able to see where I’m going with all this. We have seen the reasons for smoking start with physical punishment for not smoking; then we added pharmacological rewards for smoking; then we speculated on the personal, almost emotional, nature of missing a pharmacological effect; then we talked about missing a smoking-related behavior that has nothing directly to do with pharmacology at all. If all these things are motivations for smoking, then the seemingly simple act of drawing tobacco smoke into the lungs—this nothing activity, so slight it’s hardly there—begins to be seen for what it is: a habit of deep roots and great complexity. As we will see, addiction and attachment; pharmacology and behavior; personality, culture, and genetics all chase each other around like a ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=271))

- cat after its own tail when we start to consider the issue of why people smoke. That said, we should remember how this discussion started: with the assertion that the main reason people smoke is to get nicotine into their bodies. This is true not only because of the direct effects nicotine has, but because of its indirect effects. Think of the four reasons I set forth for smoking. The first two—being physically rewarded for smoking or physically punished for not smoking—clearly are pharmacological effects. But what about the other two reasons? (Chosen almost at random, by the way; many others could have been selected.) Well, missing having a mild tranquilizer around is not a matter of physical dependence, but it is based on the pharmacological effects of nicotine. The fourth reason follows this pattern as well. The reason people get used to holding cigarettes is not that this act is pleasurable in itself. We have no instances of people taking up tobacco holding. They take up tobacco smoking (and only later, when they’re trying to quit, do we find them regularly holding unlit cigarettes). It is the pairing of nicotine’s effects with holding that gives the latter act its power. The point here is that nicotine is like a stone dropped in a pond: it has direct effects and indirect effects. A water strider might be sunk by such a stone or buffeted ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=277))

- by the ripples that its splash creates. But ultimately, there is one cause for all the effects. This analogy is not exact. There are reasons for smoking that lie completely outside the effects of nicotine. Some of these may be strong motivating forces. But science increasingly points to nicotine as the strongest force of all in motivating smoking. Before turning to its role in the smoking habit, however, we might benefit from taking a look at some motivations for smoking that are related only weakly, if at all, to this subtle yet powerful drug in tobacco.

- This points us in the direction of a more general use of smoking: it can be a valuable communication tool. Those who wish to project an image or signal something about themselves to the outside world have a great communication device in the cigarette. This is most obvious in societal caricatures: Marlene Dietrich exhaling sensually; Edward Murrow looking thoughtful.

- There are other reasons for associating smoking with sexuality, however. One of these is that, more than any other act, perhaps, smoking draws our attention to that seat of sensuousness, the lips. Programmed as we are to follow any visual stimulus, we track the smoker’s ostentatious act to its stopping point and find ourselves looking, however briefly, at a mouth in action. Beyond this, sex is, of course, intimately entwined with our notions of need and the desire for a forbidden object. Smoking is, and has been for centuries, an advertisement of need. Its object—drug-induced contentment—is as indecent as sex. Smokers and lovers alike are perceived as people driven by illicit urges beyond their control. They are people who, in consuming their exotic, dangerous objects, are themselves consumed.

- What’s apparent, of course, is that the adventurous adjectives evoked by the picture of the smoking models are precisely the adjectives that Marlboro, for example, would like to evoke in readers when it shows them pictures of the Marlboro Cowboy looking pensively at Montana. A chicken-and-egg question arises as to whether advertising has created the association between adventurousness, etc., and smoking or whether advertising is responding to an already existing association between the two. Each element has undoubtedly reinforced the other, but we have reason to believe that advertising is responding more than creating. Smoking has always been somewhat daring and has become much more so since the 1960s. And, as we will see later, a particular sort of daring and individualistic person is inordinately attracted to smoking; cigarette companies know this and cigarette advertising images are the result. With these ads pasted on billboards all over town, millions of youngsters have a ready-made avenue for their rebellious urges. There’s a commercially approved way of being daring and it’s called smoking cigarettes. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=348))

- Social critics are fond of saying that we live in an age in which image is paramount and style is more important than substance. If so, cigarette advertising could stand as a perfect symbol of its time in that it has everything to do with image and almost nothing to do with the substance of its product. What is promoted in cigarette ads is dreams: of cowboys or glamorous women or fun days with friends. These dreams are then linked to specific brands: Marlboros or Virginia Slims or Newports. American advertising in general is heavy on image, of course, but few products can run with cigarettes in this regard. (Soft-drink and liquor ads come to mind; perhaps it is ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=402))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that the more useless or dangerous the product, the more advertising for it will be based on pure image.) When cigarette ads do deign to come down to the fuddy-duddy world of product qualities, only three things are of any importance: tar and nicotine ratings for “light” brands; price for “generic” brands; and taste for many different brands. It’s the last of these that concerns us here. If there is any “sensible” reason that people can put forward for smoking, this is it. Nearly all the other reasons, if expressed, stand to expose some element of human frailty or incompleteness in the smoker. Everyone is incomplete and frail, of course, but the smoker goes public with this fact every time he lights up. This has always been true to some extent, but is especially so now. Addiction, compulsion, irrational action: these are the messages that waft up with the smoke. The fact that taste stands nearly alone in being an unassailable motive for smoking is, I would guess, one of the reasons that cigarette companies make as much of it as they do in their advertising. It helps take them out of the world of drug-dealing by making them seem more like regular companies that cater to the public taste in the same way that, say, gum manufacturers do. On the other hand, the tobacco firms’ interest in taste clearly extends beyond image and public relations. Dozens of patents may be granted in a given year for tobacco “flavorants,” which often have names like 2,6,6-trimethyl-1-(3-ethoxy-1-butenyl)-cyclohex-1-ene.13 These chemicals are put into cigarettes alongside more familiar flavorings, such as sugar, licorice, and vanilla. Flavorings, in turn, are only one kind of additive in a product that’s full of them.b The mix of flavorings in any given brand of cigarettes is among the most tightly held secrets tobacco companies have, and trade journals tell us that flavorants have become more important in recent years because of the difficulty manufacturers have in making low-tar and -nicotine cigarettes palatable. 14 All in all, then, one gets the sense that tobacco companies believe that flavor matters a good deal to their customers. Whatever else these companies are, they’re not dumb, and we probably should accept their efforts at flavoring cigarettes as a sign that flavor does make a difference—at least as to what brand of cigarettes smokers choose. When we look at the research on this subject that’s not locked in corporate vaults, however, we’re left with the impression that there is a lot of play in smokers’ judgments about tobacco taste.

- All this relates to whether smokers choose from among different brands on the basis of taste; it says little about whether taste is a motive to smoke. Here, common sense and the little bit of evidence we have indicate that to the degree it’s a motive at all, it’s a pretty weak one. Salvatore Zagona and Louis Zurcher, Jr., once surveyed about 1,600 college smokers and found that only about 20 percent said that flavor was a source of enjoyment in smoking for therm.18 A Norwegian survey of a couple of thousand adults, some of them nonsmokers, found that ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=443))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- only about 12 percent thought people smoke because of taste.19 Even these low numbers may be suspect, however. Taste, as we’ve seen, is one of the few God-fearing reasons for smoking cigarettes, and it may be that people, consciously or not, would attribute more significance to it than is warranted when they’re asked about why they smoke.

- Of all the stimulations provided by smoking, one type has emerged in recent years as important enough to warrant intensive investigation, and it’s with an extended account of it that we will close out this section of our look at smoking motivation. The stimulation in question is that of the human airway tract, from the mouth through the throat and trachea and into the lungs. The notion of smoking being motivated in part by such upper-airway stimulation has been reported on in scientific journals for decades, but the idea seemed to be going nowhere until it was revived in the mid-1980s by a young researcher named Jed Rose, who heads the Veterans Administration Nicotine Research Laboratory in Durham, North Carolina. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=462))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Rose’s central idea is straightforward: the satisfaction that smokers derive from cigarettes comes in part from a constellation of physical sensations that are produced by cigarette smoke as it passes through the airway tract. Taste is one of these sensations. Another, more notable sensation, however, is the impact the tiny smoke particles make as they lodge against the back of the throat, the windpipe, and the lungs. This sensation has been described as the “scratch” effect and can be thought of as a kind of rewarding irritation. (In earlier smoking literature, this phenomenon was sometimes referred to as “pulmonary eroticism,” which may be the only elegant phrase smoking researchers have ever coined.) Rose has developed an extended analogy between eating and smoking that serves to illustrate his theory. Scientists have observed that people in experiments who get nutrients intravenously lose only a little of their hunger, even though they may be getting a fair amount of nutrition this way. Likewise, smokers who receive nicotine in the form of, say, nicotine gum, report time and time again that they still have a craving for cigarettes. “During cigarette smoking, the flavor of cigarette smoke and the throat impact accompanying each puff produce immediate satisfaction,” Rose has written, “just ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=467))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- as tasting and swallowing food, and the subsequent feeling of fullness in the stomach produce satisfaction when eating.”20 No one would be satisfied by sitting at a dinner table and hooking up to a bottle of glucose, the argument goes; why should we expect smokers to be satisfied by chewing nicotine gum? ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=477))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What Rose concluded from this is that the immediate satisfaction people get from smoking a cigarette may come in part from stimulation of the airway tract by the smoke. The long-term satisfaction from smoking, however, may well be dependent on something else, with nicotine being far and away the most likely candidate. Again, he uses a food analogy. When people are dehydrated, they get thirsty and drink liquids. Doing this stimulates nerves leading to the brain that immediately signal, “water level OK now,” and thirst ends. This satiation occurs, however, long before the water has reached the sites that originally signaled dehydration. Likewise, Rose thinks, airway stimulation may, at a minimum, signal to the brain, “nicotine level OK now.” Under this argument, airway stimulation draws its strength from being paired with nicotine. In psychological terms, it is a conditional reinforcer, and nicotine is an unconditional reinforcer. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=489))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As it turns out, though, it seems that cigarettes provide a direct nicotine reward through airway stimulation. If we ask why inhaling tobacco smoke should be an unconditional reinforcer, this, I believe, is a much more likely candidate. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=503))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It seems to me, however, that an argument for airway stimulation—combining the reasoning of Rose and Ginzel—can be made along these same kinds of historical lines. Why is it that cigarettes accounted for 2 percent of the tobacco market 100 years ago but now account for 95 percent? Plenty of speculation exists on this topic. There are, for example, sociological theories put forward, such as that cigarettes are a “quick smoke” suited to a stopwatch society. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=521))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It’s too early to tell how this will come out, but my feeling is that airway stimulation may turn out to be an important part of the cigarette smoking puzzle. Right now, that puzzle has a big piece missing: Why do people still desire cigarettes even when they’re given nicotine through other routes? The theory of airway stimulation aims its sights right at this question of “craving.” After getting one result after another that served to confirm his ideas, Rose has moved on to apply this work to two practical goals: devising new ways to help people quit smoking and developing a “safer” cigarette (which has been something of a Holy Grail in smoking research for decades). Time will tell what lies in store for the whole area. Readers may have noted that, although this chapter is supposedly dedicated to the reasons people smoke apart from the effects of nicotine, we have dealt with nicotine extensively. As smoking baffles smokers, so does it baffle writers trying to parse out its effects into neat, separate categories. We will now, however, really, really move on into nicotine proper. As a kind of auguring of what is to come, however, think back to the two effects of nicotine that Karl Ginzel found when he injected his sleeping cats: physical relaxation and mental stimulation. What a delicious sounding combination. What a paradox. What a drug. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=538))

- A case could be made that human motivation has no equal in terms of complexity on the grounds that the most complex object we know of—short of people themselves—is the human brain, which sits atop human motivation, both literally and figuratively, but does not comprise the whole, since cultural and environmental factors also play a part. If science has not yet had much success with human motivation as it relates to substance abuse, it has done better with understanding abused substances themselves. By the 19th century, chemistry had progressed far enough that scientists were able to pinpoint the specific compounds that put the bang in naturally occurring plants. Morphine was isolated—that is, separated out—from opium poppies in 1803 by Friedrich Wilhelm Serturner.1 Cocaine was isolated from the coca leaf by Albert Niemann in 1859–18602 and nicotine was isolated from tobacco by Posselt and Reimann in 1828.3 When we compare these drugs, we notice that nicotine differs from the other two in that it never hit the big time in society as an isolated drug, whereas morphine and cocaine did. Once pure morphine and cocaine were available, they began to be used extensively by the populace at large. This was partly because both drugs had significant medical uses, morphine as a painkiller and cocaine as a local anesthetic.

- simple reason that people have little use for nicotine except when it comes bound up in leaf or plug. The pharmaceutical entrepreneurs of the 19th century—legally as free to dispense morphine as aspirin—were extremely adept at giving the buying public whatever it wanted in the way of drugs and related paraphernalia. In its 1897 mail order catalogue, Sears Roebuck offered a selection of hypodermic syringe kits.4 If industry didn’t deliver a range of nicotine products as it did for morphine and cocaine, the reason may well have been that such products weren’t desirable. This may simply be another way of saying that nicotine’s best delivery apparatus is the cigar or the cigarette, whereas for morphine or heroin the apparatus of choice is the hypodermic needle. We have seen already how efficient inhaled cigarette smoke can be at getting the effects of nicotine going from lung to brain. Consider its general circulatory effects. When a person inhales cigarette smoke, the nicotine it carries… ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=576))

- As a delivery system, inhalation is more efficient than any Dr. Brown’s Nicotine Tonic that might be developed; such a tonic would be largely inactivated in the stomach and the liver before it passed into general circulation. By contrast, more than 90 percent of the nicotine in inhaled cigarette smoke is absorbed by the lung.7 It is a good thing that so much of the nicotine that is swallowed becomes inactivated; were this not the case, young children who eat cigarettes might suffer more than just the vomiting, convulsions, and diarrhea that they do get.8 Nicotine is a powerful drug and a little goes a long way. “Capture guns” used to take wild animals alive once employed nicotine darts to bring down creatures as big as elephants.9 A person who drinks a five-ounce cup of coffee ingests about 120 milligrams of caffeine. A person who ingested half that much nicotine would probably die as a result.10 Smokers get what they need from the one milligram of nicotine that is delivered, on average, in each cigarette.11 This is barely a large enough quantity to be seen, even if a… ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=586))

- small that they can penetrate into the tiniest branches of the lungs. There they are picked up, hitchhiker-like, by blood that has been sent to the lungs to take up oxygen. From the lungs, it’s a fast trip to the left side of the heart, where nicotine is pumped out to every corner of the body. Scientists sometimes speak of a “cascade” of effects stemming from one cause. This term surely is appropriate in the case of nicotine. From the instant it hits the lungs, its effects come spilling out this way and that, only to loop back on each other and start whole new processes rolling. Scientific sensors aren’t required to know that some of these effects are taking place. With the first cigarette of the day, heart rate will increase by 10 to 20 beats per minute. Blood pressure will go up 5 to 10 points.12 Body temperature will drop in the fingertips as the blood vessels there are constricted. These effects don’t increase by this much more with each cigarette smoked. (Alas: if they did, nobody would smoke cigarettes.)

- The other three warnings are less sobering even about health effects. In fact, one of them—“Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide”—seems less a warning than a piece of information the government thought smokers might find handy. Carbon monoxide (CO) has a considerable reputation for danger, stemming, I would think, from its role as a suicide gas in closed garages. But from the Surgeon General’s warning, it’s unclear what it does in the amounts that cigarettes provide. One answer to this question is that it may contribute to heart disease. But it also plays a role in the way that smokers process the air they breathe. Oxygen is carried to the various parts of the body by hemoglobin, a protein in the red blood cells. As oxygen enters the bloodstream from the lungs, it binds with hemoglobin in a process analogous to two people holding on to one another for the duration of a dance. When the hemoglobin reaches its destination, the dance is over; the oxygen splits off to be used within cells, and the hemoglobin returns to the lungs to pick up another partner. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=706))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- That partner, however, can just as easily be carbon monoxide as oxygen. In fact, hemoglobin binds much more readily with carbon monoxide than with oxygen. The hemoglobin that binds with CO is unavailable to carry oxygen, and there are only so many hemoglobin molecules in the body at any given time. This, then, is one of the reasons that you are unlikely to see any smokers winning the Boston Marathon. It’s not just that their lungs are clogged from the effects of tar and hence are inefficient—although that’s bound to be true if they’ve been smoking long enough—it’s that a fair number of their hemoglobin molecules are engaged in carrying poison rather than life-sustaining oxygen. (The body tries to respond to this chronic condition by creating more red blood cells, but the compensation is incomplete.) People who lock themselves in garages with their motors running are simply carrying out this process on a grand scale. When enough of their hemoglobin is unavailable to carry oxygen, they die. When carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin, the result is a molecule called carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), and its level in the bloodstream is a pretty good way to judge a person’s actual intake of cigarette smoke products.

- In the early 1970s, two British researchers, T. W Meade and N. J. Wald, decided that it was important to know when people smoked during the day in order to know when to measure them for COHb. If people smoked little during the morning relative to the rest of the day, for example, a morning sampling of COHb would be misleading as to their intake of smoke products. Since the more of these products people take in, the more prone they are in general to disease, COHb levels might serve as a kind of risk marker, the researchers felt.1 Consequently, Meade and Wald sent a questionnaire to about 3,600 British workers—in factories and offices—asking them when they smoked from the time they got up till the time they went to bed.

- The nicotine in tobacco has many uses. But when we begin to ask why it qualifies as humanity’s all-time addictive drug of choice,d one of the first things we might consider is the idea that it can rescue people from several different dysphoric states, returning them to normal from several locations on the psychological map. This is exactly what we would expect of a drug that is heavily used in the workplace, where normal is what’s called for and where the forces pulling people away from that state range from boredom to stress.

- EARLIER, WHEN WE looked at the way nicotine functions at the cellular level, we noted that the effects of the first cigarette of the day on the average smoker are likely to resemble the effects of stimulation of the body’s sympathetic—that is, fight-or-flight—nervous system. Heart rate goes up, blood vessels are constricted, and so forth. This is clearly a stimulation effect; whether moved to this state by a frightening noise or the smoking of a cigarette, the body in this condition is primed for action. In general, a similar effect takes place in the brain when a person smokes a cigarette: the brain moves to a state of higher arousal.

- Where does nicotine fit in? Since the late 1950s, it has been known that nicotine generally causes EEG arousal in humans and animals.1 If a person smokes a cigarette, dominant alpha frequency is likely to go up, along with desynchronization. In many of the studies that have shown this, scientists have had to grapple with the old smoking conundrum: Is nicotine stimulating these smokers’ brains, or is it bringing them back from ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=858))

- a depressed cortical state brought on by nicotine withdrawal? Is it, in other words, returning addicted people to a normal state by replenishing their bodies with the addictive drug? One way to get around this question, at least partially, is to give nicotine to non-smokers by, say, intravenous injection. This has been done, and we find much the same thing: nicotine stimulates the brain, as measured by brain-wave states.2 ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=861))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- formation that is the most important area in human arousal. The reticular formation sends nerve fiber projections up and out to all areas of the cerebral cortex. Stimulate certain parts of the reticular formation and the brain moves to a state of greater arousal. You don’t need drugs or electrodes to achieve this reticular stimulation: getting tapped on the shoulder will suffice; getting a balloon popped behind your back will do it on a grand scale. This is the sensory arousal we talked about earlier; one of the main things the reticular formation does is to act as a kind of hotel clerk, giving a wake-up call to other parts of the brain when this sensory stimulation comes in. We have good reason to believe that nicotine is achieving much of its alerting effect on the brain by way of its action on the reticular activating system. Recall that cells in the system contain nicotinic receptors that respond to nicotine as well as they would to the body’s own neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Further, nicotine’s alerting effects have been blocked in cats when scientists have removed their reticular systems from the neural loop.4 No reticular formation, no arousal through nicotine.

- the dirtiest drugs in pharmacology,” as one scientist expressed it to me. It’s not that researchers believe nicotine is hitting below the belt; it’s that nicotine does not have nice, clean, isolated effects. Its effects instead are all over the place, varying according to dose and individual and sometimes, it may seem, the phase of the moon. Recall that when smokers are asked why they smoke, the answer they’re most likely to give is that it relaxes them. What are we to make of this in light of the fact that smoking increases fight-or-flight reactions and, as we have just seen, stimulates brain activity as well? One sure answer to this is that at certain times—after the first act of a long play, for example—smoking is “relaxing” smokers by rescuing them from drug withdrawal. This is not much different from what happens with, say, opium addicts; the effects of the drugs are very different, but the underlying syndrome is the same.

- Scott Lukas of Harvard, who has run IV nicotine experiments, reports watching his subjects repeatedly go through the same sequence of events: the nicotine is delivered, at which point these people sit bolt upright and break out in a sweat, with heart pounding and panic breathing—all for about 30 to 45 seconds. Then this response ends abruptly and they move into a state he saw as a kind of relaxed euphoria.7 Now smokers wouldn’t put themselves through the first state in order to get to the second, but then, in Lukas’s experiments, the subjects weren’t doing what smokers normally can do so well: control the dose of nicotine they’re getting and the setting they’re getting it in. Our average smoker takes about 200 drags a day, which gives him or her a lot of practice in how to adjust dosage levels. We saw earlier how potent nicotine is at very small dosages (that is, that a little can make a lot of difference). What we begin to see through all this is the ability of smokers to fine-tune their arousal and mood state by taking in just the right amount of nicotine in just the right setting. We might compare it to an actress ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=903))

Set up perfectly. Our smoker, by contrast, is mixing his surroundings and dosage levels to set up his mental state perfectly. His unconscious is largely doing the directing here. The smoker may not consciously be aware of directions more specific than “more needed” or “level fine,” but he is very aware of those imperatives. In smoking research literature, there are what we might call “strong” and “weak” versions of this general argument. The strong version goes something like this. Smoking can reliably move people up or down the sedation-stimulation scale according to the dosage of nicotine smokers ingest and the setting in which they ingest it. That is, smaller doses of nicotine stimulate and larger doses sedate. Likewise, in boring situations nicotine is likely to stimulate, while in nerve-wracking ones it is likely to sedate. These two variables are linked in that people often smoke more in jarring situations (to calm themselves) and less in boring ones (to stimulate themselves). Nobody claims that this will always be the case, but it will happen more often than not, the argument goes. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=912))

- If it’s true that nicotine has these kinds of cognitive effects, then we ought to be able to detect them when people actually do things—when they carry out tasks. A large amount of experimental work has been done on this topic over the years. (Indeed, up to the 1950s, most of the scientific work on smoking had to do with whether it made people perform better or worse when they were asked to carry out tasks.) Two overarching questions have evolved from this. One of these is now pretty much a closed case, except for filling in a detail here and there: Do smokers who are deprived of nicotine perform worse when asked to do something, such as concentrate for a long time? Not much of a surprise here: the answer is yes. The second question is: Apart from any withdrawal rescue work, can nicotine improve human performance? That is, can it provide true, absolute improvements in human functioning? Here we have a wide diversity of scientific opinion, which we’ll get to in a minute. For now, though, let’s look at the first question in detail. Anyone who knows a smoker who is trying to quit is likely to hear the complaint that this person “can’t think” since he gave up cigarettes. Allowing for hyperbole, this person is right. In fact, he might add that he can’t perceive, either. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=961))

- nicotine seems to help people maintain their concentration over time. One might wish for more evidence supporting this conclusion, but what there is, it seems to me, definitely points in this direction. The operative word here, however, is that it “maintains” concentration, meaning that smoking seems to keep it steady during a task that goes on for awhile. This is a different assertion from saying that it boosts concentration and keeps it there. In the studies just mentioned, there was little evidence of this effect.

- Along the same lines, he has reported that tobacco seems to be able to first enhance attention and then disengage it quickly when that’s what the task calls for, this whole process occurring in the blink of an eye.7 As different as these (and other) findings are, they seem to point to a generalized enhancement of concentration with smoking. This work has a way to go, but I suspect that at the end of the day, this concentration enhancement will be shown to be the case. It goes without saying that concentration capabilities such as these would be very attractive to anyone: to keep attention fixed over a long period of time to some boring, repetitive chore; to focus strongly on what’s important and let go of what’s not; to filter out the million-and-one distractions that are part of so many working environments. Who wouldn’t want these capabilities at his or her fingertips? We saw earlier that tobacco can lay some claim to being a working drug; people use it more often during the working day than at any other time. We focused earlier on its emotional effects in this regard: its seeming ability to keep mood on an even keel. Here, it seems to me, is the cognitive side of that mood effect.

- reason people smoke: it helps them take care of business in their daily working lives. Concentration is only one of a whole constellation of abilities that together are commonly referred to as mental processing. Another ability in this constellation is sometimes known as rapid information processing. It is related to concentration—indeed, almost anything we do has a concentration component to it—but is separate from it nevertheless. Wesnes and Warburton have been the champions of the notion that smoking improves this ability, and for many years now they have carried out a large number of very similar experiments to test that hypothesis.

- We have to be cautious about these results, though, because of our old bugaboo, nicotine withdrawal. That is, you could make a case that Wesnes and Warburton were measuring not an improvement in performance when these people are smoking, but a decline in performance when they are deprived of smoking, however brief this deprivation may be. One way of controlling for this is to test nonsmokers with nicotine tablets. That’s just what Wesnes and Warburton did, and here, while they got some positive results, the findings aren’t as strong as when they were measuring smokers only.9 These findings move in the same direction as the smokers’ experiments—the nicotine prevented a decrease in accuracy and speed over time, for example—but they aren’t as robust as the other results. What emerges from this work, it seems to me, are some provocative test results—indicating that smoking aids in this kind of mental sprinting—that would benefit from the kind of converging evidence we saw with the concentration studies. There are several other areas in which claims have been made that nicotine boosts mental efficiency, and a couple of them deserve mention. One is memory and learning. There is a large body of work on this subject—larger perhaps than on any other aspect of nicotine and mental functioning. These studies have involved rats and humans, short-term and long-term memory, difficult and simple material—in short, science has covered a fair amount of territory on this question. If we were to walk through this body of material, though, in the end we’d be left with the feeling that the whole thing is a kind of Mexican standoff: for every study that finds some effect, another finds none or finds a contrary effect. If any one effect consistently is shown, however, it is that, like many drugs, nicotine produces what’s called “state-dependent” learning, meaning that if you learn something in a given state—on nicotine, on caffeine, or straight—you remember it better in that state. If so, then this effect would tend to keep people smoking through a never-ending daisy-chain of learning and recalling while on nicotine. But as such, it’s not an absolute performance enhancement; if anything, as a ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1089))

- motive it belongs in the category of the effects of nicotine withdrawal. The last area we’ll look at here has to do with purely physical perception and movement. At one time or another, most of us have turned on a fan and, as its speed increases, watched the three individual blades in it turn into one ghostly gray mass. In science, there is a kind of analog to this called the critical flicker fusion (CFF) test. Imagine it like this: you sit in a darkened room while watching a light that flickers on and off, slowly at first but then at a greater speed, until at a certain point it ceases to flicker altogether and simply looks like a light that’s turned on. The point at which it stops flickering, called the CFF threshold, is a measure of brain arousal and is affected by such things as fatigue.10 That is, an alert person will see the flicker at a higher rate of speed than will a tired person. England’s Hans Eysenck and K. M. Warwick took a group of 60 smokers and nonsmokers—interestingly, all members of the “genius” society Mensa—and measured their flicker-fusion performance in two states: without nicotine, and with very small doses of it, taken in the form of tablets. The result was that when they were dosed on nicotine they could perceive the flickering at a higher rate.11 ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1105))

- it.13 The reasons they gave for chewing were the usual: relaxation, habit, dependence. And none of them said it sharpened their reflexes or improved their game. Yet, as we’ve seen, a lot of the motivation for tobacco use exists at an unconscious level, and we shouldn’t be surprised that baseball players, like most people, wouldn’t be aware of what tobacco does to them, or for them. (In addition, would we really expect them to admit that a drug is doing something for them on the field?) Consistent with what they said, however, Steven Edwards and his colleagues at Oklahoma State University tested a group of college men—some of them athletes—and found that chewing tobacco did not improve their reaction times.14 This finding is somewhat at variance with other studies that have measured nicotine’s effect on reaction time, but even if we accept the Oklahoma results at face value, it’s clear that reaction time is not all there is to athletic performance.

Given these two things, I think professional baseball would have impetus enough—on public health grounds alone—to limit on-field chewing by players; with the evidence we’ve seen of tobacco’s potential for employment as a drug in the game, I should think that baseball would want to look very closely at this whole area. We can gain some broader perspective on the perceptual and other effects we’ve looked at by recalling that we earlier saw evidence that nicotine can seemingly move people up or down a sedation-stimulation scale according to how much they take in and the situation in which they take it. Under this view, it’s quite possible that the effects we’ve surveyed—the likelihood of increased concentration; the possibility of enhanced mental processing; the faster physical functioning—can be modified by the smoker as desired. That is, the same things wouldn’t happen to the same degree every time a person smoked: different things would happen, depending on what the smoker wanted, which would make nicotine a kind of all-purpose drug.

- Under this view, then, smoking is not just a matter of being shackled to an addiction; it’s an aid, a kind of trick if you wish, to help people function. We saw some evidence of this earlier on the emotional side; here we see it on the cognitive side. Such effects as may exist are subtle, and it’s clear that Western civilization got along just fine for hundreds of years without them. Moreover, whatever the effects are, they are small in relation to dying from lung cancer or heart disease. But the question here is not what this balance is; the question is what reasons people have for using tobacco, and these things probably should be counted among them. We have one final area to cover in the way of absolute benefits nicotine provides. This benefit sits apart from all the others we’ve talked about in that it’s not a cognitive addition to human functioning, but it certainly is an addition to the human sense of well-being. Smoking helps people stay slimmer. It takes off weight and keeps it off. This is not just some sort of folk wisdom, but is a… ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1156))

- their weight would have been had they not smoked, and continuing smokers gain weight less rapidly than do nonsmokers. Moreover, this effect continues as smokers move through life, so that the weight disparity between smokers and nonsmokers increases with age.17 This makes nicotine sound like some sort of magic elixir for the omnipresent American problem of too much self—and it does have something of that quality to it—but it is a decidedly low-grade elixir. Smokers weigh about 7 pounds less than nonsmokers, and smokers who quit gain an average of about 6 pounds during the year after they stop. It’s worth noting, however, that this is an average: some studies have reported groups of smokers weighing 15 pounds less than comparable groups of nonsmokers, and others have reported groups of smokers gaining an average of 18 pounds in the year after they quit. As with anything in the individual psyche, it may be the extremes of observed change that motivate our behavior. If Molly gained 20 pounds after quitting while Fred gained only 5, it is Molly whom we remember. We have a good idea that it is the nicotine in tobacco smoke that is causing this weight phenomenon (rather than, say, carbon monoxide) because people who quit smoking gain weight more slowly if they chew nicotine gum. How nicotine achieves this slimming trick has been the subject of a great deal of investigation over time, but only very recently have scientists been able to put together the pieces of this puzzle so that we at least know what major factors are involved. First, we know that people do eat more when they stop smoking and, notably through the work of Neil Grunberg, we know that nicotine reduces the amount of sweet foods, in particular, that animals or humans consume. It was clear for a long time that food reduction wasn’t the total answer to the question, however, because animals that are exposed to cigarette smoke lose weight without reducing their food intake. Furthermore, it seems clear that smokers eat as much as or more than nonsmokers while keeping a lower body weight.18 This left… ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1165))

- beams in elevator doors—and a computer registers each break in the light as a movement. At the end of the day you count up the movements.) Since physical activity doesn’t have much effect, this means that metabolism probably works with changes in food consumption to produce smoking’s slimming effect. Up through 1988, however, the evidence was contradictory on metabolism: some studies found that the metabolic rates of smokers would slow when they stopped smoking, but other studies found no such effect. Then in 1989, Kenneth Perkins and his colleagues produced two studies that went a long way toward answering this question. First, they showed that nicotine produced a small but significant increase of the metabolic rate in people when they are at rest—that is, when they are awake but doing nothing. The researchers wondered, however, how much this could explain about smoking and weight maintenance. As we’ve seen, we have reason… ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1185))

- The answer was yes. Perkins took two groups of smokers and gave one of them a standardized dose of nicotine (up the nose), while the other group got a placebo. Then he had both groups alternately rest or pedal lightly on a kind of bicycle apparatus. He found that although nicotine caused more energy to be expended during either rest or pedaling, the absolute excess energy expenditure caused by the nicotine was more than twice as great when the smokers were engaged in the light activity. To put this another way, nicotine provides much more of a metabolic bang during activity than during rest.19 Perkins noted that his results suggest an explanation for why nicotine seems to affect some smokers’ weights so strikingly, while it affects other smokers hardly at all: those who tend to smoke more while active would have their weight most affected by nicotine. On the other hand, those who smoked mostly while relaxing, or on coffee breaks or the like, would stand to be affected very little. With this research, we now have a pretty good idea of at least the higher level mechanisms involved in nicotine’s effect on weight: smokers… ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1194))

Two of three studies we have report that the smoker/nonsmoker weight differences are greater in women than in men, and we have reason to believe that women who quit smoking increase their food consumption more than do men who quit. Second, whether or not this disparity is real, women and girls are certainly more concerned about the question of smoking and weight than are men. The 1988 Surgeon General’s report noted that females are particularly worried about weight gains after they quit smoking; they are more likely to endorse smoking as a weight-loss strategy; and they are more likely to report relapse to smoking because of weight-related motives.

- For our purposes, suffice it to say that the arena of smoking seems to provide additional evidence for the assertion that women’s concern, perhaps obsession, with weight in this country should be a feminist issue. Lung cancer now claims the lives of more American women than any other form of cancer, including breast cancer. Adolescent girls now smoke at rates greater than the rates for adolescent boys. We can infer from the evidence we have seen that the fear of weight is probably responsible to some extent for these depressing events. To the degree that women keep smoking because of their fears about weight, they are dying because of their fears about weight. (Whatever health benefits a woman may derive from losing 7 pounds are overwhelmed by the disastrous physical effects of smoking.) Since nearly one-quarter of all adult American women smoke, this is not a trivial matter: some 46,000 American women were diagnosed with lung cancer in 198524 and we can expect that 85 percent of those women are dead today. As usual, the tobacco industry has weighed in on an important tobacco issue in the wrong way. At one time, the industry was blatant in advertising appeals that linked smoking with a thinner female figure.

And, as we have seen, to some degree it does. American advertising is one large dream machine, of course, and Big Tobacco is no more to blame for playing on this than are other advertisers. The problem is that the stakes are so high with this product. The risk is not of buying a product that you don’t need, but of buying a product that can addict and kill you. To echo the words of another writer, it seems clear that smoking is a feminist issue.     When we step back and look at the effects of nicotine on day-to-day human functioning—both the weight loss and the constellation of cognitive effects we’ve reviewed—it’s worth noting that the debate on nicotine has been framed almost entirely in terms of what enhancements it may provide. Debilitations are found here and there with nicotine, but in the main the question has been: Does nicotine do something positive, or does it do nothing at all?

- regular and controlling, which are the very hallmarks of addictive drug use. This is so much the case that we could imagine addiction as a kind of drill sergeant, giving orders on smoking to a bunch of new nicotine enlistees: Recruits, you’ll find that smoking will make you nauseated at first, but you will keep with it, and smoke a little more with each passing month until you level out your consumption, usually at about 20 cigarettes a day, and hold this pattern for years, maybe a lifetime. That’s your long-term picture. In the short run, the cigarettes you smoke will be evenly spaced out over time; likewise for the drags you take within each cigarette. The main thing is you will take in the same amount of nicotine each day. Do not attempt to vary this amount because it will not work. If you cut down on the number of cigarettes you smoke, you’ll find that you just increase the number of drags on the cigarettes you do smoke. If you try to take fewer drags on the cigarettes you smoke, you’ll just end up smoking more cigarettes.3 ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1290))

- So things are regular with smoking. Smokers don’t capriciously decide to have a cigarette. Within a certain loose framework, they’re obliged to have one. Here we reach the nic-o-stat concept with which our whole discussion started, and we can see that there’s some truth to it. This fact is exemplified through a very common practice: the smoking of “low-tar, low-nicotine” cigarettes. These cigarettes are so named from the Federal Trade Commission rating process begun in 1967. The notion is, of course, that people who can’t quit smoking can at least cut down on the amount of tar and nicotine they take in by smoking “light” cigarettes, and the FTC method of rating can give these smokers a benchmark to decide which cigarettes fall into this category. Even today, I think, most people believe that the tobacco in these cigarettes contains less tar and nicotine, in the same way that skim milk contains less fat. It doesn’t (which the cigarette companies undoubtedly knew all along). Instead, these cigarettes get low FTC-method ratings… ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1299))

- to people. Why? Because people do what FTC machines cannot: block the ventilation holes, smoke the cigarettes farther down, take more intense drags. People do this because of what we talked about above: they need a certain amount of nicotine to keep the Nag at bay and will get it one way or another even from low-nicotine cigarettes. It is not till you get to ultra-low cigarettes that these techniques will not work. And what’s the result in this case? Poor sales for ultra-lows because they don’t deliver the goods, no matter how they are manipulated.f The evidence from this whole subindustry, then, is in perfect keeping with the notion that smokers require a certain level of nicotine day in and day out. This realm of evidence is familiar to us because it deals with products we see in our everyday lives. A good deal of the evidence on the addictive nature of smoking, however, comes from the rarified environment of the laboratory.

Not only do they not have opinions about the question, but they presumably have never been influenced by a Marlboro ad or a Virginia Slims billboard. How do we get them to tell us anything? Well, first of all, we see if they’ll work for the supposedly addictive drug in tobacco, nicotine. Not work too hard; just press a lever to get it. If they press the lever a lot—repeatedly, frequently—then we have a pretty good idea that it’s doing something for them. In scientific terms, the nicotine is reinforcing their behavior. It is motivating them to do something—lever pressing—that they wouldn’t do otherwise. (I can’t help but see in these tests a crystalline reduction of the human situation. What will people do to get their drugs? Walk two blocks out of their way, already late for an appointment, to get a pack of cigarettes?) The king of reinforcing drugs for this test is cocaine.

- name for a dysphoria scale in drug testing is the LSD scale; if people tell you this drug is addictive, tell them it’s highly unlikely.) From the earliest nicotine tests, in 1967, it was clear that animals would press levers for it, but their rates of pressing were so low that it called into question the whole notion of nicotine being reinforcing. Then in 1981, Steven Goldberg of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) discovered that he simply had to fine-tune the nicotine delivery somewhat to see that it worked quite well as a reinforcer.6 Not as well as cocaine, but clearly it lay in the realm of reinforcing drugs. When Goldberg made nicotine available on an intermittent basis, and sometimes flashed on a small light as it was delivered, he found that squirrel monkeys would hit the lever as many as 250 times to get a single injection. The Goldberg experiment turned out to lie right at the beginning of a comprehensive set of studies on the addictive potential of nicotine carried out through the 1980s under the leadership of Goldberg and Jack Henningfield at NIDA’s Addiction Research Center (ARC) in Baltimore.g (See footnote on next page.) One of the things these scientists did was to extend Goldberg’s animal findings to human beings. They took some human volunteers—cigarette smokers—put catheters in their arms, and had them sit in a chair for three hours at a time with a radio playing and magazines to read. To the side was a machine with a couple of levers on it; one of the levers didn’t do anything, but the other was set up to deliver either nicotine or a saline solution. When nicotine was delivered, these people would press the bar for it at nice, regular intervals. At a certain dose of nicotine per injection, they’d press at about the same rate in each three-hour session, but if the dose were increased—if they got more per shot—they’d reach less frequently for the lever. That they weren’t simply interested in lever pressing or the experience of fluid injection is shown by what happened when (unbeknownst to them) saline was used: the lever pressing was disordered and unpredictable… ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1329))

- What do these dry, clinical terms actually mean? Well, Hatsukami and Hughes put some perspective on this by observing that in their outpatient study, the psychological tests the abstainers took put them in the 40th to 50th percentile of psychiatric outpatients. “Thus, during abstinence,” they say, “the subjects were as distressed as the average psychiatric outpatient.”12 This sounds about right. Confusion, craving, depression, hostility. Not physical and psychological collapse, as with heroin, but not normal either by a long shot. What proportion of quitters feel these effects? It’s hard to say; most of the people in the outpatient study reported experiencing five or more symptoms, but a review of many such studies indicates that perhaps one-quarter of all smokers who quit report no withdrawal whatsoever.13 My guess is that a standard distribution goes on, with a minority of quitters having no trouble, the majority in the middle having a fair amount of difficulty, and a minority over at the other end in a state of misery. How long does this go on? It’s generally agreed that withdrawal comes on within a matter of hours and peaks within two or three days. Within this time, confusion and anxiety are lessened, and sleep interruptions are fewer. Withdrawal is regarded by most people, I think, as the black beast at the heart of drug addiction, be it to heroin, cocaine, or cigarettes. That is to say, it is regarded as the single most important reason people cannot quit taking drugs. Yet is it withdrawal—short—term punishment for not taking a drug—that really is central to addiction? The symptoms of withdrawal may decline after a few days, but it is a false sunrise that greets the reformed smoker a week or so after quitting. Thereupon begins the more subtle—and because of this more insidious—“protracted abstinence” syndrome. The scientific literature contains reports of ex-smokers having intermittent, intense urges to smoke up to nine years after quitting; my guess is that these desires may exist for a lifetime in some people. Studies of long-term quitting rates confirm that protracted abstinence is much more of a minefield for ex-smokers than is immediate withdrawal.

- clinics have, over the years, been successful in getting 60 to 80 percent of their enrollees to quit during the few days to weeks that they are in session.14 Then begins the plunge: during the first three months after the program, 65 percent of those who quit will have returned to smoking. After a year, 75 percent of those who quit are smoking again. It’s worth noting that heroin addicts and alcoholics relapse at almost exactly this same rate.15h The months following quitting, then, are the long march for a great number of ex-smokers, and in this syndrome we can see, I think, the true depressive dilemma that comes with this brand of drug addiction. Protracted abstinence is the intermittent tug on the sleeve, the feeling in the chest, the whisper in the ear saying how good it would be to have just one cigarette. But one cigarette for a lot of ex-smokers means they’re gone; it means they’re back to life on the other plane. Back to the endless cycle of need and satiation, in which they get to carry on unhindered for only 40 minutes at a time, at which point they have to return to mother nicotine to receive permission to remain themselves. Without this homage, the smoker begins to turn into something slightly different: a person desirous of his controller, edgy, hostile, depressed, confused. Behold man.

It is regular, it is controlling, it has its own withdrawal syndrome, and so forth. From this evidence, we have a good idea of what it means to be a nicotine user and then to try to quit being one. Yet how much does this tell us, really? To say that withdrawal happens is not to say why it happens.

- set these things aside for the moment and concentrate on the inside of the box; let’s look, in other words, at what we know about the biological basis of addiction, concentrating first on withdrawal. The common thread that runs through most theories of withdrawal is that the body seeks stasis—it seeks to remain as it is—and accordingly will modify itself to remain the same when chronically pushed in a new direction by a drug. It’s rather like a house that is pushed in the direction of cold by the winds of January; the thermostat in the house works against this external influence to keep the home’s internal environment the same. The body has, in a sense, a multitude of small thermostats that push in the opposite direction from external drug influences. The pharmacological concept that describes this phenomenon is tolerance, normally a good thing in human affairs, but with a slightly different meaning in biology. Pharmacological tolerance means having to take progressively more of a given drug to keep getting the same effect from it.

Nicotine has its own forms of tolerance, but, as we might expect, its tolerance is more subtle than that of the opiates. Its most famous tolerance effect is that kids don’t keep getting nauseated from smoking once they take it up; there are other effects as well, however. Smokers are unaware of it, but they metabolize nicotine and other drugs faster than do nonsmokers. (Caffeine is one of these; Valium is another: smokers may require up to half again as much Valium as nonsmokers to get the same level of tranquilization.)1 Then, too, there is a kind of short-term tolerance, called tachyphylaxis, that comes with each day’s smoking.

- As I write this, one of the hotter topics in psychopharmacology is the notion that a single neurotransmitter and a single “reward pathway” are employed by our most serious drugs of abuse. Dozens of scientists are working on this topic, but the case for such a system—proceeding from the long-standing notion of “pleasure centers” in the brain—has been put forward most forcefully by a Canadian researcher named Roy Wise. The neurotransmitter in this system, appropriately enough, is dopamine. This substance is vitally important to human beings in domains completely separate from drugs, for it is a lack of dopamine, in an area of the brain called the corpus striatum, that causes the rigidity and shaking of Parkinson’s disease. The dopamine that comes to the corpus striatum is generated in an area deep in our “primitive” midbrain called the substantia nigra (or “black substance,” so named because it is dark brown or black).2 There are two other primary dopamine-producing areas nearby, however: the hypothalamus, and something called the ventral tegmental area. It is the last of these that concerns us here. The ventral tegmental area, in our midbrain, sends forward nerve projections, up and out toward the forehead, in a kind of coaxial cable called the medial forebrain bundle. There may be 50 different nerve pathways in ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1458))

- this bundle, which has been compared to a frayed rope. Among these fibers are the pathways for dopamine; for our purposes, the most important of these fibers—some of the frays in the rope—go to an area called the nucleus accumbens. To repeat, then: dopamine is created in the ventral tegmental area and goes out through the medial forebrain bundle to the nucleus accumbens. Here is the case for how this system is involved in drug addiction, according to Roy Wise.3 ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1468))

- What about nicotine? Work done by several teams of researchers has shown that nicotine causes the release of dopamine into this same system.4 What has not yet been done with nicotine is the other side of the coin: establishing that this system needs to be functioning for nicotine to be rewarding. It also appears that alcohol increases the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area. Now, what’s crucial to note about Wise’s argument is that this medial forebrain system is concerned only with positive reinforcement; that is, it has to do only with the things these various drugs do for people. Relief from the withdrawal that we looked at before is negative reinforcement—it has to do with people taking drugs to keep things they don’t like from happening to them (such as sleeplessness, tension, diarrhea). In Wise’s view, this positive dopamine system is separate from the several areas of the brain that seem to be involved in negative reinforcement.

- much getting off them, but staying off? It may be, Wise says, that because these substances are so powerfully reinforcing, we’re going to have a powerful hunger to experience their effects again and again purely from our memory of them: Craving for cocaine or heroin may, like craving for nicotine in a smoker who has been nicotine free for many years, simply be triggered by memories of past experience. Like a cat that has tasted fish, a human that has tasted cocaine may be unwilling to give up the hope of repeating the experience.6 Finally, should the medial forebrain hypothesis be even partly correct, it would go a long way toward explaining one of the best documented and least understood aspects of drug use: the multiple drug abuser. Ninety percent of all alcoholics smoke, and the percentage of opiate addicts who are smokers may be even higher. An appalling number of junkies have problems with alcohol.

- at very high risk of abusing several. If the dopamine hypothesis is correct, this would be understandable because all of these drugs are employing the same neural circuitry and producing something of the same effect. To put it in terms a cautious scientist never would, they are all yielding the same high to a certain degree.

- Under this view, the ex-alcoholic may make his road even tougher by continuing to smoke cigarettes. What credence should we give to the dopamine hypothesis? There seems to be a growing consensus among drug researchers that dopamine and the medial forebrain bundle are indeed involved in all the drug addictions we’ve talked about. Exactly what is meant by the weasel-word “involved,” however, is unclear at this point. Given the terrifying complexity of the brain and the drugs in question, many researchers are extremely skeptical of the notion that any one system will turn out to be responsible, even in some substantial part, for our worst drug addictions. Lots of objections can be raised to this hypothesis; any theory so overarching and audacious is bound to attract critics, and Wise certainly has his. I have gone into such detail on this theory not because I believe it to be true, though it may be, but because it is the most compelling attempt I have seen to turn a vast body of disparate research results into a coherent theory of the biology of reward in drug abuse. This is in itself an achievement that is rather hopeful: a certain critical mass of raw information has to exist before such theories can be produced. Once created, they then serve as organizing principles that can be tested through yet more research. Wise’s theory is, then, an example of what I hope we can look forward to more of in the future: testable notions of what drug addiction means at a biological level. Work on this subject is important not just as an academic matter. As we will see later, it’s possible that it could have great bearing on the approach that we, ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1522))

- In the extremes to which the need for drugs will push people, the biggest difference between nicotine and other addictive drugs is that nicotine is legal while the others are not.i Thus, thanks to the efficiencies of legal manufacture, a cigarette costs less than 10 cents, while a “rock” of cocaine may cost $10, even though both objects keep their users satisfied for about the same amount of time. Therefore, if you are paying $200 a day for cocaine and are poor to begin with, you live in squalor and rob people or kill them or do whatever is necessary to get that drug into your system. A nicotine habit, on the other hand, can be taken care of with a minimum-wage job. Despite this, however, there have been times in history when nicotine’s delivery vehicle, tobacco, has been unavailable—or available only at the most extreme monetary or human costs. In these rare instances, we get to see what would happen if nicotine were contraband like heroin, and hence a scarce and precious commodity. We begin with Robert Hughes’s account of life among the ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1544))

- prisoners of the penal colony that was Australia early in the 19th century. Life admittedly was worth far less there than in most times and places. Still, as Hughes reports: A group of prisoners were being led in single file through the forest when, without provocation or warning, one of them crushed the skull of the prisoner in front of him with his ax. Later he explained that there was no tobacco to be had in the settlement; that he had been a smoker all his life and would rather die than go without it; so, in the torment of nicotine withdrawal, he had killed the man in order to be hanged himself.1 Wartime has provided many of the most vivid instances of tobacco scarcity. Looking back on his experience in World War II, a Mr. N. A. Photiades wrote to the Times of London in 1957 to express his doubts about the worth of governmental actions aimed at persuading people to quit smoking. This came days after Britain’s ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1552))

- Medical Research Council had labeled cigarette smoking a major cause of lung cancer. He wrote: I had the misfortune to be a prisoner for nearly four years during the war and found that the one thing that men were unable to give up was cigarette smoking. There was, in fact, a very active market in bartering the handful of rice we received daily for the two cigarettes our hosts so kindly gave us. I have actually seen men die of starvation because they had sold their food for cigarettes. If men under those circumstances cannot abandon smoking, is it likely that we will now—with full pockets and stomachs? 2 Perhaps the greatest mass example of tobacco deprivation came in Germany after the war, where tobacco was so scarce and so universally… ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1560))

- butts in toilets”—and of the note scrawled beneath it: “It makes them soggy and hard to smoke.” The serious side to this can be seen in an account of this period written by F. I. Arntzen in 1948: Up to a point, the majority of the habitual smokers preferred to do without food even under extreme conditions of nutrition rather than to forgo tobacco … . Of 300 German civilians questioned, 256 had obtained tobacco at the black market, 37 had bought tobacco and food, and only 5 had bought food but no tobacco. Many housewives who were smokers bartered fat and sugar for cigarettes. In disregard of considerations of personal dignity, conventional decorum, and esthetic-hygenic feelings, cigarette butts were picked out of the street… ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1568))

- This list could go on, but I think the point is clear: Were tobacco illegal, we would see with it all the depraved trappings of drug culture that we associate with “serious” drugs like heroin or cocaine.

- Lynn Kozlowski and his colleagues at the Addiction Research Foundation in Toronto posed the following question to a sampling of their patients: “Think of your strongest urge to use cigarettes, and then think of your strongest urge to use alcohol or the drug that brought you here for treatment. Which was stronger?” About two-thirds of the patients reported that their urges for cigarettes were as strong as or stronger than their urges for alcohol. With heroin, about 20 percent reported that their urge to smoke was as strong as or stronger than their opiate need.2 Even at the lower bound of these studies, think what that means: 20 percent of the Toronto drug abusers had stronger urges to take this Munchkin drug tobacco than to use the very archetype of the addictive drug, heroin. If we ask how this could be so, we have at least a partial explanation at the level of human experience and conditioning. To put the matter simply, drug dependence is inextricably bound up with the setting in which drugs are taken; drug-taking behavior is strengthened to the degree that it is paired with other activities; and no drug on earth is paired with as many activities as is tobacco. We are in the territory of Pavlov here, but we can use a somewhat more appealing example than his dog to illustrate our point. A woman is invited to dinner at a restaurant she once frequented with her former lover. She has been with someone else for a year now, and she has thought neither of her former lover nor the restaurant in months. But being in the place again, with its familiar lighting and aromas, elicits a profound feeling of loss in her; for a few moments she misses her lover as though she had parted from him yesterday. Thus with drugs. The importance of the pairing of environment and drug use has been shown in many ways, but we can get an uncluttered look at the process in some animal experiments. To take but one example, in the 1970s Harbans Lal and his colleagues injected a group of lab rats with morphine; each injection was given, however, at the same time that an audible tone was sounded. After several days of this, the tone by itself had the power to elicit the physical signs of drug injection in the animals. (The tone raised their rectal temperatures, if you must know, just as morphine did. This may not seem like much of a sign of being high, but it’s difficult to get lab rats to express their feelings.) In a different experiment, these researchers made addicts out of another group of rats while pairing a bell sound with morphine injections. They then cut off the supply of morphine, but continued the bell sound for some of the animals. The result? The bell by itself lessened the severity of the narcotic withdrawal these animals were undergoing.3 Human beings are not immune to this kind of behavioral conditioning. Former addicts who have long been abstinent from drugs will, like our woman at the restaurant, experience extreme discomfort upon returning to the places in… ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007IVQTZE&location=1588))
