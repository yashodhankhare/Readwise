## Highlights
- The mental models presented here are focused on understanding the four most important attributes of a company when deciding if it is investable: its growth, its capital allocation, its pricing power and its valuation. These mental models are based on ([Location 28](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=28))

- the companies that have incrementally increased their share price over long time periods. It’s not possible to achieve this feat without also experiencing incremental growth in profits. While most data from the financial markets is noisy and meaningless, linearity over a long time period typically reveals high quality businesses that have high quality shareholders. This is because high quality shareholders invest and hold for the long-term due to the quality of the underlying business. Companies mostly owned by high quality shareholders do not see their share price being subjected to wild swings in trading volumes and shorting, which is why the linearity method helps us find them. Linearity is another example of using reverse engineering for finding compounding machines. Let’s consider the linearity of Company A and Company B’s share price in the previous example. The measure of linearity is R-Squared (R-Sq for short). A perfectly straight line that’s going up has a R-Sq of 1.00 and a perfectly straight line that’s going down has a R-Sq of -1.00. Company A has a linearity of 0.99, which is almost perfectly linear growth. Company B has a linearity of 0.73, ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=217))

- which is growth, but much more lumpy. When looking at the linearity of share prices, ideally a value above 0.85 over a 10 year time period should be seen as attractive. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=225))

- A company’s free cash flow can only be used for specific purposes. These are: Reinvesting in the company’s growth Paying down debt Paying out dividend Buying other companies Buying back the company’s own shares ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=329))

- Determining a company’s FCF growth is only the first step in our analysis. We now need to reach a view on whether growth can be maintained into the future. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=431))

- Once it has its money, the company then engages with its supply chain. Companies have suppliers of goods and services, and they are also the suppliers of goods and services to their customers. The lifecycle of a company’s capital is therefore as follows. A business will: Borrow money from their debt and equity investors, Exchange the money with their suppliers for goods and services, Provide goods and services to their customers in exchange for payment, then Return surplus profits to their investors.

- The three rules of corporate finance Corporate finance is the area of finance that concerns: (i) how a company funds itself (i.e. how it raises capital), and (ii) how it invests its capital. The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximise the value of the company. This is achieved by following the three rules of corporate finance: Buy high returning assets. Use low cost debt to finance the purchase of high returning assets. Only return capital to investors if there are no suitable opportunities for reinvestment. The rules of corporate finance have two implications for investors. Firstly, like companies, our aim when buying investments should also be maximising total return. This means we should not limit ourselves to one region of the world or one sector or industry. Instead we should only focus on investing in high quality assets with good opportunities for high returns. Secondly, when we evaluate a company we should consider (i) how high the return is on their assets, (ii) how low the cost is of their debt, and (iii) their framework for returning capital to investors.

- In summary, the preferred approach is to calculate the company’s free cash flow return on its invested capital (the sum of a company’s shareholder equity and non-current liabilities). ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=467))

- Once expressed as a percentage, the number tells you how many dollars of cash the company generates for every $100 of capital invested. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=468))

- For long-term compounding it’s important that both high growth and a high ROC be in place. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=634))

- One option for investors faced with a company that has a high return on capital, but also a high payout ratio, is to reinvest the dividends by purchasing more shares in the company. This isn’t ideal, as having the company reinvest its capital for you saves on transaction fees and taxes. Investors will also benefit from the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. If a company has a P/B ratio of 10, then that effectively means it costs $10 to buy just $1 of a company’s capital. This is inefficient for investors looking to reinvest dividends, but very efficient for investors in companies that reinvest earnings, rather than paying them out. This is because if a company retains $1 of earnings, then that $1 of earnings has a market value of $10. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=652))

- The best protection against inflation is to own companies that have pricing power. As investors we want companies that are price setters, not price takers. Oil companies are ultimately price takers, as they can’t control the price of oil, which is set externally by the global oil market. Companies with pricing power are price setters. They are typically insulated from commodity prices and interest rates, and can consistently raise their prices over time, often above inflation, without seeing a decrease in demand for their product. When inflation climbs, companies with pricing power are able to pass on their increased costs to their customers.

- We can infer that a company with a consistently high return on capital and a consistently high margin has both pricing power and other competitive advantages. Qualitative research into the companies with these financial properties reveals the parts of their business models that they have in common.

- While the preceding chapters have demonstrated the importance of high FCF per share growth, high FCF returns on capital and high FCF margins, the above case studies should also demonstrate the importance of qualitative analysis. Strong financial metrics allow us to infer that a company has a resilient business, but it is also important that we support our inferences with an understanding of the business models of each potential investment. Set out below are a series of questions to help you get started with your qualitative research: ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=785))

- The second valuation principle is that you can still pay an expensive price and make a significant return. There are numerous historic examples of where investors could have paid expensive valuations and still made significantly high returns. This is because valuations are moments in time snapshots of moving objects. Imagine a photograph of sprinters taken halfway through a race. While the photo captures the positions of each runner at a specific moment in time, it does not reveal each runner’s speed, whether they were getting faster or slowing down, how much energy they had left and who won the race. Similarly the market’s valuation does not tell you how fast a company is growing, how predictable the company’s revenues are, their ability to raise prices, whether it has new markets to enter and whether it can protect itself from economic cycles. There are plenty of examples in sport of teams and athletes that are behind making spectacular comebacks. There are also plenty of examples in business of beaten down companies making equally spectacular comebacks. While share price reflects the market’s valuation at a specific moment in time, it does not tell you what’s going to happen in the company’s future.

- While it is tempting to say that companies trading on a FCF yield of 4% have a more attractive valuation than companies trading at 2%, such a conclusion only focuses on the market’s current valuation and does not consider the quality of the cash flows being valued. A company trading at a 2% FCF yield may have faster growth, a better quality underlying business, less exposure to economic cycles and low levels of debt on its balance sheet. The company trading at a 4% FCF yield may have slower growth, a shrinking market share, exposure to commodity prices and high amounts of debt on its balance sheet. Given that choice, it would make more sense for the investor to consider the company trading at 2%. Therefore, FCF yields cannot be considered in isolation. In the following table both Company A and B generate $2.00 of FCF per share. Company A manages to grow its FCF at 20% per year, while Company B only manages to grow its FCF at 2% per year. While at first Company A is trading at ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=856))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- twice the valuation of Company B (a 2% yield compared to a 4% yield in year 0), the forward FCF yield 5 years later is higher for Company A than Company B (4.98% compared to 4.42% in year 5). This is because over the long-term a high FCF growth rate means that the valuation is actually more attractive than it first appears.

- Ideally valuation should be a comparative exercise where you compare the relative valuations of high quality companies with high FCF growth rates. The following table sets out the FCF yields at the time of writing (December 2022) for a subset of high quality companies that have grown their FCF by over 15% per year over the last 5 years. The wide range of valuations (1.3% to 5.0%) demonstrates that there are often value opportunities among the universe of high quality companies.

- When you see that a company’s share price has steadily gone up over time, the first reaction should be to question whether the share price growth was driven by free cash flow growth or a change in the market’s valuation.

- The following table describes three hypothetical companies. Each company grew its share price 6-fold. However, each company achieved this through different routes. Company A grew its free cash flows, Company B grew its valuation and Company C grew both. In reality it is Company C that reflects most quality growth companies. This example also demonstrates the important fact that any share price change can be understood by the growth of a company’s free cash flow and the change in its valuation. Share price returns are ultimately driven by the ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=962))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- change in valuation and growth. Stocks enjoying attractive valuations coupled with strong growth prospects have the potential for both increases in the valuation combined with growth in FCF to work together to create share price growth. That’s why growth and valuation must be considered side by side. While a change in valuation can be significant, a company’s growth can last for decades, hence why growth is the more important factor here.

- It is therefore important to consider what it is that actually influences a company’s share price. Ultimately it comes down to supply and demand, with the market’s demand for a company’s share being driven by: The market’s view of the company’s growth prospects. This involves the market pricing in the company’s actual historic earnings, the estimates of its future earnings and its competitive advantages.

- The market’s view of the economy. Company’s don’t exist in a vacuum, they exist as part of the wider economy. The market’s valuation will price in economic factors such as inflation, employment, financial stability, public health and war. Changes in the earnings yield of the S&P 500 and the value of a volatility index, such as the VIX, are both useful indicators of the market’s view of the economy and equities. The market’s ability to invest. Even if the market views a company and the economy favourably, the market can still be limited by its own ability to invest. The activity of central banks in setting the monetary supply, through interest rates and quantitative easing, also strongly influence share prices. Interest rates are often described as gravity for share prices. This is because a long-term low interest rate supports high valuations, while a long-term high interest rate suppresses valuations.

- several decades. It demonstrates that high quality growth companies more often than not provide suitable entry points for long-term investors on a frequent basis. This is why it is often said that “there is rarely a bad time to buy a compounding machine”. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=996))

- In closing, investors should focus primarily on the quality of a company’s business, the resilience of its cash flows and the advantages it has over its competition. As long as these remain in place and you’re prepared to be a long-term shareholder, the valuation you enter in, will more often than not, be of little consequence. Comparing the FCF yields of high quality companies, should help reveal the value opportunities that sit within the investment universe of high quality companies.

- The above evidence suggests that 20-25 high quality companies held for the long-term is probably all that the average investor needs to be diversified and to outperform. This approach ensures that investments are given the time required to compound their value. The lesson here is: don’t interrupt compounding unnecessarily.

- Time-weighted return (TWR) We’re now approaching the end of the book. We’ve covered how to create a shortlist of potential investments, how to evaluate that shortlist based on four financial metrics and how to use scoring and ranking to inform your investment decision making. Having put together a portfolio of high quality companies, all that’s left to do is sit back and monitor its performance. It can be difficult to calculate the return of a portfolio when there are numerous inflows and outflows of cash. You can’t simply subtract the starting balance from the end balance, as your return will also ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=1490))

- include cash that was added to the portfolio. This is where time-weighted return comes in. It allows you to account for your portfolio’s inflows and outflows when calculating the compound rate of growth of your portfolio. An example is set out in the following table. You start the year with $10,000. At the end of January your portfolio grows by 5% to $10,500. At the end of February your portfolio has grown again, this time by 4.8%, to $11,000. In March you decide to add $1,000 to your portfolio. Therefore, while you started with $11,000, your inflow means you actually started with $12,000. You also end March with $12,000, meaning your portfolio didn’t grow during this month. In April your portfolio drops in value to $11,000, representing a -8.3% loss. In May you decide to withdraw $500 from your portfolio. Therefore, while you started the month with $11,000, you actually started with $10,500. You end May with $11,000 again, meaning that your portfolio has grown by 4.8%. You end June with $12,000, meaning your portfolio grew by 9.1% over the month and by 15.2% over the first half of the year. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=1495))

- To calculate the time-weighted return for each period, you simply need to divide the End value by the Actual Start value and then subtract 1. So for January this is: 10,500 / 10,000 - 1 = 0.05 TWR is a fraction, which can then be expressed as a percentage. In this instance it’s 5.0%. Having calculated the TWR for each period, we can then calculate the year to date (YTD) return. To do this we simply add 1 to each TWR value, then multiply each value, before finally subtracting 1. So in this example we simply calculate the following: (0.050 + 1) * (0.048 + 1) * (0.000 + 1) * (-0.083 + 1) * (0.048 + 1) * (0.091 + 1) - 1 = 0.152 Again, this fraction can be expressed as a percentage, to reveal that the year to date performance of the portfolio is 15.2%. While the time periods used in the above example ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT8BV98C&location=1548))

- are months, the same approach could be used for days or years. You can then compare your return to other investors or the market. Having screened and filtered thousands of potential investments, and evaluated each investment based on their quality and valuation, it is ultimately your portfolio’s time-weighted return that matters.
