## Highlights
- The scoreboard, in effect, had given Val a false picture. She had assumed that Neumann would make her 3-foot par putt and tie for the lead if she missed her own par putt. It was a false assumption. But that false assumption, plus the information from the leaderboard, made her own par putt harder than it needed to be and nearly cost her the tournament. Of course, it’s very difficult to block out the score. “Doc,” Val told me later, “I didn’t want to look at that leaderboard. But it was like that leaderboard was looking at me.” ([Location 2175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEJ2GG&location=2175))

- To score consistently, a golfer must think consistently. A sound, consistent pre-shot routine makes it easier. The correlation between thinking well and making successful shots is not 100 percent. But the correlation between thinking badly and unsuccessful shots is much higher. Golfers must learn to quiet… ([Location 2564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEJ2GG&location=2564))
- The loss of focus on four or five shots a round makes the difference between great golf and mediocre golf. A golfer must learn to enjoy the process of striving to improve the short game.

- It is more important to be decisive than to be correct when preparing to play any golf shot, particularly a putt. Confidence is crucial to good golf.

- A golfer should strive to be looser, freer, and more confident with every hole. This will combat the tendency to get tighter, more careful, and more doubtful. Being careful, tightening up, and trying to steer the ball will likely cause disaster. Good golfers gain control over the ball by feeling that they are giving up control. Golfers need selective memories,… ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEJ2GG&location=2573))

- Players with great attitudes constantly monitor their thinking and catch themselves as soon as it begins to falter. A good competitor never allows herself to intensely dislike another player. She might be paired with her for an important round. The quality of a golfer’s… ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEJ2GG&location=2583))
- If a golfer chooses to compete, he must choose to believe that he can win. Winners and losers in life are completely self-determined, but only the winners are willing to admit it. Courage is a necessary quality in all champions. But an athlete cannot be courageous without first being afraid. In sport, the bad news for the present champion is that tomorrow is a new day, when the competition starts again from scratch. But that’s the good news for everyone else. On the course, golfers must have… ([Location 2586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEJ2GG&location=2586))
