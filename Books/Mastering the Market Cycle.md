## Highlights
- Some of these patterns are commonly called cycles. They arise from naturally occurring phenomena but, importantly, also from the ups and downs of human psychology and from the resultant human behavior. Because human psychology and behavior play such a big part in creating them, these cycles aren’t as regular as the cycles of clock and calendar, but they still give rise to better and worse times for certain actions. And they can profoundly affect investors. If we pay attention to cycles, we can come out ahead. If we study past cycles, understand their origins and import, and keep alert for the next one, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel in order to understand every investment environment anew. And we have less of ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=70))

- It’s my primary message that we should pay attention to cycles; perhaps I should say “listen to them.” Dictionary.com supplies two closely related but distinct definitions for the word “listen.” The first is “to attend closely for the purpose of hearing.” The second is “to heed.” Both definitions are relevant to what I’m writing about.

- with cycles—an investor has to learn to recognize cycles, assess them, look for the instructions they imply, and do what they tell him to do. (See the author’s note below regarding my use of male pronouns.) If an investor listens in this sense, he will be able to convert cycles from a wild, uncontrollable force that wreaks havoc, into a phenomenon that can be understood and taken advantage of: a vein that can be mined for significant outperformance.

- A winning investment philosophy can be created only through the combination of a number of essential elements: A technical education in accounting, finance and economics provides the foundation: necessary but far from sufficient. A view on how markets work is important—you should have one before you set out to invest, but it must be added to, questioned, refined and reshaped as you proceed. Some of your initial views will come from what you’ve read, so reading is an essential building block. Continuing to read will enable you to increase the efficacy of your approach—both embracing those ideas you find appealing and discarding those you don’t. Importantly, it’s great to read outside the strict boundaries of investing. Legendary investor Charlie Munger often points to the benefits of reading broadly; history and processes ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=90))

- in other fields can add greatly to effective investment approaches and decisions. Exchanging ideas with fellow investors can be an invaluable source of growth. Given the non-scientific nature of investing, there’s no such thing as being finished with your learning, and no individual has a monopoly on insight. Investing can be solitary, but I think those who practice it in solitude are missing a lot, both intellectually and interpersonally. Finally, there really is no substitute for experience. Every year I have come to view investing differently, and every cycle I’ve lived through has taught me something about how to cope with the next one. I recommend a long career and see no reason to stop any time soon. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=96))

- Since knowledge is cumulative but we never know it all, I look forward to learning more in the years ahead. In investing, there is nothing that always works, since the environment is always changing, and investors’ efforts to respond to the environment cause it to change further. Thus I hope to know things in the future that I don’t know now, and I look forward to sharing them in memos and books yet to come.

- Please note that when I talk about “investing,” I’ll assume the investor is buying, holding or, as we say, “being long” in the expectation that certain assets will appreciate. This is as opposed to selling short securities that one doesn’t own in the hope they’ll decline. Investors aren’t always “long” rather than “short,” but most of the time they are. The number of people who sell stocks short or ever get “net short”—that is, whose short positions have a total value exceeding that of the stocks they own—is tiny relative to those who don’t. Thus, in this book I’m going to speak exclusively about investing in things because they’re expected to rise, not selling assets short in the hope they’ll fall.

- The odds change as our position in the cycles changes. If we don’t change our investment stance as these things change, we’re being passive regarding cycles; in other words, we’re ignoring the chance to tilt the odds in our favor. But if we apply some insight regarding cycles, we can increase our bets and place them on more aggressive investments when the odds are in ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=146))

- So, in my view, trying to predict what the macro future holds is unlikely to help investors achieve superior investment performance. Very few investors are known for having outperformed through macro forecasting. Warren Buffett once told me about his two criteria for a desirable piece of information: it has to be important, and it has to be knowable. Although “everyone knows” that macro developments play a dominant role in determining the performance of markets these days, “macro investors” as a whole have shown rather unimpressive results. It’s not that the macro doesn’t matter, but rather that very few people can master it. For most, it’s just not knowable (or not knowable well enough and consistently enough for it to lead to outperformance). Thus I dismiss macro prediction as something that will bring investment success for the vast majority of investors, and I certainly include myself in that group. If that’s so, what’s left? While there are lots of details and nuances, I think we can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas: trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities, being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation in those fundamentals, and understanding the investment environment we’re in and deciding how to strategically position our portfolios for it.

- What do value investors do? They strive to take advantage of discrepancies between “price” and “value.” In order to do that successfully, they have to (a) quantify an asset’s intrinsic value and how it’s likely to change over time and (b) assess how the current market price compares with the asset’s intrinsic value, past prices for the asset, the prices of other assets, and “theoretically fair” prices for assets in general.

- In my view, the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressiveness and defensiveness. And I believe the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment and where a number of elements stand in their cycles.   The key word is “calibrate.” The amount you have invested, your allocation of capital among the various possibilities, and the riskiness of the things you own all should be calibrated along a continuum that runs from aggressive to defensive. . . . When we’re getting value cheap, we should be aggressive; when we’re getting value expensive, we should pull back. (“Yet Again?,” September 2017)   Calibrating one’s portfolio position is what this book is mostly about. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=182))

- I lean heavily toward the first definition: in my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want.

- What is the origin of risk? One of my favorite investment philosophers, the late Peter Bernstein, said in an issue of his Economics and Portfolio Strategy newsletter titled “Can We Measure Risk with a Number?” (June 2007):   Essentially risk says we don’t know what’s going to happen. . . . We walk every moment into the unknown. There’s a range of outcomes, and we don’t know where [the actual outcome is] going to fall within the range. Often we don’t know what the range is.

- As retired London Business School professor Elroy Dimson said, “Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” For each event in economics, business and markets (among other things), if only one thing could happen—if there could be only one outcome—and if it were predictable, there would, of course, be no uncertainty or risk. And with no uncertainty regarding what was going to happen, in theory we could know exactly how to position our portfolios to avoid loss and garner… ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=205))

- Investors—or anyone hoping to deal successfully with the future—have to form probability distributions, either explicitly or informally. If it’s done well, those probabilities will be helpful in determining one’s proper course of action. But it’s still essential to bear in mind that even if we know the probabilities, that doesn’t mean we know what’s going to happen. Outcomes regarding a given matter may be governed by a probability distribution in the long run, but with regard to the outcome of a single event there can be great uncertainty. Any of the outcomes included in a distribution can occur, albeit with varying probabilities, since the process through which the outcome is chosen will be affected not only by the merits, but also by randomness. To invert Dimson’s statement, even though many things can happen, only one will. We may know what to expect “on average,” but that may have no connection with what actually will happen. In my way of thinking about it, investment success is like the choosing of a lottery winner. Both are determined by one ticket (the outcome) being pulled from a bowlful (the full range of possible outcomes). In each case, one outcome is chosen from among the many possibilities. Superior investors are people who have a better sense for what tickets are in the bowl, and thus for whether it’s worth participating in the lottery. In other words, while superior investors—like everyone else—don’t know exactly what the future holds, they do have an above-average understanding of future tendencies. As an aside, I want to add a thought here. Most people think the way to deal with the future is by formulating an opinion as to what’s going to happen, perhaps via a probability distribution. I think there are actually two requirements, not one. In addition to an opinion regarding what’s going to happen, people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will prove correct. Some events can be… ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=212))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In other words, in order to win at this game more often than you lose, you have to have a knowledge advantage. That’s what the superior investor has: he knows more than others about the future tendencies. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=245))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But all this being said, there doesn’t have to be certainty in order for the game to be worth playing. A knowledge advantage regarding the tendencies is enough to create success in the long run. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=251))

- The superior investor is attentive to cycles. He takes note of whether past patterns seem to be repeating, gains a sense for where we stand in the various cycles that matter, and knows those things have implications for his actions. This allows him to make helpful judgments about cycles and where we stand in them. Specifically: ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=258))

- Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages? If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that we’re now in dangerous territory? Does investors’ behavior suggest they’re being driven by greed or by fear? Do they seem appropriately risk-averse or foolishly risk-tolerant? Is the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap) because of what’s been going on cyclically? Taken together, does our current position in the cycle imply that we should emphasize defensiveness or aggressiveness? Attention to these elements gives the superior investor an edge that allows him to win more often than he loses. He understands the tendencies or odds; thus he knows something that others don’t about the color of the balls in the jar. He has a sense for whether the chances of winning exceed the chances of losing; thus he is able to invest more when they are favorable and less when they aren’t. Importantly, all these things can be assessed on the basis of observations regarding current conditions. As we’ll see in later chapters, they can tell us how to prepare for the future without requiring that we be able to predict the future. Remember, where we stand in the various cycles has a strong influence on the odds. For example, as we’ll see in later chapters, opportunities for investment gains improve when: the economy and company profits are more likely to swing upward than down, investor psychology is sober rather than buoyant, investors are conscious of risk or—even better—overly concerned about risk, and market prices haven’t moved too high. There are cycles in all these things (and more), and knowing where we ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=260))

- stand within them can help us tilt the odds in our favor. In short, the movement through the cycle repositions the probability distribution governing future events. Perhaps I should illustrate with regard to investment returns: When our position in the various cycles is neutral, the outlook for returns is “normal.”     When the cycles are positioned propitiously, the probability distribution shifts to the right, such that the outlook for returns is now tilted in our favor. Our favorable position in the cycles makes gains more likely and losses less so.     But when the cycles are at dangerous extremes, the odds are against us, meaning the likelihoods are less good. There’s less chance of gain and more chance of loss.     The same is true when our position changes in only a single cycle. For example, regardless of what’s going on with regard to the economy and company profits (that is, as the academics say, ceteris paribus or “all other things being equal”), the outlook for returns will be better when investors are depressed and fearful (and thus allow asset prices to fall) and worse when they’re euphoric and greedy (and drive prices upward). The odds change as our position in the cycles changes. If we don’t change our investment stance as these things change, we’re being passive regarding cycles; in other words, we’re ignoring the chance to tilt the odds in our favor. But if we apply some insight regarding cycles, we can increase our bets and place them on more aggressive investments when the odds are in our favor, and we can take money off the table and increase our defensiveness when the odds are against us.

- Most people think of cycles in terms of a series of events. And most people understand that these events regularly follow each other in a usual sequence: upswings are followed by downswings, and then eventually by new upswings. But to have a full understanding of cycles, that’s not enough. The events in the life of a cycle shouldn’t be viewed merely as each being followed by the next, but—much more importantly—as each causing the next.

- I confess that I alternate between discussing the ups and downs of cycles and the side-to-side oscillations of pendulums, applying the cycle label to some phenomena and (as seen in chapter VII) the pendulum label to others (usually those connected to psychology). Sometimes I’ll talk about a given phenomenon as a cycle, and sometimes as a pendulum. But when pressed, I find it hard to distinguish between the two or to say why one gets one label and not the other. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=311))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There really is no fundamental difference. I’ll even admit that a pendulum is little more than a special case of a cycle, or perhaps just a different way to make reference to particular cycles. My reasons for referring to some things as cycles and others as pendulums are clear to me. I hope they will become clear to you as well. Or, at minimum, I hope my use of the two terms won’t detract from what you take from this book. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=317))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The bottom line is that, in the world investors inhabit, cycles rise and fall, and pendulums swing back and forth. Cycles and pendulum swings come in many forms and relate to a wide variety of phenomena, but the underlying reasons for them—and the patterns they produce—have a lot in common, and they tend to be somewhat consistent over time. Or as Mark Twain is reputed to have said (although there’s no evidence he actually said it), “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” Whether Twain said it or not, that sentence sums up a lot of what this book is about. Cycles vary in terms of reasons and details, and timing and extent, but the ups and downs (and the reasons for them) will occur forever, producing changes in the investment environment—and thus in the behavior that’s called for. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=320))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The fact is that the performance of these things is heavily influenced in the short run by, among other things, the involvement of people, and people are far from steady. Rather they fluctuate from time to time, often because of things we can lump under the broad heading of “psychology.” Thus people’s behavior varies . . . certainly as the environment varies, but sometimes in the absence of changes in the environment, too. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=331))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It’s important to note from the above that there cannot be said to be a single “starting point” or “ending point” for a cycle. Any of the phases listed above can be described as representing the beginning of a cycle . . . or the end . . . or any stage in between. The simplistic narrator may find it easy to talk about the beginning of a cycle, but someone a bit more sophisticated can find that extremely hard. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=347))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- People often ask me “what caused the cycle to begin?” or “are we close to the end of the cycle?” I consider these improper questions, since cycles neither begin nor end. Better questions might be: “what caused the current up-leg to begin?” or “how far have we gone since the beginning of the up-cycle?” or “are we close to the end of the down-leg?” You might even ask whether we’re close to the end of a cycle, as long as you define it as running from one peak to the next, or from trough to trough. But—in the absence of such a definition—cycles do not have a defined beginning, and I believe they will never end. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=356))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The cycle oscillates, as I mentioned, around the midpoint. The midpoint of a cycle is generally thought of as the secular trend, norm, mean, average or “happy medium,” and generally as being in some sense as “right and proper.” The extremes of the cycle, on the other hand, are thought of as aberrations or excesses to be returned from, and generally they are. While the thing that’s cycling tends to spend much of the time above or below it, eventual movement back in the direction of the mean is usually the rule. The movement from either a high or a low extreme back toward the midpoint is often described as “regression toward the mean,” a powerful and very reasonable tendency in most walks of life. But, thinking back to the cycle stages listed above, it can also be seen that the cyclical pattern generally consists as much of movement from the reasonable midpoint toward a potentially imprudent extreme (phases b, e and h in the preceding graphic) as it does going from an extreme back toward the midpoint (a, d and g). The rational midpoint generally exerts a kind of magnetic pull, bringing the thing that’s cycling back from an extreme in the direction of “normal.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=361))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But it usually doesn’t stay at normal for long, as the influences responsible for the swing toward the midpoint invariably continue in force and thus cause the swing back from an extreme to proceed through the midpoint and then carry further, toward the opposite extreme. It’s important to recognize and accept the dependability of this pattern. The details vary—the timing, duration, speed and power of the swings and, very importantly, the reasons for them—and that’s likely what’s behind Twain’s remark regarding history not repeating. But the underlying dynamics are usually similar. In particular, that means the swing back from a high or low almost never halts at the midpoint . . . regardless of how “right” ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=369))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- or “appropriate” the midpoint may be. The continuation of the movement past the midpoint and toward the opposite extreme is highly dependable. For example, markets rarely go from “underpriced” to “fairly priced” and stop there. Usually the fundamental improvement and rising optimism that cause markets to recover from depressed levels remain in force, causing them to continue right through “fairly priced” and on to “overpriced.” It doesn’t have to happen, but usually it does.

- The process described in the three bullet points above sounds like a physical one, governed by forces such as gravity and momentum. But as I mentioned above and we’ll see later on, the most important deviations from the general trend—and the variation in those deviations’ timing, speed and extent—are largely produced by fluctuations in psychology. If you consider the human psyche—rather than physical attributes—to be the source of much of the energy or momentum, these three points do a pretty good job of also explaining the swings and oscillations that investors are challenged to deal with.

- It’s extremely important to note this causal relationship: that the cycles I’m talking about consist of series of events that cause the ones that follow. But it’s equally significant to note that while cycles occur in a variety of areas due to these serial events, cyclical developments in one area also influence cycles in others. Thus the economic cycle influences the profit cycle. Corporate announcements determined by the profit cycle influence investor attitudes. Investor attitudes influence markets. And developments in markets influence the cycle in the availability of credit . . . which influences economies, companies and markets.

- as my descriptions will be. The various cycles operate on their own, but they also continuously affect each other. I try to tease out the various threads in my mind and treat them separately, and that is the way this book will be organized. But the well-behaved, isolated cycles I’ll describe are only an analytical concept. In life they’re really a jumble of interrelated phenomena that can’t be separated entirely. A affects B (and C), and B affects A (and C), and they all influence D, which influences all of them. They’re all entangled with each other, but we must think about them in an orderly fashion if we are to understand cycles and their effects.

- Cycles are self-correcting, and their reversal is not necessarily dependent on exogenous events. The reason they reverse (rather than going on forever) is that trends create the reasons for their own reversal. Thus I like to say success carries within itself the seeds of failure, and failure the seeds of success.

- perception, cycles are often viewed as less symmetrical than they are. Negative price fluctuations are called “volatility,” while positive price fluctuations are called “profit.” Collapsing markets are called “selling panics,” while surges receive more benign descriptions (but I think they may best be seen as “buying panics”; see tech stocks in 1999, for example). Commentators talk about “investor capitulation” at the bottom of market cycles, while I also see capitulation at the top, when previously prudent investors throw in the towel and buy.

What Twain must have meant by this statement—if he indeed was responsible for it—is that whereas the details vary from one event to another in a given category of history (say, the ascent of demagogues), the underlying themes and mechanisms are consistent.

- In short, the details are unimportant and can be irrelevant. But the themes are essential, and they absolutely do tend to recur. Understanding that tendency—and being able to spot the recurrences—is one of the most important elements in dealing with cycles. Finally, I want to bring in the definition of insanity that Albert Einstein is credited with: “doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” When people invest in things after they’ve been carried aloft because “everyone knows” they’re both flawless and underpriced—thinking they offer high returns without risk of loss—that’s insanity. Such beliefs have been defrocked in the aftermath of every bubble. But many people—either unaware that bubbles tend to be followed by crashes, or blinded to that risk by their eagerness to get rich quickly—buy into the next one nevertheless.

- The length of this chapter and the large variety of topics covered are indicative of the multi-faceted and challenging nature of cycles. For this reason, cycles have to be understood both analytically and intuitively. As with many other aspects of investing, those who possess the latter ability in addition to the former will go the furthest. Can an intuitive approach be taught? Yes, to some degree, but most fully to those who start off with the gift of insight. In short, some people just tend to “get it” (whatever “it” may be) and some ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=493))

- don’t. Courses in accounting, finance and security analysis will equip the investor with the technical knowledge that is necessary for success but, in my opinion those courses are far from sufficient. The main element missing from them is an understanding of cyclical phenomena and how they develop as set forth in this book. Some cues will be found in the newly established fields of behavioral economics and behavioral finance, and I commend them to your attention. Psychology is an essential component in understanding the cycles that matter so much to investors. The greatest lessons regarding cycles are learned through experience . . . as in the adage “experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.” ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=497))

I hope what you read here will add to your understanding and speed your education. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=502))

- In the fall of 2013, in response to something I’d written in The Most Important Thing, I received an email from Nick Train of Lindsell Train, a London-based money management firm. Nick took issue with my use of the word “cycle” to describe phenomena like those I’m discussing here. Nick and I had a healthy email colloquy regarding the issue and met for an enjoyable, spirited lunch. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=515))

- By the time the main course arrived, it had become clear that what motivated Nick to write was his conviction that for something to be described as cyclical, its timing and extent have to be regular and thus predictable. A radio cycle or sine wave, for example, rises and falls in a regular, predictable pattern, with the same amplitude, frequency and ending point every time. Dictionary.com defines a cycle in physics as “a complete alteration in which a phenomenon attains a maximum and minimum value, returning to a final value equal to the original one,” and a cycle in mathematics as “a permutation of a set of elements that leaves the original cyclic order of the elements unchanged.” In other words, these scientific and mathematical ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=517))

- cycles follow patterns so regular that they end up back where they started, and that happens because the timing and path of the fluctuations are always the same. Score one for Nick. But economies, companies and markets—and certainly investors’ psyches and behavior—are not regular in this way. I asserted at our lunch, and I think Nick eventually agreed, that things can be cyclical without exhibiting this degree of consistency. It’s all a matter of your definition of the word “cycle.” Here’s part of what I wrote to Nick to follow up:   What I claim is that, usually,… ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=523))

- The most important thing to note here is that, as I said in the last chapter, the things I call cycles do not stem completely—or sometimes at all—from the operation of mechanical, scientific or physical processes. They would be much more dependable and predictable if they did—but much less potentially profitable. (This is because the greatest profits come from seeing things better than others do, and if cycles were totally dependable and predictable, there would be no such thing as superiority in seeing them.) Sometimes there is an underlying principle (and sometimes not), but much variation is attributable to the role of humans in creating cycles.

- If the number of workers working and the amount they earn were relatively constant, we might expect the amount they spend on consumption to be similarly constant. But it isn’t. Spending fluctuates more than employment and earnings because of variation in something called “the marginal propensity to consume”: of every additional dollar earned, it determines the percentage that will go to consumption. Because this propensity is variable in the short run, consumption can vary independently of income. Earners may choose to spend a higher ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=774))

This phenomenon demonstrates the contribution of psychology to behavior, and behavior to short-term economic variation. It’s particularly important in this vein to note the extent to which economic expectations can be self-fulfilling. If people (and companies) believe the future will be good, they’ll spend more and invest more . . . and the future will be good, and vice versa. It’s my belief that most companies concluded that the Crisis of 2008 wouldn’t be followed by a V-shaped recovery, as had been the rule in the last few recessions. Thus they declined to expand factories or workforces, and the resulting recovery was modest and gradual in the U.S. (and ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=784))

- even more anemic elsewhere). Another reason for short-term variation concerns inventories. Businesses may overestimate the demand for their products in a given period and thus increase production such that it exceeds the amount they can sell. Or they may hold production constant but encounter surprisingly soft demand. In either case, more goods will be produced than sold. The excess will be added to inventories. That, in turn, is likely to cause production in subsequent periods to be adjusted downward until inventories are restored to desired levels. In this way, additions to and reductions in inventories often lead to short-term ups and downs in economic output.

There’s only one catch: since major deviations from trend (a) occur infrequently and (b) are hard to correctly predict, most unconventional, non-extrapolation forecasts turn out to be incorrect, and anyone who invests on their basis is usually likely to do below average. So these are the possibilities I see with regard to economic forecasts: Most economic forecasts are just extrapolations. Extrapolations are usually correct but not valuable. Unconventional forecasts of significant deviation from trend would be very valuable if they were correct, but usually they aren’t.

- Thus central banks turned to managing inflation. The goal wasn’t to eliminate inflation—since it is accepted as (a) having a variety of salutary aspects and (b) being largely unavoidable—but to control it. The reasons for inflation are somewhat mysterious and, like many other processes described here, unreliable and sporadic. Sometimes a given set of circumstances will give rise to inflation, and at other times the same circumstances will lead to more or less inflation, or to none at all. But in general, inflation is viewed as a result of a strong upward movement of the economic cycle. When the demand for goods increases relative to the supply, there can be “demand-pull” inflation. When inputs to production such as labor and raw materials increase in price, there can be “cost-push” inflation. Finally, when the value of an importing country’s currency declines relative to that of an exporting country, the cost of the exporter’s goods can rise in the importing country.

They, too, follow a cycle—one that is influenced by the economic cycle, but that rises and falls much more than the economy as a whole. So profits are more volatile than GDP. The question is why? What factors cause the profit cycle to perform differently from the economic cycle?

- The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the movement of a pendulum. Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on average,” it actually spends very little of its time there. Instead, it is almost always swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc. But whenever the pendulum is near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1063))

- toward the midpoint sooner or later. In fact, it is the movement toward an extreme itself that supplies the energy for the swing back. Investment markets make the same pendulum-like swing: between euphoria and depression, between celebrating positive developments and obsessing over negatives, and thus between being overpriced and underpriced. This oscillation is one of the most dependable features of the investment world, and investor psychology seems to spend much more time at the extremes than it does at a “happy medium.” ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1065))

- July 2004, but now with data brought up to date through 2016):   Putting it all together, fluctuations in attitudes and behavior combine to make the stock market the ultimate pendulum. In my 47 full calendar years in the investment business, starting with 1970, the annual returns on the S&P 500 have swung from plus 37% to minus 37%. Averaging out good years and bad years, the long-run return is usually stated as 10% or so. Everyone’s been happy with that typical performance and would love more of the same. But remember, a swinging pendulum may be at its midpoint “on average,” but it actually spends very little time there. The same is true of financial market performance.

- a fun question (and a good illustration): for how many of the 47 years from 1970 through 2016 was the annual return on the S&P 500 within 2% of “normal”—that is, between 8% and 12%? I expected the answer to be “not that often,” but I was surprised to learn that it had happened only three times! It also surprised me to learn that the return had been more than 20 percentage points away from “normal”—either up more than 30% or down more than 10%—more than one-quarter of the time: 13 out of the last 47 years. So one thing that can be said with total conviction about stock market performance is that the average certainly isn’t the norm. Market fluctuations of this magnitude aren’t nearly fully explained by the ([Location 1103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1103))

- changing fortunes of companies, industries or economies. They’re largely attributable to the mood swings of investors. Lastly, the times when return is at the extremes aren’t randomly distributed over the years. Rather they’re clustered, due to the fact that investors’ psychological swings tend to persist for a while—to paraphrase Herb Stein, they tend to continue until they stop. Most of those 13 extreme up or down years were within a year or two of another year of similarly extreme performance in the same direction.

In fact, I believe their unemotional nature is one of the great contributors to their success. This is one of my most persistent observations and—in a related way—one of the questions I’m most often asked is whether people can learn to be unemotional. My answer is “yes and no.” I think it’s possible for people to be on the lookout for potential emotional influences and to try to restrain their effect. But I also think people who are inherently unemotional will have it much easier.

And sometimes they view events in a positive light, and sometimes it’s negative.

- It all seems so obvious: investors rarely maintain objective, rational, neutral and stable positions. First they exhibit high levels of optimism, greed, risk tolerance and credulousness, and their resulting behavior causes asset prices to rise, potential returns to fall, and risk to increase. But then, for some reason—perhaps the arrival of a tipping point—they switch to pessimism, fear, risk aversion and skepticism, and this causes asset prices to fall, prospective returns to rise, and risk to decrease. Notably, each group of phenomena tends to happen in unison, and the swing from one to the other often goes far beyond what reason might call for.

- Since (a) investing consists of dealing with the future but (b) the future isn’t knowable, that’s where the risk in investing comes from. If future events were predictable, investing would be easy and profit would be sure. (The general level of returns might be low in that case because so little risk is involved; that’s a topic for another day.) But the fact that events aren’t predictable introduces risk. Because the events that actually occur may be different than those that were predicted, or the market’s reaction to events may differ from ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1313))

Since risk (that is, uncertainty with regard to future developments, and the possibility of bad outcomes) is the primary source of the challenge in investing, the ability to understand, assess and deal with risk is the mark of the superior investor and an essential—I’m tempted to say the essential—requirement for investment success. Finally as to foundation, it’s important to recognize that while the investment environment varies over time, at any particular point in time it is a given. What I mean is that we can accept the environment as it is and invest, or we can reject it and stay on the sidelines, but we don’t have a third option ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1316))

- This graphic has become ubiquitous in the investment world in the time since my first exposure to it fifty years ago. Its essence lies in the fact that the line slopes up and to the right, indicating a positive relationship between risk and return. This is usually misinterpreted, in my view, as meaning “riskier assets produce higher returns,” and thus “if you want to make more money, the answer is to take more risk.” This formulation cannot be correct, since if riskier assets could be counted on to produce higher returns, they by definition wouldn’t be riskier. The linearity with which the relationship between risk and return is presented in the graphic above ignores the fact that at every level of risk there ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1336))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is a range of potential outcomes regarding return, and thus it overstates the reliability of the relationship. That’s what makes people say riskier investments produce higher returns. Instead, I think the graphic should be interpreted as saying, “Investments that seem riskier have to appear to promise higher returns, or else no one will make them.” Words like “seem” and “appear” are the right ones, since they indicate that risk and potential return can only be estimated, and that the investment world doesn’t work like a machine. That makes those words highly appropriate—actually, compelling—for use when discussing investing. (For a more thorough discussion, see chapter 5 of The Most Important Thing.) People who immediately “get” concepts like risk and risk/return usually have an intuitive sense that prepares them to be good investors. I hope the reasons behind my interpretation of the graphic will become immediately clear once I have prompted you to think about it. Let’s suppose a logical investor is offered two investments with the same expected return, but in one case the return is virtually assured and in the other it is highly uncertain.

To describe risk aversion, I say most people prefer safety and disprefer risk—even though I’ve never seen the word “disprefer” in a dictionary. (There’s a big difference of opinion regarding the propriety of that word, with the linguistic establishment railing against it, but I think it’s a great word.

- to be borne are the reasons why long-term Treasurys carry higher yields than short-term Treasurys; why high yield bonds promise higher returns than investment grade bonds; why stocks are generally expected to return more than bonds; and why venture capital investing is expected to provide higher returns than public stocks. Note that I’m only talking here about “expectations” and “promises”—or what “may happen” or “should happen”—rather than things that “will happen” or “are sure to happen.” But that expectation of incremental return generally has to be present in order for most people to voluntarily take on added risk. Because of the natural dispreference for risk, it’s entirely reasonable to expect that if they’re going to bear it, investors have to be induced through the possibility of an incremental reward. Non-daredevils will do risky things only if they expect a generous reward for doing so. Nothing else makes sense. Risk aversion is an essential element in investing. People’s aversion to loss causes them to police the markets. Because most people are averse to risk: they approach investing with caution, they perform careful analysis when considering investments, and especially risky ones, they incorporate conservative assumptions and appropriate skepticism… ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1357))

- How about some quantification of this cycle? In mid-1998, just before the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management brought investors other than techies to their senses, only $12.5 billion of non-defaulted bonds yielded more than 20% (one possible threshold for the label “distressed debt”). Because investors weren’t very worried about risk, they demanded ultra-high returns from relatively few non-defaulted bonds; the word “blithe” might best describe their attitude. But Long-Term’s demise awakened investors to the existence of risk, and a year later, the amount of bonds yielding more than 20% had more than tripled to $38.7 billion. By mid-2002, when the corporate scandals held the debt market in a grip of terror, the 20% yielders had grown to $105.6 billion, eight and a half times the level just four years earlier. Risk aversion had come a long way from inadequate and, as later events showed, had become excessive. By March 31, 2004, this figure had fallen 85%, back to just $16.2 billion; risk aversion had subsided (and possibly had become inadequate again). I’m sure that fundamentals didn’t fluctuate anywhere near the degree reflected in prices, yields and thus the distressed debt tally. As usual, reality was greatly exaggerated by swings in psychology.

- attitudes toward risk has grown to be one of the longest in this book. There’s a good reason for that: I believe it covers one of the most important cycles. In The Most Important Thing, a key chapter talks about the importance of knowing where we stand in the various cycles. Understanding how investors are thinking about and dealing with risk is perhaps the most important thing to strive for. In short, excessive risk tolerance contributes to the creation of danger, and the swing to excessive risk aversion depresses markets, creating some of the greatest buying opportunities. The rational investor is diligent, skeptical and appropriately risk-averse at all times, but also on the lookout for opportunities for potential return that more than compensates for risk.

And anyway, risk is my friend—the more risk I take, the more money I’m likely to make.” Then, in bad times, they switch to something simpler: “I don’t care if I ever make another penny in the market; I just don’t want to lose any more.

- Consider this: the ups and downs of economies are usually blamed for fluctuations in corporate profits, and fluctuations in profits for the rise and fall of securities markets. However, in recessions and recoveries, economic growth usually deviates from its trendline rate by only a few percentage points. Why, then, do corporate profits increase and decrease so much more? The answer lies in things like financial leverage and operating leverage, which magnify the impact on profits of rising and falling revenues. And if profits fluctuate ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=1781))

There have been numerous recent examples where loose capital markets contributed to booms that were followed by famous collapses: real estate in 1989–92; emerging markets in 1994–98; Long-Term Capital in 1998; the movie exhibition industry in 1999–2000; venture capital funds and telecommunications companies in 2000–01.

In the movie Fields of Dreams Kevin Costner was told, “If you build it, they will come.” In the financial world, if you offer cheap money, they will borrow, buy and build—often without discipline, and with very negative consequences.

- requiring speedy deployment. The generosity of the capital markets let telecom companies sign on for huge capital projects that were only partially financed, secure in the knowledge that more financing would be available later, at higher p/e’s and lower interest rates as the projects were further along. This ease caused far more optical fiber capacity to be built than was needed at the time, a lot of which is sitting idle. Much of the investment that went into it may never be recovered. Once again, easy money has led to capital destruction. In making investments, it has become my habit to worry less about the economic future—which I’m sure I can’t know much about—than I do about the supply/demand picture relating to capital.

Rather it is to enable you to sense where we stand in the various cycles in real time, and thus to take the appropriate action. The key to dealing with the credit cycle lies in recognizing that it reaches its apex when things have been going well for a while, news has been good, risk aversion is low, and investors are eager. That makes it easy for borrowers to raise money and causes buyers and investors to compete for the opportunity to provide it. The result is cheap financing, low credit standards, weak deals, and the unwise extension of credit.

- the cards when the credit window is wide open—not lenders or investors. The implications of all of this should be obvious: proceed with caution. The exact opposite becomes true at the other extreme of the credit cycle. Its nadir is reached when developments are unpleasant, risk aversion is heightened, and investors are depressed. Under such circumstances, no one wants to provide capital, the credit market freezes up, and proposed offerings go begging. This puts the cards into the hands of providers of capital rather than the borrowers. Because borrowing is difficult and capital is generally unavailable, those who possess it and are willing to part with it can apply rigorous standards, insist on strong loan structures and protective covenants, and demand high prospective returns. It’s things like these that provide the margin of safety required for superior investing. When these boxes can be ticked, investors should swing into an aggressive mode. Superior investing doesn’t come from buying high-quality assets, but from buying when the deal is good, the price is low, the potential return is substantial, and the risk is limited. These conditions are much more the case when the credit markets are in the less-euphoric, more-stringent part of their cycle.

- Rather than companies that are doing well or have bright futures, our distressed debt investments are generally in companies that are doing so poorly that they’ve defaulted on their outstanding debt or are considered highly likely to do so: they’re either in bankruptcy or viewed as heading for it. To be clear, our typical company isn’t challenged operationally, just overloaded with debt; thus our mantra is “good company, bad balance sheet.” Normally investors buy debt securities or make loans because they expect to be paid interest periodically and have their principal repaid when the debt matures. With distressed debt, however, the consensus is that ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2109))

- these things won’t occur: instead it is expected that the debt won’t “stay current” or “be serviced.” So if interest and principal aren’t expected to be paid, what is the distressed debt investor’s motivation? The answer is that debtholders who aren’t paid as scheduled have a “creditor claim” against the debtor. In short—and to over-simplify—when a company goes through bankruptcy, the old owners are wiped out and the old creditors become the new owners. Each creditor receives his share of the value of the company—depending on the amount and seniority of the debt he holds—in some combination of cash, new debt and ownership of the company going forward.

Thus it’s appropriate to again cite John Kenneth Galbraith’s observation regarding attitudes toward history:   There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance.

- statements—usually stressing the positives, because of humans’ tendency toward greed and wishful thinking—and for some reason this seems particularly true in real estate. Over the course of my career I’ve heard investment in real estate rationalized by easily digested statements like “they’re not making any more” (in connection with land), “you can always live in it” (in connection with houses), and “it’s a hedge against inflation” (in connection with properties of all types). What people eventually learn is that regardless of the merit behind these statements, they won’t protect an investment that was made at too high a price. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, as I mentioned earlier, a number of elected officials decided that as a step toward benefitting society and increasing access to the American dream, it would be swell if more people owned homes. As a result, government-sponsored mortgage lenders got the message that home financing should be made more easily available, and they complied. The combination of this message, the resulting increase in… ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2313))

The combination of strong economic growth, generally moderate economic fluctuations, and prudent mortgage lending practices had prevented the occurrence of such a wave in the period since the Great Depression . . . long enough for the last such episode to be forgotten, as Galbraith says. But that didn’t mean lenders were incapable of lapsing into lending practices so generous and imprudent that a powerful recession could bring on such a wave of defaults. In the early years of the 21st century, the combination of strong demand for homes and plentiful mortgage money—abetted by optimistic media coverage—caused home prices to rise strongly. Thus we started to hear yet another sweeping generalization concerning real estate: “home prices always go up” (see the section that follows). I hope by now you’ve caught on to the fact that the merits of the asset in question matter only so much, and certainly they can’t be strong enough to always carry the day.

Prices are affected primarily by developments in two areas: fundamentals and psychology.

- be reduced to earnings, cash flow, and the outlook for the two. They are affected by many things, including trends in the economy, profitability and the availability of capital. And psychology—how investors feel about fundamentals and value them—is likewise affected by many things, particularly investors’ level of optimism and attitude toward risk. There are cycles in the elements mentioned above, and several aspects to each cycle. The themes behind the cycles’ behavior—and the ways in which they interact and combine—have a repeating, understandable pattern, as we have discussed at length. They all come together—and they combine with idiosyncratic and random influences—to cause the behavior of the securities market. It’s my goal in this chapter to give you a feel for the cyclical ups and downs of the market. Not for the fact that it rises and falls, or how it has done so in the past, or what these movements were in reaction to.

They conclude that joining the herd will stop the pain, so they surrender. Eventually they buy the asset well into its rise or sell after it has fallen a great deal.

- what that implies for its future movements. As I wrote in The Most Important Thing, “we may never know where we’re going, but we’d better have a good idea where we are.” To do that requires an understanding of the basic nature of cycles in general: what gives rise to their movements, what causes them to progress toward peaks and troughs, and what causes them to retreat from those extremes? We’ve touched on the key elements that concern us: the tendency of basic themes to repeat and of history to rhyme, the tendency of things to rise and fall, especially those determined by human nature, the way each development in a cycle has implications for the next, the way the various cycles interact and influence each other, the role of psychology in pushing cyclical phenomena beyond rational levels, thus the tendency of cycles to go to extremes, their tendency to move from extremes back toward a midpoint, and the regularity with which that movement continues past the midpoint, toward the opposite extreme. These are the generalities that affect cycles of all kinds. In addition, we have to bear in mind the specific elements that influence the market cycle: the economic and profit cycles that shape the investment environment, the tendency of psychology to overreact to developments in the environment, the way risk is considered non-existent and benign at some times, and then enormous, inescapable and lethal at others, and the way market prices reflect only positives and overstate them at one point, and… ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2660))

- asset prices to bargain valuations. These things can be observed and quantified. In addition, our understanding of cycle positioning can be greatly aided by an awareness of how investors are behaving. To respond to market cycles and understand their message, one realization is more important than all others: the risk in investing doesn’t come primarily from the economy, the companies, the securities, the stock certificates or the exchange buildings. It comes from the behavior of the market participants. So do most of the opportunities for exceptional returns. When investors act in a prudent manner, reflect risk aversion, apply skepticism and restrain their positive emotions, security prices tend to be reasonable relative to underlying value, making the market a safe and sane place. On the other hand, when investors become euphoric, their overenthusiastic buying lifts prices to dangerous levels. And when they’re despondent, their panicked selling takes prices to bargain lows. Warren Buffett tells us, “The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.” When others are euphoric, we should be terrified.

And what you pay—the security’s price and its relationship to intrinsic value—is determined by investor psychology and the resulting behavior. The key to being able to behave in a way that’s appropriate given the market climate lies significantly in assessing psychology and the behavior of others. You have to know whether the market is red-hot and thus overpriced, or frigid and thus a bargain. ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2705))

- As I said in introducing the guide, “for each pair, check off the one you think is most descriptive of the current market. And if you find that most of your checkmarks are in the left-hand column, hold on to your wallet.” These sorts of markers can tell us where we stand in the cycle and what that’s likely to imply for the future. Thus they help in what I call “taking the temperature of the market.” Here’s how I described the process in The Most Important Thing:   If we are alert and perceptive, we can gauge the behavior of those around us and from that judge what we should do. The essential ingredient here is inference, one of my favorite words. Everyone sees what happens each day, as reported in the media. But how many people make an effort to understand what those everyday events say about the psyches of market participants, the investment climate, and thus what should be done in response? Simply put, we must strive to understand the implications of what’s going on around us. When others are recklessly confident and buying aggressively, we should be highly cautious; when others are frightened into inaction or panicked selling, we should become aggressive. So look around, and ask yourself: Are investors optimistic or pessimistic? Do the media talking heads say the markets should be piled into or avoided? Are novel investment schemes readily accepted or dismissed out of hand? Are securities offerings and fund openings being treated as opportunities to get rich or possible pitfalls? Has the credit cycle rendered capital readily available or impossible to obtain? Are price/earnings ratios high or low in the context of history, and are yield spreads tight or generous? All of these factors are important, and yet none of them entails forecasting. We can make excellent investment decisions on the basis of present observations, with no need to make guesses about the future.

And no one need try. At any rate, different events occur in each cycle, and in a different sequence, and with different results. My point here is that not all the details are important. Rather, the key is to (a) figure out which are the important ones, (b) make inferences about what’s going on from the important ones (and then perhaps consider as many of the less-important ones as we can), and (c) conclude from those inferences what are the one or two things that most characterize the investment environment and what action they call for.

- awareness of what’s going on around us, and in particular of investor behavior. Importantly, it’s possible to be disciplined even in observing these largely non-quantitative phenomena. The key questions can be boiled down to two: how are things priced, and how are investors around us behaving? Assessing these two elements—consistently and in a disciplined manner—can be very helpful. The answers will give us a sense for where we stand in the cycle. In closing on this subject, I want to repeat something I’ve been harping on: even the best of temperature-taking can’t tell us will happen next . . . just the tendencies. Since market cycles vary from one to the next in terms of the amplitude, pace and duration of their fluctuations, they’re not regular enough to enable us to be sure what’ll happen next on the basis of what has gone before. Thus, from a given point in the cycle, the market is capable of moving in any direction: up, flat or down. ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2799))

All other things being equal, when the market is high in its cycle, a downward correction is more likely than continued gains, and vice versa. It doesn’t have to work out that way, of course, but that’s the safer bet. Assessing our cycle position doesn’t tell us what will happen next, just what’s more and less likely. But that’s a lot.

- This last point is particularly important. Every bubble starts with a grain of truth, as I noted earlier. But the import and profit potential of that truth are overestimated in bubbles; disbelief is suspended; and it is widely accepted that the gains can roll on forever.

- The bottom line is that in an extreme bubble like this one, the rational investor doesn’t have to make fine distinctions. All you have to be able to do is identify nutty behavior when you see it. To me—as an observer viewing it in detached fashion from the sidelines, rather than someone with skin in the tech-investing game—the events of the tech/Internet craze had the appearance of a Hans Christian Andersen tale. Those who participated in it so wanted it to roll on that no one would step forward ([Location 2870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2870))

- Contributing to . . . euphoria are two further factors little noted in our time or in past times. The first is the extreme brevity of the financial memory. In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten. In further consequence, when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again, sometimes in only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and larger economic world.

- missed)—is one of investors’ greatest recurring failings. It exemplifies “what every man wishes,” as Demosthenes said, but it makes no sense. If there were a silver bullet: Why would the purveyor offer it to you rather than buying it up himself? And wouldn’t everyone else buy it and drive up its price to the point where it’s no longer a sure thing? I’ve seen dozens of silver bullets touted over the course of my 48-year career. Not one has proved out. No investment strategy or tactic will ever deliver a high return without risk, especially to buyers lacking a high level of investing skill. Outstanding investment results can only come from exceptional skill (or perhaps in isolated moments from good luck). As I said earlier, bubbles generally spring from a grain of truth. But they’re all taken too far, and their eventual puncturing brings the greatest pain in the investment world. Belief in a silver bullet underlies many bubbles. The fact that investors are willing to swallow a promise of return without risk is an infallible indicator that skepticism is in ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=2941))

- The sub-prime mortgage bubble demonstrated an extremely important principle in action that I haven’t touched upon before now. The financial and investment environment—and the performance of investment techniques and instruments—is not immutable. Rather, as I’ve said many times with regard to cycles, these things are affected by the involvement of people. There is no such thing as a market that is separate from—and unaffected by—the people who make it up. The behavior of the people in the market changes the market. When their attitudes and behavior change, the market will change. In the case at hand: market forces changed the participants’ motivations, as just described, these changed motivations changed their behavior, and their changed behavior clearly determined the results.

- These were our observations, and it was the last that most called our attention to the negative trends that were afoot. It felt like there wasn’t a day on which either Bruce Karsh or I didn’t visit each other’s office to complain about a newly issued security, saying, “It shouldn’t be possible to issue a piece of junk like this. The fact that it is means there’s something wrong with the market.” Those risky deals told us fear, skepticism and risk aversion were insufficient, and greed, gullibility and risk tolerance were in the ascendency. The implications of this combination are never good. All the points noted here were obvious and not subject to debate. All that mattered is whether you made these observations and drew the appropriate conclusions. You didn’t have to fully understand what was wrong with sub-prime mortgages or deconstruct mortgage backed securities and highly structured collateralized debt obligations. We certainly didn’t.

- The key—as usual—was to become skeptical of what “everyone” was saying and doing. One might have said, “Sure, the negative story may turn out to be true, but certainly it’s priced into the market. So there’s little to be gained from betting on it. On the other hand, if it turns out not to be true, the appreciation from today’s depressed levels will be enormous. I buy!” The negative story may have looked compelling, but it’s the positive story—which few believed—that held, and still holds, the greater potential for profit.

- Shortly after Lehman’s bankruptcy filing on September 15, 2008, Bruce Karsh and I reached the conclusion that (a) no one could know how far the financial institution meltdown would go, but (b) negativity was certainly rampant and very possibly excessive, and assets looked terribly cheap. Thinking strategically, we decided that if the financial world ended—which no one could rule out—it wouldn’t matter whether we’d bought or not. But if the world didn’t end and we hadn’t bought, we would have failed to do our job. ([Location 3057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=3057))

- While we’re reviewing the climate in late 2008, this is an appropriate time for a discussion of investor behavior on the way to, and at, market bottoms. ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=3065))

- First, what is a bottom? It’s the point when the lowest prices of the cycle are reached. Thus a bottom can be viewed as the day the last panicked holder sells, or the last day on which sellers predominate relative to buyers. For whatever reason, it’s the last day prices go down, and thus the day they reach their nadir. (Of course these definitions are highly exaggerated. The expression “a bottom”—like “a top”—describes a period of time, not ([Location 3067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=3067))

- a day. Thus the phrase “the last day” is mostly a figure of speech.) From the bottom, prices rise, since there are no holders left to capitulate and sell, or because the buyers now want to buy more strongly than the sellers want to sell. The question I want to touch on here is, “When should one begin to buy?” I made reference in earlier chapters to “falling knives,” which constitute a very important concept. When a market is cascading downward, investors can often be heard to say, “We’re not going to try to catch a falling knife.” In other words, “The trend is downward and there’s no way to know when it’ll stop, so why should we buy before we’re sure the bottom has been reached?” What I think they’re really saying is, “We’re scared—in particular of buying before the decline has stopped, and thus of looking bad—so we’re going to wait until the bottom has been reached, the dust has settled, and the uncertainty has been resolved.” But hopefully by now I’ve made it abundantly clear that when the dust has settled and investors’ nerves have steadied, the bargains will be gone. At Oaktree, we strongly reject the idea of waiting for the bottom to start buying. ([Location 3070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=3070))

- First, there’s absolutely no way to know when the bottom has been reached. There’s no neon sign that lights up. The bottom can be recognized only after it has been passed, since it is defined as the day before the recovery begins. By definition, this can be identified only after the fact. And second, it’s usually during market slides that you can buy the largest quantities of the thing you want, from sellers who are throwing in the towel and while the non-knife-catchers are hugging the sidelines. But once the slide has culminated in a bottom, by definition there are few sellers left to sell, and during the ensuing rally it’s buyers who predominate. Thus the selling dries up and would-be buyers face growing competition. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078977BRM&location=3079))

- Like so many other things in the investment world that might be tried on the basis of certitude and precision, waiting for the bottom to start buying is a great example of folly. So if targeting the bottom is wrong, when should you buy? The answer’s simple: when price is below intrinsic value. What if the price continues downward? Buy more, as now it’s probably an even greater bargain. All you need for ultimate success in this regard is (a) an estimate of intrinsic value, (b) the emotional fortitude to persevere, and (c) eventually to have your estimate of value proved correct.
