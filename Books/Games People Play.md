## Highlights
- Unfortunately, success turned transactional analysis into a pop-psychology circus. What often got lost in the uproar were the facts that transactional analysis is a serious cognitive-behavioral approach to treatment and that it also has very effective ways of dealing with internal models of self and others as well as other psychodynamic issues.

- Drawing on insightful observations and intuitive hunches which he presented in practical generalizations and useful didactic diagrams, Berne presented his ideas in terms of the science of his time. Now, however, we can understand them in terms of the sciences of our time. To give a few examples: ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=66))

- Berne described ego states as coherent ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving that occur together. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=72))

- Berne labeled networks that develop early in life as Child ego states. When we activate one of these, we act like the child we once were. Networks which represent the internalization of the people who raised us, as we experienced them, Berne named Parent. When in Parent we think, feel, and act like one of our parents or like someone who took their place. Ego states which deal with the here and now in a nonemotional way are called Adult. When in Adult, we appraise reality objectively and make fact-based decisions, while making sure that Child or Parent emotions or ideas do not contaminate the process. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=74))

- It should be noted that ego states are real and observable, not hypothetical like the ego, id, and superego of psychoanalysis. It should also be noted that we all have three ego states and that we energize different ones depending on what is appropriate to the time and circumstances. That is, the Adult, which is an ego state or a group of ego states, is not the same thing as a grown-up adult human being.

- Each transaction has two parts: a stimulus and a response. Individual transactions are also usually part of a sequence. ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=82))

- As will be discussed later, games are very specific ways of relating to and interacting with others. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=85))

- In Games People Play, Berne describes a game as a patterned and predictable series of transactions which are superficially plausible but actually conceal motivations and lead to a well-defined predictable outcome. They are habitual, dysfunctional methods of obtaining strokes, and the people involved are not fully aware of the two levels of transactions in which they are engaged. Berne absolutely did not mean that a person is consciously manipulating or deliberately confusing others, as implied in today’s common colloquial saying, “He’s playing mind games” or the marital war games of Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=86))

- The “con” is the first move/invitation made by the initiator, Person A. The “gimmick” is the weakness in Person B which leads him or her to respond to the con. The X represents a switch in ego states by Person A. P is his or her payoff, a surprise feeling. To make this more clear, let us look at the example of Johnny, the child who lied: ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=94))

- For example, in the game of NIGYSOB, one person energizes Parent and Adult ego states, while the other energizes Child. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=122))

- The person who initiates a game does so with a discount. These come in one of four varieties: (1) a discount that there is a problem, (2) a discount of the significance of the problem, (3) a discount that the problem is solvable by the person and (4) a discount that the problem is solvable by anyone.

- Current video recordings of infants and toddlers and their mothers demonstrate, I believe, that some games are played out even in the first year of life. These are presumably recorded in patterned behaviors in implicit memory long before the child has words. As Berne noted, we actively teach our children to play specific games. Indeed, the sequence described ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=140))

- In 1977, Fanita English noted that games arise when people cannot get a living person to stroke them in the style to which they were accustomed in early childhood for expressing feelings that covered forbidden ones (“racketeering”). In response, they switch ego states. She concluded that there are really only three major patterns: NIGYSOB, in which a person switches from helpless or defiant Child to Parent, Kick Me, in which a person switches from bossy or helpful Parent to Child, and Uproar, where both partners switch ego states simultaneously and march off. English also described how people sometimes play games which confirm two different existential positions. For example, a person such as Johnny’s mother might play NIGYSOB, which reinforces the position “I’m okay, you are not” and then, under stress, switch to Kick Me which reinforces the existential position, “I’m not okay, you are.” Today, we could consider this an example of a person’s reinforcing two different sets of basic… ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=143))

- Recently, Charlotte Sills has pointed out that when people repeatedly play the same game in a group they may be expressing a basic human dilemma which the group has not been addressing.

- Transactional game analysis should be clearly distinguished from its growing sister science of mathematical game analysis, although a few of the terms used in the text, such as “payoff,” are now respectably mathematical. For a detailed review of the mathematical theory of games see Games & Decisions, by R. D. Luce and H. Raiffa. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=205))

- The solitary individual can structure time in two ways: activity and fantasy. An individual can remain solitary even in the presence of others, as every schoolteacher knows. When one is a member of a social aggregation of two or more people, there are several options for structuring time. In order of complexity, these are: (1) Rituals (2) Pastimes (3) Games (4) Intimacy and (5) Activity, which may form a matrix for any of the others.

- The most gratifying forms of social contact, whether or not they are embedded in a matrix of activity, are games and intimacy. Prolonged intimacy is rare, and even then it is primarily a private matter; significant social intercourse most commonly takes the form of games, and that is the subject which principally concerns us here. For further information about time-structuring, the author’s book on group dynamics should be consulted. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=310))

- OBSERVATION of spontaneous social activity, most productively carried out in certain kinds of psychotherapy groups, reveals that from time to time people show noticeable changes in posture, viewpoint, voice, vocabulary, and other aspects of behavior. These behavioral changes are often accompanied by shifts in feeling. In a given individual, a certain set of behavior patterns corresponds to one state of mind, while another set is related to a different psychic attitude, often inconsistent with the first. These changes and differences give rise to the idea of ego states. In technical language, an ego state may be described phenomenologically as a coherent system of feelings, and operationally as a set of coherent behavior patterns. In more practical terms, it is a system of feelings accompanied by a related set of behavior patterns. Each individual seems to have available a limited repertoire of such ego states, which are not roles but psychological realities. This repertoire can be sorted into the following categories: (1) ego states which resemble those of parental figures (2) ego states which are autonomously directed toward objective appraisal of reality and (3) those which represent archaic relics, still-active ego states which were fixated in early childhood. Technically these are called, ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=330))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- respectively, exteropsychic, neopsychic, and archaeopsychic ego states. Colloquially their exhibitions are called Parent, Adult and Child, and these simple terms serve for all but the most formal discussions. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=339))

- The implications are: That every individual has had parents (or substitute parents) and that he carries within him a set of ego states that reproduce the ego states of those parents (as he perceived them), and that ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=347))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- these parental ego states can be activated under certain circumstances (exteropsychic functioning). Colloquially: “Everyone carries his parents around inside of him.” That every individual (including children, the mentally retarded and schizophrenics) is capable of objective data processing if the appropriate ego state can be activated (neopsychic functioning). Colloquially: “Everyone has an Adult.” That every individual was once younger than he is now, and that he carries within him fixated relics from earlier years which will be activated under certain circumstances (archaeopsychic functioning). Colloquially: “Everyone carries a little boy or girl around inside of him.” ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=349))

- Both these transactions are complementary; that is, the response is appropriate and expected and follows the natural order of healthy human relationships. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=410))

- The first, which is classified as Complementary Transaction Type I, is represented in Figure 2A. The second, Complementary Transaction Type II, is shown in Figure 2B. It is evident, however, that transactions tend to proceed in chains, so that each response is in turn a stimulus. The first rule of communication is that communication will proceed smoothly as long as transactions are complementary; and its corollary is that as long as transactions are complementary, communication can, in principle, proceed indefinitely. These rules are independent of the nature and content of the transactions; they are based entirely on the direction of the vectors involved. As long as the transactions are complementary, it is irrelevant to the rule whether two people are engaging in critical gossip (Parent-Parent), solving a problem (Adult-Adult), or playing together (Child-Child or Parent-Child). ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=411))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The converse rule is that communication is broken off when a crossed transaction occurs. The most common crossed transaction, and the one which causes and always has caused most of the social difficulties in the world, whether in marriage, love, friendship, or work, is represented in Figure 3A as Crossed Transaction Type I. This type of transaction is the principal concern of psychotherapists and is typified by the classical transference reaction of psychoanalysis. The stimulus is Adult-Adult: e.g., “Maybe we should find out why you’ve been drinking more lately,” or, “Do you know where my cuff links are?” The appropriate Adult-Adult response in each case would be: “Maybe we should. I’d certainly like to know!” or, “On the desk.” If the respondent flares up, however, the responses will be something like “You’re always criticizing me, just like my father did,” or, “You always blame me for everything.” These are both Child-Parent responses, and as the transactional diagram shows, the vectors cross. In such cases the Adult problems about drinking or cuff links must be suspended until the vectors can be realigned. This may take anywhere from several months in the drinking example to a few seconds in the case of the cuff links. Either the agent must become Parental as a complement to the respondent’s suddenly activated Child, or the respondent’s Adult must be reactivated as a complement to the agent’s Adult. If the maid rebels during a discussion of dishwashing, the Adult-Adult conversation about dishes is finished; there can only ensue either a Child-Parent discourse, or a discussion of a different Adult subject, namely her continued employment. The converse of Crossed Transaction Type I… ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=419))

- Simple complementary transactions most commonly occur in superficial working and social relationships, and these are easily disturbed by simple crossed transactions. In fact a superficial relationship may be defined as one which is confined to simple complementary transactions. Such relationships occur in activities, rituals and pastimes. More complex are ulterior transactions —those involving the activity of more than two ego states simultaneously—and this category is the basis for games. Salesmen are particularly adept at angular transactions, those involving three ego states. A crude but dramatic example of a sales game is illustrated in the following exchange: ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=444))

- Transactions may be classified, then, as complementary or crossed, simple or ulterior, and ulterior transactions may be subdivided into angular and duplex types. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=462))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A GAME is an ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions progressing to a well-defined, predictable outcome. Descriptively it is a recurring set of transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with a concealed motivation; or, more colloquially, a series of moves with a snare, or “gimmick.” Games are clearly differentiated from procedures, rituals, and pastimes by two chief characteristics: (1) their ulterior quality and (2) the payoff. Procedures may be successful, rituals effective, and pastimes profitable, but all of them are by definition candid; they may involve contest, but not conflict, and the ending may be sensational, but it is not dramatic. Every game, on the other hand, is basically dishonest, and the outcome has a dramatic, as distinct from merely exciting, quality. It remains to distinguish games from the one remaining type of social action which so far has not been discussed. An operation is a simple transaction or set of transactions undertaken for a specific, stated purpose. If someone frankly asks for reassurance and gets it, that is an operation. If someone asks for reassurance, and after it is given turns it in some way to the disadvantage of the giver, that is a game. Superficially, then, a game looks like a set of operations, but after the payoff it becomes apparent that these “operations” were really maneuvers; not honest requests but moves in the game. In the “insurance game,” for example, no matter what the agent appears to be doing in conversation, if he is a hard player he is really looking for or working on a prospect. What he is after, if he is worth his salt, is to “make a killing.” The same applies to “the real estate game,” “the pajama game” and similar occupations. Hence at a social gathering, while a salesman is engaged in pastimes, particularly variants of “Balance Sheet,” his congenial participation may conceal a series of skillful maneuvers designed to elicit the kind of information he is professionally interested in. There are dozens of trade journals devoted to improving commercial maneuvers, and which give accounts of outstanding players and games (interesting operators who make unusually big deals). Transactionally speaking, these are merely variants of Sports Illustrated, Chess World, and other sports magazines. As far as angular transactions are concerned—games which are consciously planned with professional precision under Adult control to yield the maximum gains—the big “con games” which flourished in the early 1900’s are hard to surpass for detailed practical planning and psychological virtuosity.1 ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=619))

- What we are concerned with here, however, are the unconscious games played by innocent people engaged in duplex transactions of which they are not fully aware, and which form the most important aspect of social life all over the world. Because of their dynamic qualities, games are easy to distinguish from mere static attitudes, which arise from taking a position. The use of the word “game” should not be misleading. As explained in the introduction, it does not necessarily imply fun or even enjoyment. Many salesmen do not consider their work fun, as Arthur Miller made clear in his play, The Death of a Salesman. And there may be no lack of seriousness. Football games nowadays are taken very seriously, but no more so than such transactional games as “Alcoholic” or “Third-Degree Rapo.” The same applies to the word “play,” as anyone who has “played” hard poker or “played” the stock market over a long period can testify. The possible seriousness of games and play, and the possibly serious results, are well known to anthropologists. The most complex game that ever existed, that of “Courtier” as described so well by Stendhal in The Charterhouse of Parma, was deadly serious. The grimmest of all, of course, is “War.” ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=638))

- Since we are here concerned with the personal histories and psychodynamics of the individuals involved, the present approach is one aspect of social psychiatry; some implicit or explicit judgment is passed on the “healthiness” of the games studied. This is somewhat different from the more neutral and less committed attitudes of sociology and social psychology. Psychiatry reserves the right to say, “Just a moment!” which the other disciplines do not. Transactional analysis is a branch of social psychiatry, and game analysis is a special aspect of transactional analysis.

- Thesis. This is a general description of the game, including the immediate sequence of events (the social level) and information about their psychological background, evolution and significance (the psychological level). In the case of “If It Weren’t For You” Marital Type, the details already given will serve. For the sake of brevity, this game will henceforth be referred to as IWFY. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=686))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The antithesis to IWFY is permissiveness. As long as the husband is prohibitive, the game can proceed. If instead of saying “Don’t you dare!” he says “Go ahead!” the underlying phobias are unmasked, and the wife can no longer turn on him, as demonstrated in Mrs. White’s case. For clear understanding of a game, the antithesis should be known and its effectiveness demonstrated in practice.

- IWFY is a two-handed game and calls for a restricted wife and a domineering husband. The wife may play her role either as a prudent Adult (“It’s best ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=705))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that I do as he says”) or as a petulant Child. The domineering husband may preserve an Adult ego state (“It’s best that you do as I say”) or slip into a Parental one (“You’d better do what I say”). ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=706))

- Beyond their social function in structuring time satisfactorily, some games are urgently necessary for the maintenance of health in certain individuals. These people’s psychic stability is so precarious, and their positions are so tenuously maintained, that to deprive them of their games may plunge them into irreversible despair and even psychosis. Such people will fight very hard against any antithetical moves. This is often observed in marital situations when the psychiatric improvement of one spouse (i.e., the abandonment of destructive games) leads to rapid deterioration in the other spouse, to whom the games were of paramount importance in maintaining equilibrium. Hence it is necessary to exercise prudence in game analysis. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=808))

- Number of players: two-handed games (Frigid Woman), three-handed games (Let’s You and Him Fight), five-handed games (Alcoholic) and many-handed games (Why Don’t You—Yes But). Currency used: words (Psychiatry), money (Debtor), parts of the body (Polysurgery). Clinical types: hysterical (Rapo), obsessive-compulsive (Schlemiel), paranoid (Why Does This Have to Happen to Me), depressive (There I Go Again). Zonal: oral (Alcoholic), anal (Schlemiel), phallic (Let’s You and Him Fight). Psychodynamic: counterphobic (If It Weren’t for You), projective (PTA), introjective (Psychiatry). Instinctual: masochistic (If It Weren’t for You), sadistic (Schlemiel), fetishistic (Frigid Man). In addition to the number of players, three other quantitative variables are often useful to consider: Flexibility. Some games, such as Debtor and Polysurgery, can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible.

Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=835))

- Kick Me Thesis. This is played by men whose social manner is equivalent to wearing a sign that reads “Please Don’t Kick Me.” The temptation is almost irresistible, and when the natural result follows, White cries piteously, “But the sign says ‘don’t kick me.’” Then he adds incredulously, “Why does this always happen to me?” (WAHM.) Clinically, the WAHM may be introjected and disguised in the “Psychiatry” cliché: “Whenever I’m under stress, I get all shook up.” One game element in WAHM comes from inverse pride: “My misfortunes are better than yours.” This factor is often found in paranoids.

- If the people in his environment are restrained from striking at him by kindheartedness, “I’m Only Trying to Help You,” social convention or organizational rules, his behavior becomes more and more provocative until he transgresses the limits and forces them to oblige. These are men who are cast out, the jilted and the job losers. The corresponding game among women is “Threadbare.” Often genteel, they take pains to be shabby. They see to it that their earnings, for “good” reasons, never rise much above the subsistence level. If they have a windfall, there are always enterprising young men who will help them get rid of it, giving them in return shares in a worthless business promotion or something equivalent. Colloquially, such a woman is called “Mother’s Friend,” always ready to give judicious Parental advice and living vicariously on the experience of others. Their WAHM is a silent one, and only their demeanor of brave struggle suggests “Why does this always happen to me?” An interesting form of WAHM occurs in well-adapted people who reap increasing rewards and successes, often beyond their own expectations. Here the WAHM may lead to serious and constructive thinking, and to personal growth in the best sense, if it takes the form “What did I really do to deserve this?” 4: Now I’ve Got You, You Son of a Bitch ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1065))

- Thesis. This can be seen in classic form in poker games. White gets an unbeatable hand, such as four aces. At this point, if he is a NIGYSOB player, he is more interested in the fact that Black is completely at his mercy than he is in good poker or making money. White needed some plumbing fixtures installed, and he reviewed the costs very carefully with the plumber before giving him a go-ahead. The price was set, and it was agreed that there would be no extras. When the plumber submitted his bill, he included a few dollars extra for an unexpected valve that had to be installed—about four dollars on a four-hundred-dollar job. White became infuriated, called the plumber on the phone and demanded an explanation. The plumber would not back down. White wrote him a long letter criticizing his integrity and ethics and refused to pay the bill until the extra charge was withdrawn. The plumber finally gave in. It soon became obvious that both White and the plumber were playing games. In the course of their negotiations, they had recognized each other’s potentials. The plumber made his provocative move when he submitted his bill. Since… ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1075))

- took the opportunity to make extensive criticisms of the plumber’s whole way of living. On the surface their argument was Adult to Adult, a legitimate business dispute over a stated sum of money. At the psychological level it was Parent to Adult: White was exploiting his trivial but socially defensible objection (position) to vent the pent-up furies of many years on his cozening opponent, just as his mother might have done in a similar situation. He quickly recognized his underlying attitude (NIGYSOB) and realized how secretly delighted he had been at the plumber’s provocation. He then recalled that ever since early childhood he had looked for similar injustices, received them with delight and exploited them with the same vigor. In many of the cases he recounted, he had forgotten the actual provocation, but remembered in great detail the course of the ensuing battle. The plumber, apparently, was playing some variation of “Why Does This Always Happen to Me?” (WAHM). NIGYSOB is a two-handed game which must be distinguished from “Ain’t It Awful?” (AIA). In AIA the agent seeks injustices in order to complain about them to a third party, making a three-handed game: Aggressor, Victim, Confidant. AIA is played under the slogan “Misery Loves Company.” The confidant is usually someone who also plays AIA. WAHM is three-handed, too, but here the agent is trying to establish his pre-eminence in misfortune and resents competition from other unfortunates. NIGYSOB is commercialized in a three-handed professional form as the “badger game.” It may also be played as a two-handed marital game in more or less subtle forms. Antithesis. The best antithesis is correct behavior. The contractual structure of a relationship with a NIGYSOB player should be explicitly stated in detail at the first opportunity, and the rules strictly adhered to. In clinical practice, for example, the question of payment for missed appointments or cancellations must be settled clearly at once, and extra precautions must be taken to avoid mistakes in bookkeeping. If an unforeseen contretemps arises, the… ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1085))

- Examples: (1) I caught you this time. (2) Jealous husband. Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. Adult: “See, you have done wrong.” Adult: “Now that you draw it to my attention, I guess I have.” Psychological Paradigm: Parent-Child. Parent: “I’ve been watching you, hoping you’d make a slip.” Child: “You caught me this time.” Parent: “Yes, and I’m going to let you feel the full force of my fury.” Moves: (1) Provocation—Accusation. (2) Defense—Accusation. (3) Defense—Punishment. Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—justification for rage. (2) External Psychological—avoids confrontation of own deficiencies. (3) Internal Social—NIGYSOB. (4) External Social—they’re always out to get you. (5) Biological—belligerent exchanges, usually… ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1105))

- be played between parents and children and in working life. (1) First-Degree SWYMD: White, feeling unsociable, becomes engrossed in some activity which tends to insulate him against people. Perhaps all he wants at the moment is to be left alone. An intruder, such as his wife or one of his children, comes either for stroking or to ask him something like, “Where can I find the long-nosed pliers?” This interruption “causes” his chisel, paintbrush, typewriter or soldering iron to slip, whereupon he turns on the intruder in a rage and cries, “See what you made me do.” As this is repeated through the years, his family tends more and more to leave him alone when he is engrossed. Of course it is not the intruder but his own irritation which “causes” the slip, and he is only too happy when it occurs, since it gives him a lever for ejecting the visitor. Unfortunately this is a game which is only too easily learned by young children, so that it is easily passed on from generation to generation. The underlying satisfactions and advantages are more clearly demonstrated when it is played more seductively. (2) Second-Degree SWYMD:… ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1114))

- of considerateness or gallantry. He may deferentially and courteously let her decide where to go for dinner or which movie to see. If things turn out well, he can enjoy them. If not, he can blame her by saying or implying: “You Got Me Into This,” a simple variation of SWYMD. Or he may throw the burden of decisions regarding the children’s upbringing on her, while he acts as executive officer; if the children get upset, he can play a straight game of SWYMD. This lays the groundwork through the years for blaming mother if the children turn out badly; then SWYMD is not an end in itself, but merely offers passing satisfaction on the way to “I Told You So” or “See What You’ve Done Now.” The professional player who pays his psychological way with SWYMD will use it also in his work. In occupational SWYMD the long-suffering look of resentment replaces words. The player “democratically” or as part of “good management” asks his assistants for suggestions. In this way he may attain an unassailable position for terrorizing his juniors. Any mistake he makes can be used against them by blaming them for it. Used against seniors (blaming them for one’s mistakes), it becomes self-destructive and may lead to termination of employment or, in the army, to transfer to another unit. In that case it is a component of “Why Does This Always Happen To Me?” with resentful people, or of “There I Go Again” with depressives—(both of the “Kick Me” family). (3) Third-Degree SWYMD: in a hard form SWYMD may be played by paranoids against people incautious enough to give them advice (see “I’m Only Trying to Help You”). There it may be dangerous, and in rare cases even fatal. “See What You Made Me Do” (SWYMD) and “You Got Me Into This” (UGMIT) complement each other nicely, so that the SWYMD-UGMIT combination is a classical basis for the covert game contract in many marriages. This contract is illustrated by the following sequence. By mutual agreement Mrs. White did the family bookkeeping and paid the bills out of the joint checking account because Mr. White was “poor at figures.” Every few months they would be notified of an overdraft, and Mr. White would have to square it with the bank.… ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1124))

- his fault. Since he had forbidden her to overdraw their account, the only way she could make ends meet was by leaving this large obligation unpaid and hiding the duns from him. These games had been allowed to go on for ten years, on the basis that each occurrence would be the last, and that from then on it would be different—which it was, for a few months. In therapy Mr. White very cleverly analyzed this game without any assistance from the therapist, and also devised an effective remedy. By mutual agreement he and Mrs. White put all charge accounts and their bank account in his name. Mrs. White continued to do the bookkeeping and make out the checks, but Mr. White saw the bills first and controlled the outgoing payments. In this way neither duns nor overdrafts could get by him, and they now shared the budgetary labor. Deprived of the satisfactions and advantages of SWYMD-UGMIT, the Whites were at first at a loss, and were then driven to find more open and constructive types of gratification from each other. Antithesis. The antithesis to First-Degree SWYMD is to leave the player alone, and to Second-Degree SWYMD to throw the decision back on White. The First-Degree player may react by feeling forlorn, but seldom angry; the Second-Degree player may become sulky if he is forced to take the initiative, so that systematic anti-SWYMD leads to disagreeable consequences. The antithesis to Third-Degree SWYMD should be put into competent professional hands. PARTIAL ANALYSIS The aim of this game is vindication. Dynamically the mild form may be… ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0F775HJHJ&location=1143))
