## Highlights
- It became clear that the relationships were the horse and the anxiety that got them into therapy was the cart. I was struck by the similarities in so many clients’ stories, yet these clients were very different people with different histories. But where they didn’t vary was that all of them felt they were to blame for their situations—they doubted themselves, ruminated, felt ashamed, were psychologically isolated, confused, and helpless. Increasingly, they censored themselves in these relationships and became progressively more numb and restrained to avoid the criticism, contempt, or anger from these challenging people in their lives. They were trying to change themselves with the hope that this would change this person and relationship. There was another significant similarity: the behaviors that were happening in their relationships. Regardless of whether it was a spouse, partner, parent, other family member, adult child, friend, colleague, boss—my clients consistently shared stories of being invalidated or shamed for having a need or for expressing or being themselves. Their experiences, perceptions, and reality itself were regularly challenged. They were blamed for the problematic behavior of these people in their lives. They felt lost and isolated. Yet at the same time, all of them shared that it wasn’t bad all the time. There was sometimes laughter, good sex, enjoyable experiences, dinners, shared interests and histories, even love. In fact, just when things seemed as though they were becoming untenable, there would ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=182))

- be a decent day, just enough to reseed the self-doubt. I gave my clients what had helped me in my own healing—validation and education. Focusing on their anxiety without educating them about the patterns within these relationships was like fixing engine problems by putting air in the tires. And those engine problems always seemed to track back to the same place: narcissistic relationships. There is a proverb that says Until the story of the hunt is told by the lion, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter. The person who holds the narrative holds the power. Until now, we have only told the story of the hunter. Books about narcissism tend to talk about narcissists. We are deeply curious about these charming people who seem to get away with so much bad and hurtful behavior with so few consequences. We are compelled to understand why they are ostensibly so successful and why they do what they do. As much as we may not like narcissism, we glorify people with these personality styles—they are our leaders, heroes, entertainers, and celebrities. Unfortunately, they are also our parents, partners, friends, siblings, children, bosses, and neighbors. But what about the lion? What about the person whom the hunter goes after or harms? Much of what’s written about narcissism tends to forget the more important part of the story: What happens to the people who are in the wake of the narcissist? How are people affected by folks with narcissistic personalities and the behaviors? When people are hurt, there is a ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=193))

- preoccupation with understanding the “why”—as if this could somehow ease their pain (it doesn’t). We become so curious about the hunter in an almost obsessive zeal to understand why they do what they do. Why would someone lack empathy or gaslight or manipulate or lie so skillfully or rage so suddenly? But in focusing on why people with narcissistic personalities do what they do, we lose sight of what happens to the people who fall in love with, have children with, are raised by, are related to, work for, work with, get… ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=205))

- if their harmful behavior is intentional or not? Can you heal without understanding narcissism? And most importantly, can you heal from these relationships? This book will explore those complex questions. There is pushback from people who ask me, “How do you know the partner/parent/boss/friend is narcissistic?” Fair question. When I am working with a client in therapy, I have typically not met the other people in their lives, but I am getting a detailed history, often reading emails and text messages that have been sent to them by the antagonistic person and witnessing the impact on my client. I use the term antagonistic relational stress to describe what happens to survivors of these relationships, and I prefer to characterize the behavior of the psychologically harmful person in my clients’ lives as antagonistic, which is a broader and less stigmatized term than narcissistic. This is the term I use when teaching other professionals about these patterns, because it captures the breadth of antagonistic behaviors and tactics that we observe in narcissism—manipulation, attention-seeking, exploitativeness, hostility, arrogance—but also in other antagonistic personality styles, such as psychopathy, and positions it as a unique stress that antagonistic relationships evoke. But the narcissistic cat is out of the bag, and the term narcissistic abuse is familiar to most of you, though I will also use the term antagonistic throughout this book to capture the full breadth of these patterns.

- The only thing you need to understand about narcissism is that in almost all cases this personality pattern was there before you came into the narcissistic person’s life and it will be there after you leave. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=265))

- I have heard from people around the world that simply receiving a framework for narcissism and what these relationships do to them marked the first time they felt normal in years. This isn’t about calling out narcissistic people but rather about identifying unhealthy relationship behavior and patterns. To be given permission to disengage. To learn that multiple things (good and bad) can be true in a relationship. To learn that understanding narcissism doesn’t mean you have to leave or end contact with people you have complicated relationships with, but instead that you can interact with them differently. To understand that it is a basic human right to be seen and to have your own and separate identity, needs, wants, and aspirations expressed and recognized. To become aware that instead of thinking differently about yourself, it’s time to start thinking differently about the behavior of someone whom you love or respect but who is also harming you. To finally be told, clearly and definitively, that you were never going to be able to change another person’s behavior. All of this was like turning the house lights on and the gaslights off.

- or vain or entitled is the consistency and sheer number of these traits in one person. Just being superficial doesn’t mean someone is narcissistic. It is also looking at the function of these traits—which is to protect the narcissistic person. Narcissism is about a deep insecurity and fragility offset by maneuvers like domination, manipulation, and gaslighting, which allow the narcissistic person to stay in control. The variable empathy and lack of self-awareness mean that they do not stop to consider the harm their behavior is creating for other people. The traits aren’t really the issue, but rather how these traits translate into consistently harmful behaviors. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=324))

- A Need for Narcissistic Supply Narcissistic people need validation and admiration, and this need motivates much of their behavior. They seek ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=334))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- out status, compliments, excessive recognition, and attention, and this may happen through ostentatious wealth, physical appearance, friends who fawn over them, or social media likes and follows. This validation from other people or the world at large, whatever form it takes, is called narcissistic supply. Their moods can turn rather dark, and they can become irritable, resentful, sullen, and aggrieved when they do not get the validation or supply they feel entitled to. Anyone around them must bring supply or face their wrath. Egocentricity Narcissistic people are egocentric, but this goes beyond mere selfishness. It is selfishness with a devaluation chaser. For example, a selfish person will choose the restaurant they want, but a narcissistic person will choose the restaurant they want and tell you they had to do that because you are too dumb about food to choose one. In short, a narcissistic person’s needs will always come first in any relationship. Consistent Inconsistency Narcissism is consistent. However, there is a consistency to it that can make it feel inconsistent. When the narcissistic person is well regulated, feels they are in control, and has sufficient narcissistic supply—for instance, ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=335))

- work is going well, they are getting compliments, they are in a fun new relationship, or they just got a new car—they may be less antagonistic and more pleasant. Unfortunately, the narcissistic supply gets stale for them quickly, so they always need more, new, better. I recall working with a narcissistic person who said one afternoon, “I am having the best day ever, I scored a big new deal, I am the man, I slay it every time, right?” That evening, he left a message saying that he was angry and that his life isn’t fair. I came to find out that this change in his emotional state was because the new person he was dating had to reschedule dinner. It can turn that quickly. Restlessness There is a restless quality to the narcissistic personality, a pursuit of novelty and excitement, which is why we may observe infidelity or frequently shifting romantic partners, overspending and shopping, or frenetic activity. Narcissistic people often seem… ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=345))

- importance in the world, fantastical beliefs about ideal love stories and their current or future success, a sense of superiority over other people and of a uniqueness and specialness about themselves not observed in others. Grandiosity also means that the person believes they are better than others. It is “delusional” because for most narcissistic people, there is little to no evidence supporting any of these beliefs, and they hold on to them despite the discomfort or harm this stance is causing to other people. Shifting Masks The confusion comes from the narcissistic person going between charming, fun, and charismatic, or at least normal and regulated, to abusive, sullen, and enraged. Their self-appraisal is high when things are going their way, and when things are not, they blame the world and shift to viewing themselves as a victim. As a result, you can’t always anticipate which version of the narcissist you will be dealing with—the… ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=356))

- that entitlement may be the core pillar of this personality style and that all other dynamics tie back to it.[1] Narcissistic people believe that they are special, must be given special treatment, can only be truly understood by other special people, and that the rules should not apply to them. If rules are applied to them or they are held accountable, narcissistic folks become quite angry and push back because those rules are for ordinary people! If they have to follow the rules, then they aren’t so special. They feel entitled to doing and saying what they want, whenever they want. Their entitlement serves as a way for them to create a reality in which they can exert their specialness, and it drives their anger when they don’t feel they are being regarded as a VIP. Most of us can probably recall a time when a narcissistic person’s entitlement left us feeling uncomfortable. One woman shared with me the mortification she would feel when her husband would raise his voice and bark at restaurant servers when he didn’t get his way. She said that she got good at keeping her head down in shame in those situations so that she never had to make eye contact with the people left in her husband’s wake. Sadly, she felt complicit in their mistreatment because she didn’t stop him, yet stopping him meant enduring his tantrums or silent treatment for days. Overcompensating for Insecurity This takes us to the bedrock of narcissism, which is insecurity. Narcissism is not about high self-esteem or low self-esteem as much as it is about inaccurate, inflated, and variable self-appraisal. The narcissistic person always harbors a lurking sense of inadequacy that is close… ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=366))

- way, and they may use it to get what they want. Once they get what they want, or they can’t be bothered, the empathy fades. Narcissistic empathy can also be performative—to look good to other people, to win someone over—and it can also be transactional, mustering it to get what they need from someone else. This can feel really galling because it shows you that they know that empathy is valued but they may only deploy it as a tactic. Narcissistic people tend to be more “empathic” when they feel safe and supplied. For example, on a day when things went well for them, they may come home and hear about a bad day you had at work and reassure you everything is going to be okay. A week later, you may think, Well, they were so supportive last week when I raised this with them, let me talk it out with them again. But this time they may not have had that same kind of validating day, so you are met with, “When are you going to stop complaining about work? I’m tired of hearing your whining.” Contempt for Others Narcissistic people need people, and they resent that they need people. Needing people means other people have power, and they cannot tolerate thinking of themselves as dependent on anyone. This can drive the contempt that is often observed in narcissism—contempt for other people and their feelings,… ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=410))

- Projection of Shame Projection is also a common pattern in narcissism. It is a defense—which means it operates unconsciously to protect the ego—and manifests as a person projecting unacceptable aspects of themselves onto another person. For example, a person who is lying accuses another person of lying, then the “projector” gets to continue to view themselves as honest after psychologically flinging their bad behavior onto someone else. Narcissistic people project the shameful parts of their personalities and behavior onto others to maintain their grandiose ideal of themselves and to shelter themselves from the discomfort of shame.

- Being Incredibly Charming If narcissistic people are entitled, rageful, manipulative, and invalidating, why don’t we see these behaviors early and get the hell away? Because narcissistic people have great game. They are charming, charismatic, confident, curious, and often very well put together and intelligent. While you may not consider arrogance to be desirable, there is often the assumption that behind that arrogance and confidence, a person has the goods to back it up. You may also be willing to excuse a lot of bad behavior if you believe someone is smart or successful. Narcissism is often conflated with success, and instead of being viewed as a toxic and unhealthy pattern, it is viewed as… ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=431))

On the milder end you have your superficial social-media narcissists, locked into a perpetual and emotionally stunted adolescence, which may be annoying but not necessarily harmful.

- Moderate narcissists have just enough insight to know that their behavior is not okay—but not enough regulation, mindfulness, or empathy to stop themselves. Because they are aware enough to know that their behavior is inappropriate, they do it out of sight of others, which can leave you with no support. As a result, they are often a devil at home and an angel in the street. They might compliment you in a meeting in front of colleagues then verbally eviscerate you behind closed doors in their office. This two-faced mask-on-mask-off behavior is a trademark of the moderate narcissist. People will see a relatively composed and charming person in public, which is a complete disconnect from what you are experiencing in private.

- Vulnerable I am every bit as smart as all these start-up types, but I didn’t have the connections or Daddy’s money to get ahead. I’m not wasting my time in college or working some BS job for an incompetent; I would rather do nothing than work for Ivy League A-holes. I blame my parents for not giving me more money and setting me up better, because then I would have totally been the best in the business. Vulnerable narcissists are the victimized, anxious, socially awkward, sullen, broodingly angry, irritable, sad, and resentful narcissists. This type is sometimes termed the covert narcissist. The covert/overt distinction actually refers to the patterns we can and cannot see: overt behaviors, like yelling or manipulating, versus covert behaviors, meaning the narcissist’s thoughts and feelings. Some people also use the term covert narcissist to refer to the narcissistic person’s ability to pass as a nice person when there are people to impress—in essence they are ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=480))

- hiding their narcissism from plain view (but behaving badly when there is no audience). In a vulnerable narcissistic person, instead of the grandiosity presenting as charismatic and pretentious prattling about their next big thing, it translates as a victimized grandiosity (“I never get a fair chance, because the world is too stupid to recognize my genius”) and a victimized entitlement (“Why should I have to work when other people have trust funds?”). People with vulnerable narcissistic styles will attribute your success to good luck and their own lack of success to life being unfair to only them. They are also chronically malcontented. Vulnerable narcissists can be oppositional and argumentative, and asking them to do anything can feel like trying to compel a teenager to fold the laundry. They also struggle with abandonment and rejection sensitivity and may burn you out through their constantly victimized anger. Vulnerable narcissists can be awkward in social situations and compensate for that anxiety and the insecurity it evokes by criticizing you or devaluing and mocking you when you are enjoying other people or experiences or you are succeeding at something. Because vulnerable narcissists don’t have the charismatic and charming exterior, most people, including therapists, will believe that they are struggling with self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or just bad luck. But even if these other issues are addressed, the sense of victimization lingers. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=489))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There is also the pervasive yet misleading idea that narcissism is a diagnosis or an illness. Many online communities and therapists believe you cannot diagnose people without proper training and evaluation (and there is truth to that). They inadvertently shame survivors of actual narcissistic and antagonistic relationships by saying that if a person has a “disorder,” it is wrong to characterize their behavior as abusive because they are not in control of it—even though we know narcissistic people can be quite tactical about how they show their different faces. This has pushed some survivors into believing that perhaps they have no right to view the patterns in the relationship as toxic or abusive, and that maybe they themselves are the issue. However, this is problematic in several ways. First, narcissism is a personality style, not a disorder. A personality style is the collection of traits that together represent a given individual’s personality, and is associated with how they would behave, cope, approach, and respond to life. Yes, there is a diagnosis called narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is characterized by all the patterns we observe in a narcissistic person. But to receive the diagnosis, the patterns must be observed by a trained clinician as being pervasive, stable, and consistent and the patterns must result in significant impairments in social and occupational functioning, or distress, for the person. We cannot diagnose a patient on the basis of what other people are experiencing, even if those other people are experiencing distress and harm. NPD is a paradoxical illness that may harm the people the narcissistic person interacts with more than it harms the narcissistic individuals themselves. People who have narcissistic personality styles won’t typically show up to therapy for evaluation, and it can take several weeks or months to definitively determine NPD. If narcissistic people do show up to therapy, it may be because they are experiencing their own negative mood states (e.g., anxiety or depression) or co-occurring issues such as substance use, are being forced to go for good optics, or their lives have taken a turn they don’t like (e.g., their relationship ends), but they don’t necessarily show up because they are experiencing guilt for hurting others (in fact, most narcissistic people are more likely to think the other person is the one with the issue, not them). I personally believe the diagnosis should be disbanded altogether, because there is little substantial evidence for accessible treatment, and because there is little reliability across clinicians in assigning this diagnosis. It is beyond the scope of this book to address the nuanced issues around this diagnosis, but this term narcissistic personality disorder has muddied the waters of the conversation on narcissism. We all have a personality; some are just easier to get along with than others. For purposes of this book, we are not concerning ourselves… ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=576))

- They Can’t Control Their Behavior Have you ever been to a party with a narcissistic person you are close to? In front of others, they were charming and charismatic, and you were surprised they didn’t react when a person tossed a playful jab at them. You may have thought, “Oh, maybe I was wrong about them, everybody really likes them, and they managed themselves well.” Then you get into the car at the end of the evening and they lay into you, just expel their rage all over you. You recognize that, in fact, they were bothered by what was said but were able to make the choice to not react so as to not look bad in front of others, just as they ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=620))

- also made the choice to let loose on you when there were no witnesses. Narcissistic people can manage their behavior. They may lose it in front of others they’re close to (e.g., family members), but generally not in front of “high-status” people or new people whose validation they desire. A woman once told me her narcissistic sister would sometimes call when she was in the car and ask in a sweet voice if she was alone, knowing she was on speaker. If she answered yes, the sister would let it rip and go off on her. That’s a choice. She didn’t like the idea that people would hear her rageful behavior, so she knew rage was not a good look. Unlike people who have personality styles that are more uniformly dysregulated and will yell at you in front of your friends, clients, and strangers alike, narcissistic people tend to be much more tactical and less disorganized. Narcissistic people know what looks good and bad, and how to choose their audience to maintain a public image while privately using those closest to them as punching bags and pacifiers.

- happens to be associated with better mental health and better emotional regulation.[5] Let’s say that you are agreeable. Do you want to change that? Do you feel you could change that? Do you think that tomorrow you could go from being empathic, humble, and ethical to entitled, manipulative, attention-seeking, and egocentric? Not likely, and you may even ask, “Why would I want to do that? It wouldn’t feel good, and it would hurt people around me.” It’s not easy to change a personality. Personality is generally viewed as stable and relatively unchanging. Some researchers believe that a significant experience like trauma could result in personality change, as can physical trauma such as a head injury or a stroke.[6] However, to even nudge personality, a person must be committed to change and believe it will yield a desirable outcome. Even then, under conditions of stress, our baseline personality will pop through. Narcissism is termed a maladaptive personality style because it often puts a person at odds with other people. However, the more maladaptive the personality, the more resistant it is to change. People with this personality have little desire to change, especially since many narcissistic people are thriving financially and professionally, and because they have little self-awareness or self-reflective capacity, they don’t take notice of other people’s experience and their contribution to it. Instead, they blame everyone else when something goes wrong and are firm in their self-righteous resolve that they are good. If a narcissistic person does not believe there is a reason to change—and in fact, they may believe it would hurt them or take away their “edge”—they will be no more likely or able to make that switch to agreeableness or to become self-aware than you would be able to switch over from agreeableness to disagreeableness. Personality change may be possible, but the changes require tremendous buy-in from the person making the change. For example, a person who really wants to be more conscientious because they think it would make them a better student may be willing to do the work to make the change, but it would still be very difficult. Everyone loves a redemption story. The myth is that all people can change, and if all people can change, so can a narcissistic person.

- People who have moderately narcissistic people in their lives may struggle with differentiating the personality style from other mental health issues. This is because narcissism can magnify or look similar to other mental health patterns. Unfortunately, the presence of narcissism makes treatment for other mental health issues that much more complicated. We most often observe overlaps and association between narcissism and the following: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),[7] addiction,[8] anxiety, depression,[9] bipolar disorder,[10] impulse control disorders,[11] and PTSD. These overlaps may be more pronounced with certain subtypes of narcissism, for example, how social anxiety is commonly observed in vulnerable narcissism.[12] The grandiosity and variable, irritable, and reactive moods we observe in narcissism can sometimes result in the narcissistic person’s patterns being attributed to bipolar disorder or to hypomania (a lower-level mania where a person is able to work and function). Bipolar… ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=660))

- often a presenting characteristic of depression, and irritability is a quality observed in many narcissistic people. While we know that narcissism and depression are associated,[14] it is not uncommon for the depression observed in vulnerable narcissism to be so pronounced that the therapist misses the narcissistic patterns, so even as the depression improves, the narcissistic patterns mean ongoing victimhood, irritability, and apathy. People who are narcissistic often have co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or evidence of problems with attention.[15] This is challenging because the ADHD can be deployed as an excuse for why the narcissistic person is impulsive or can’t pay attention when you are talking (but is able to stay on point when the conversation is about them or they are focused on something that matters to them)—and ADHD in and of itself is not associated with manipulation, entitlement, or lack of empathy. Narcissism can complicate substance-use treatment, increasing the likelihood of relapse, and the grandiosity means that a narcissistic person may think they don’t need therapy and drop out of treatment, or not get it at all.[16] Addiction may muddy the waters for you in the relationship, as… ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=675))

- colleagues have suggested that narcissism, especially the impulsivity and anger, is related to adverse childhood experiences.[17] However, a large proportion of people with narcissistic personalities have not experienced significant trauma, and most people who experience trauma do not go on to develop narcissistic personalities. That said, if you are aware that the narcissistic person in your life has a history of trauma, you may have struggled with guilt and even the belief that it isn’t fair to hold that person accountable if their behavior is posttraumatic in nature. These overlaps can get very confusing, and you may find yourself justifying their behavior (“Maybe they are just anxious . . .” but most anxious people aren’t abusive). The key to remember is that personality is consistent, a sort of backbeat that constantly plays behind the vocals. Other mental health patterns may only flare up at times or be manageable with medication and intervention.

His father’s rage, entitled behavior, unrealistic expectations that his family simply be an audience for his validation-seeking behavior, the ridicule and the contempt—all harmed not only Jordan but his mother as well. This behavior is called narcissistic abuse. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=745))

- In other words, narcissistic people make you feel small so they can feel safe. One way to understand narcissistic abuse is to consider the question, “What does the narcissistic person need?” The answer is control, domination, power, admiration, and validation. How they go about getting that is where the narcissistic abuse comes in. Just as narcissism is on a continuum, so too is narcissistic abuse. Milder narcissistic abuse may feel like being taken for granted and being chronically disappointed, while at the severe end we may witness violence, exploitation, stalking, and coercive control.[1] The majority of folks affected by narcissistic abuse are not just dealing with the distraction and annoyance of a narcissistic adult who is obsessive about social media nor are they managing violence and coercion. Rather, they’re dealing with moderate narcissistic abuse: systematic invalidation, minimization, manipulation, rage, betrayal, and gaslighting with periods of “normal” and “good” thrown into the mix. To the world your relationship may look fine, while you live in a confused and uncomfortable haze. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=763))

- Ultimately, for a narcissistic relationship to last, you must submit to their reality. When the narcissistic person implies that your desire to be acknowledged within the relationship means that you really don’t want it, you may stand down, put the evidence away, and give in to keep the relationship afloat. Another framework for more wholly understanding gaslighting comes from Dr. Jennifer Freyd, a renowned psychologist best known for her work on betrayal. She conceptualized the DARVO model to explain the response any abuser, but certainly a gaslighter, will engage in when confronted about their behavior. DARVO stands for deny (the behavior), attack (the person confronting them about the behavior), and reverse victim and offender (the gaslighter positions themselves as a victim—e.g., ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=804))

- Minimization is when the narcissistic person plays down your experience to the point where they might outright deny it. Narcissistic abuse often entails having your feelings minimized with statements such as “It’s not that big a deal” or “I don’t understand why something so small is bothering you.” It’s a minimization not only of your feelings and experience but also of your achievements, for example, trivializing a promotion you received or the difficulty of completing your degree at school. There is a hypocrisy to the minimization: when something happens to the narcissistic person, they feel entitled to it being as big an issue or feeling as they want, but they will diminish the same experience in you. Minimization may even put you in harm’s way, particularly when narcissistic people minimize your health concerns, which may result in a delay in getting support or treatment. Narcissistic people use manipulation to control or influence you to achieve a desired goal that may not be in your best interest but is in theirs. Instead of being transparent about what they want or why they need your help, they play upon your vulnerable emotions—guilt, ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=838))

- obligation, low self-worth, confusion, anxiety, or fear—to rope you into doing what works for them. Anyone who has ever been told by an adult narcissistic parent something to the effect of “Oh, I don’t mind if you don’t come to the holiday dinner, I may not be able to cook anyhow, my back is acting up, and each year I wonder if this will be the last year I can make the big meal, but I understand you have other, more important things to do” knows about manipulation. Exploitativeness refers to the process of taking unfair advantage of another person. It involves playing on existing vulnerabilities or creating vulnerabilities, such as isolating you or making you financially dependent, and taking advantage of that situation. It may also mean taking advantage of the money, people, and other resources you brought to a relationship. Narcissistic people may imply that you “owe” them something, with parents even implying you “owe” them because they fed and housed you. The exploitativeness means that there will be a psychological debt that is created if you ever accept a favor, and in the future if you feel uncomfortable with something the narcissistic person is asking of you, they will remind you of what they have done for you in the past. The narcissistic person’s rage may be the most frightening aspect of narcissistic abuse. Narcissistic people feel entitled to their volatile and reactive rage, which is often activated by shame.

The unwillingness of narcissistic people to control their impulses means they can be highly reactive, especially when they feel provoked, envious, or disempowered. Narcissistic people have high rejection sensitivity, and any experience that smacks of rejection or abandonment is met with reactive rage.[5] Narcissistic rage plays out in every possible communication platform—text messages, voicemails, emails,… ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=858))

They will use money to control you; for example, by paying your rent in order to keep you living nearby, or offering to pay a family member’s medical bills so you then feel silenced and indebted. The control extends to isolation. Narcissistic abuse often consists of the narcissistic person criticizing your family, friends, and workplace, and when you are with those people, the narcissist will behave in a manner that is insulting and rude. A narcissistic person may also tell you falsehoods about people close to you so you question their loyalty and friendship. The result is that you slowly have less contact with people you care about, or those people just no longer come around. The more isolated you become, the easier it is to control you. Revenge and vindication are another common feature of narcissistic abuse, and narcissistic people can be tenacious. Hell really hath no fury like a narcissist scorned.

- The Disagreeable Patterns Arguing, baiting, blame shifting, justifying, rationalizing, criticizing, being contemptuous, humiliating, speaking in word salad This set of patterns reflects tactics that narcissistic people will often use to achieve the same goal as all narcissistic behavior—to control the narrative. Narcissistic folks love a fight, debate, argument, or any form of conflict. Arguing gives them another way to get supply, let out some steam, air their grievances, and remain dominant. It’s like the aphorism “Never wrestle with a pig—you end up dirty, and the pig likes it.” When you try to disengage from these relationships, it’s not unusual that the narcissist pokes you and tries to provoke a fight. This is most commonly achieved by baiting.

It may be framed as mockery in front of others, and downplayed as a joke, but it may also be indirectly communicated through non-verbals such as eye-rolling.

- The harm of narcissism is less about the narcissism and more about the behavior. People with narcissistic personalities engage in invalidating behaviors and defenses such as grandiosity and entitlement that offset their insecurity and allow them to feel a sense of power and control. And these behaviors alternate with patterns such as charm and charisma and even empathy that show up when they feel secure and validated. All of this results in cycles that confuse us. This is a relationship with someone you may love, care about, admire, or want to remain connected to who is unwilling to recognize your needs, your hopes, or you as a person separate from them, and is willing to use any tactic they can to maintain control and dominance.

- To slowly realize that the person you love or believe you were supposed to love doesn’t have real empathy, doesn’t appear to care when you are hurt, and will always put themselves first is a bleak realization. Despair is experienced by almost everyone navigating narcissistic relationships, and it is a mix of sadness, helplessness, hopelessness, powerlessness, fear, and sometimes even suicidal thoughts. There is no way to fix the situation, make it better, be seen, or receive empathy. No matter what you say or do, nothing changes. Regardless of the type of narcissistic relationship, the recognition that it cannot change creates a sense of dread and unfathomable grief. If you try to exert your wants, aspirations, or needs in one of these relationships, those attempts will not be tolerated by the narcissistic person, and over time, you will no longer feel that you are a meaningful player in your own life. Narcissistic relationships are often not just about you—they may affect your children, jobs, friendships, or relationships with other family members. Your sense of powerlessness within your narcissistic relationships can extend to a sense of helplessness in your other relationships as well, and you may feel despair about not being able to protect other people. You may experience some (or many) of the patterns observed in depression, including sadness, irritability, changes in appetite, problems sleeping, feelings of worthlessness, being distracted and unable to concentrate, tearfulness, and social withdrawal.

- Ask yourself if you notice your health getting better or worse depending on your contact with a narcissistic relationship. Being in one of these relationships is stressful, and stress affects your health in a variety of ways, such as headaches, muscle tension, and diminished immune function, which can make you more vulnerable to illness. If you have preexisting chronic health conditions, like autoimmune conditions, asthma, or diabetes, stress can exacerbate your illness. It has been suggested that suppressed trauma can be experienced as physical pain,[7] and the chronic pain and other similar physical discomfort reported by long-term experiencers of narcissistic abuse are consistent with that observation. Doing the kind of research required to substantiate this narcissistic abuse–illness connection is not easy. In an ideal world we would follow groups of narcissistically abused people for many years, monitor their health, measure their relationships and stress levels, and observe what unfolds.

Anecdotally, many health practitioners are seeing the negative impacts of toxic relationships on health. Your body is a more honest scorekeeper of the toll of narcissistic abuse than your mind. Your brain and mind are engaged in the trauma-bonded justifications and rationalizations, while your body feels and holds pain, grief, trauma, and loss with less censorship. I’ve also witnessed many of these health problems begin to remit once a person distances themselves from a narcissistic relationship. I recall one woman who had numerous health issues, including headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and chronic pain, and her narcissistic partner passed away unexpectedly after a brief illness. She told me that her physical symptoms remitted within a month of his death, even though his passing and the debt he left put her in a financially precarious and stressful position. She felt guilt that she was relieved about his passing and the end of his psychological torment of her, and even felt guilty about the improvement in her health when she knew the world expected her to be a grieving widow.

- It is easy to understand this when we have a physical vulnerability: I twisted my ankle, I can’t take the stairs. I have asthma, I can’t go into a room full of dust. Similarly, to heal from the fallout of narcissistic abuse and help prevent future abuse, we must first know our whole selves, including our vulnerabilities, belief systems, and histories. Even if you come from a happy family, are content in a good job, and have plenty of friends, narcissistic relationships may still play on your belief systems. Understanding your backstory and vulnerabilities to these relationships can help you heal and protect yourself in the future. This chapter will lay out these risk factors at multiple levels: you as an individual, the experiences you had in your family of origin, the cultural messages you received, and the messages from society at large.

- You may know the story of the scorpion and the swan. The scorpion charms the swan, asks for a ride across the river, promising not to sting her, and against her better judgment the swan acquiesces and gives the scorpion the ride (the scorpion future faked the swan, and love bombed her, too!). No surprise, when they get to the other side, the scorpion stings the swan, despite their promise. Ultimately, no matter how persuasive they are, a scorpion is going to sting. It’s what they do. The scorpion and the narcissist have a similar ground game. Despite the charm, flattery, promises, and false reassurance, the narcissistic person will not change, and they will sting you. Even more important than understanding narcissism is acknowledging how the associated unhealthy behavioral patterns have played out in your relationship. There is a lot of intense analysis about why narcissistic people do what they do, but when it comes to healing, it really doesn’t matter. It’s less about the “Why did they do that?” and more about the “They did that, it’s not good for me, and they are going to do it again.” Radical acceptance is acknowledging this consistency and unchangeability to help you move forward. Understanding acceptance means understanding both what acceptance is and what it is not. Acceptance doesn’t mean you are signing off on what happened in your narcissistic relationship, and it is not submission or capitulation. Acceptance doesn’t mean you are a doormat. Radical acceptance is acknowledging the reality of the narcissistic relationship landscape and, above all else, that their behavior is not going to change. Radical acceptance gives you permission to heal, because you stop channeling your energy into trying to fix the relationship and instead focus on moving yourself forward. The alternative is to remain stuck in the unfounded hope that it could get better and stay in these invalidating cycles in perpetuity.

- All roads are hazardous when navigating narcissistic territory, but only one pathway will get you to a better destination, and that’s the one of radical acceptance. Of course, as Luisa’s story shows us, accepting a narcissistic situation for what it is can lift the curtains and allow you to see it so you can finally stop jousting at windmills. There is grief in having to accept that your relationship cannot improve, that there will be no phoenix rising from the ashes, and that the narcissistic person will never really attempt to see and understand you. This can be devastating and cement the loss you may have been trying to avoid mentally and emotionally. However, not only does acceptance open the gateway to healing and growth, but it can give you a sense of relief. In some ways, it’s like learning that there was no right answer to the test question, so you never could have gotten it correct. You can ultimately let go of the erroneous belief that there is something you can do to “fix” the relationship, and then you can stop wasting time and invest those hours into yourself and the relationships and pursuits that are actually good for you.

- Acknowledging the reality of the narcissistic relationship is not easy. Recognizing and living with the emerging recognition that this person will never change and the relationship will never get better means moving into a very different reality than the one you had hoped for, may still want, and molded yourself to fit for so many years, sometimes a lifetime. The greatest barrier to radical acceptance is hope. Hope for change. Hope that the promises will be kept. Hope that things will get better. Hope for the genuine apology or accountability. Hope for the happily ever after. Hope that it is actually a normal and healthy relationship. In a narcissistic relationship, hope takes a long time to fade. The challenge of acceptance is that it squelches that hope, and evokes grief, guilt, and helplessness. When hope gets extinguished, many people feel pressured to make a decision they are not yet ready to make, because radical acceptance begs the question “If it is really this bad, and it is not going to change, I can’t really stay in it, can I?” It can also raise tremendous guilt, as though you are a bad person for having a “defeatist” mindset about someone you are supposed to love. To avoid having to make a difficult decision, you might erect barriers to acceptance such as justification, rationalization, denial, and personal narratives that frame your story in a more palatable manner (It isn’t that bad, we found love despite our tough childhoods; Relationships are hard, and one day once things are settled, it will all be good; Families are complicated; We work hard and we fight hard). All of this allows you to remain in the relationship and not face the more frightening issues raised by acceptance, such as giving up hope, setting boundaries, being alone, distancing from family, starting again, or being wrong. But radical acceptance isn’t necessarily a call to leave a relationship or situation. It is a shift in expectations regardless of what you choose to do. It means that if you stay in the situation, you see the relationship and the behavior within the relationship clearly. Acceptance doesn’t just mean seeing that the person’s personality and behavior are not going to change, but also that this will not be a safe space or a relationship you ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2159))

- can rely on. That is not easy to do, but the pathway to radical acceptance begins with the simple acknowledgment that this is how it is and it is not going to change. Initially, no actions need to be taken—you don’t need to break up or file for divorce or go no contact. In fact, in the early days of radical acceptance, letting it breathe for a minute is essential, because your entire reality must integrate this seismic shift. After this first step, you are in a better position to make decisions that are protective and informed. This is a major shift in how you have been thinking about your relationship, sometimes for decades, and it may feel pessimistic or even cynical to “give up” on another person. This alteration in your thinking can feel like a barrier because you may not view yourself as a person who gives up on anyone. But radical acceptance is not a disavowal of a narcissistic person; it’s a rejection of their behavior and a recognition that this unacceptable behavior will not shift. When we are in the throes of a narcissistic situation, we are already struggling with self-devaluation, and radical acceptance may magnify those feelings if you think you are giving up on another human being. That mental trap of “I need to be forgiving, I know they don’t mean it” or “I am as bad as them if I give up on them” can keep people stuck and impede the process of healing. Instead, focus on framing narcissistic abuse as behavior, because it can feel less dehumanizing than viewing it as “This is a bad person.” ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2176))

After Emma really accepted that her husband’s and mother’s behavior was not going to change, and that she did not feel able to separate from either of these relationships, she was hit with a tidal wave of grief. She felt that she could accept that she wouldn’t have a perfect relationship with her mother, or that her marriage would be rocky. But accepting that it wouldn’t change felt like a loss of hope; she may not ever get a loving, patient partner or a safe, compassionate mother. Letting go of those hopes and narratives was like a funeral in her mind. Now Emma no longer takes the bait, and she has developed some new interests. Her friends and her therapist are her sounding board now, and she puts time and effort into cherishing her friends and enjoying her children. She has figured out workarounds on household issues and knows that turning to her husband for help just raises more conflict (the workarounds are more work but less anguish; it’s easier to bring the trash cans in herself). She has set dates with her mother and recognizes that what her mother wants—24/7 access to her—is impossible. On her hardest days, Emma feels her life is a sham. On most days, she is grateful that the number of conflicts has dropped, and she is less disappointed on a daily basis.

The vast majority of us stay in at least one narcissistic relationship. That is why advice that only encourages you to get out doesn’t help. Radical acceptance does not mean you have to end the relationship; it simply means you must see it for what it is. Our reasons for staying, even after we understand what the narcissistic relationship is really about, include financial realities, family relationships we want to maintain, religion, societal and cultural expectations,… ([Location 2222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2222))

- Ultimately, radical acceptance can set you free even if you remain in a narcissistic relationship. You are no longer looking at the eastern horizon and searching for the sunset. You can divest your psychological investment and put it into other areas of your life: healthy social support and relationships, meaningful pursuits, or other interests. There can be a complicated relief that comes from no longer living in suspended hope and waiting for the future-faked better someday. Instead of it being resignation, acceptance can be framed as an opportunity to finally settle into and bring your authentic self to your healthy relationships. It’s such a difficult balance—when you bring your authentic self to the narcissistic person, they often shame and rage at you, and yet it is central to your healing that you cultivate your true self and share it with others. I have talked with people who said that once they really accepted, they no longer waited for empathy, compassion, or respect from the narcissistic person. Their reasons for staying were varied, but they said that with acceptance, they could now disengage and ([Location 2237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2237))

Others who didn’t want to share custody of children counted the clock down to eighteenth birthdays before filing for divorce. Yet others stayed in toxic workplaces until a job search was successful or benefits and pensions got figured out. The goal of radical acceptance while staying in a narcissistic situation is to have realistic expectations, check in with yourself, ensure you do not fall into the trauma-bonded justifications, and remain true to yourself (which I recognize is not easy as you are also navigating the process of figuring out who you are separate from this relationship).

- Don’t Hit Send We’ve all written that text or letter or email where we explain ourselves to a narcissistic person: the long, meandering email, the text that goes on far longer than a text should. You probably wrote that letter because they never listen to you while you speak, and they gaslight, interrupt, or confuse you so much that you get tongue-tied. Maybe you thought if you wrote it out carefully, then they could see your point of view clearly. But it never works. They read it and either respond with an obscene emoji, send an eviscerating and scathing response, or gaslight you (again). Now, take a different approach to writing that email or text or letter.

Let it be a catharsis and a clearing out of all the things you want to say. But do not send it to them! You may want to share it with a trusted friend or a therapist just to have someone bear witness to your experience. I have read countless numbers of these letters, texts, and emails over the years, and they are usually painful, poignant, and poetic reflections on a survivor’s pain. Sharing it in a safe space such as therapy allowed them to receive empathy for their experience, empathy they would not have received if they’d shared it with the narcissistic person in their life. These letters also became a place to share other strong emotions such as anger that they could have never safely shared in the relationship. When you’re done, destroy the letter. Make the destruction ceremonial. If it’s safe, burn it, or write it on something biodegradable and drop it in a pond or the sea, toss it off a mountaintop, or bury it. If you can’t do any of those, run it through a shredder. Or just write it into your phone as a note and then delete it. The point is to give yourself an opportunity to vent and clearly lay out all of your thoughts and feelings about this relationship. Then by destroying it, you acknowledge that the narcissist will never hear your words, which fosters acceptance.

- The Toxic Cleanup Most of us don’t have just one toxic person in our lives. Once you pull back the curtain on the more compelling or demanding narcissistic people in your life, you will see that there are more people like this in your world than you initially recognized. If we do not see them clearly for who they are, we run the risk of enabling or minimizing their impact. By setting boundaries, ending relationships, disengaging, and radically accepting what narcissistic relationships are really about, you can start extending those boundaries to the other unhealthy people in your life.

- to bring joy to a person’s life, cleaning out toxic people should bring ecstasy. First, go through your list of contacts in your phone—and this is going to sound a little childish—and put a little symbol or emoji next to the names of the people who aren’t good for you. They may not be as toxic as the more demanding narcissistic people in your life, but they may still be taking a toll on you and leaving you depleted. When any of these less-than-healthy folks text you and you see that little toxic symbol, that reminder may be enough to stop you from engaging. It may also be a reminder to say “No” to that phone call you know will be a one-sided time suck. This extends to not falling into the “birthday trap”—reaching out on the birthday of a narcissistic person from your past—which may place you at risk of being sucked back into the narcissistic relationship cycle. You can expect to feel guilt, fear, and anxiety when you begin to eliminate or distance from these difficult people, but you will also feel relief. And you will augment the radical acceptance because you are more broadly able to see that your life is better without engaging in unnecessary invalidating exchanges with people.

- Building radical acceptance can be a soul- and eye-opening process. You’re letting go of the hope that the narcissistic person will become kind, empathic, and interested in your life and you are recognizing that the invalidation, hostility, and carelessness are here to stay. It’s not about giving up or giving in or agreeing with the abusive behavior, but about seeing a situation clearly. While this may initially make you feel hopeless or cynical, radical acceptance is an essential gateway to healing and to separating from their reality and upholding your own. Radical acceptance raises tremendous grief, a unique grief that can overwhelm us and keep us stuck. In the next chapter, we will learn how to process the sense of loss and grief that these relationships can evoke.

- The narcissistic relationship is an intricate dance: the narcissistic person projects their shame onto you, and you, because you’re an empathic and accountable person, may receive it, integrate it, blame yourself, and ultimately take responsibility for all the toxicity within the relationship. Only with this structure can these relationships persist. The day you finally accept that the narcissistic dynamic will not change and that it has nothing to do with you is the day these cycles shift—and the day the relationship stops “working.” ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2511))

- The more contact you have with a narcissistic person, the worse you feel. Going no contact is exactly what it sounds like: no longer reaching out to them, but even more important, no longer responding to them. You don’t take their calls, you don’t reply to their text messages, you don’t talk to them. You disappear from their lives. At the more extreme end, you may also block their number, email, or social media accounts, or you may even have a protective element like a restraining order. No contact is a heavy-handed but effective tool to end toxic cycles. When you go no contact, be prepared for a toxic dance. The narcissistic person will alternate between angry and aggressive communication and hoovering manipulation, especially if you slip up and respond or if they realize that their anger isn’t working. If you don’t respond to hoovering, the rage communication will begin ([Location 2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=2967))

- again. The amount of communication may also increase if you haven’t blocked them—be prepared for dozens if not hundreds of texts, emails, and phone calls that grow angrier. They may threaten to blackmail you, or hire an attorney, or tell other people terrible things about you. They will double down over time, and the threats may become more unsettling until you contact them. They may even stalk you. If the stalking escalates—they drive by your home, the number of messages is overwhelming, they reach out to your workplace—consider consulting with an attorney or local domestic violence agency to learn whether legal remedies may be available to you (and sadly, there are fewer than you think—our current systems favor stalker-y behavior over survivor protection). Unfortunately, going no contact is not viable in most situations and can sometimes create more distress. For instance, no contact doesn’t work if you are co-parenting minor children, or in most workplaces, and it doesn’t always work in family systems if you want access to some family members or have children who are invested in cousins or grandparents. For some of us, the overwhelming sense of disloyalty and grief at ceasing communication can be too uncomfortable or may cause pain for others in your life who matter to you. Ultimately, lots of stars need to align for you to be able to consider going no contact and then being able to stick to it.

- The reality is, many of us cannot easily exit narcissistic relationships, and almost all of us have at least one relationship we cannot leave. It’s too simple to tell yourself, This is toxic so I’m getting out. Maybe you stay because of children, because you need the job, or because you can’t imagine walking away from your parents or family, no matter how toxic they are. You may feel you need your sidekick, even though the friendship with the narcissistic person is taking a toll on you. No matter why you choose to stay, the rules of engagement will need to change if you hope to heal.

- This chapter will break down how to balance on the razor’s edge of staying or having some contact in any narcissistic relationship without enabling the narcissistic patterns or blaming yourself. It will provide some key techniques and hacks for survival. Healing and growing while you are still in the relationship require mindful awareness of what is happening, preparing for and recovering from your conversations with the narcissistic person, being intentional, and always maintaining realistic expectations to manage the carousel of disappointment and grief. The exercises in this chapter will help you remain true to yourself and your goals, sidestep conflict, and construct workarounds while not allowing the invalidation of the relationship to clip your wings. The primary challenge of healing while staying in the toxic situation is that narcissistic people don’t really want you to heal. It’s not that they care about your healing per se, but rather that your healing means they get less supply. Your healing means that you are experiencing yourself separate from them, which defies their expectation for domination and control. Narcissistic relationships are like sandbags on your hot-air balloon: as you try to fly, they attempt to keep you stuck on the ground. This chapter will teach you how to cut the ropes on those sandbags. It may look like you are still in the relationship with the narcissistic person, but at least your spirit can rise.

- The truth is, healing is more important than leaving. You can still heal and not make the massive leap of leaving the relationship, disrupting contact, or upending your life. Healing is about taking back your power, even if you do stay. As you change, become more gaslight resistant, find your voice, and stop subscribing to their version of reality, the narcissistic folks may become less focused on you. You are only interesting as a source of supply, a prop, or a punching bag. Once you are no longer serving those roles, they may pack it in, disengage, or no longer want you around. Be prepared for that. This can be frightening as well, and your own fears of abandonment can put you at risk of wanting to put the brakes on your healing and individuation so the relationship can sustain.

- Healing is possible regardless of whether you leave the narcissistic relationship or not. However, and I cannot sugarcoat this, living with or regularly interacting with a narcissistic person is like living with a person who smokes cigarettes. Even if you have air filters, open the windows, and keep the house clean, you will still get a little sick over time. If you stay, in most cases, there is no way to fully “work it out” with a narcissistic person. There will always be workarounds, minefields, and tension. It will never be easy. The person will not change, and your body and mind will not adjust to their impact on you. It’s important for you to know these limits because if you don’t, you can once again fall into the patterns of self-blame and think, “Oh, great, I can’t even heal right.” You are doing just fine. It’s a new status quo: the narcissistic relationship remains the same; you are the one who is changing. Remaining in a narcissistic relationship requires awareness, clear expectations, and self-compassion. Let’s explore what this looks like.

In a healthy relationship you can set boundaries, and when someone violates your boundaries, you can communicate and, ([Location 3280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3280))

- gradually, they will acknowledge and shift the behavior. Boundaries in narcissistic relationships are an exercise in hypocrisy. While narcissistic people will expect you to honor their boundaries, they will not respect yours. But if you are going to remain in one of these relationships, boundaries are necessary, and you cannot set them overnight. Boundaries are meant to bring safety, something that is lacking in narcissistic relationships. Setting boundaries is paradoxical, a new and healthier safety behavior that in the short term can leave us feeling uneasy. The key is to remember that boundaries are an inside job. It becomes less about you waiting for the narcissistic person to honor a boundary and more about you setting one for yourself that you can honor. This is about knowing what qualifies as acceptable to you. It is a slow process, gradually disengaging from sharing important things about yourself and avoiding sharing feelings, emotions, aspirations, or negative moods with the narcissistic person. You also need to be clear on your nonnegotiable boundaries. For some people it’s cheating; for others it’s physical violence. If the narcissistic person crosses the nonnegotiable line, you may feel empowered to set more clear boundaries or even get out. However, in many moderate narcissistic relationships, that clear boundary may not get crossed. There may not be the “big” breach ([Location 3283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3283))

- Gray Rock and Yellow Rock If you’ve read about narcissistic abuse before, you may have encountered the term gray rock. Gray rocking entails being as uninteresting as a gray rock, with minimal response, flat emotion, and simple answers. It’s as close to no contact with a narcissist as you can be while still having some contact. In essence, you are no longer a source of good narcissistic supply. Gray rocking can be used in real-time conversation, texting, and emailing—no long shares, just the facts, yes and no, and a sort of “copy that” acknowledgment that a message was received. Gray rocking is a specifically disengaged form of communication—unemotional, perfunctory, brief, unembellished, and not vulnerable. Initially if you start gray rocking, the narcissistic person may get angry, because you are no longer feeding their need for arguments, drama, validation, and admiration. The challenge becomes whether you can hold on during their initial escalation. They may push harder, bait you more, and multiply their insults. You will likely hear things like “What are you doing? You think you’re too good to talk to me now? What, are you in therapy now? Did your therapist tell you to be like that?” Be prepared for it—you may need to white-knuckle through this experience.

The DEEP technique gives you a quick way to remember what not to do if you want to protect yourself and avoid falling into the typical mess of being gaslighted, baited, and invalidated.

- Don’t defend. Defending ourselves is the most common mistake we make in the face of narcissistic behavior. When someone is accusing you of something you did not do or saying something about you that you do not agree with, it’s natural to want to defend yourself. But remember the cardinal rule of narcissism: they aren’t listening. So avoid putting in a lot of effort, giving them lots of narcissistic supply, and ending up in unnecessary arguments where you keep defending yourself. Where this gets tricky is when you hear that the narcissistic person is speaking badly about you to others. At those times, it’s better to talk with the people hearing these things—and if anyone is willing to believe the narcissistic person, that is more of a reflection on that person than on you. If their behavior is defamatory and resulting in professional and financial damages, retain an attorney. Not defending is not about being a doormat; it is about not wasting your energy on a pointless endeavor. Don’t explain. Because narcissistic people are so manipulative, you may feel compelled to explain yourself whenever they gaslight you. The difficulty is that they will distort your explanation, and before you know it, you will be defending yourself. You may believe that if the narcissistic person could just hear your point of view, things would be better—but they won’t.

Here is where the gray rocking, yellow rocking, and firewalling come into play. Avoid getting into a back-and-forth with the narcissistic person. If they are going on about something, you can briefly acknowledge it, then move on. Don’t voluntarily get into conversations because more often than not, they will end badly. Do not offer feedback or guidance or a critique—let them fail on their own. It is so difficult to live with or have regular contact with someone and not meaningfully interact or engage with them, but one exercise that can be useful is to play out the entire conversation in your head before you ever open your mouth.

- Many people think, Maybe it is something about me, that is why they are treating me like this. But remember: it’s not you! You aren’t the only one the narcissistic person is treating this way, though you may be getting the worst of it. They aren’t noticing you enough to actually devalue you; they are devaluing your narcissistic supply because that is all you or anyone else is to them. This can be difficult for survivors to accept because you have spent years mired in self-blame and thinking of course it’s you! It’s not, and the more you can disconnect from that belief, the easier it becomes to disengage. While not going DEEP is a useful technique, it isn’t always a smooth path forward. A person shared with me that once she used this technique and disengaged, her narcissistic spouse pushed back saying that he had no interest in being in a “polite” relationship and behaved even more badly. The DEEP technique will often show you the uncomfortable truth of your narcissistic relationship, which can fuel radical acceptance, but it still stings, especially if you are going to stay. Stop Making It about Them The biggest challenge when you remain in these relationships is that the narcissistic people are still in your life, and they remain a big part of your context. Before you understood narcissism, you lived in their service (I hope they are okay with this, I would be doing so much better if they were just happy). As you begin to radically accept that they won’t change, you may still hitch your psychological cart to them (I am going to heal just to show them they don’t have power over me; I hope I get this promotion just to piss them off; I hope they find out I am dating someone new). Here’s the problem: When you do this, the narcissistic person is still a frame of reference—you’re healing to prove something to them, succeeding to get one over on them.

- least. Psychological research highlights the value of forgiveness, and in healthy relationships it has tremendous value. But narcissistic relationships are not healthy, so all the conventional wisdom about forgiveness goes out the window. Merriam-Webster defines the word forgive as “to cease to feel resentment against (an offender).” If you no longer feel resentment toward the person who betrayed you, then you are in the clear—forgive away. To try to forgive while still resenting may be what the world or the narcissistic person wants to see, but it is not an authentic process within you. What has happened in the past when you forgave the narcissistic person in your life? In most cases, narcissistic people didn’t recognize forgiveness as the gift that it is and changed their behavior. Instead, they likely saw it as permission to keep on doing what they were doing. Forgiveness is narcissistic supply, one more thing that emboldens the narcissistic person’s entitlement, and you may even get angry at yourself for forgiving them, especially if you get betrayed again. Forgiveness also rarely happens in real time in a narcissistic relationship. It is something that, if it happens, tends to unfold long after you have safely extricated from the relationship. Multiple studies suggest that forgiveness is not good for a person if it is not followed by an attempt to make amends or foster safety. When people repeatedly forgave a partner who behaved badly in a relationship, it negatively affected the well-being of the person doing the ([Location 3719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3719))

- forgiving. Other researchers also found that less-agreeable partners were more likely to re-offend after being forgiven and didn’t feel pressure to change their behavior because they believed their partner wouldn’t be mad at them if they did slip up again. There is even a name for all of this: the doormat effect, which states that forgiving a less-agreeable partner who has behaved badly negatively affects self-respect. Most of what is written about the virtues of forgiveness does not account for narcissism and antagonism. When we do account for repeat offenders and disagreeable personalities, research suggests that it would be better for your well-being if you didn’t forgive.[3] Personally, I have not forgiven all the narcissistic people who showed up on my path. I have let go, moved on, and wish them no ill will, but I also see clearly that they harmed me and, in some ways, changed me, yet they never took responsibility for the harm they caused. I still spend time with some of them. But I always feel worse afterward, and because of these relationships, I am more vigilant, fearful, and less trusting. Embracing my non-forgiveness has significantly helped my healing and brought the volume down on my anger. The disconnect between resentment and forgiveness meant that if I claimed to forgive them, then I was holding something that held me back. Forgiveness for them meant internal tension for me. Doesn’t seem very healing, does it? Some have told me, “Ramani, you have moved on and left them behind, just forgive them.” But I don’t view lack of forgiveness as a weight I carry. I view it as a realistic assessment of the situation. For years I did keep forgiving, or at least believed that I was forgiving, and I turned to the multiple truths to make sense of it. They hurt me, I loved them, I tried to forgive, they betrayed me again, I stopped trusting other people, I still am afraid of their criticism. Moving on wasn’t as simple as forgiving and letting go. It never is. Part of the struggle is that some things we call forgiveness aren’t. Letting go, moving on, pardoning the narcissistic people’s behavior, or forgetting it altogether can help set you free but they’re not the same as forgiveness, which is a more active process. Rumination about forgiving (or not forgiving) can keep you mentally interlinked with the narcissistic relationship, even when they are out… ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3731))

- forgiving repeat offenders. Healing, shaping a new narrative, and taking your voice back are about choice, and in the same way, forgiveness is about choice. It is astonishing to me how much of the discourse on narcissistic abuse is about forgiving the narcissist. It’s ridiculous. If you don’t want to forgive, you may have been shamed as somehow lacking compassion when, in fact, you are sorting through the wreckage of the narcissistic relationship. Or you may have been told that you will not be able to heal if you do not forgive. That is simply not true. Healing is about clearly seeing what happened. To allow yourself to feel the sadness and the pain. This is not a story you just tell once. You need to tell it enough times so you can see it, but you can’t do that without feeling it. It is sad, and grief-filled, and painful. To heal means to allow yourself to feel your pain and your story of narcissistic abuse. To slowly do this without shame but with self-compassion. Many people put their heads down and obsessively work or engage in other frenetic activity to get past narcissistic abuse. That’s not healing; that’s distracting yourself. Being busy can feel safe in the short term. The long game means you can’t skip the pain step and go from busy to better.… ([Location 3754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3754))

- out, you blame yourself for staying too long. How could I have been so stupid? Why didn’t I see it sooner? Maybe I didn’t try hard enough. How much of this was my fault? Maybe I created this monster. Forgive yourself for not seeing it, for confusing empathy with enabling, and for making excuses. You didn’t know. No one is taught this, so why would you have seen it? Self-forgiveness is about release. Releasing yourself from the narcissistic person’s narrative. You may feel you let yourself, your own children, or your colleagues and employees down. But you just wanted to be loved, cherished, and protected by your parents; to fall in love with someone and be treated with kindness, compassion, and respect; to be treated equitably and respectfully in the workplace; to receive basic empathy. In return for that, you were met with gaslighting, invalidation, rage, contempt, dismissiveness, and cruelty. You did nothing wrong. It’s time to stop crafting… ([Location 3766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4J6P5RB&location=3766))

- Reflect on How You Felt Instead of What Happened If you tell your story enough, over time it can be easy to get separated from the emotions. As a therapist, I believe the stories are the “B-side” of a therapy session—the most important part is how a client felt in the moment and feels now. As you heal from narcissistic abuse and recraft your narrative, pay attention to your emotions. It’s so easy to get lost in the narrative episodes (My parents did this; This happened at my wedding; My partner cheated; My business partner stole my money) that you don’t feel the feelings. Simply recalling the things that happened in the relationship misses the one part of the story that is all yours: how you felt when it happened. Connecting to these feelings can break cycles of rumination, foster discernment, and allow you to be more present and self-compassionate.
