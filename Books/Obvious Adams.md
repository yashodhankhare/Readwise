## Highlights
- It is interesting, this story of a poor boy who began life as Oliver B. Adams in a little grocery store in a small New England town, and has grown to be known everywhere in the business world as “Obvious Adams.” ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=120))

- “It all struck me in a heap: How many of us have sense enough to see and do the obvious thing? And how many of us have persistency enough in following out our ideas of what is obvious? The more I thought of it the more convinced I became that in our organization there ought to be some place for a lad who had enough sense to see the obvious thing to do and then to go about it directly, without any fuss or fireworks, and do it!

- Adams smiled. “Well,” he said, “since I had that name wished upon me I have given considerable thought to that very question, and I have decided that picking out the obvious thing presupposes analysis, and analysis presupposes thinking, and I guess Professor Zueblin is right when he says that thinking is the hardest work many people ever have to do, and they don’t like to do any more of it than they can help. They look for a royal road through some shortcut in the form of a clever scheme or stunt, which they call the obvious thing to do; but calling it doesn’t make it so. They don’t gather all the facts and then analyze them before deciding what really is the obvious thing, and thereby they overlook the first and most obvious of all business principles. Nearly always that is the difference between the small businessman and the big, successful one. Many small businessmen have an aggravated case of business astigmatism which could be cured if they would follow the obvious course of calling in some business specialist to correct their vision and give them a true view of their own business and methods. And that might be said of a lot of big businesses too. “Some day,” he continued, “a lot of businessmen are going to wake up to the power and sanity of the obvious. Some have already. Theodore Vail, for instance, worried over the telegraph equipment that stood practically idle eight hours out of the twenty‑four and he conceived the night letter idea to spread out the business over the dull hours and make more new business. What could have been more obvious? “Study most of the men who are getting salaries of upward of one hundred thousand dollars a year. They are nearly all doers of the obvious.

- I sat and thought too. What was the secret of this man’s success? I asked myself. And then I recalled the little boy’s composition on the mountains of Holland. He wrote:   THE MOUNTAINS OF HOLLAND ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=377))

- There are no mountains in Holland. That is the answer, I decided. There is no secret — it is obvious! ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=379))

- The trouble is, the obvious is apt to be so simple and commonplace that it has no appeal to the imagination. We all like clever ideas and ingenious plans that make good lunch‑table talk at the club. There is something about the obvious that is — well, so very obvious!

- THE FIRST TEST OF OBVIOUSNESS I borrowed from Kettering of General Motors, who had it placed on the wall of the General Motors Research Building in Dayton: This problem when solved will be simple. The obvious is nearly always simple — so simple that sometimes a whole generation of men and women have looked at it without even seeing it. Whereas if an idea is clever, ingenious, or complicated, we should suspect it. It probably is not obvious. The history of science, the arts and the great developments in the world of business, is a history of men and women stumbling upon simple solutions to complex problems. Mr. Kettering’s wise proverb might be paraphrased. “The solution when found will be obvious.” ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=396))

- THE SECOND TEST OF OBVIOUSNESS is a question: Does it check with human nature? If you do not feel pretty certain that your idea or plan will be understood — and accepted — by your mother, wife, brothers, sisters, cousins, your next‑door neighbor, the man who works at the next desk or machine, the ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=402))

- mechanic who services your automobile, your minister, your barber, the manager of your grocery store, the man who shines your shoes, your Aunt Mary, your secretary, your seat‑-mate on the 5:29 suburban train, your most outspoken friends — if you don’t feel comfortable about explaining your “obvious” idea to these people — it probably is not obvious. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=405))

- THE THIRD TEST OF OBVIOUSNESS is: Put it on paper. Write out your idea, plan or project in words of one or two syllables, as though you were explaining it to a child. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=414))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Can you do this in two or three short paragraphs, so that it makes sense? If not, if the explanation becomes long, involved, ingenious — then very likely it is not obvious. For, to repeat, “When you find the answer it will be simple.” ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=416))

- THE FOURTH TEST OF OBVIOUSNESS is: Does it EXPLODE in people’s minds? If, when you have presented your idea, outlined your solution to a problem, or explained your plan, project or program, people say, “Now why didn’t we think of that before?” you can feel encouraged. For obvious ideas are very apt to produce this “explosive” mental reaction. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=422))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If an idea or proposal does not “explode,” if it requires lengthy explanation, and involves hours of argument, either it is not obvious, or you have not thought it through yourself and reduced it to obvious simplicity. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=428))

- THE FIFTH TEST OF OBVIOUSNESS is: Is the time ripe? Many ideas and plans are obvious in themselves, but just as obviously “out of time.” Checking the timeliness is often just as important as checking the idea or plan itself. Sometimes the time may have passed, definitely and irrevocably; in which case the obvious thing to do is forget your idea. In other instances its timeliness may be ahead, which calls for patience, plus alertness. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=432))

- “One of the cardinal virtues,” wrote Emerson in his Journal, “is timeliness. My neighbor, the carriage maker, all summer is making sleighs, and all winter is making light, gay gigs and chariots for June and August; and so, on the first days of the new season, is ready...” To be ready is to be timely; and to be timely is an obvious requirement.

- Never mind how a thing has always been done, or how other people want to do it. What is the simplest possible way of doing it? Strip off all the accumulated ideas, practices, methods, techniques and traditions. If a seven‑year old boy were tackling the problem for the first time, uninhibited by the experience of generations, how would he be likely to proceed? Accumulated experience is valuable — but it can also smother and thwart and complicate doing the obvious. It takes simple, fresh, bold, original thinking to simplify anything. And — never forget — “This problem when solved will be simple.” There is a perfectly mechanical way of simplifying a plan or project, or of analyzing an idea to test its simplicity. List on a sheet of paper every part of it. As you write ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=465))

- What opportunity is being overlooked because no one has bothered to develop it? In the home office of a large insurance company, a man who earned a $600 award for a simple idea he had dropped in the Suggestion Box gave this advice to his associates: “Look for the obvious which no one else has bothered with.” ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=513))

- In his stimulating book3, Ray Giles tells the following story to illustrate the point that there are great opportunities in the obvious:   “Some years ago, a grocery clerk was cutting cheese — a huge round American cheese. When you asked for a pound, the clerk lifted the glass bell and cut off a piece, estimating the weight by its heft. While the glass was off, the cheese was exposed to dust and flies. If sales were slow, the cheese might crumble before the last was gone. The chief protection of the cheese was a tough rind — which you had to buy along with the cheese. One day the grocery clerk had a thought — an obvious one that might come to anyone: Why not put cheese in sanitary packages? The clerk’s name was J. L. Kraft, and every time you eat Kraft cheese let it remind you that a simple, obvious idea may lead to wealth.”   In almost everything we use in our daily lives there is opportunity for improvement — often so completely obvious that it should shame us not to have seen it. Benjamin Franklin, bothered by the need for two pairs of spectacles, one for looking at things nearby, and another for seeing things at a distance, developed bifocal spectacles, which have been a boon to humanity. Nothing could be more obvious. Which suggests that as a technique for discovering the obvious, we should take a bifocal look at everything we use and do and need — examine it close‑up to see if some ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=517))

- detail might not be improved; push it off and study it in the large, to see if there may not be some entirely different way of accomplishing the same end. Some way that is simpler, more efficient, more economical. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T14VCJE&location=529))
