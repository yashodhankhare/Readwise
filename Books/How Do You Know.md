## Highlights
- “So, what is knowing, and what is knowledge? What do we mean when we say we know? … Please, sirs, do go into this with me, pay a little attention. To know is a very interesting word. How do you know, and what do you know? Please ask yourselves, as I am asking myself.” ~ Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986), philosopher ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=126))

- “The real secret of magic is that the world is made of words, and that if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it whatever you wish.” ~ Terence McKenna (1946-2000), lecturer and author of True Hallucinations “I think that the most pervasive and fundamental of these obstacles to change and growth is a complicated condition we can call by a simple name… ‘a belief in magic.’ I think we all believe in magic.” ~ Wendell Johnson (1906-1965), psychologist and author of People in Quandaries ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=136))

- For much of what we think about Wall Street, investing, and life rests on nothing more than abstractions – words and symbols (and words are a kind of symbol) – that have no basis in the world “out there.” In short, we make them up. They exist in our heads only. And yet we come to treat them as if they were real. In doing so, we deceive ourselves and allow others to deceive us. We waste a lot of time on pointless guesswork. We make avoidable thinking errors. We put our trust in bad maps and wander astray. In the markets, we lose money – and a piece of our sanity. What we need is a radically different way to think about the world around us. We need a way of thinking mindfully of this abstracting and the limits of those abstractions. Fortunately, such a way exists, though it seems largely forgotten except by a small group of connoisseurs. In what follows, I’ll share with you this robust framework for identifying and piercing through these abstractions. I’ll give you tools to sharpen your thinking. If you work with these tools, I guarantee you will see results. I can’t guarantee you won’t ever fall for magical thinking again. But you will fall for less magical nonsense than before.

- There is no such thing as a “value stock” or a “growth stock.” One man’s growth stock is another man’s value stock – and vice versa. In other words, people create these categories. And they create them using varying criteria, which they select. One stock can, therefore, fill many roles depending on the definition used; sometimes the same stock fulfills the same roles at the same time. As a result, such categories are nearly meaningless. And yet the financial world churns out stuff like the Bloomberg piece every day. They are silly and a waste of time. What is “value” (or “growth”) but some arbitrary definition?

- Yet, many investors take this kind of “analysis” very seriously. I know asset allocators and investment advisors who will make decisions on where to invest based on this kind of thinking. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=219))

- If you want to get on the path to clear thinking, you have to see through this charade of “value” versus “growth” – and all of its many manifestations, multiplied across many verbal and conceptual siblings and cousins. You have to recognize it as arbitrary and made up and nonexistent in the real world. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=224))

- In fact, even the idea of “stocks” is something that exists only in our heads. Nobody owns “stocks.” And there is no such thing as a “stock market.” What people own is Exxon Mobil (XOM), or Apple (AAPL), or Facebook (FB). They own individual companies (or funds). And those individual companies (and funds) are all different. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=226))

- But I hear people talk as if stocks were all the same. People say, “Stocks are expensive,” or “Stocks are going to go up,” or “Stocks are going to go down.” And they’ll engage in serious discussion about it – with charts and facts and jibber-jabber about interest rates and the economy and the Fed, etc. But they’re talking about an abstraction – something that doesn’t exist in a practical sense.

- Naming something does not tell us much about the thing so named. As a society we way overstate the power of a name. I always think of the story told by Richard Feynman: “See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler. … Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing – that’s what counts.” (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.) When we call a stock a “value stock,” “growth stock,” “cyclical stock,” or whatever, we should not assume we know anything about that particular stock. We know only what other people call it. (I’ll have more on this when we talk about how you should not trust labels.) Focus instead on what the thing does, how it behaves, etc. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=248))

- I would ignore the designations of Class A and such, and instead focus on the financial characteristics of the buildings themselves. Focus on how they actually perform, on the price you’d pay to own them relative to the potential return, and risk of loss, not on what label people agree to place on the assets today.

- Broadly speaking, the two aspects of magical thinking above fall in the category of the magical power of a definition. We love definitions. We fight endlessly over what is what. It’s nonsense. Just because you can create definitions and pin them on things doesn’t mean they have any validity. And yet, it sometimes seems to me, the bulk of differences, arguments, and discussions is really over definitions. This morning as I write this, I see a post from an investor titled “Is it a Tool or a Platform?” The entire post is an attempt to solve a self-created problem! “One of the toughest things about analyzing companies is figuring out if they are tools or platforms,” the author writes. “It’s pretty critical that we figure out the difference.” Why? “Tools” and “platforms” are just words. Forget about them. Focus on what the companies do and less on what they’re called or how they’re defined. Once you see this madness, you will start to see it everywhere. (In the same morning, I saw an article titled “Is economics a science?” Again, we find an entire column fussing over a definition. I’m telling you, it’s everywhere.)

- You have surely heard people say, “You can’t change history.” Of course you can. The thinking error here comes from the misconception that history is a series of events existing as a reality separate from how we think about them. Not so. History exists only as interpretation, as memory, as stories we tell ourselves. All of which we can, and do, change. I want to share an interesting passage on this from the philosopher Oliver Reiser (from Logic and General Semantics: Writings of Oliver L. Reiser and Others, edited by Sanford Berman): There is a very general belief that the past is irrevocable, that history cannot be changed. Now, it is doubtless true that the past is past, but certainly this does not prove that the past is unalterable. … In the cultural interpretation of human history, the past is what it is because of its influence on the present. And if we change the present, we have in a sense altered the past. … If, in the sphere of individual history, the meaning of an experience suddenly breaks upon us, that original event is no longer what… ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=287))

- It is perfectly legitimate to do so. As we will learn later, reality is a product of the observer and the observed. There is no such thing as objectivity. To be objective is like trying to bite your own ear. It can’t be done. Everything we “see” must be processed and filtered through our human nervous system. And no two people process and filter in the same way. To cast the same idea of “history as only what we think of it” in more poetic terms, I want to share this passage from Alan Watts’ autobiography, In My Own Way: “The past is nothing but a present memory, a shadow, a trace; the illusion that a cigarette whirled in the dark is an actual circle of fire.” (Watts wrote beautiful, philosophical books and is most famous as a popularizer of “Eastern religions.” We’ll come back to his ideas and insights throughout this book.) What is history? It is words and symbols. Abracadabra again. We create history with words. Let us look at one more example before we move on. It is another one of my favorites for its initial shock value. 1 + 1 Does Not Always Equal 2 You probably take for granted that 1 + 1 = 2. It’s often thrown about as if it were some kind of law that is true always and everywhere. And yet it isn’t. The statement “1 + 1 = 2” is a statement made up of symbols. They are not real-world phenomena. In the real world, many things are not additive. Alfred Korzybski, an important thinker that we will hear more from in the next chapter, wrote in his magnum opus, Science and Sanity: In chemistry, for instance, does hydrogen ‘plus’ oxygen produce water, H2O? If we mix the two gases, two parts of hydrogen with one of oxygen we do not get water. We must first pass a spark through the mixture, when an explosion occurs and the result becomes water, a new compound quite different from its elements or from a mere mixture of them. Does one gallon of water and one gallon of alcohol make two gallons of a mixture? No, it makes less than two gallons. Does light added to light make more… ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=302))

- In business and in life, clear thinking requires that we do not assume that 1 + 1 always equals 2. Often you can combine two things and get something worth much less, as in a merger gone bad. And sometimes you can get something worth much more. Expecting the real world to obey our made-up equations and mathematical models is a sure path to sloppy thinking and self-deception. That our equations and models seem to often describe how the real world works is a different thing than saying the… ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=325))

- I write from an investing perspective, but in some ways this book is as much about thinking and life as it is about investing. In the spirit of Charlie Munger’s worldly wisdom, I’m sharing a mental model you can add to your own latticework of models. Munger, who is the famous and wise vice chairman of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said of his first rule of worldly wisdom: Well, the first rule is that you’ve got to have multiple models because if you just have one or two that you’re using, the nature of human psychology is such that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you’ll think it does. … And the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines. You may say, “My God, this is already getting way too tough.” But, fortunately, it isn’t that tough because 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight. I believe the model offered here can carry a lot of very heavy freight.

- Korzybski’s name and ideas are not well-known today. You probably had not heard of him before picking up this book. But you probably had heard the phrase most often associated with him: “The map is not the territory.” Think about a map of, say, the United States. The map is an abstraction. It may include states and capitals and show rivers and borders. But it also leaves a lot of things out. Seeing “New York City” on a map is quite a different thing than standing in the middle of Times Square on New Year’s Eve. In general semantics, maps stand as a powerful metaphor for our ideas, concepts, definitions, theories, etc. Korzybski stressed that the usefulness of a map was in its similarity to the territory it supposedly mapped. Maps can be “wrong.” ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=389))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Henceforth, in this book, I will also follow Korzybski’s convention, as outlined in the General Semantics Bulletin: “to mark off terms and phrases which seem to varying degrees questionable for neurolinguistic, neurophysiological, methodological, or general epistemological reasons.” I won’t be dogmatic about it and sprinkle single quotes everywhere, but I will use it judiciously to highlight terms where you should exercise particular care in handling them. Korzybski, as you might gather, was a stickler for a high level of linguistic clarity (to which I aspire but surely fall short). So Korzybski – instead of calling a map ‘good’ or ‘bad’ – thought of maps in terms of whether they were similar in structure to the territory or not. In the example above, our map was not similar in structure to the territory. It was false-to-facts. Following this map would have led us astray. Likewise, when our abstractions – those ideas, concepts, theories, definitions, etc. – do not match the territory, we fall into error. As Korzybski said, “for maximum probability of maximum predictability we must have a map similar in structure to the territory.” ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=405))

- Aristotle, I’m sure, needs no introduction. Aristotelian, in this context, primarily refers to a kind of thinking associated with his philosophy. A brief sketch of a few specifics will help frame what Korzybski reacted against and help you see the radical nature of general semantics. The first is the law of Identity. A is A. Things are what they are. An apple is an apple. That’s Aristotelian thinking. A non-A orientation would say, “No, this apple is different from other apples. And every apple is different in countless ways from every other apple.” You can have two fresh apples, but they differ in shape, size and color.

- But it doesn’t seem so trivial if we say, “stocks are expensive” (implying all stocks are the same and all stocks are expensive), thereby causing us to miss out on a stock just about to march up tenfold. Or if we think, “All lawyers are the same,” and then misjudge a lawyer who is quite different from our experience to that point. Or if we say, “CEOs are liars,” and then overlook a key insight from a CEO who wasn’t lying. The examples are endless. And it can be much more grave if we say “A Muslim is a Muslim” or “A Jew is a Jew,” implying a sameness that doesn’t exist. Some awful ideas and actions begin with such thinking. A non-A orientation would appreciate that all Muslims, for example, are not the same. They are all different in countless ways, as all people are everywhere. Another point of Aristotelian logic is that A is either A or not-A. This is the law of the excluded middle. A is either an apple or an orange. Closely related to this is the law of non-contradiction. A cannot be both A and not-A. But a non-A orientation realizes that in the world “out there,” most things do not fall into either/or categories. You can be both a father and a son. Something can be both a food and a poison – depending on the amount consumed. A non-A orientation guards against thinking in either/or terms. ‘Success’ or ‘failure,’ for example, admits little possibility of a more nuanced outcome. Ditto the idea that you are either a ‘winner’ or ‘loser,’ or such murky terms as ‘happiness’ or ‘wealth’ or ‘cause’ and ‘effect.’ Bruce Kodish, a general semanticist and Korzybski’s biographer,… ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=440))

- A non-A orientation realizes that whatever map (idea, concept, theory, etc.) we use, that map is not the territory. Our maps are reproductions of certain chosen details. They are representations, but they can never be the things they represent. A photo of a savory barbeque can never be the barbeque itself; no matter how good a representation, you can never taste it. The philosopher Alan Watts put it another way: “The menu is not the meal.” The words you read on the page of a menu are not the meal itself. Or as another philosopher, Jiddu Krishnamurti, said in Think on These Things, “A symbol, a word, is not the thing it represents. The word ‘door’ is not the door, is it?” I know this seems obvious, but again, we often forget and fog up our thinking as a result of forgetting. We assume ‘Class A building’ is a physical thing that exists. When we describe something using a word, we often think somehow we’ve captured what it is. A non-A orientation rejects this.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are many other implications: If the map is not the territory, then the map is not all of the territory. In other words, we always leave details out. Whatever we say, think, etc., we leave something out. What we leave out could be important. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=493))

- Maps are also self-reflexive. Meaning, we can make a map of the map. And we can make a map of the map of the map. Put another way, we can create abstractions based on our abstractions. We can make theories about our theories. We can have concepts built on concepts. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=496))

- Later he came to think it was a great breakthrough and that it captured what he was trying to get people to understand. (Still the engineer at heart, he apparently fashioned nice-looking models made of wood in his workshop. I keep thinking I’d like to make one to hang in my office. It would make a great conversation piece, besides serving as a reminder to be conscious of my own abstractions.) So what is this model with the mysterious name of “structural differential”? Take a look at the nearby diagram. It needs explaining. The “Event” level is the world out there; process may be a better word than event as it represents an ever-changing mosaic of happenings. All those dots and strings are the possible details that you could pick up through your human nervous system. The jagged line at the top of the parabola shows that there are a seemingly infinite number of details about the world out there that you cannot perceive. Let’s imagine we’re sitting in a park. The “Event” level is everything that is going on around us, whether we’re aware of it or not. It is every detail – every blade of grass, a bird in a tree, a sound, a smell, etc. Even things beyond our ability to detect, such as radio waves, infrared light, etc. Everything. The “Object” level comes next. It shows your perceptions of that “Event.” It represents the details you pick up. So again, think back to us sitting in a park. You’re aware of the dog running in the grass. You see a few trees. You hear a bird sing. You’re aware of the park bench you’re sitting on. These are things you pick up, the dots and strings on the “Object” level. But… as the diagram shows, you don’t pick up all the dots and all the strings. Some of the strings don’t connect from the “Event” to the “Object.” There are fewer dots on the “Object” than the “Event.” This shows you that some things are left out. You cannot possibly process all the details of the “Event.” You don’t pick up every bug, bird, leaf, blade of grass, sound, smell, etc. In short, the “Object” level is what you immediately perceive at the nonverbal level – it is your first impressions, visual images, feelings, tastes, textures, etc. The next level is “Description.” This is where you first start to conceptualize and put things into words. This is your making of the map. The important thing here is again the leaving out of details. You cannot put all of what you experience into words. You must again abstract; you must leave things out. And that is reflected in the diagram as more dots and strings fall behind and the “Description” itself takes on a shape different from the Object and Event levels. So, we’re sitting in the park, and you see someone run by. There’s the “Event” – a swirl of happenings and details of which you grasp only a fraction (the “Object” level). From the Object level you see someone in running shorts and shoes, T-shirt sweated through (the “Description”). The Object level you might think of as the focus of your attention. In this… ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=526))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- From this Description we start to draw Inferences. We say it’s profitable or it’s growing. At some point in our chain of inferences we may conclude the “stock is cheap.” But look how far from the “Event” we’ve come! Look at all the details we’ve left out. It makes you quite humble about the value of your inferences. There is so much you can’t possibly capture – so much you miss. Possibly, these missing strings and dots are important. Maybe you left out General Electric’s gaping pension deficit, which will eat into future earnings. Maybe your analysis also missed the adjustments GE made to disguise weaknesses in its earnings report. And so again, your inference would be wrong because the details you left out were ones that mattered. The stock dropped nearly 30% in 2017, a loss you may have avoided with a better inference. I realize the irony in talking about a model about the abstracting process. We shouldn’t take the model too literally. There are no levels in the real world. What the model represents can happen in mere seconds, or it may take weeks of work. Even so, the structural differential is quite robust. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=566))

- The structural differential is a model, after all. In the real world all these things – Event, Object, Description, Inferences – blend and exist together. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=588))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The idea behind it is simple. Dawes takes the structural differential and puts it in a time series. It captures well the idea that things are constantly changing. The Event is not a static thing, but a process. In such a world, it can be dangerous to stick with Inferences as if they were static tags. Inferences and Descriptions must be updated to reflect the changing nature of the Object and Event levels. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=593))

- If we accept that we don’t know ‘all’ that’s going on around us, we’re less likely to be close-minded about our ideas, opinions, decisions, etc. … If we accept that we don’t know ‘all’, we are more likely to develop a theoretical, experimental, and less absolutistic approach to what we believe, what we understand or know, and what we do. We adopt a continuous learning approach to living when we are aware that there is more information available to us than what we presently have. As an investor, learning the lessons embedded in the structural differential will go a long way toward making you more conscious of your own abstracting. Make your own structural differential and hang it on your wall. One last fascinating tidbit before we leave the structural differential: The model seems quite similar to Einstein’s own model of thinking. As Kodish writes in Dare to Inquire: While Einstein’s model emphasizes the scientist’s process of making conjectural jumps from experience, applying ‘logic,’ and then testing against experience, the structural differential emphasizes the structure of the underlying neuro-psycho-logical process of abstracting through which this takes place.

- Perhaps that will nudge you to give the structural differential a deeper look. I know “structural differential” is a funny name and that it looks strange. It may seem off-putting and even silly, but I would simply urge you to try it. Play with the model and apply it.

- One thing you may begin to appreciate after playing with Korzybski’s ideas for a bit is the complexity of the world around us. Making good inferences, then, becomes a tricky matter. Take the simple idea of cause and effect, which is an inference. In this chapter, we’ll explore why drawing cause and effect relationships is much more difficult than you might think – perhaps even impossible. Yet, the way many people talk about cause and effect often reflects a lack of appreciation for the utter complexities of markets and life. Consider the following: “When interest rates rise, stocks will fall.” “Lower taxes will cause stock prices to rise.” “High debt levels mean lower growth.” ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=643))

- First, you’ll note the heavy abstractions: ‘interest rates,’ ‘stocks,’ ‘lower taxes,’ ‘debt levels,’ ‘growth.’ These words, as we’ve seen, beg many questions. (Which stocks? What taxes? Which debts? ‘High’ compared to what? ‘Lower’ by how much? Etc.) Even looking past the abstractions, you should distrust simple cause-and-effect explanations such as these – no matter the proof offered. You’ll see why below.

- The error people made in thinking QE propped up the market was in mistaking correlation for causation. But correlation is not causation, as your statistics teacher surely used to teach you. (The second mistake is thinking that any single factor drives ‘the market.’) You may remember the old joke about the man on the street corner waving a red flag. Finally, someone goes up to him and asks what he’s doing. “I’m keeping the elephants away.” “But there are no elephants here.” “Then it’s working.” Right.

Let me ask you: When you look at a company today in 2017, do you put any weight on what it earned in 2007? Or 2008? Or 2009? I don’t. And I would advise that you don’t either. But CAPE does. The reason you shouldn’t is that companies change. Why should I care what, say, Berkshire Hathaway earned in 2006 or 2007? It owns businesses today it didn’t even own back then. It’s practically a different firm. This goes for most businesses. They’re different now than they were then. Restaurants own more restaurants. Retailers own more stores (or less). Share counts change, especially with buybacks (which reduce shares outstanding). Accounting rules change. The mix of businesses in the index changes too – from heavy manufacturing to service to tech. All have different P/Es. People come and go, including CEOs, CFOs, etc. Second, mean reversion is a questionable way to look at markets. I know this sounds like heresy. Everybody seems to believe in mean reversion, or the idea that markets revert to an average. But the mean itself constantly changes. Also, which mean do you use? The five-year? Ten-year? Twenty-year? How about 50-year? You get different answers. Your choice is arbitrary. And mean of what? Does it even make sense to average price-earnings ratios over time? Lots of things impact price-earnings ratios – such as interest rates, expected growth rates, debt levels, and more. Less obvious, but perhaps most important: There is no rule that says markets have to revert to some average. The concept of an average is just an imaginary construction that exists in our heads. There is no average in real life. It has no physical existence, and it is not a constraint on anything. Our averages are like lines of latitude on the globe; they are just concepts. CAPE advocates like to say it works, as far as having some predictive value about future equity returns. They should say, “It seems to have worked in the past over the very long run.” And that’s not a good argument, because you can find whatever you want in the data – as Leinweber’s brilliant study shows. The same thing applies to many popular, even “sacred” ratios. Warren Buffett once said that market cap to GDP was “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” Well, that sealed this metric’s popularity, but it’s just another phony. Why should, say, the valuation of the S&P 500 – which gets more than 40% of earnings from outside the U.S. – be constrained by U.S. GDP? It isn’t, and it shouldn’t. Normally what happens when I tell people this is they agree, and then they continue to use it anyway. People seem to have a desperate need to believe in some kind of cause-and-effect relationship to make sense of the world. Most seem terrified to live with the idea that things just happen for reasons we can’t understand. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=689))

- I once heard author Robert Anton Wilson give a talk – on YouTube; he died in 2007 – where he explained an interesting exercise. He said he got it from reading a book by the mystic Aleister Crowley (1875-1947). Crowley said he got it from a monk in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The exercise goes like this: You go find a quiet place to sit, and then you trace out all the reasons you are there at that moment doing that exercise. So, you might start by saying, “I’m here because I read about this exercise in a book. I read the book because a friend of mine recommended it to me at lunch. Why was I meeting him at lunch that day? Well, because we regularly meet for lunch. Why…” And you keep going and pushing as far as you can stand to do it. What you come to realize is the role that chance and happenstance play in your life. Everything had to happen just as it happened for you to be sitting there at that moment. It also begs the question about what “the cause” was. There seem to be so many things that had to happen just the way they happened. Which one is “the cause”? If even seemingly trivial events don’t happen as they did, then perhaps where you are now would change completely as a result. If you push on with this exercise far enough, you’ll get to when your parents met. And if you keep going, you’ll eventually get to ancestors. There is, as should be obvious, no end to the trail. And so it sort of throws the whole question of “cause” out the window. The philosopher Alan Watts talked about this “ancient problem of cause and effect. We believe that every thing and every event must have a cause.” He showed how the problem comes from not seeing the whole picture. We rely too much on our own chosen set of data points. He has a most interesting story in The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, which brings home the point: Here is someone who has never seen a cat. He is looking through a narrow slit in a fence, and, on the other side, a cat walks by. He sees first the head, then the less distinctly shaped furry trunk, and then the tail. Extraordinary! The cat turns round and walks back, and again he sees the head, and a little later the tail. This sequence begins to look like something regular and reliable. Yet again, the cat turns round, and he witnesses the same regular sequence: first the head, and later the tail. Thereupon he reasons that the event head is… ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=718))

- Another demonstration of this that I found quite memorable comes from author William O’Hanlon. I first came across it in Gad Horowitz’s The Book of Radical General Semantics. You have probably heard the old phrase “connecting the dots.” I know financial writers who will sometimes say they help their readers “connect the dots.” Well, you can understand O’Hanlon’s graphic if you keep that old saw in mind. Now, imagine we have 18 dots. We’ve arranged them in six columns and four rows as shown here: ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=783))

- And as Horowitz notes: O’Hanlon’s diagram presupposes that everyone agrees that the dots account for all relevant facts and they all are equally important. However, in the soft sciences, human relations, etc., these criteria are rarely if ever satisfied. Indeed. In the real world, different people will use different dots, or more dots (or fewer). It’s endless. As O’Hanlon’s chart makes clear, no one interpretation is any better or worse than any other. They are all possible, plausible ways to “connect the dots.” ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=792))

- I love the work from the fertile minds of Murray Stahl and Steven Bregman at the money management firm Horizon Kinetics. They have a way of piercing Wall Street’s abstractions and revealing an underlying reality quite different from what you’d expect. In this chapter, we’re going to look at why you can’t trust labels. In Compendium Compilation: Selected Essays Published in 2016 by Murray Stahl, he often shows the dangers of relying on generalizations and labels. We covered this idea earlier, but it’s worth pulling out and considering on its own. Stahl looked at the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF (KOL). This is an ETF made up of a basket of coal companies. Presumably, people who buy this ETF want to get exposure to coal. But as Stahl asks: “Should someone investing in this fund know something about the various companies in order to form a generalized premise about the fund?” My answer would be yes. I can’t buy a bucket of stocks blind. I want to know what’s in the bucket. ETF investors often don’t bother to look. If you look at what’s in KOL, you find some interesting things, as Stahl shows. The idea behind a coal ETF is that it gets you exposure to coal. You’d expect to find coal miners. Jastrzebska Spolka is one coal miner in the index. It mines coal in Poland, most of which stays in Poland. “This is just one company,” Stahl writes. “The fund has 28 holdings. Imagine meeting 28 people about which you know nothing except that they are all employed in the coal mining industry in one capacity or another. Now imagine being asked to make true generalizations about those people as a group.” I’d say that would be very difficult. And I’d also agree that such generalizations would not be worth much. Such is the case with KOL. The companies are all very different. You can see it in the performance of the stocks in the ETF. The Polish stock was up 3.5x in 2016 through July 2016 when Stahl wrote his essay. But another stock in the coal ETF was the oddly named Korean coal firm Kiwi Media, which Stahl points out fell 45%. Beyond performance, many of the stocks in KOL are in widely different businesses. One holding in the ETF was Joy Global, which doesn’t even mine coal, but sells equipment to miners. FreightCar America was also in the coal ETF but doesn’t mine coal either. It ships coal, among other commodities. The point is they are all very different. Is the logic underlying a coal ETF sound?

- So far, we’ve talked about how we abstract from the world around us. And we’ve seen why we should distrust those abstractions and the inferences we draw from them (such as with labels and cause-and-effect analysis). In this chapter, we look at another limitation: our own point of view. As R.D. Carmichael, a physicist, said: “The universe, as known to us, is a joint phenomenon of the observer and the observed.” In other words, you can’t take the observer out of the analysis. Whatever we observe, we observe through the filter of our own nervous system. We cannot forget this important point.

- As Korzybski writes: The question arises, what part in the ‘seeing’ is due to ‘senses,’ and what to ‘mind’? The answer is, that, structurally, the ‘seeing’ is the result of a cyclic interdependent process, which can be split only verbally. In other words, ‘seeing’ is something the whole organism does. The entire human nervous system as an entity ‘sees.’ We’re going to pause here and linger over a point Korzybski makes in that ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1051))

- Keep It Together: Elementalistic Thinking vs. Non-Elementalistic Thinking Korzybski saw the act of splitting verbally what wasn’t split in the nonverbal world as a neurolinguistic flaw. He called it elementalistic thinking. This stands in contrast to non-elementalistic thinking (or el versus non-el). El thinking means you split things verbally that are not split in the non-verbal world. The Oxford English Dictionary (second edition) credits Korzybski with coining this usage of elementalism: The verbal separation into separate concepts or entities of things which cannot be separated empirically or physically, e.g., space and time, body and mind. ‘Mind’ and ‘body’ is a classic example of el thinking. These exist separately only verbally. In the non-verbal world we inhabit, there are no ‘minds’ without ‘bodies.’ The same is true of ‘space’ and ‘time.’ We could add to this list the words ‘observer’ and ‘observed,’ concepts we can separate verbally but that in the non-verbal world are always together. There is no observer or observed without the other. ‘Thoughts’ and ‘feelings’ is another common bit of el thinking. Semanticists like to say thinking-feeling. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1057))

- Investors commonly praise the performance of a CEO by looking at what the stock did under his watch. This is likely misplaced cause and effect at work. But you could also argue that you cannot separate the CEO from his company in this way. El thinking often comes about when we try to find the cause of something. As Martin Levinson, a general semanticist author, writes: Elementalism is involved when we seek the cause of something, unconsciously assuming that there is only one cause. For example, the cause of juvenile delinquency, the cure for cancer, the way to raise children, etc. But most problems in life do not have single antecedents. Causation is typically multi-faceted. Non-el thinking tries to keep together what is together in the non-verbal world, even though our language so easily separates them. So we know now we must consider the observer and the observed. But we shouldn’t stop there either. We have to consider the observer and the observed and the environment. Or, as general semanticists like to say, “the organism as a whole in an environment.” That’s the basic unit of analysis. And the reason is that the environment also impacts the observer and the observed. The point of general semantics, as I see it, is to ‘clean up’ our neurolinguistic processes, to make the world inside our skulls more in tune with the world outside of our skulls. The point Korzybski and his merry band make again and again is that the world outside of our skulls has a structure. And Korzybski’s idea was to make our way of talking and thinking about it match up better with that structure. As he wrote: All that we deal with in the outside world involves indivisibly ‘matter,’ ‘space,’ and ‘time.’ Using the old language, there cannot be something somewhere at ‘no time,’ or something at some ‘time’ and ‘no where’ or ‘nothing’ ‘somewhere’ at ‘some time.’ Everything which happens must be structurally represented as something, somewhere, at some ‘time.’ If the structure of the world happened to be such that ‘nothing’ would happen ‘nowhere’ at ‘no time,’ then we would have nothing to talk about, and all we would or could say would deal with our fancies.

- In a slight twist to what we’ve talked about so far, Heuer shows how we tend to see what we expect to see. And he maintains this is a more important tendency than seeing what we want to see. There are many experiments that show this. One simple one is nearby. (See “You see what you expect to see.” ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1163))

- The vast majority of people, when they see those three triangles, will miss something about them. (Look again. The article is written twice in each of the three phrases.) Our brains automatically and effortlessly seem to make what we see conform to what we expect. That’s interesting, but it has an important corollary principle: “It takes more information, and more unambiguous information, to recognize an unexpected phenomenon than an expected one.” This is no surprise to those of us who have spent time in markets and have held stocks under a certain belief we were slow to change in the face of mounting evidence our view was wrong. It usually takes something of a “shock” to snap us out of our expectation-based reality tunnel. Of course, by then it is often too late. This is really hard to get around, because we need to have some ‘mind-set’ around which we organize the flood of sensory inputs we receive. As Heuer says, ‘mind-sets’ are slow to change; gradual, evolutionary change often passes unnoticed. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1166))

- Again, value has many facets, and what you see is a mirror of what you’re looking for. That’s why I called my presentation “Value is a mirror of itself.” It was a twist on Thomas Schelling’s observation that the universe is a mirror of itself. Meaning, broadly speaking, that what we see reflects what we know, what we expect to see, etc. Clear thinking demands you do not accept the notion of a mystical, objective ‘intrinsic value.’ Instead, you understand that all notions of value have meaning only in comparison to something else. It’s not only that value is relative, but that value is also inseparable from its environment. Price-earnings ratios do not exist in isolation, for example. They exist in an environment, one we must be sure never to forget. ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1267))

- In a certain town, there is a barber who shaves every man who does not shave himself. Does the barber shave himself? How do you solve it? There are many paradoxes like it.

- In this case, the word is “barber.” Weinberg explains: The paradox is unsolvable as long as one assumes that a man is a barber and this can be his only classification. The paradox dissolves when we realize that a man is classified as a barber only when he is barbering other people and that as soon as he barbers himself he is no longer a barber but is now to be classified as a man who shaves himself. If we leave out the category “barber” and just say, “There is a man in town who shaves everyone who does not shave himself,” we are still acting as if the classification is rigid and not man-made. When the man is shaving other people his classification becomes “man who shaves other people.” When he shaves himself, he belongs to another category, “man who shaves himself.”… We must remember that all these classifications are arbitrary and man-made and should be changed when the thing classified or its use changes. This is a great illustration of how we treat a word as a real thing. The paradox does not exist if you see past the idea of barber as a rigid thing that exists-in-the-word and is attached to a thing, as some kind of physical label, and instead see it as an arbitrary definition. If you focus on what you observe, there is no paradox. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1335))

- The Investment Implications of Future Events Are Unknowable – Even When You Know the Future! Here is an example from the marketplace where a seemingly logical assumption fated you to a doomed conclusion. It comes from Michael O’Higgins, the president of O’Higgins Asset Management, an independent, fee-based investment advisory based in Miami. In a July 2016 blog post titled “If We Had a Crystal Ball,” he posed an interesting question about gazing into that crystal ball. He asks you to suppose that on January 31, 2006, you knew with certainty that the price of gold would more than triple over the next five years, from $569 per ounce to $1,900 per ounce. Knowing that, might you have invested in Newmont Mining, the world’s second-largest gold producer? Odds are high that you would have gladly bought Newmont shares. With that kind of surge in the price of gold, buying shares in one of the world’s largest gold companies would seem like a no-brainer. Yet, the share price of Newmont fell 5% over that time. The premise was wrong: A rising gold price doesn’t mean gold mining shares go up. Gold mining shares are businesses. They have costs. They have financing needs. The stocks have valuation multiples, subject to all the whims of the market. A rising gold doesn’t automatically lead to a rise in the price of Newmont shares. O’Higgins ran through several other examples... Suppose that at the start of 1973 you knew that the earnings of the Dow Jones Industrial Average would rise 50% over the next two years. Seems you would bet on the Dow, right? Well, the Dow got cut in half. The premise: rising earnings lead to rising stock prices. Wrong. Again, too many real world variables were left out of the premise. The valuation on those earnings could fall, for example, as they did. Say you could know ahead of time which companies would make money and which would lose money. You’d likely invest in the former. In 1999, the stocks of companies that actually made money declined 2%. Profitless tech startups soared 82%. Premise:… ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1350))

- If you had known all that was going on, you probably would’ve stayed away from Brazilian stocks. Yet, the Brazil iShares ETF was up nearly 60% through July. “Even if we had a crystal ball,” O’Higgins concludes, “the investment implications of future events and conditions are unknowable.” (Remember this next time you hear one of those market pundits telling you what the future holds.) But there are other kinds of logic that can trip us up, too. What if I say: If A is better than B And B is better than C Then A is better than C. Would you agree? It seems entirely logical. In fact, this kind of reasoning has a name: the transitive rule. Ed Thorp writes about this in his book A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market.

- Imagine you hold an apple and say: “There are seeds in this apple.” Is that a statement of fact? Or is it an inference? Knowing the difference between a fact and an inference is an important idea we will explore in this chapter. It seems basic, but as you will see, you know far fewer facts than you think. By the end of this chapter, I hope I’ll have convinced you that’s true. ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1417))

- Summing up, I said: In other words, I can take this apple, and I can say it’s round; I can talk about its color, or how much it costs, and so on… These are things that can be observed. But if I say there are seeds in this apple, I go beyond what can be observed. I can’t see whether there are seeds in this apple. To do that, I have to cut open the apple. Another way to think about it, as for certainty that there are seeds in this apple: Would you bet your life? I wouldn’t. The odds are very great, and it’s very probable… but you can’t be certain. It’s probably obvious to you now that there isn’t all that much we know for certain. As investors, we deal mostly with inferences. Therefore, it may help us to think in terms of a continuum. On one end is near certainty – ‘facts,’ as we call them. And on the other end of the spectrum are wild guesses. In between lie varying degrees of certainty. This mirrors more closely the real world, as all inferences are not equal; some are better than others. (And we don’t want to get too hung up on our own definitions, which are arbitrary anyway.) Thinking in this way brings a few ready benefits: ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1461))

- It’s harder to be dogmatic. If you are less sure of what you know and are less enamored with what other people call ‘facts,’ then you are less likely to get stuck asserting something that turns out not to be true. You are more likely to change your mind, as you are more open to the idea that you can be proved wrong. The great fear of many investors is that they become so wed to their ‘facts’ that they can’t see when they are wrong. Bill Ackman provides what is perhaps a famous case study here, where he rode Valeant down more than 90% from its peak even as his thesis crumbled. You are more open to expect the unexpected. After all, if you have no particular commitment to inferences – understanding their limitations – you are open to the idea that new observations can better them, or provide a surprise. We can’t help but make inferences. I do not want to leave you with the impression that we should not make inferences, or that we should not rely on them.

- When I made my speech, I was at a hotel in Delray Beach, Florida. I inferred that the stage upon which I spoke would support my weight. I also inferred that the roof would not collapse on me and that the water provided would not kill me. I could not verify all these things ahead of time. However, these inferences were high-quality inferences, you might say. Therefore, this brings us naturally to the idea of standards. What standard will you use to verify your ‘facts’? This is actually a complex question. Let us run through an example inspired by a very similar one Weinberg used in his book. Suppose there is a table. You use a tape measure and declare it is 30 inches high. Is that a fact? It would seem so, but… on what standard? Suppose a friend came along with an electronic instrument accurate to 1/1000th of an inch. He declares the height of the table is actually 30.019 inches. Is that a fact? And does that mean that your measurement is no longer a fact? Of course, you could get even more ‘accurate’ measurements. Even then, you’ll run into problems. Eventually, you get down to the molecular level. Then you find that your sharp-edged table is actually a cloud of ever-moving molecules – and where is the edge of a cloud? ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1490))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Weinberg writes: What, then, is the ‘real’ height of the table? Our answer is that there is no such thing. It is a meaningless question because, as of this date, there is no possible way, actual or imaginable, to arrive at an answer. The table is 30 inches high. The table is 30.019 inches high. Both are correct; both are accurate; both are factual statements. Nor do they contradict, for two different standards are used. Which standard you select depends on what you are doing. For most purposes, the 30 inches from your tape measure is good enough. But we could imagine more scenarios where we’d need more exacting standards. The other lesson here is that observation alone may not establish a fact. We need to know by what standard. If someone told you the table was 30 inches high, your next question would be, “How do you know?” All Statements About the Future Are Inferences… But So Are Statements About the Past When you really sit and think about this stuff, even things you might take for granted you start to question, or at least hold with a softer grip. For example, all statements about the future must be inferences by nature. You can’t observe the future. But all events about the past are also inferences – except those based on actual observation by you (or the speaker or writer as the case may be). This gets a little difficult to understand at first. After all, this means that when you sit down and read history, you’re reading a collection of inferences. History is a mixture of guesses, hunches, based on evidence of varying grades of quality selected by the historian and similar evidence rejected by that historian who is, let us not forget, a fallible human being with a reality tunnel that colors all he or she sees (and doesn’t see). Thus, things you normally would say in knee-jerk fashion are ‘facts’ are, on closer inspection, inferences. There is a famous story involving professor Weinberg that illustrates this point well. He was teaching a course in general semantics in the 1960s. On the day of our story, he was trying to get his students to understand the difference between a fact and an inference, as we’ve just done.

- At one point, he offered his class the following example: “Fact or inference: John F. Kennedy is president of the United States.” The class shouted, “Fact!” And Weinberg said, “No!” He pointed out again the difference between a fact and inference, using the same basic schematic as Irving Lee’s that I used above. “We’ve all been in class for almost an hour. Who’s to say as a matter of fact that John Kennedy is president of the United States? It is an inference, although a highly probable one. He might have resigned, his back pain may have incapacitated him, he might even have been killed. Such a statement is not one of fact.” As the story goes, class ended shortly after noon. The date was November 22, 1963. And the students all learned, in a visceral way, what Weinberg meant to teach them. Getting mixed up and believing your inferences without question can have serious consequences. (“Suppose the Trojans had checked that wooden horse?” Weinberg asks.) Much of the drama around literature and movies hangs around some kind of faulty inference. But now so armed with the ideas in this chapter, you too will be sensitive to the differences between facts and inferences. You will be more careful about what you know and what you assume. Lee in his “Talking Sense” speech told a wonderful story involving President Eliot of Harvard, about this idea of being careful about what you assume and what you know: Eliot entered a crowded NY restaurant and handed his hat to the doorman. After lunch, he goes to leave. As he came out he was astonished to see the doorman promptly pick out his hat from the hundreds that were there and hand it to him. “How did you know that hat was my hat?” Eliot asked. “I didn’t know it was your hat, sir,” said the doorman. “Why, then, did you hand it to me?” And the doorman very courteously replied, “Because, sir, you handed it to me.” President Eliot was delighted with this precise delimitation of what the doorman saw and what he assumed. That is the kind of thinking I have been trying to cultivate in myself and in which, through this book, I am trying to impart on you.

- In markets, it does not take much imagination to see where you could go wrong relying on intensional definitions. We’ve already seen numerous examples in this book to back this point: an entertainment and leisure ETF full of airlines (and no Disney), a homebuilder ETF with non-homebuilder stocks, and companies with “dot com” in their name that were not really internet properties, etc. It may be impossible to be purely extensional, and you wouldn’t want to be. Both definitions have their uses. But it does seem our society skews heavily toward the intensional definition. And you can see clearly where extensional thinking would be an aid to clarity. Almost all of our labels are intensional as such. When we describe a stock as a biotech, utility, bank, retailer, miner, insurer, or media company, we rely on intensional definitions. But we have all run across stocks that have a certain label but functionally are closer to something very different.

- “No one can be conscious of abstracting all the time, not even me and I wrote the book!” ~ Alfred Korzybski Careless inattention to big, abstract words may have helped foster the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as Harold Evans contends. Evans edited The Sunday Times and The Times of London. In 2001, his peers voted him the greatest British newspaper editor of all time. In 2004, he was knighted. In 2017, at the age of 88, he published Do I Make Myself Clear? Why Writing Well Matters. The book is well worth your time if you do any writing at all. But for our purposes, Chapter 10, titled “Money and Words,” holds a provocative thesis. It gets to the heart of why language matters. Evans maintains that the Great Recession – that epic bust of 2008, the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s – had roots in words “to an extent not commonly appreciated.” There was “no common name and no comparable scrutiny for the new banking beasts in an unpoliced jungle inhabited by a wild menageries of money managers who borrowed short, lent long, and repackaged risky loans as bonds.” Words performed their magic and held people in their spells. “Triple-A” meant safe. But few dug behind the simple words and definition to get at the thing itself. CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), SIVs (structured investment vehicles), monoline financial guarantors, credit derivative products, etc.… Or the idea that, as we mentioned before, “housing prices never go down.” As The Washington Post reported: Countless delusions and mistakes brought on our financial crisis, but none did as much damage as the belief that home prices never go down. People have long seen real estate as a safe investment. The notion is intuitive – the supply of land is limited, and the population is always growing – and until 2007, national home prices had not fallen significantly since the Great Depression.

Take this description of what a company does, from the company itself: “[XYZ] designs, procures, and executes branded marketing materials and retail experiences for the world’s leading brands.” This example is not the worst I could find. But it’s typical, loaded with abstractions. What are “marketing materials”? And what does it mean to “execute” them? Why not just be specific and say “we design, procure and make advertising flyers, signs, and billboards.” And how about that term “retail experiences”? That’s like flying a big flag saying, “We’re trying to make it sound like we do something way more impressive than what we actually do.” ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1673))

He may give a short talk, and then he takes questions. This can go on for hours. It is called a satsang. In finance, there are similar performances. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting is akin to a satsang. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger sit up on a stage and take questions for hours.

- A price-earnings ratio for such a portfolio would be meaningless. Say we have a two-stock portfolio. The price-earnings ratio of the bank stock we own is 12 and the price-earnings ratio of a fast-growing tech name is 30. The average is 21. So what? It means nothing. The two companies are very different. You can’t average unalike things in this way. It’s an abuse of math. You can’t take the price you paid for an apple and the price you paid for a car and expect an average of the two to mean anything. It’s the same with stocks. The idea here is that we need to think about our questions before we try to answer them. Remember we talked about logical fate? The same holds true here. If you ask a poorly structured question, you won’t get a good answer. As a society we spend a lot of time on how to give answers. We spend less time learning to formulate a question. To start, we need a way to sort different types of questions. ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1724))

At the moment, I’ll just say this is an example of a question that is not operational/extensional because it deals with the future. I can’t get the answer. It is a speculative question, and a silly one at that. Speculative questions are those that have no reliable answers. Investors spend an inordinate amount of time and energy thinking up these questions and trying to answer them. Stop spending so much time trying to figure out where the market is going to go, or what interest rates are going to do, or what the Fed’s next move is. And yet… Not all speculative questions are so horrible. We need speculative questions, because they can lead us on a path to other questions. Maybe we ask ourselves, “Gee, shipping stocks are down 90%. Have we hit bottom in the shipping industry?” Now, we can’t know that for sure without the benefit of hindsight. It’s a speculative question. But it may lead us to do more work on shipping stocks and fish around for ‘value’ there.

These are questions that come from, in Pula’s analogy, “the darkest cave… unlit by consciousness of abstracting.” Included here would be questions that assume assertions of paranoia. Pula gives an example: “‘Why is that man looking at me that way?’” I get questions along these lines, too, usually from people who exhibit extreme fears of government: “If the government is going to confiscate IRAs, why should I buy this stock in my IRA as you suggest?” There are many variations on this theme.

It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication or reflection. The fact of the matter is that the ‘real world’ is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. … We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.” ~ Edward Sapir (1884-1939), anthropologist-linguist ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1818))

(You’ll find it at the start of this chapter.) In this paper, Whorf has some interesting examples he pulled from his work at Hartford Fire. Whorf studied hundreds of reports on how fires got started. He saw that sometimes a “linguistic meaning” had a role to play. He wrote about gasoline drums, which, so labeled, were handled with great care. However, when labeled in the mind as “empty gasoline drums,” people tended to get careless. The drums are empty, after all. Yet empty gasoline drums are perhaps more dangerous because they contain explosive vapor. He fingered the linguistic meanings embedded in the word “empty,” which suggest a “lack of hazard,” among other things.

A worker, thinking it “a pool of water,” lit a blow torch and threw his match in the “water.” But the gas emitted from the pool lingered under the roof and the flare of flame ignited it, the woodwork, and eventually, the adjoining building. Whorf writes: Such examples, which could be greatly multiplied, will suffice to show how the cue to a certain line of behavior is often given by the analogies of the linguistic formula in which the situation is spoken of, and by which to some degree it is analyzed, classified, and allotted its place in that world which is ‘to a large extent unconsciously built upon the language habits of the group.’ Sapir and Whorf became most associated with this idea that language impacts thought, hence the idea became known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Korzybski, our epistemological knight-errant, found much that he liked in Whorf’s work. Korzybski recognized Whorf’s work (and… ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1866))

- There is little doubt Korzybski thought the hypothesis had merit. He included the idea in his last paper, “The Role of Language in the Perceptual Processes.” He wrote: We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an habitual language has. It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves us… and that the structure which a language exhibits, and impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically projected upon the world around us. Enslaves us. Strong stuff. If we aim to clarify our thinking, we must realize the hold language has on us and not let the embedded assumptions pass unexamined.

- Indeed, there is something about the unsayable, the silent level – or what Korzybski called the “unspeakable objective level.” This is where we live. This is where we have our primary experience. It comes before speech. In this chapter, you’ll see the benefits of tapping this silent level. ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1910))

- You may recall, in an earlier chapter, our discussion of the structural differential. Flip back to the picture of that model. You can see in that model how our first verbalizing of the “Event” is an abstraction, strained of countless details. I’ll say it again: You need to know that the verbal world is not the world out there, an idea which gets to the heart of non-A orientations generally. The word “chair” is not the thing you sit in. The “stock” is not the company out there in the real world with people and assets and customers and debts, etc. If you stub your toe, you feel certain sensations. If you put those into words, you cannot capture those sensations. The words will be different; they are not the experience. As Korzybski said, “Whatever you say it is, it isn’t.” The ‘map’ is not the ‘territory.’ The ‘menu’ is not the ‘meal.’ We can put lots of things into words but not capture the thing itself. Jonas, in her Aeon piece cited above, offers her own example: She knows how to play the violin. But if she tried to verbalize how to play the violin, you would not be able to play it yourself as a result of listening to her. There is an acquired ‘know-how’ at the unspeakable level that you only gain through experience. “Similarly,” she writes, “I could try to explain the colour red to you, in terms of the latest scientific theories about wave-lengths, retina receptors and human colour-perception. But no matter how comprehensive my description, phenomenal knowledge can’t be passed on through language.” Jonas mentions the philosopher Thomas Nagel’s famous paper, “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” Her reference made me re-read it. Nagel makes the case that it is impossible for us to gain a real understanding of what it is like to be a bat. Bats perceive the world in a way we can only describe with words – such as describing how sonar works. Try as we might, we can’t experience what it is like to be a bat. “If I try to imagine this,” Nagel writes, “I am restricted to the resources of my own mind, and those resources are inadequate to the task.” Again, we can talk about a bat. But we can’t experience what a bat experiences. In fact, we don’t need to talk about bats. We can talk about people. None of us experiences the world in quite the same way. You can watch a movie or read a book or witness an accident or value a stock… and your view will be different than someone else’s in many ways, sometimes in critically important ways. And putting that full experience into words is impossible. You can only fall short. For example, this is a real review of a beer posted on the site BeerAdvocate, and it is by no means atypical: Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, ginger, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, honey, brown sugar, toasted oats, biscuit, herbal, floral, pepper, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast, pale… ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1912))

- Understanding You Can Only Grasp Non-Verbally Korzybski was not the first to recognize this. Zen, for example, is all about the unsayable. (And several writers have noted the affinity between Zen and general semantics.) Zen teaches liberation by “pointing,” using puzzles (kōans), not analysis and discussion. “The fundamental position of Zen is that it has nothing to say,” Watts wrote in Psychotherapy East & West. “The blue hills are simply blue hills / The white clouds are simply white clouds.” There is an understanding that is beyond the verbal level, indeed that can only be reached nonverbally. This means, perhaps, that this chapter will be short… Seriously, though, the main idea here is simply to think more about what is happening than how we describe it. This is extremely hard to do. As U.G. Krishnamurti – a thinker we will hear more from later – pointed out, it is hard to look at anything without… ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1947))

- You can find this out for yourself. Try this exercise from Bruce Kodish: Spend the next few minutes letting sounds from your surroundings come to you. Notice any tendency to label what you hear or talk to yourself in any other way. How well can you put aside these labels and bring yourself back to the sounds? … Eventually one can begin to construct these kinds of sensing experiments and ask sense-able questions for oneself. There are endless experiments to do. Sensory awareness can be done anywhere, anytime: while waiting in lines, for a bus or in traffic, sitting in a lecture or at your computer keyboard, etc. Trying to stay silent is a lot harder than it sounds. I urge you to try it. I like to go for long walks or jogs. And I’ve tried at times to just absorb the sights and sounds around me without verbalizing internally what I see and hear. It is hard. But there is a benefit to the exercise. For one thing, I’ve learned you appreciate how much is going on – you pick up on sights and sounds you otherwise pay no attention to. You start to look at the world with a sense of wonder. Experiencing the silent level in this way also makes it easier to absorb and understand the ideas in this book. You know the word is not the thing, at a visceral level. General semanticists in the Korzybskian tradition have long been fans of the silent level. Irving Lee dedicated a chapter in one of his books to it, titled “When to ‘Keep Still.’” He succinctly summed up the benefit of the silent level: “An understanding of this silent universe will help dissolve the false-to-fact character of our limited, too-often dogmatic talk.” It’s easy to talk. It’s harder to be silent. It’s harder to just ‘take things in.’ The world out there is far richer and more complex than our language can convey. And it is limiting to label something and let those labels dictate what you see… ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=1957))

- Silence Transcends Speech “Silence is so accurate.” ~ Mark Rothko (1903-1970), painter Sages and wise men have long known the value of silence. It’s a cultural cliché: the bearded holy man on the mountain sitting in deep meditation. Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950), the famed Indian teacher of the last century, often sat in silence when people visited him at his ashram. Much like with Abramović, visitors would have powerful experiences in that silence. But such experience doesn’t require any mystical faith. Ramana Maharshi was wise to the ways of the world, and there are many quotes I could share that fit with the core ideas in this book. For example: Q: What is reality? A: It is not with forms and names. That which underlies these is the reality. … It transcends speech.” Ramana Maharshi asked, “How does speech arise?” First you have to abstract from the reality you perceive around you. This gives rise to a thought, which in turn becomes a word. Ramana Maharshi used to say, “the word is the great-grandson of the original source.” Korzybski would’ve approved.

- Even something like your desk changes slightly from minute to minute. It may look like the same desk, but if you left it there for 20 years, you’d see the effects of an aging process. It didn’t happen overnight. Nothing remains the same. Despite the seeming obviousness of this, investors have made the opposite view the epitome of wisdom. Thus the old phrase attributed to John Templeton: “The four most expensive words in the English language are, ‘This time it’s different.’” Investors will frequently mock or deride a case for an investment by using Templeton’s phrase, “This time is different,” in a sarcastic way. As if to say, “You nut, don’t you see this is the same basic pattern we’ve seen before? This time is no different!” Of course this time is different. This time is always different. And every time is always different from every other time. Episodes may seem similar on the surface or in certain important ways, but there are countless details that are different from prior episodes. And you cannot be sure those details don’t matter. To blithely wave them away with a snarky reference to Templeton’s maxim seems foolish at best. ([Location 2027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2027))

- Investor Thomas Russo likes to give another analogy. He talks about visiting a 700-year-old temple in Japan. It is made of wood and none of the wood is 700 years old, as pieces have been replaced multiple times over the years. But we talk about the temple as if it is 700 years old. In markets, we see the effect of change in many similar ways. Consider the S&P 500, one of the most frequently cited market indexes. Did you know that prior to 1976, there were no financial companies in the index? In 1976, Standard & Poor’s changed the rules and replaced 60 companies in the index, adding financials. There were also major changes after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, in which 56 companies were swapped out. On average, over the last 50 years, 20-plus companies are swapped out each year.

- That’s a lot of big changes. The S&P 500 of 2000 is not the same as the S&P 500 of 2017, even though our language infers that it is. We say, “The S&P 500 trades at a premium above its 10-year average.” But the S&P 500 today is different than the S&P 500 of 10 years ago, five years ago, etc. We even treat the companies as if they were the same. But Berkshire Hathaway of 2016 is markedly different than the Berkshire Hathaway of 2000. ([Location 2075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2075))

- I see readers of mine do this all the time, as I’ve mentioned before, and it causes them to make obvious mistakes and close off certain ideas because they harbor outmoded thoughts about it. Readers chafed at the idea of investing in AIGJune 2016 because they couldn’t get AIG2008 out of their heads. But AIG June 2016 proved a good investment and was up 34% by the end of the year. This works well with people, too. My view of Bill Ackman2014, when Pershing Square returned a net 40% gain to investors, is quite a bit different than my view of Bill Ackman2015 after Valeant – the notorious pharmaceutical company – collapsed and his fund delivered a net loss of 20%. By dating my thinking, I set a reminder that Bill Ackman is not the same every year. And also important, by dating, I see that it makes no sense to have a commitment to my view. Just because I thought Ackman was a great investor in 2014 does not mean I have to stand by that view today. This same logic works wonderfully for countries, objects of any sort, ideas, statements, etc. This is what Korzybski meant when he said dating would abolish “dogmatism and absolutism.” Part of the idea behind general semantics is to use language that better fits the world as it is. By dating, we explicitly recognize our world as an ongoing process. It flows, like Heraclitus’ river. It’s always changing.

- No two things exist exactly alike. Yet, in investing and in life, the language we use often strongly implies otherwise. We seem to do this frequently with people. We’ll refer to ‘immigrants,’ ‘Muslims,’ ‘consumers,’ ‘truck drivers,’ ‘Wal-Mart employees,’ ‘brokers,’ and on and on. We use these classifications thoughtlessly, not considering if there is an established norm of some kind that makes the classification meaningful. ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2141))
    - Tags: [[whorf sapir]] 
- When you adopt a non-A orientation, you see that the common idea of a ‘norm’ simply disappears. We’ve already dealt with some of the most obvious ways we do this in financial markets. For example, the way we talk about ‘stocks’ as if they were all the same. The way we talk about specific classifications, such as coal stocks, obscures many important differences among the stocks we blanket with such a category, differences that manifest in widely varying performance. Korzybski gave us a simple tool to remedy this: the index. This is something he took from mathematics. You may remember using symbols such as x1, x2, and x3. This is a mathematician’s way of showing that the variable ‘x’ can be one number in one instance and another number in another instance. In other words, x1 does not equal x2. (I realize subscripts have other uses in mathematics, but for our purposes, this is the relevant usage.) Likewise, when we say, “She is a fundamentalist, just like Jane,” we should realize that “fundamentalist1” does not equal “fundamentalist2.” They are different. Using an index allows you to still recognize both as part of a classification (‘fundamentalist’) but not smother the individual identity of each. Horowitz writes eloquently about this, and I quote him here: The formulation “she is a fundamentalist,” without indexing, forces our attention exclusively onto what (we think) all fundamentalists have in common as members of the class. The index is Dr. K’s gentle soothing remedy, guiding our attention to this fundamentalist here, whom we can hear, see, etc. with who we can converse, emphasize, etc. The index politely invites us to relate to this one in her specificity… And to revise and enrich our concept of fundamentalist. The index pushes back on our tendency to make sweeping generalizations about a class or category. Instead of allowing the generalization to pass unquestioned, the index flags it. Whatever we may say about a person generally by making a deduction based on a classification, we know nothing about this person specifically. We use indexing extensively already in many areas of life. We use them in house numbers. Not just a house, but house number 14. Not just any driver’s license or phone, but this specific license number and this specific phone number. What general semanticists propose is to use indexing whenever we talk about classifications or categories. Remember, a core idea behind general semantics is to be conscious of your abstractions and your abstracting, to be aware of your generalizations. Practice with the index helps the idea seep deeper into your psyche. Eventually, thinking this way will become second nature. Then you won’t make such a mistake as assuming acre1 equals acre2, which is what investors in real estate and natural resource companies do all the time. St. Joe is a classic example of how this mistake occurs. St. Joe is a real estate company based in Florida. It owns over 600,000 acres of land in Florida in the… ([Location 2149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2149))

- The Chain Index So, that’s the value of the index. There is an extension of the index called the chain index. What this does is put the subject in an environment, or a context.

In this case, using a chain index we ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2209))

He is willing to consider varying points of views, to look at different angles, to consider different narratives, to explore ideas without dogmatic commitment. But he drops a bunch of IQ points when talking about politics. When it comes to his politics, his point of view is affirmed by “biological reality” (a favorite phrase) and “accepted by science” and “backed up by facts.” His thinking becomes remarkably rigid. The transformation is quite striking. Friend1 talking about investing is not friend1 talking about politics. ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B1MYKS4&location=2214))
