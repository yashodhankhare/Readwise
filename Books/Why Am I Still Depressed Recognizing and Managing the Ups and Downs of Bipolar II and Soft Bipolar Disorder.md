- Of course, very low mood, energy, and motivation, as in official Major Depression, can also be a severe condition. Treatment with antidepressant medications is often very helpful for that. So what is this variation where antidepressants can make things worse? Whereas depression alone causes symptoms such as low energy, low mood, and low motivation, this type of bipolar disorder includes all these and some additional complicating factors. As I mentioned previously, these factors can be symptoms such as agitation, irritability, difficulty sleeping, or rapid, unstoppable thoughts. They can also include dramatic swings in mood or energy. Sometimes there is a complicated family background of mood and anxiety symptoms, or many relatives with alcohol problems. Sometimes there may be repeated episodes of depression that end on their own or for which antidepressants work temporarily but then stop working. One of the most important markers is depression that keeps coming back. Most people with true Major Depression will have one or two episodes in a lifetime.

- repeated brief episodes, two or three months long or less, is more likely to be a form of bipolar disorder. Any of these additional symptoms or signs should raise the possibility that you are dealing with something more complicated than Major Depression. However, notice that we're still talking just about depression, plus some other symptoms. We are not talking about "going crazy," manic, psychotic, or losing control of your behavior. But we are talking about an extremely common mood problem. Some mood experts think it might be about one-third of all versions of depression. The good news is that we have well-known treatments, which often can work as well or better than antidepressants for these bipolar variations. The bad news is that there is tremendous confusion about these variations as a diagnosis. The very doctors whom you'll need to see for treatment sometimes can't agree on what you have. If you get the wrong diagnosis, you can get the wrong treatment, which can actually make your symptoms worse. There is so much confusion about this condition that some doctors are starting to worry that it is being overdiagnosed, though the evidence suggests it is being significantly underdiagnosed.

- Antidepressant medications can make bipolar disorder worse. They can cause people to have a manic episode, including not only the positive, or euphoric, version where you feel "on top of the world," very confident, and full of potential, but also the negative, or dysphoric, version where you feel agitated and angry, and believe that the people around you are stupid, slow, and pathetic.

- There is a term for this way of thinking about models, such as the DSM versus the Mood Spectrum, called heuristics. In plain English, it means something like this: Make an educated guess, and see how it works. Try a certain way of thinking or looking at a problem. If using that guess or model seems to lead to better outcomes, keep using it. If not, try another. The next section explains how the Mood Spectrum concept is a useful tool in just this way.

- The Mood Spectrum: Just a Different Way of Thinking In the DSM mode of thinking, making an accurate diagnosis requires determining whether the patient with depression symptoms is unipolar or bipolar, whereas in the Mood Spectrum approach, we clinicians don't ask what might be the most accurate label for you. Instead, we ask where might your symptoms lie on the Mood Spectrum. The Bipolar Clinic at Harvard's teaching hospital recently began using a system like this, which they call the Bipolarity Index. Instead of saying "yes" or "no" as to whether you might have a bipolar disorder, they try to determine how much bipolarity you have. (More about the Bipolarity Index appears in Chapter 3.) But just in case you're starting to feel lost in all the lingo and ways of thinking, remember this. Your diagnosis has two main functions:   1. To help guide you to effective treatment 2. To offer some clues about your future (such as, Will this go away? How bad could it get? Will it come again? or Might my children get it?) Some people can find themselves in the middle of a debate between doctors about what they have, where neither diagnostic function is occurring. Unfortunately, as you may have experienced, this unipolar-or-bipolar debate can become quite intense. When doctors disagree, the patient can be stuck in the middle, which is never good. If that happens, everyone needs to relax and remember that diagnoses are merely best estimates of reality, not reality itself. Diagnoses are heuristic: they are ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=291))

- Thus with a Mood Spectrum way of looking at things, one can have "a little bipolarity." While this might strike you as strange, it's what this very chapter is about—so read on. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=310))

- The trick is to remember that manic episodes can be a very negative experience. Roughly half the time that people are manic, the experience is not euphoric, or full of great confidence, joy, hope, and pleasure, but dysphoric, where people experience most sensory input as harsh and unpleasant (lights are too bright, noises are too loud); their thoughts are rapid, intense, and often extremely negative and angry; and they find other people to be too slow, stupid, and irritating. This is also true in hypomania. Many clinicians think that patients like their hypomania and will conceal it, or even fail to recognize it as abnormal. This may be somewhat true for subtle forms of hypomania, but much less so for severe hypomania. People do indeed recognize their agitation, insomnia, and acceleration. When they find something that makes it stop, they are generally very inclined to stick with that solution (managing alcohol or avoiding late night light, as discussed in Chapter 11, or using mood stabilizers, which are discussed in Chapter 8), unless the solution comes with significant problems of its own. Fortunately, clinicians now have many treatment options and can often find one that does not place the patient in this dilemma of choosing between symptoms and side effects.

- entire collection of bipolar variations that do not make themselves obvious through mania. As noted earlier, obvious symptoms are more likely to be recognized by multiple observers, creating a hard finding that can anchor efforts at diagnosis. By contrast, less obvious symptoms leave clinicians basing a patient's diagnosis on less firm ground, thus the term soft bipolar. This term is sometimes used quite generally to refer to any bipolar variant where the data supporting the diagnosis are not hard, or easily recognized and agreed upon. I hope you're already concluding that making a firm diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be very difficult, and similarly, that firmly ruling out bipolarity may be even more difficult. What is a diagnostician—or you—to do? One defense against this confusion is to learn more about bipolar variations, as presented in the next two chapters.

- Using our drill cores from Figure 2.2, we can ask what hypomania looks like between points A and B—between "not present" and "mild." Here lies nearly all the controversy about the bipolar disorder diagnosis. Here's the problem: remember from Chapter 1 that when Dr. Benazzi looked, he could not find a biologic step-down, a real biologic dividing line, between bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder. (This is shown as the smooth tapering of the ramp of hypo-mania in Figure 2.1.) Imagine there was a dividing point between hypomania and no hypomania at all. Then we could say, "Everyone to the right of this point has bipolar disorder, and everyone to the left of this point does not." But this does not appear to be the case. Instead, in clinical practice we see patients all along a gradual slope of hypomania—all the way to zero. Perhaps this slope actually makes more sense than thinking of bipolar disorder as clearly either there or not there. Bipolar disorder is defined by a collection of symptoms and behaviors. When these are extreme, they are clearly abnormal, but when they are mild, they are part of normal human experience. Irritability, confidence, agitation, great joy, decreased sleep, and a rapid flow of ideas are all common human experiences—unless they are extreme. So besides the DSM-driven need to make an illness either clearly there or clearly not there, why should there be an obvious dividing line between normal and abnormal? This idea of a gradual transition between normal and abnormal is consistent with current thinking about how certain genes might cause bipolar disorder. Briefly, the model says that getting a small dose of some of the bipolar genes leads to creativity, charisma, and willingness to take risks, but a big dose leads to bipolar disorder itself. There appear to be many such genes—at least eight or so. Each could differ in several ways from the genes found in families with no bipolar disorder. If there are at least eight genes (some researchers think there may be many more) with different versions of each, the various combinations could lead to many different personality styles and behaviors. Some combinations might look just a little different from the behaviors of the average person (whoever that is), but not be clearly abnormal. Other combinations might look rather unusual, but not interfere with function to the point where the person needs treatment. You see? Abnormal is an arbitrary point along a continuum of styles and behaviors that when extreme are recognized as illness. Well then, where is normal? Good point—we'll get to that in the next chapter. First, let's add another piece to our Mood Spectrum model, one that explains much of the diagnostic confusion about bipolar disorder.

- Unusual periods of sleepiness lasting most of the day, accompanied by extremely low motivation and profound fatigue, may mark a more "bipolar" depression. But depression by itself will not identify where a person lies on the Mood Spectrum. Depression is by far the predominant symptom in bipolar disorder of all kinds, but especially in the middle of the spectrum. This is shown in Figure 2.3. In this study, patients were found to have symptoms about half the time. In Bipolar I, depression accounted for about two-thirds of that symptomatic time. But in Bipolar II, over 90 percent of time spent ill was due to depression. Bipolar disorder in the middle of the Mood Spectrum is experienced almost entirely as depression! Manic-side symptoms account for only a very small fraction of the experience. Thus in the Mood Spectrum model, think of the wedge of hypomania as an iceberg in a sea of depression symptoms. In the middle of the spectrum (official DSM Bipolar II), only a small tip of hypomania sticks up above the waves of depression. And farther down the spectrum toward the unipolar end, it is effectively obscured by the depressive symptoms. To find the vanishing point, where hypomania finally isn't there at all, one has to search underneath the sea of depressive symptoms. You may recall that the official distinction between bipolar and unipolar, if one uses a DSM system, is based on the presence or the absence of hypomania. However, anyone wishing to establish that hypomania isn't there will have to use a snorkel, as well as a magnifying glass! Thus we arrive at our final version of the spectrum model, shown in Figure 2.4. This is the one I want you to remember.

- present, we have serious diagnostic confusion, as evidenced by a recent national presentation by some of the most respected mood experts in the United States. In a webcast presented by Harvard faculty, with an audience of hundreds of psychiatrists, doctors' different diagnostic approaches emerged while examining a case study of a man with clear symptoms of depression, as well as anger, anxiety, sleep problems, and alcohol use. Even after the Harvard experts had arrived at a unipolar diagnosis, two-thirds of the audience felt the patient was best diagnosed as bipolar. At minimum, this example shows that even when presented with exactly the same diagnostic information and even when assisted by mood experts offering diagnostic guidance, psychiatrists can end up disagreeing about fundamental mood diagnoses. In Chapter 4 we'll look at how this diagnostic confusion might affect your… ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=572))

- This is another example of the "uncertainty principle" of bipolar diagnosis: the harder you look, the more uncertain you get. Imagine trying help a patient nail down whether the emotion of irritability really lasted long enough to justify a diagnosis of hypo-mania. Is an hour arguing with your spouse sufficient? Most of us would probably think not. How about an hour with no provocation at all, where the anger comes out of nowhere and seems very extreme, such as yelling at the kids for no reason at all? If you have frequent mood swings that also show up in other ways, this example of anger could be interpreted as hypomanic—but one certainly hopes for something more than just this to establish bipolarity.

- Most psychiatrists would not consider bipolarity with only this example of anger to support it. But what if there was another hint of bipolarity, such as a relative with mood symptoms that sound very bipolar but have no such diagnosis? You can see the problem here. If we clinicians base our diagnoses on a symptom that can have such different lengths, we would have to admit we are doomed to disagreement. What can a doctor or a patient do to deal with this realm of uncertainty? As you read earlier, turning to a rule-based system to make diagnoses consistent sometimes ends up creating disagreement among doctors. Faced with all this confusion and disagreement, what are you, the patient, supposed to do? First, let's look at one more aspect of bipolar disorder where the Mood Spectrum model may be useful.

- In this chapter we have repeatedly faced the same problem: there are no clear dividing lines. Whether we seek to divide unipolar from bipolar, hypomania from brief mood shifts, mixed states from milder anxiety and depression combinations, or adolescence from a bipolar mixed state, we find no place to divide the pairs without doing so arbitrarily.

- The DSM, driven in part by research necessity, emphasizes drawing a line somewhere to characterize ideal types that can provide a common language for doctors, therapists, patients, and families. But as you've seen, many patients lie in the fuzzy realm between clear bipolarity and clear unipolarity, and in between brief emotions and long mood episodes. Before I show you how you can use all this information in making your diagnosis, you should know about one more set of Mood Spectrum variations. Sorry, I know you're anxious to get on with things, but remember: your best defense against a diagnostic misunderstanding is for you yourself to understand the many possible variations in bipolar disorder. The next chapter presents one of the trickiest concepts yet: how you can be "a little bipolar" without any hypomania or mania at all.

- 1. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), or winter blues, is much more common in Bipolar II than in the general population. 2. PMS is much more common in women with seasonal affective disorder than in those whose mood does not shift in the winter. In one recent study, 46 percent of women with SAD had severe PMS, whereas in women without SAD, only 2 percent had severe PMS. The association has been shown in the other direction as well: in women with PMS, 38 percent had seasonal affective disorder; by comparison, in those without PMS, only 8 percent had SAD. 3. Both PMS and seasonal affective disorder have atypical symptoms, which as you know from this chapter are associated with bipolarity.

- Are these mild states mental illnesses? Once again the labels run the risk of causing more trouble than they solve. Everyone knows that the phrase "mentally ill" casts a dark shadow. No one wants that thrown over them. The phrase itself is so tarnished by its history, we psychiatrists have been avoiding it for years. (For example, we have "mental health" or "behavioral health" programs.) ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=875))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When people ask me if I think they are mentally ill, I try to reframe the entire question in different language. If no clear dividing line exists between "normal" and "clearly ill," how do psychiatrists decide who to treat? That turns out to be pretty easy. First of all, we clinicians can only treat those who come to see us—that's a big hurdle. You can almost assume that anyone who gets as far as my office may be worth treating—although, of course, treatment is entirely up to the person, at least in the case of mild to moderate symptoms. (Severe symptoms may pose risks to the person or others, and then the issue of who needs treatment becomes much more complex.) But the cutoff we clinicians really use is this: how much do the symptoms interfere with life? Some pretty dramatic symptoms may be present, but if you are coping with them so well that you don't really create much trouble, then there is probably little reason to take the risks or spend the time and money to be treated by a psychiatrist. Granted, "create much trouble" is pretty vague. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation, perhaps just shifting the gray zone of "who to treat?" to different language. But it beats "mentally ill," don't you think? ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=877))

- There are no lab tests for psychiatric diagnoses. Because we psychiatrists still have no biologic underpinnings for our diagnoses, doctors in other medical disciplines continue to view us with a mixture of scorn, pity, or relief (relieved that at least they don't have to do it). Like it or not, psychiatric diagnoses currently are based on four factors:   1. Symptoms 2. Symptom course over time (including age of onset) 3. Family history 4. Response to prior treatments As you've read repeatedly in this book, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder tends to be based on the presence or absence of hypo-mania or mania, rather than on the latter three factors. But as was shown in Chapter 3, these other factors are very relevant. In this chapter we'll look at two factors that affect the gathering and interpretation of the diagnostic data: first, your doctor's diagnostic biases and second, your own insight into your symptoms. Then we'll look at the risks of the underdiagnosis and over-diagnosis of bipolarity. In Chapter 6 we'll return to all this, putting together a plan for working with your doctor or therapist—first on your diagnostic evaluation and then during ongoing treatment.

- The medical field has a phrase for this: "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." (You might have to read that sentence a few times.) In other words, looking for keys and not finding them does not make it certain they aren't there. It just means you didn't find them. Establishing the absence of something with certainty is nearly impossible; you can only increase the probability that it isn't there.

- But, wouldn't you be able to recognize all three levels? Well, that depends, actually. Some people maintain the ability to recognize what is happening and when they are not their usual selves, from subtle hypomanic symptoms to the extremes of mania. This ability is usually termed insight, meaning that a person can see him- or herself clearly and recognize changes in behavior. But often in mania, and somewhat less often in hypomania, the illness itself interferes with this insight. People become overconfident, start making big plans, ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=983))

- You can see the unfortunate implication: you may look truly unipolar now, but if you're young and especially if you have several of the soft signs presented in Chapter 3, you'll have to keep considering this issue of bipolarity as you select your treatments. Doctors ask me: How soon can I relax about all this if my patient gets a good response to an antidepressant? My answer is that in my experience, negative reactions to antidepressants have occurred in anywhere between twenty minutes, such as my patient who said that twenty minutes after his first dose of paroxetine (Paxil), "I felt like I was shot out of a cannon," and seven years, such as my patient who developed a clear negative reaction to sertraline (Zoloft) after doing very well on it for seven years. (I published the latter as a case report because of its implications.) Really Unipolar, but Called Bipolar. Finally, here is the promised section on what might befall you, if you really are unipolar and find yourself being diagnosed as bipolar by a doctor or therapist wearing bipolar lenses. There are multiple risks. First of all, there is the stigma factor. It's bad enough to have to accept the label "depressed," right?

- of "bipolar?" Whoa, that is a completely different level in the mental-illness department store. You came in looking for a new shirt, and all of a sudden someone is showing you a new suit and tie as well. Or so it may seem. Having read this far, you now know that this distinction between unipolar depression and bipolar disorder is just a matter of degree—a matter of your position on the Mood Spectrum. But society doesn't know that. It is embarrassing enough for someone to know you are being treated for depression, but for them to know you are being treated for bipolar disorder? Most people find this a very big jump, even after they have learned about the Mood Spectrum. I generally counsel my patients to be very cautious about whom they tell that they've been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. There is just too much risk that their boss, friends, or schoolmates will react to this label as though it means Bipolar I (remember, that's the new name for the former manic-depressive illness, which includes full manic symptoms such as psychosis). There is nothing morally wrong about having Bipolar I, of course. Yet the term calls up an image in most people's minds that is far from the symptom patterns of the Mood Spectrum and thus is misleading, as well as potentially more stigmatizing. Second is the issue of medication risks. Most people look at the list of potential side effects that can occur with mood stabilizers and think they look worse than the potential side effects of antidepressant medications. This is a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison. How ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1101))

- do you compare the risk of something that can cause a severe skin rash, which requires hospitalization 1 time in about 3,000 and occasionally, though very rarely, is fatal, versus the risk of a medication that can make you suicidal, perhaps rarely but perhaps as often as 1 time in 100 or 200? Antidepressants look pretty innocent in the advertising they receive, complete with happy white-teethed smiling models and cheery colors, yet they can cause weight gain, problems with sexual function (far more often than do most mood stabilizers), and the usual long laundry list of uncommon but serious problems. Nevertheless, when my patients look at the list of risks associated with mood stabilizers, they generally seem to regard the risk column as considerably worse than that for antidepressants (more about this in the Chapter 8). Third, mood stabilizers may simply not work when the problem really is unipolar. Yet, some actually do: lithium is routinely recommended as an add-on option for unipolar depression that is not responding well or fully to an antidepressant. More limited data exist for several other medications used for bipolar disorder, suggesting they might be beneficial even if used mistakenly.

- Many people finish learning about the problem of subtle hypomania and the soft bipolar variations of the Mood Spectrum, but still want to know: "Can't someone just give me a yes or no?" After all, when you see a psychiatrist or even your primary care doctor, before they can start treatment—especially with a medication approach—they have to decide one way or another, don't they? Well actually, no—and yes. I don't mean to confuse you, but it really depends on which way you think about diagnosis. You now understand the Mood Spectrum model, which does not offer a yes or no. In this model a diagnosis is an attempt to place you somewhere on the spectrum. By comparison, in the DSM category-based system you can answer the question, "Do I have bipolar disorder?" with a yes or no. In some people, all the diagnostic clues point in the same direction: symptoms, symptom course over time, family history, and response to previous treatment. These people are likely to be at one end or another of the Mood Spectrum. The DSM system works fine for them.

- yes-or-no answer is appropriate and will lead directly to appropriate treatment. These people don't need any additional tests to help establish their diagnosis. Ironically, the people who might need a test result to clarify their diagnosis are the very ones whose test results are most difficult to interpret, as you will soon learn. There are tests. Two of them are very easy to take, even on your own without a doctor or therapist involved at all. But you must remember: the test result is not a diagnosis. Even a positive test, a yes answer on the test, does not mean you have bipolar disorder. Many doctors have forgotten why this is so, though they once learned it. Therefore, to be safe, you need to learn this if you are going to use these tests either on your own or in a doctor's office. You're anxious to look at the tests, aren't you? All right, they're coming. But first, you must know how to interpret the results. Usually this is left to doctors who are supposed to have been trained to do what you're about to learn. But it won't hurt for you to know, too. What You Should Know Before Taking and Scoring the Tests Before you learn how to score your test, you need to understand the warning that a test result is not a diagnosis. Wait a minute, isn't diagnosis the point of the thing? Well, yes and no. Yes, the point is to help establish a working diagnosis for you. But no, a positive test doesn't mean you have bipolar disorder. Why not? That gets a bit complicated. Here's a short answer.

- Medical diagnostic tests, even the very best ones, don't give a diagnosis. They shift the likelihood of a diagnosis. Remember that most diagnoses in psychiatry are based on four things:   1. Your symptoms 2. Your symptom course over time 3. Your family history 4. Your response to treatments When your doctor, with your help, has assembled those four parts of your diagnostic database, he or she will have at least a hunch as to what's going on. If the doctor is nearly certain you don't have bipolar disorder, or nearly certain that you do, there is no need for a test. But between those extremes, a test can sometimes shift the hunch in one direction or the other. That can be useful. Though they were taught this logic in medical school, many doctors have forgotten that even a very biologically based test like an HIV test for the AIDS virus does not give a diagnosis. That's because the tests, even very precise tests like that for HIV, are not perfect. They can produce false-positive results. A positive is supposed to mean the disease is present, but sometimes this is a false signal. Sometimes the test is positive… ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1156))

- The bipolar tests have error rates like this, too—worse, in fact. Some studies say quite a bit worse. That's why you have to be careful with the test results. They are supposed to be used to shift a hunch. They can be helpful in this way, especially if your test result is clearly positive or negative. But by themselves, they cannot make a diagnosis, because of their error rates. Just like any test, even the more biologically based low-error-rate tests, the bipolar tests give results that must be interpreted in the context of the other four factors for a diagnosis: symptoms, symptom course, family history, and response to previous treatments. This statistically correct way of using the test results is discussed in great detail (which doctors will recognize and perhaps shudder to see again, as these statistics are not easy and often are presented very quickly in medical school) on my website, in the plainest English I can muster. That's why the test result is not a diagnosis: the result must be interpreted in the context of a hunch. Your doctor or therapist is supposed to gather the information to create that context and then the hunch. There is no statistical reason why you can't gather the information, arrive at your own hunch, and then use the test to adjust your hunch. If you've read and understood the first three chapters of this book, I think your hunch can, indeed, be more accurate than that of many primary care doctors (though their skills are beginning to improve rapidly). The next step is using your test results to adjust your hunch. If you read and can understand my Web pages describing the details of that process, then I think you can do as well or better than most primary care doctors. Mind you, this is diagnostic heresy: the guild of medicine does not allow patients to make their own diagnoses. Let's put it this way: if you have not read and understood my Web pages about interpreting your test results, then you should not trust your interpretation of them and should talk with your doctor and therapist about what they mean. Yet all this fuss over a test result is leading us away from the main point of this entire book: patients can be found all the way across the Mood Spectrum. Therefore, we'll look at the test that can help determine your position on that spectrum: the Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (BSDS). By contrast, another test, called… ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1167))

- Medical students, being what they are, commonly translate this to, "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras." Get it? Horses are common, zebras are not (at least at U.S. medical school locations). When a medical student sees a symptom, such as cough, she should think about common possible causes, or "horses," first. Later, she can consider much more unusual causes of cough, the "zebras" of medicine. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1238))

- Another simple clue is the absence of other features of bipolar disorder—no early onset of symptoms, no repeated mood episodes, no shift in mood after childbirth, and (perhaps most important) no family history of any mood, anxiety, or alcohol problems. When some of these features, as well as bipolar-like symptoms, are present, the likelihood that a bipolar diagnosis best explains all these findings increases.

- The very concept of personality disorders has a complex history in psychiatry. (A less judgmental and more descriptive terminology cannot come too soon, in my opinion.)

The bottom line of that essay is that treatments for both labels can be useful for both conditions, and neither type of treatment is likely to make either condition worse if there is a misdiagnosis—so why not just get on with selecting treatments and skip the worry over the label? You may recognize this as a "lumper" approach. Treatments may become more specific in the future, making a "splitter" approach more necessary. For now, however, I think lumping makes more sense, especially because it may prevent potentially destructive disagreements about diagnosis, which serve little purpose but can increase patients' distress.

- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The human nervous system learns well, sometimes all too well. A life-threatening experience, just once, can teach your brain to be cautious about anything even remotely resembling that experience, for years. Fortunately, well-refined psychotherapies for PTSD help many people. These are summarized on an excellent website, ptsd.facts forhealth.org. Bipolarity interacts directly with PTSD: that is, each makes the other worse. So getting your bipolarity well-controlled is an important part of PTSD treatment. The reverse is probably also true, but harder. In medicine, we often think that if one condition has many treatments, that's because none work very well, such as some cancer treatments. This could be said of PTSD treatments. Many kinds of psychotherapy have been tried. Most clinicians would agree on one thing: when a person is in the grip of uncontrolled bipolar symptoms, that is not the time to explore the memories of the triggering event for the PTSD. Use self-control and self-soothing behavioral techniques at such times, and get the bipolar cycling under control before using exploratory psychotherapy. Similarly, almost every medication class in psychiatry has ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1431))

I really like that because it warns against something people do all the time. We hesitate to try something if it might not turn out very well, and as a result, we don't try at all. Take exercise, for example: if Michael can't work out five times a week, which he knows is what he should be doing, he doesn't work out at all. How ironic. Wouldn't three days a week be better than none? Even one day a week is still better than none, right? ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1507))

- Here are some tricks to make tracking easier to keep up. Make it a routine. That means the chart itself has to stay in some location where you'll pass it every night. I tell patients to put it on a clipboard, with a pen or pencil attached by a string; hang it on the back of the bathroom door or above the sink; and fill it out every night when they brush their teeth. Don't list your medications every day. Just note changes (mood, sleep, exercise, for example; or mood, exercise, irritability). This leaves only about three simple check marks to make per day. If you're organized, this should take, what, about fifteen seconds? You just need to try this approach for a while to see if you can make it stick. If you succeed, you will have a record that is much better than your doctor's. You could look back months from now and know precisely what medications you were taking, what doses, and what results you were getting. This just can't be beat. And yet, unless you really work at it, this is not likely to be a regular part of your care. I have to admit, I don't have many patients doing it and have not made a point of it with them, primarily because I don't want to burden them with it. Many people don't want that daily reminder that they have a mood disorder requiring treatment. "Just taking pills is bad enough—don't make me think about how I feel!"

- The sidebar example makes an important point: people get better. They can do so on their own, and it happens all the time. Also, if you manage to convince people they're going to get better, this in itself increases the likelihood that they will get better. Isn't that a funny thing about us humans? So how can you know whether the treatment you are being offered isn't just a placebo, as the Internet-available low-dose lithium may be? And how do you find out about a treatment's safety record? Let's look at each of these factors in turn, in the next two sections. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1736))

- So the people selling the expensive, minimal-lithium pills described earlier are very likely to hear back from many customers about how much the pills helped. The pill really did help—they really are better. Thus the people selling the pill believe it really works. And when they believe this, their medication becomes even more effective, because their ability to convince people that the pill will help improves with every reported success. You see what happens? Everyone in the loop reinforces everyone else's belief. Thus a pill that might contain no active ingredients (or almost none, in the case of the expensive lithium) becomes a truly effective treatment. Here is a very important conclusion: because of the remarkable human phenomenon where believing something will work actually makes it work, anyone who claims that their pill, lotion, or potion "works" cannot really know this is so, unless they compare their product to a placebo. That's why randomized trials are so important. ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1753))
- One more example can be found in the flurry of concern that serotonergic antidepressants like fluoxetine (Prozac) can raise the rate of serious bleeding problems after surgery. These medications have been around for more than fifteen years now. There were some reports along these lines at least as far back as five years ago, but a recent study reported an epidemiologic comparison (as described earlier) of more than 1,000 patients' experiences, strongly increasing the evidence for this risk. The bottom line again is that it takes a lot longer to establish risk than to establish benefit. Unless you can find some reason to think an herb, vitamin, or other alternative medicine is safe, you are taking an unknown risk—rather like you would be if you use a medication that had just been released for use.

- However, there is a simple way to get a look at the likelihood of a side effect. The FDA now requires that drug manufacturers present their data about the frequency of side effects—along with a lot of other stuff that won't usually mean much to you—on that sheet of paper the pharmacist usually gives you with a new medication, the product information (PI) sheet. PIs for most medications can be found on the Internet as well. Around the middle of the PI is usually a table that compares the frequency of side effects in those who took the medication versus the frequency seen in those who took the placebo. This is just what we need, of course, because not only do placebos commonly help people get better, they also commonly cause side effects! It's almost laughable in some ways, but it just shows how we humans work. Expectation has tremendous power. If researchers tell study participants, "This medication may cause a serious skin rash," the rate of rash in the placebo group roughly doubles. When you need some real numbers for the frequency of side effects of a medication, get the PI. Find the table where the side effects of the medication are shown compared to the placebo, and skim down for instances ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1844))

- where the medication side effects are clearly more common than those among the people taking the placebo. These are the common side effects (greater than 1 percent). Everything else is infrequent (less than 1 in 100) or rare (less than 1 in 1,000), usually shown just below that table. (A word of caution: if a patient in a research trial has a side effect for even one day, that side effect will be listed—even if it was gone the next day. So remember, the lists you see do not distinguish between the side effects that decrease or disappear, as many do, and the ones that never decrease and may force someone to stop the medication.) Notice that for infrequent or rare side effects, there is no placebo comparison. So, when you read below the table, you have entered the realm of the unknown again: without a placebo, you can't tell whether those bad reactions were really caused by the medication. Some of them surely are, as we know from experience with the medications. As discussed in the Chapter 5, when a possible side effect arises, medications should be considered guilty until proven innocent by stopping the medication (but DON'T DO THAT ON YOUR OWN, REMEMBER? Whoa, there I go again). However, not all the side effects listed in the lower parts of the PI are really from the medication, right? Some of them, perhaps many of them, belong somehow to the patient (a negative placebo effect, if you will). To conclude this discussion of risk and benefit, let me remind you that bipolar disorder carries its own risks.

- What Causes Mood Disorders Anyway? We now believe that mood disorders are produced when stress and other factors shift the normal balance between cell growth and cell shrinkage. Say that again? You thought it had something to do with serotonin, right? Well, that's true, but now more is known about what the serotonin is actually doing. Your brain cells (neurons) very actively reshape themselves all the time in ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1872))

- response to your experience and your environment. This reshaping process requires that some cells shrink, while others grow. Just recently another important part of this process was revealed: new brain cells can be formed and become part of this reshaping process. Brain researchers have shown in several different ways that brains can indeed make new cells. (For some stunning pictures, go to the link on my website called "Depression Is Not a Moral Weakness.") The exciting part of this story is that these new cells form in the very parts of the brain where you're likely to need them—especially if you have a mood problem. That's very nice to know, because the scary part of this story is that mood problems can make neurons shrink and even die. If this goes on long enough, one can even see, using research brain scanners, that a depressed person's whole brain has literally shrunk, as much as 10 to 15 percent in some sensitive areas. This brain shrinkage is called atrophy, and the chemicals that cause it are called atrophic factors. Effective treatments, however, may stop and even reverse at least some of this shrinkage. We now know that feeling very stressed emotionally, such as through repeated major losses or intensely frustrating and yet uncontrollable situations, leads to increased brain chemicals that have an atrophic effect. Fortunately, several brain chemicals have the opposite effect. Many treatments for depression seem to work through these favorable brain chemicals called trophic factors.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In normal cell-shape change processes, the atrophic factors are balanced by trophic factors so that the result in your brain is merely a shape change, not an overall loss of cells. Mood disorders, including both unipolar and bipolar variations, seem to shift this trophic-atrophic balance. If the balance tips so that the atrophic processes just slightly exceed the trophic processes, this will lead to brain shrinkage over time, right? Slowly, if the shift is small, or rapidly, if the shift is very large, more neurons will shrink than will grow. To understand the actions of antidepressant and mood stabilizer medications, you will want to know about some of the trophic and atrophic factors involved in this cellular balance. We'll look briefly at a few of these factors and then at how treatments affect the balance. Oddly, many of the trophic and atrophic factors have been discovered while researchers were trying to figure out how current treatments work. Researchers have been trying to figure out the root cause of mood problems by looking first at one effective medication and then at another to discover what all effective treatments actually do to brain cells.

- By its very nature, bipolar disorder is a problem of cyclic changes in mood and energy. In other words, people with bipolar disorder almost always have phases of one kind of symptom, then phases with none or with some other symptom. When you look at this pattern over time, you can see repeated cycles of symptoms. (An exception is mixed states, which can simply persist as a swirling mixture of agitation and depression. Although cycling might be going on, it is only from one combination of symptoms to another and can, instead, feel rather constant.) These cycles often have no clear relationship to human calendar time, with the notable exception of symptom increases around particular phases of women's menstrual cycles, and seasonal shifts in mood and energy associated with the timing of morning sun and total light levels. Few would disagree with the commonsense notion that it's better to prevent symptoms than to wait for them to show up and then treat them. Therefore, arising from the cyclic nature of bipolar disorder, we have the first principle of bipolar treatment: focus on a long-term goal of stopping the cycling. Try to avoid focusing on treating your symptom du jour (symptom of the day), which in most cases will be depression. Instead, the goal is not having depressions in the first place! Maintain Long-Term Focus on Your Goal. Two tricks may help you maintain that long-term focus. First, look for treatments that can keep depression from returning but don't make the cycling worse. Not many true mood stabilizers meet both of these conditions. However, when you also consider nonmedication approaches, quite a few treatments fulfill these twin requirements and have antidepressant effects as well. Here's the second trick for keeping a long-term mind-set. Most patients' depressive phases don't last very long: perhaps weeks and occasionally months. If they can just get out of the current episode and put a treatment in place to prevent falling back in, they may be able to avoid using an antidepressant approach with its possible risks. But how are you supposed to manage during the depression that you're waiting out? Fortunately, there are options (discussed later), which not only can prevent later episodes but can also treat the one you're in. It's important to recognize (especially when you are weighing the risks of such treatments) that for some people, one option is to take no risks and wait the depression out—as long as some steps are being taken to decrease the chances of going through depression again. For people with very long depressed phases, this may not be such a good idea. But if your episodes generally last a few weeks, or if they last months, but you're already two months into this episode, you might be able to stick it out knowing that you're adding a preventive agent and may be less likely to go through this again. Maintaining this shift in mind-set is not easy, because of the very nature of depression itself. It can be awful. It can… ([Location 1949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1949))

- In fact, you'd have to have very firm beliefs that antidepressants can make things worse, or you would probably go ahead and prescribe one. Even with such beliefs, you might find yourself having to almost ignore the patient's desperation in order to stick to your principles. A well-known mood expert suggests, partly in jest, that doctors "plug their ears with wax" (invoking the story of Ulysses), meaning they should try to ignore the patient's pleas for help with their symptom du jour and keep the focus on the long-term goal. The problem with this approach, of course, is that patients want to be heard. They are suffering, and they want help with that suffering. Can't you just see the doctor getting ready to cave in? The doctor needs a quick reminder and an alternative plan. The reminder goes like this: many mood experts agree to avoid using antidepressants wherever possible so as to avoid inducing cycling. Indeed, it seems that the more experience one has treating patients with bipolar disorder, the more one avoids antidepressants. According to one study, bipolar specialty clinics have only about 20 percent of their patients on antidepressants, whereas general psychiatrists use antidepressants in 80 percent of their bipolar patients. Fortunately, much more is available for the treatment of depression (in a Mood Spectrum context) than antidepressants alone. So the doctor need not plug his or her ears. She can treat depression very actively, in fact, yet emphasize approaches that do not risk making the long-term ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1975))

Fortunately, the list is not short. It includes several nonmedication approaches, as well as some pill-based approaches with low long-term risk—which is important, because in most cases people need to use these strategies for a long time. (How long? Usually I duck that question at this stage, suggesting that first we want to focus on finding a treatment that works. Later we can talk about how long the treatment might need to be continued, what kind of risks and side effects go along with it, and so on. At that point—since I emphasize finding treatments with no side effects, if at all possible—thinking about staying with that treatment for a long time may not look so bad, especially if it is already helping.) Most of the strategies shown here will be discussed further in later chapters, but I want you to see them all at once. Knowing about this list helps many patients and doctors see that depression does not have to be ignored or always treated with an… ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1986))

- there are some heavies farther down the list. Looking at the nonmedication approaches first is a good place to start, especially since part of the goal is to keep overall risks low. The nondrug approaches here have almost no risk at all. You'll find details and links for all these strategies in the remaining chapters. As you can see from Table 7.1, there are lots of things to try. You can make many combinations of elements. Each might be insufficient by itself, but when combined they can have a strong impact on your depression. The table roughly is organized from least risky to most—so you could start at the top and gradually combine elements, finally including one or two of the medication approaches as well, if necessary. But remember, time is on your side if you are adding any mood stabilizer—even if it does not have specific antidepressant effects—because you can prevent cycling back into depression, and you will come out of this episode as you have come out of those preceding it. Third, Gentle Pressure on the Seesaw Everyone faces destabilizing factors in their lives, such as emotional stress, but most have at least some stabilizing factors as well, such as adequate sleep, good social connections, and perhaps even regular exercise. Think of these factors as sitting on opposite sides of what we used to call a seesaw, back in the old days before Xboxes. On one side of the seesaw are the destabilizing influences:… ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=1997))

- In general, the treatment of bipolar disorders requires steadily tipping the see-saw toward the side of greater mood stability. In addition to lifestyle changes, many people have to use pills as well: perhaps fish oil, usually something pharmaceutical. Some require several mood stabilizers, combining them at low doses to avoid the side effects that might accompany using one or two at high doses. But slowly, all these ingredients begin to tip the balance toward greater stability. Thus treatment is a process involving much more than medications alone. You have to look at your lifestyle, your social connections, your job and income, even what you eat (because weight gain can result from the condition itself, as well as from some medication options), when you sleep, and certainly how much you exercise. This is true for all types of recurrent mood disorders across the Mood Spectrum—even including Bipolar I. There is nothing earthshaking in this third principle. It's just good medical practice to look at all the possible factors that affect you, and to try to shift the balance between the negatives and the positives. But notice what this perspective suggests when the next depressive phase comes along.

- looking to stop the cycling by gently tilting the seesaw back toward stability. Why this emphasis on gently? Because we're dealing with your brain, OK? But (to speak more gently) also because the system we're dealing with seems to react to change with more change. That's what cycling is all about. If something shoves the mood system hard in one direction, in many people the system responds by pushing back in the other direction. This may be the basis of the most common cycling pattern, in which hypomanic or manic episodes go straight into depressive phases. It's as though the mood system overreacted to the hypomania or mania and pushed so hard in the other direction as to cause a depression. This same logic could explain why in some people, antidepressants appear to cause hypomania or mania, perhaps by pushing too hard and leading to an overshoot in the other direction. Occasionally, when increased quickly for mania or… ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2022))

- Like the first guideline, this is not controversial. This is just good common sense. So why does it merit discussion? Because these obvious strategies are harder than swallowing a pill! I wish I could require anyone who is going to receive an antidepressant to show me they've already tried a reasonable exercise program first. Unfortunately, our society doesn't consider that as an acceptable professional practice. But think about it: exercise has very low risks for most people, has practically zero risks for young healthy people, and has other known health benefits. Overall it clearly has more side benefits than it has risks—for almost everyone. So why even consider an approach with known risks when another approach has known additional benefit instead? Because our society makes exercise so difficult to get on a regular basis, that's why (more on that in Chapter 13).

- Not Currently on an Antidepressant. Let's say you've tried all of the antidepressants that aren't antidepressants and depression is still your main problem. In fact, it's your only problem. You don't have any signs of hypomania: you're sleeping too much, not having difficulty sleeping; your energy is very low, not agitated; and your mood is just depressed, not significantly irritable. In addition, you are not cycling at all, just depressed. Not many of my patients reach this point. It's hard to really exhaust all the options from Table 7.1. Most commonly, when depression is still a problem after all the options were tried, it is mixed together with signs of hypomania, such as agitation, severe sleep problems, or irritability. Even if these may only appear briefly in cycles, that still counts as present in my book. If an antidepressant is added when signs of hypomania or cycling are present (speaking from clinical experience; there are no data to go on here), commonly the depression will get better all right; but the hypomanic ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2071))

- symptoms often get worse, the cycling becomes more prominent, or both. If one assumes that the antidepressant can cause those changes, then one immediately faces the need to remove the antidepressant to address the hypomania and cycling. Therefore, in my experience, if hypomania or cycling is present, I treat that first. Although all along the way my patient and I discuss the probable benefits and possible risks of antidepressants, I try to hold off on using them until we are faced with a relatively pure depression, with no hypomania at all. But, of course, you remember the trouble we had ruling out hypomania because of the difficulty with being certain something is not there? Just as different doctors arrive at different diagnostic conclusions because of the way they handle the gradually vanishing iceberg of hypo-mania, so too might they have different treatment strategies (even when they agree on this principle of avoiding antidepressants when hypomania is present!) because of their different thresholds for detecting hypomania. When a pure bipolar depression is identified, an antidepressant with relatively more energizing effects, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), is generally my preference. This scenario is very common in the winter, when a seasonal shift in mood leads to a winter depression. In seasonal affective disorder, very low energy is recognized as a characteristic feature of such depressions; thus, again, buproprion is likely to be my choice of antidepressant. (Of course, one then has to guess when, nearing the return of the light in the spring, one should taper off the antidepressant. For me this is always tricky, as the patient doesn't want to stop early!) I have spoken very generally here. In my practice there are numerous exceptions to this rule. For many of those patients, we've discovered that they do better by staying on the antidepressant, and most had to discover that by going off the antidepressant and watching things get worse. I've not yet read anyone describe how we might identify these patients in advance so that they don't have to go through this process. One frequently cited study, led by Dr. Lori Altshuler, speaks to this issue, but people often forget to note the design of the study, which makes drawing any conclusions tricky. A more recent study with a much stronger design supports a general approach of routinely, though carefully, tapering people with bipolar disorder off of antidepressants. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2079))

- However, note the word taper. I once heard Gary Sachs, one of the most widely known and respected bipolar experts, say that if a patient is doing well, one should take four months to go off an antidepressant, 25 percent per month. If a patient is not doing well, I might go much faster, perhaps removing it in only a month or two. But my patients have seemed to do much better since I started following Dr. Sachs' advice. "Wait a minute," you say, "haven't you been telling us that antidepressants can make people worse? Now you're saying you should keep them around for months?" Good, following right along, aren't you. Here's one more bit of information you need to understand this paradox. There is also a phenomenon called antidepressant-withdrawal mania, in which suddenly stopping an antidepressant seems to induce manic or hypomanic symptoms. I've seen this rather frequently in patients who've gone off antidepressants on their own. Stopping fast is not good. How slow one has to go to avoid this phenomenon is not clear, but you can see why Dr. Sachs' advice may be wise. To summarize, then: maximize your use of antidepressants that aren't antidepressants. Be cautious with true antidepressants. And rely primarily on mood stabilizers, remembering that the goal is not to treat today's symptom, but to stop the cycling. The next chapter will look at mood stabilizers in more detail. ([Location 2101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2101))

- Your cat Felicia needs to see the veterinarian. Time to put her in the little cat-transport box—which, of course, she hates. Imagine you had to do this with one hand. She sees your hand coming from the right, and she scoots left. You move your hand to her left, but she shies to the right. Finally, you get frustrated and try to just grab her, but whichever side you come from, she's off in the other direction. You might be able to nab some cats with a one-handed approach, but most require two hands. Using antidepressants to treat bipolar depression is like trying to grab Felicia with one hand. It might work once or twice, but after a while you will want something that comes at her from both sides at once. To stretch this analogy a bit, imagine that Felicia prefers to run to her left. In that case, you could get away with an approach that is more sure-handed on the left, even if it's pretty weak on the right. But the more skittish the cat, the more you need an approach that covers both sides. That is the general idea behind a mood stabilizer: a treatment for mood instability that pushes toward the middle from both sides. Note there is no intention of squishing the cat while doing this! You want Felicia herself to remain unchanged while you get a good hold from both sides. Turning back to real life and mood stabilizers, surprisingly only one treatment meets this definition, according to one analysis. That is lithium; though even lithium is not perfect, as it is not equally powerful on both sides. Beyond this, there is some disagreement about which medications merit the term mood stabilizer. Now that bipolar disorder is more widely recognized and discussed, medication manufacturers have recognized this large potential market. All of a sudden, everybody wants to be a mood stabilizer.

- Lithium. Many people associate lithium with the treatment of severe mental illnesses. For people whose symptoms lie in the middle of the Mood Spectrum and whose primary symptom is depression, the idea of taking a medication they associate with severe mental illness is often hard to swallow (sorry). Yet lithium has one of the best track records as a mood stabilizer. It even has been shown to have an oddly specific antisuicide effect, much more so than valproate, for example. It has been shown to increase brain size, reversing the trend toward shrinkage (particularly in the frontal lobes and memory center) that mood problems seem to cause. It's cheap, and clinicians have many years of experience with it, so no new surprises are likely concerning long-term risks. Yet lithium does have significant long-term risks:   It can interfere with kidney function—though this usually takes more than a decade of use. (If you start now, however, I hope that by that time we'll have a much better treatment, developed on the basis of actually understanding the basis of bipolar physiology.)

- Stabilizers That Work Better Against Depression Omega-3 fatty acids (from fish oil), lamotrigine (Lamictal), and thyroid hormone are a very odd assortment to lump in the same group. Yet all three have been shown to have both antidepressant effects and mood stabilizing effects—although the evidence supporting their effectiveness is variable. Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Most likely you have heard of these as fish oil, as that is the source as well as the form you swallow. Most people immediately say, "Yuck," or some other colorful variation, perhaps thinking of mothers giving their children cod-liver oil or just imagining that fishy taste. But some fish oil pills are tasteless, and even some fancy emulsions taste pretty good, believe it or not, although they cost much more. One thing stands out about this approach compared to the rest: it has no known health risks. People have worried about heavy metals like mercury, but these appear to get trapped in the fish meat and don't come out with the oil. Fish oil can cause "fish burps" (one patient said to me, "When I burp, I feel like a seal"), though taking the pills with meals or keeping them in the freezer so that they release more slowly and ([Location 2187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2187))

The current data are made somewhat more convincing by several studies showing that people in fish-consuming countries have lower rates of bipolar disorder than those who live in countries where fish are not a regular part of their diet.

- turns out that an extremely complex relationship exists between thyroid hormone and bipolar disorder. Thyroid problems run in families with bipolar disorder. Bipolar symptoms sometimes show up for the first time, or at least become severe enough to require treatment, after some thyroid hormone change. But can thyroid hormone be a treatment? There are four reasons to consider it. 1. When thyroid hormone is low, people can become depressed. Doctors should check thyroid hormone levels in someone who is depressed because it is such an easy thing to treat. 2. There is a long tradition of using thyroid hormone as a booster for antidepressant treatments that are not working well enough. Although the data supporting this practice are limited (by the way, the data are much better for lithium in this role), it's a standard option for treatment-resistant depression. 3. At least two studies show that people with low-normal thyroid hormone levels (still in the normal range, but at the low end) respond less well to treatment for depression. This has been shown in both unipolar and bipolar depression. 4. Thyroid hormone has been used at very high doses as a treatment for rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. This has seemed to work for a few of my patients, but about twice as many simply become hyperthyroid as the dose goes up. My experience with this strategy is limited, in part because thyroid hormone is not regarded as a routine mood stabilizer. Most of the research on this approach ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2208))

- You certainly want an approach that can treat your current symptoms. But if one of your options also has the ability to prevent cycling into symptoms in the future, that would be best. I hope that sounds familiar? Remember the first guideline from the last chapter: focus on cycling. In other words, you want to prevent the return of symptoms once they have disappeared, as well as make them go away now. If you can find a medication that will do both, that's obviously better than having to switch to a different approach later for prevention of recurrences. The ability to prevent cycling is much harder to demonstrate in a research study, compared to treating the present symptoms. Imagine how long a research study needs to last to be able to say that a medication prevents the return of symptoms. For a person who has only a few mood episodes a year, the study would have to run at least a year to show a difference between the medication and a placebo. Amazingly, some of our treatments have ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2268))

- actually been studied this long, and their proponents can thus make such claims. So far these include lithium, valproate (Depakote), olanzapine (Zyprexa), lamotrigine (Lamictal), and recently, for a shorter period of study, aripiprazole. Everything else has so far been studied only as treatment for a current symptom. This does not mean the others do not have the ability to prevent cycling back into symptoms. It just means they have not been shown in well-controlled research studies to have this ability. So we have a serious "asymmetry of evidence"—a lack of research on all potential candidates. Some experts have suggested starting with one of the five medications named in the last paragraph because they at least have some evidence for these ideal effects (although most have been shown to prevent recurrence in only one direction—either into depression or into hypomania or mania). Another way to choose might be to look for the best match with your current symptoms, according to the spectrum diagram at the beginning of this chapter. If that match also points toward a medication that has been shown to prevent relapse into your most common symptom, you may have found your best option. What Is Most Important to You In business school they teach students about three criteria that often guide consumers' choices. These are shown in Figure 8.2, using hamburgers as an example.

- we've gone through the list, I can usually tell which of these three criteria—Fast, Antidepressant, or No Weight Gain—will most strongly drive his or her decision. In America, avoiding weight gain is usually an important criterion: either people are already overweight and for health reasons cannot afford to gain more, or they fear gaining weight because of the culture's intense worship of thinness. For some people with very severe symptoms, the treatment must be fast. Finally, for most people in the middle of the Mood Spectrum, depression is by far the dominant symptom. For them, the treatment needs to include a significant antidepressant effect. As you can see from these diagrams, a few medications can offer two out of three of these desirable qualities. A word of caution: I have positioned these treatments according to my understanding of current research and my experience. The diagram includes those medications that I think have been shown to approach the "ideal" characteristics of a mood stabilizer: able to prevent cycling as well as treat current symptoms.

- Remember, these distinctions are based on my clinical experience, not entirely on research data. So if your doctor sees these categories differently, he or she is not wrong! Approved by the Food and Drug Administration You'll sometimes see people write as though FDA approval should guide your choice. After all, isn't that agency supposed to look at all the options and indicate the ones that have good evidence for effectiveness and low evidence for risk? Well, no, actually. That's not quite how it works. Here's a short version of a complex story about FDA approval. A medication cannot be advertised for a specific purpose (such as treating bipolar disorder) until it is FDA-approved for that purpose. To get FDA approval, strict research guidelines must be met, including at least two randomized controlled trials, as described in the previous chapter. These trials cost millions of dollars. So if the manufacturer is not in a position to earn millions of dollars from promoting the use of their product, they have no incentive to bother getting FDA approval. It would just cost them money that they won't see coming back in return. This is especially the case… ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2301))

- have to pay millions of dollars to sponsor such research), you can see this is not a good business strategy. Therefore, the FDA-approved drugs are those where the manufacturer stands to benefit by supporting the expensive research. These tend to be the newer drugs, with at least several years remaining on their patents. So older drugs (oxcarbazepine, verapamil, and certainly thyroid hormone) are not likely ever to be FDA approved. No one wants to pay for the research the FDA requires. As a result of this process and several other factors, no mood stabilizers have been approved specifically for Bipolar II. Some were approved for bipolar disorder generally, before the FDA started chopping up their approvals in the last decade. Most are approved only for the treatment of Bipolar I (this includes most of the atypical antipsychotics). Thus when given for the treatment of these different bipolar variations, most mood stabilizers are used off label. This jargon term means that the medication has not been officially "labeled" for this purpose by the FDA. It does not mean the medication doesn't work or carries more risk than other options.

- I usually duck this question initially, suggesting that we first find a medication or medications that clearly work. Obviously if we can't get that far, this question is moot. Yet people begin to realize that the medications may control symptoms but not cure the illness, and that in most cases treatment of some kind has to continue in order to prevent a relapse. With that realization comes one of the biggest hurdles: accepting that your mood disorder may be chronic, meaning that it probably won't go away. People begin to recognize that beyond getting rid of present-day symptoms, the next challenge is to stay well thereafter. This realization can happen very early and very quickly—no matter how artfully I duck the question at first. This is why I so strongly emphasize that our goal in treatment is 100 percent symptom control, with 0 percent side effects. A patient with very severe symptoms may be willing to put up with significant sedation at first, or tremor, or even appetite increase. But once the symptoms are controlled, the burdens posed by treatment (including time and money spent on therapy and medications, as well as any side effects) must become the focus—and quickly. If these are not reduced to a tolerable level, the patient almost certainly will consider stopping the treatment: after all, the symptoms are now gone or much reduced, so what justification is there to put up with the treatment burdens anymore? You can see why I steer patients toward treatment approaches that are sustainable for the long term, right from the beginning. Why start with something you'll want to switch away from, if it works? Why not start with those that, if effective, pose few problems when continued? For medications like lithium or valproate (Depakote), which have significant side effects at high doses but few at low doses, sometimes this means using several medications together at low, tolerable doses, rather than pushing a single medication up to its full strength. Historically this practice has been frowned upon, scornfully referred to as polypharmacy (literally, ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2372))

- Can Trying a Mood Stabilizer Make Things Permanently Worse? Good question. You should wonder about this in order to evaluate the full picture of the risks you're taking when trying one of these medications. So far, mood stabilizers look better in this respect than antidepressants. As you'll see in the next chapter (Controversy 2b), a tiny bit of evidence suggests that antidepressants might be able to make things worse in the long run, perhaps permanently, in some people with bipolarity (and by the remotest stretch of the evidence, perhaps even in some patients who appear to be unipolar at the beginning of treatment). By contrast, I have never even heard speculation about such risks for mood stabilizers, with one exception: lithium, when stopped abruptly or tapered too fast (over a few weeks, instead of several months), appears to make some people more susceptible to a return of symptoms than if they had never taken it at all. If we stretch that evidence, as I'm obviously willing to do for antidepressant risk, we might conclude that all mood stabilizers should be slowly tapered. (This is based on extrapolating from the lithium experience; to my knowledge this phenomenon has not been shown directly for any other mood stabilizer). Mind you, any treatment you try has some potential for risk. For medications that have been in frequent use for at least several years, these risks are fairly well-known. For newer medications and untested strategies such as herbs and other alternative treatments, it is difficult or impossible to fully describe the possible risks of treatment. Risk of side effects is a different matter.… ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2389))

- Depression is the predominant symptom of the Mood Spectrum. Consider it this way: if pure hypomania accounts for only 2 percent of the time spent ill, and a person with this version of bipolar disorder is ill about 50 percent of the time, then that person is hypomanic only about 1 percent of the time. That means experiencing hypomania one day in a hundred—about one day every three months. But that same person is depressed about six weeks out of those twelve. You can see why people focus on the depression and often miss or fail to mention the tiny wedge of other symptoms. Isn't this stunning? These data describe what it's really like to have Bipolar II: when symptomatic, you are depressed. Once in a rare while, hypomania appears, as likely to be mixed with depression as to occur by itself. If your bipolarity is subtle, perhaps very mild hypomania, you or your doctor could easily overlook it. ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2408))

- When Depression Is the Dominant Symptom Now for the treatment implication of this depression dominance: depression is very likely to be the patient's main target when coming to the doctor for help. Many people have learned, from friends or from their own reading, that antidepressant medications can help with depression (lately they've had a lot of help from advertising by the manufacturers). Therefore, unless they learn about the complexities of the Mood Spectrum, as you have done by reading this far, they are very commonly looking for treatment with an antidepressant medication. Most often, they see their primary care doctor first. Unless she has learned about the complexities of the Mood Spectrum, an opportunity few primary care doctors have had, she is very likely to prescribe an antidepressant. You see the problem: antidepressants look like the obvious, right thing to do. But antidepressants can make bipolar disorders worse. They can flip people into mania or hypomania, cause mixed states, increase the rate of shifting from one mood state to another, and may even worsen the long-term course of the illness—or so some mood experts believe. Let's take a look at the concerns about anti-depressants in bipolar disorder. ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2415))

- Most studies of antidepressant risk in bipolar disorder focus on the first controversy, the switch rate. But remember, depression is the dominant symptom in this illness. It comes back again and again. It is unusual for a patient with bipolar disorder to have only one exposure to antidepressant medications. Most patients receive these medications repeatedly or continuously. What impact does this have on their long-term outcomes? We'd want to compare them to a group without such exposure, preferably by randomly dividing a collection of people into a group that received an anti-depressant and a group that did not. Unfortunately, we have no such randomized trial. In fact we have almost no experimental data to go on, though several authors have collected other data that allow an evidence-based approach to longer-term risks of antidepressants. These possible risks include Rapid cycling (as in the forthcoming example of John Hudson) The possibility that antidepressants might prevent response, or full response, to mood stabilizers ([Location 2449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2449))

- A more theoretical concern about a long-term increase in mood episodes Controversy 2a: Do Antidepressants Cause Rapid Cycling? Rapid cycling technically refers to patients who have more than four mood episodes per year. Surprising? In classic Bipolar I, patients can go for years without an episode of mania or depression. But in Bipolar II, particularly the more complex versions with additional symptoms of anxiety or problems such as alcohol abuse or a history of sexual trauma, cycle rates are very often far higher (so that my patients laugh at the idea of only four in a year). And yet, as you know, antidepressants can make bipolar conditions worse. You've already heard that antidepressants can cause hypomanic and manic symptoms. A lot of clinical experience and a little research data suggest that antidepressants can also cause increased cycling, meaning an increased frequency of mood episodes compared to what might have occurred without the anti-depressant. In other words, it looks like antidepressants can shift a patient to a more rapid cycling pattern, as appears to have occurred to John Hudson in Figure 9.1. The scale shown is one we clinicians often use for a quick estimate of how a person is doing. We ask, "On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the worst you ever feel and 10 is the best, how are you doing today?" Most people who have no mood symptoms at the time answer, "OK, I think, about 5 or 6." Thus the middle of this mood range is about 5, as shown by the straight line at that level.

- Controversy 2b: Can Antidepressants Cause Depression? If you look at John's experience and can tentatively accept the idea that antidepressants can increase cycle frequency, you're ready for the next small step in this logical analysis of their effects in bipolar disorders. Think along with me carefully here, as this is extremely important for understanding the principles that follow. Here's the crucial step. If antidepressants do indeed increase cycling so that people have more mood episodes than before, then they also will have more symptoms. Ironically, these can include depressed symptoms. These patients may thus have more depressed phases, and thus more days depressed, than before they started the antidepressant. You can see this pattern in John's case, which I've drawn from the experience of many of my patients. Since at this point, John's antidepressant is not helping and might be making things worse in this way, you might think that stopping it would be a good idea. But you wouldn't think about doing that with your own antidepressant, would you? Heavens no, you'd discuss it with ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2502))

- your doctor first so that he has the opportunity to tell you why it is not a good idea in your case, and why there might be a major risk in doing so. Or the doctor might agree and then give you instructions on how to taper it off slowly, which is usually essential. In any case, you'd talk with the doctor about that first, right? Good, then I won't have to give you any further lecture about why it is so important that you not take the ideas in this book and run with them on your own. Assuming for the moment that antidepressants can indeed cause increased cycling, one more small logical step leads to a very paradoxical conclusion: if antidepressants increase cycling and then lose their beneficial effects, they can effectively be causing depression. Pardon me? Antidepressants causing depression? My guess is that you've never heard of that idea. Neither have most doctors. This is my own way of looking at antidepressant effects, and not one you'll find in the standard writings about bipolar disorder and its treatment. So be cautious and remember I could be completely wrong about this. Notice that the whole idea of antidepressants causing depression depends entirely on whether antidepressants do indeed cause cycling from one mood state to another. Although generally most practicing psychiatrists accept the latter idea, only a little research evidence is available to support it. To my knowledge less evidence goes against it. Wait just a minute here. Perhaps you find this idea that antidepressants can cause depression by causing increased ([Location 2510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2510))

- cycling just too paradoxical to swallow. Here's an analogy that might make the problem clear. Suppose you love going to the amusement park to ride the roller coaster, but the newest one makes your stomach quite queasy. The big drops, from near the top to near the bottom, seem to really get you.

- Imagine how hard it would be to know, for Jason Brown, that the antidepressant was responsible for the acceleration of his illness. How could anyone be sure it wasn't just the very illness worsening at the rate it would have regardless of whether he had taken an antidepressant or not? Although for one person it is impossible to know this, an interesting study done at Stanford University might support the concern I'm presenting here. In that study, people with Bipolar II, who were depressed, were treated with valproate (Depakote). The researchers ([Location 2581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2581))

- found that people who had been treated previously with an antidepressant did not respond as well to the valproate as those who were "antidepressant naïve." As the authors acknowledge, it is unknown whether those who had received an antidepressant before entering this study had more severe symptoms than the other group and that is why they ended up getting an antidepressant in the first place. But these results are consistent with the idea of a permanent change in the nervous system that might result from antidepressant exposure. A small study like this doesn't prove anything, but it has kept me wondering. Dr. El-Mallakh, cited earlier, has wondered likewise. He and his colleagues concluded a review of this issue thus: "Although far from conclusive, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that antidepressant treatment is associated with a manic episode earlier than might occur spontaneously."

- Worse yet, weight gain can easily worsen depression: people look at their bodies and behaviors and become even more discouraged and dissatisfied with themselves. They feel more uncomfortable when physically active, so they spend more time sitting and less time doing things that might positively impact their mood. Because they spend more time sitting or lying down, they may even begin to gain weight faster. ([Location 2707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2707))

Finally, you'll find out about some of the antidote medications that have been used to combat weight gain. The conclusion: the three standard recommendations, despite how difficult they are to follow, are clearly preferable to the antidote strategies. I hope that after all this information the first three strategies (exercise, using medications that are not associated with weight gain, and avoiding simple sugars) now look like the most obvious and most important strategies for handling the weight gain associated with mood medications. Another is to maximize the use of nonmedication approaches, discussed in the next three chapters on lifestyle changes (including exercise) and psychotherapy options.

- Metabolic Syndrome and Mood. Why are we focusing on metabolic syndrome here? We do so because the condition has been shown to be common in depression and bipolar disorder, the defining poles of the Mood Spectrum. Does the mood problem cause metabolic syndrome or does metabolic syndrome cause the mood problem? Or does some third factor cause both at the same time? For now the answer appears to be all of the above, as follows. The stress hormone cortisol, which we saw a moment ago causes increased glucose release from the liver, is also clearly involved in causing depression (although the brain systems that regulate cortisol are also involved in mood changes). Therefore, cortisol is a clear candidate for a third factor that might cause both metabolic syndrome and mood problems. But depression can clearly cause metabolic syndrome through the self-reinforcing loop described earlier: mood goes down, energy goes down, activity goes down (and calories sometimes go up, particularly in atypical depression and seasonal affective disorder). This can lead to insulin resistance and from there to metabolic syndrome. ([Location 2762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2762))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Finally, a slight bit of evidence suggests that somehow, metabolic syndrome itself might cause depression. For example, Dr. Natalie Rasgon, now at Stanford, and her colleagues at UCLA, published a very suggestive case report on this issue. They describe the experience of a woman who did not get better with an anti-depressant, but then got well and stayed well when her metabolic syndrome (a variant called PCOS) was treated. What was the treatment? The same medication that is commonly used for type II diabetes: metformin (Glucophage). A handful of other patients have also reported mood improvement on metformin, but this approach has not been studied. More on my website; see the Notes page.

- Remember that when weight gain occurs, medications are not always the guilty party. The very conditions we are treating on the Mood Spectrum from depression to bipolar disorder can also cause weight gain. However, mood medications themselves definitely are often involved, and some very frequently. Medications for the bipolar end of the Mood Spectrum are most commonly associated with this problem, but even antidepressants can be a problem.

- Exercising Using medications that are not associated with weight gain Avoiding simple sugars Unfortunately, these most important strategies are also so unrealistic that the list should really read more like this:   Exercise—you can't beat it, but you can't do it either, right? Use medications that are not associated with weight gain—great idea, got any? Avoid simple sugars—so don't eat what everything around you tells you to? Let's look at each of these great ideas, and their problems, before we come to the less preferred solutions. ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2803))

- Exercise This solution—and the reasons why it is not happening despite being so obvious—are so important that I'm going to drag you through an entire chapter about it. Chapter 13 focuses on why people don't exercise, and what you can learn from that. Remember, exercise is one of the most logical, safest, and most effective approaches to controlling weight gain. It could be even better than that: it may even directly target the causes of weight gain from stress, mood problems, and the medications that often are used in treating these problems. Remember that metabolic syndrome appears to be caused by all three: stress, a prime cause of depression in the first place; mood problems, which after a time can become a separate cause of weight gain; and finally, mood stabilizing medications. At this point, it appears that much of the weight gain caused by mood disorders stems from the biochemical changes of metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance. But exercise reduces insulin resistance! Should I say that again? Do you see how direct a solution is available through exercise? If insulin resistance is at the core of the weight gain caused by stress, mood problems, and medications, then exercise is a logical means of preventing the weight gain in the first place.

- Remember this when we come back to it in Chapter 13: exercise is a highly specific antidote to one of the most significant side effects you could experience with Mood Spectrum symptoms and medications. Of course, it has other health benefits—including having its own antidepressant effects! You can understand why I'd love to have a system where anyone who wants me to treat their mood problem must first either become a regular exerciser or have a clear reason why no form of exercise is possible (a rare thing).

- If metabolic syndrome and mood do have some sort of connection, might a low-carbohydrate diet improve mood? This is a logical conclusion given what I've said thus far, and it is a very important question. To my knowledge, however, all we have on that question is a single unpublished case report, which is equivalent to no evidence at all. Nevertheless, you may find it interesting that a woman wrote me describing her husband's mood shifts as he went on and off the Atkins diet. He was taking lithium and an antidepressant. When he went off the Atkins diet, he did so in a big way: eating an entire package of cookies ([Location 2890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2890))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- at once, for example. When he did this, his irritability returned. When he got back on the diet, his irritability would go away. This case, by itself, means almost nothing, but it is an interesting story. After all, you might know of someone who can eat an entire package of cookies and not get irritable. That is, irritability does not directly result from eating a huge amount of refined sugar, as far as is known. But perhaps some people with Mood Spectrum symptoms might be more likely to experience such changes. That is just a guess at this point. Overall, the entire story of metabolic syndrome drives home one point: we can't just sit back and blame the medications, even though they are part of the problem (often a big part). We also have to look at stress, exercise, and diet. But if you are stuck with a medication that can cause weight gain, a few antidotes have been tried. I warn you in advance: none is useful enough to have become a regular strategy in my practice, and so far I still don't have a single patient pursuing any of these ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2894))

- Three lifestyle management techniques can help control your symptoms: manage sleep closely, manage stresses as you are able, and be very careful with alcohol if you use any at all, while avoiding most other drugs. Exercise, a fourth technique, is so important that it gets its own chapter. (I know you're looking forward to it—if only because it's the last one!) Some people might be able to manage their symptoms with these techniques alone, although that's uncommon. Even if the techniques don't end up helping you much, none will hurt you, at least not much. The problem is that you, like everyone else, also want to have as normal a life as possible. The challenge is to balance that wish with the need to do what you can to keep this mood thing under control as much as possible without relying on medications to do so. Remember, none of the following strategies are all-or-none. Each can be used to a limited extent if you don't go for the full version. Think about starting small and see how that goes first.

- Clinical experience has also shown that sleep has something to do with health, especially mental health. People with bipolar disorders who miss too much sleep can have a manic or hypomanic episode. In other words, sleep deprivation is pro-manic. It promotes shifting toward mania. The opposite is true as well: getting too much sleep is associated with depression. Researchers have shown ([Location 2979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=2979))

- that if you wake a depressed patient at 4 A.M. and keep him up, his mood will improve that very day. (Unfortunately, when he sleeps again, his mood will worsen, so this is not a practical long-term solution.) So the right amount of sleep, which for most people seems to be about eight hours, seems to have a mood-stabilizing effect. This is a very powerful effect for some people. The good news is that you can strongly affect your mood stability simply by keeping regular sleeping hours. The bad news is that you sometimes will see your mood destabilized by variations in sleep that are forced upon you, by work, relationships, or even simply traveling across time zones. (We humans have no evolutionary experience with that kind of dramatic change in our relationship with the sun!) What's the connection between sleep and mood stability? As yet, this is not known. It will be one of the exciting stories to watch in the next decade or so, during which the answer will, I hope, emerge. For now, enough is known to say that sleep management is a very important part of mood symptom management.

- you need to understand a bit more about how your internal clock operates, because it very strongly determines your sleep patterns.

- This research shows that the biological clock has a very strong impact on bipolar patterns. This is not surprising in light of clinical experience. When people are manic, something is wrong with their clock. Their bodies don't seem to cycle naturally into sleep mode at night. They can be in daytime ([Location 3002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3002))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- action mode all night (much to the disappointment of the hospital night shift, who otherwise can get a lot of work done and occasionally even sleep). Less obvious but equally as mistimed is the experience of bipolar depression, in which people can feel like they are in sleep mode nearly all day, sleeping as much as sixteen hours or more in every twenty-four. This can go on for days, sometimes weeks, and occasionally for months. Imagine what you'd think if this was happening and you did not know you had a bipolar disorder. If your family, friends, or coworkers did not know about or understand bipolar disorder, imagine what they would think. You may know from painful personal experience just how they would interpret one of these phases (saying you're lazy, have no gumption, are disrespectful, and so forth). Thus the biological clock somehow is very deeply involved in bipolar symptom creation. Fortunately some clues about what's wrong with the clock are beginning to emerge, and this time one of the sources is a treatment, rather than a research team examining cells and molecules. To understand this treatment and what it may indicate about bipolar disorders, you need to understand a few more features of the clock.

- Making Sleep Regular If the enforced-darkness approach in the following sidebar sounds too restrictive (which it does to virtually all my patients), you can still use its general principle: regular sleep in the dark is a crucial part of bipolar symptom management. Almost all people can tell that their mood stability suffers when they stay up too late (especially for several nights in a row). They are likely to find hypomanic symptoms creeping in, such as irritability and accelerated, fragmented thinking. Not long thereafter, depressed symptoms often follow.

- The disappearance of natural light at dusk also affects the clock, though not as strongly as morning light. Evening light exposure may be a very important variable in patients with bipolar mood variations. In modern societies, with our houses and window coverings, we live in simulated caves. Our eyes may not be able to see the real dawn while we are asleep, but even more artificial is the amount of electric light we use at night. Few people get to experience the gradual disappearance of the sun, shifting first to dusk and finally to darkness, every day. Most people live in prolonged day, and then finally turn it abruptly off at bedtime. They hope to fall asleep in the complete darkness that began only minutes before. Sounds a bit odd, doesn't it? Yet isn't that the norm in modern societies? Surely it's the norm at your house? You're thinking, "I know where he's going with this, and I don't like the sound of it." Before you start reaching any conclusions, though, take a look at the experience of one patient whose rapid-cycling bipolar disorder was treated with no medications, and imagine what a smaller dose ([Location 3034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3034))

- stay out another four hours a day—until 10 P.M. He remained stable for more than a year (at which point the graphs stop) on this regimen of ten hours of darkness nightly. This "dark therapy" worked similarly for another patient in Switzerland with rapid cycling who was also taking a mood stabilizer. The researchers there noted that his rapid cycling responded immediately when he was given even just ten hours nightly of required darkness. (They called it a ten-hour dark/rest period.) So for you, would perhaps a bit of dark therapy help limit the amount of medication you might need? We don't really know a minimum dose for this strategy yet, but it certainly is cheap, right? You might have to buy some extra-thick curtains. You could start by hanging dark towels to see if you can make this strategy work. Oh, the kids?

- to do with them while you're in the dark for twelve hours? Good point; that might require some significant negotiation with people who might benefit if your mood is more stable. Most people encountering this treatment idea are more concerned about boredom, or being stuck with nothing to distract them from the activity of their own mind. That, too, is an understandable concern. You might have to look at the NIMH patient's graphs to see how utterly dramatic and rapid his improvement really was, to prepare yourself to try even the Swiss ten-hour approach.

- To make these ideas more practical, try this: start by trying to limit your late-night bright light exposure. Even this is going to be hard for a lot of people: it means no television or computer use after, say, about 9 P.M. One mood and light researcher even suggests getting dimmer switches for all the lights you use late at night and gradually lowering them. At least you can get one for the bathroom, so you don't turn on the shaving lights at 10:30 P.M. to brush your teeth! That's the wrong message to be sending your hypothalamus, you see? You don't have to place yourself in a dark room at 6 P.M. to benefit from these ideas. You could shoot for a gradual dimming starting at 9 P.M., getting in bed in darkness by 10 P.M., and having regular rise times. For people whose mood routinely goes down in the winter, a device called a dawn simulator can help make those morning start-ups easier. It gradually turns on your bedside reading lamp over thirty to forty-five minutes, mimicking the arrival of the sun. For some people, it helps prevent the depression itself (by tricking your hypothalamus into thinking it's still July!). This device is much easier to use than a light box, as by the time you wake, the treatment is complete. It is also far cheaper.

- can be found on my website Dawn Simulator page, linked from the Notes page. Before we leave this topic, you should know that a research team has studied other social rhythms, not just sleep times. They looked at when you actually fall asleep (not just bedtime), when you eat your first meal, when you get exercise—twenty different daily rhythms. When they taught patients to try to maintain regularity in all these rhythms, those patients had better mood stability than patients receiving treatment as usual. But of all these variables, sleep was clearly the most important, regular exposure to darkness probably second, and regular morning light and rise times probably third. I strongly recommend that you work at making your own rhythms regular, in roughly that order. ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3078))

- These include learning the relationship between hot thoughts and your body's stress hormones. Cognitive therapists often quote a Greek philosopher named Epictetus, who said, "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them." You may not be able to control some of the stresses you face, but you can learn to control your reactions to them. Most people can at least learn to do so better than they did before CBT. CBT also commonly includes techniques for managing the stress that does make it past your cognitive first line of defense. Tense muscles, overfocused angry thoughts, even increased heart rate and sweating: all of these can be eased with standard behavioral techniques such as relaxation exercises. Wait, wait—before you dismiss those exercises as too soft and fuzzy, you should know that several of them are standard parts of the lives of nearly half the people on this earth. Most religions emphasize prayer or meditation, and many meditative traditions are based on focused attention, especially on one's breathing. I routinely teach a breathing technique used in these meditative traditions, without the religious overtones. This method of mindful relaxation is simple, takes only minutes to learn, and is generally very well received, even by my patients who probably would not tell anyone ([Location 3093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3093))

While we're working on getting your symptoms under control, it's wise to take alcohol out of the picture entirely. Two weeks? Can you go that long? Four weeks? Some people drink so little and care about it so little, that this is not an imposition at all, and they readily agree. But others look at me as though I'm asking an awful lot when I ask them these questions. For them, I leave it at this: just a short while—basically as long as I think they might be able to go entirely without alcohol, even if it's only two weeks. Most people can see some mood improvement in that time. My goal at this point is to get them better enough that when they start drinking again, they can see that it's making them worse. When they… ([Location 3110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3110))

- symptoms even a little better in that time, then they may recognize the sleep disruption and mood-destabilizing effects so common with even a little alcohol. Some people require even more reassurance that I am not telling them they must stop drinking forever, right now. If they seem to need such reassurance, I add that in a few weeks, they'll probably be able to try adding back a little bit of alcohol, looking for destabilizing effects. In other words, I ask them to watch out for alcohol causing the opposite effect of what we're (hopefully) already achieving by then. Then I drop the bomb, gently or firmly, depending on what this particular patient requires: most people discover at that point that they can get away with about one drink per week, sometimes two, and usually no more than one drink at a sitting. More alcohol than this generally causes some instability that they themselves can recognize, particularly if we've achieved good symptom control by that time. Again, the main point is to recognize that you are going to be the judge about how much you can ([Location 3118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0041OT92Q&location=3118))

- drink. The trick is to be a good scientist and watch your results closely. Granted, this approach does not work for everyone. But most studies show that about half of all patients with bipolar disorder use alcohol or drugs, so it's almost the norm to have to approach this topic somehow. Some people, if they hear they must give up something they've already seen that they cannot manage without, may give up on treatment. So I tend to emphasize that the patient is going to make these decisions, and I support his or her efforts to take charge of the process—including efforts to control drinking. (This approach is called Motivational Interviewing; for more information, see motivationalinterview.com.) How often do people use alcohol to treat bipolar symptoms? There is some debate about that. You'd think that people would drink when heading toward mania, trying to slow themselves down, and use stimulants when depressed, trying to get themselves going again. But often people use stimulants in the manic phase, trying for more of the same, and alcohol just about anytime. Many people use alcohol for two specific symptoms: sleep problems and social anxiety. Alcohol often helps people slow down their thinking, which makes getting to sleep much easier. Unfortunately it usually wears off about three to four hours later, at which point people rebound awake and have great difficulty getting back to sleep. Alcohol often helps with social anxiety, especially in low doses (higher doses tend to cause their own social problems!). But in both cases, the alcohol can easily make the bipolar disorder worse. I recommend to you just what I tell my own patients:   Take the alcohol out of your lifestyle entirely for starters, at least for a few weeks, but preferably until things are going quite well for you (however long that takes). Then you can try adding it back cautiously—but I suggest that you start with no more than one or two drinks per week and watch closely for any destabilizing effects.

The goal is to maintain a sensible degree of control over these lifestyle choices without having one's life shortchanged by the illness. That's a tricky balancing act.

- Five Effective Psychotherapies Two psychotherapies for Major Depression (with no bipolar component) have been tested against antidepressant medications and shown to be as effective, in several large research studies. These are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)—which you read briefly about in the last chapter—and interpersonal therapy (IPT). If you are all the way to the left on the Mood Spectrum and thus have unipolar depression, these are the two therapies generally recommended. For people whose symptoms lie farther to the right on the Mood Spectrum, variations on CBT and IPT have been developed that address hypomanic and manic symptoms as well as depression. We look first at two specific tools, called prodrome detection and social rhythm therapy, then at three more comprehensive approaches: psychoeducation, a bipolar-specific CBT, and family-focused therapy.

Several very large studies have shown CBT to be as effective as antidepressant medications for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. (Read that sentence again, it's important. Most people don't know that therapy works as well as antidepressant medications. In the next chapter, you'll see evidence that exercise also has been shown to work as well as an antidepressant.) Recently, a bipolar-specific variation of CBT, when added to standard bipolar treatment consisting of medications and regular psychiatric follow-up, has been shown to be superior to standard treatment alone.
