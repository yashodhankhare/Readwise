## Highlights
- Understanding grows from personal experience that enables a person to see and feel in ways so varied and so full of changeable meanings that one’s self-awareness is the determining factor. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=290))

- A child is only confused by questions that have been answered by someone else before he is asked. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=533))

- One of my objectives in building up this relationship with Dibs was to help him achieve emotional independence. I did not want to complicate his problem by building up a supportive relationship, to make him so dependent upon me that it would postpone the more complete development of his feelings of inner security. If Dibs was an emotionally deprived child — and indications were that he was — to attempt to develop an emotional attachment at this point might seem to be satisfying a deep need of the child, but it would create a problem that must of necessity ultimately be resolved by him.

- I attempted to keep my comments in line with his activity, trying not to say anything that would indicate any desire on my part that he do any particular thing, but rather to communicate, understandingly and simply, recognition in line with his frame of reference.

- Any exclamation of surprise or praise might be interpreted by him as the direction he must take. It might close off any other areas of exploration that might be far more important for him. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=848))

- He needed to develop strength to cope with his world, but that strength had to come from within him and he had to experience personally his ability to cope with his world as it was. Any meaningful changes for Dibs would have to come from within him. We could not hope to make over his external world.

- A child gets his feelings of security from predictable and consistent and realistic limitations. I had hoped to help Dibs differentiate between his feelings and his actions. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=1371))

- In my opinion, the therapeutic value of this kind of psychotherapy is based upon the child’s experiencing himself as a capable, responsible person in a relationship that tries to communicate to him two basic truths: that no one ever really knows as much about any human being’s inner world as does the individual himself; and that responsible freedom grows and develops from inside the person. The child must first learn self-respect and a sense of dignity that grows out of his increasing self-understanding before he can learn to respect the personalities and rights and differences of others.

- Sometimes it is very difficult to keep firmly in mind the fact that the parents, too, have reasons for what they do — have reasons, locked in the depths of their personalities, for their inability to love, to understand, to give of themselves to their children.

- “Then the psychiatrist told us, that in view of our backgrounds, he would be very frank with us. He said that Dibs was not mentally defective or psychotic or brain-damaged, but the most rejected and emotionally deprived child he had ever seen. He said that my husband and I were the ones who needed the help. He suggested treatment for both of us. It was the most shocking experience we had either of us ever had. Anyone could see that my husband and I had been functioning adequately. We had never been inclined to free and easy social life, but the few friends and professional colleagues we had respected us, and respected our desire to have our own private lives our own way! We had never had any personal problems that we could not cope with ourselves. ([Location 2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2309))

- “I tell you no one knows the terrible tragedy and agony it is to have a mentally handicapped child! The only person he has ever related to has been his grandmother. She was with us the first month of his life — and visited us once a month for three years until she moved to Florida. After that she would come twice a year and stay for about a month each time she came. Dibs always remembered her, always made up to her when she came, always missed her desperately when she left. And he seemed to count the days until she would return. “I have done everything I could for Dibs. We have given him everything money could buy, hoping that it would help. Toys. Music. Games. Books. His playroom is filled with everything we have thought might entertain, educate, and amuse him. And he has, at times, seemed to be happy in his room at home. He has always seemed happier alone. That’s why we sent Dorothy away to a boarding school near here. She comes home on weekends and vacations. I think Dibs is happier with her out of the house. I thing she is happier at the school. They do not get along at all well. Dibs strikes out at her like a wild animal if she goes near him or goes into his room.

- “Lately, he seems so unhappy. And he seems to have changed. Then, yesterday, when my husband brought Dibs home, he was upset. They were both upset. He said that Dibs was babbling like an idiot. He said it in front of Dibs.” She broke down and sobbed bitterly. “Then, I asked what Dibs had said and he said that Dibs was just babbling like an idiot! Dibs walked across the room, grabbed a chair and threw it over, knocked some things off the coffee table with a sweep of his hand, screamed at his father ‘I hate you! I hate you!’ ran up to him and kicked him again and again. My husband grabbed Dibs and after a struggle finally carried him up to his room and locked him in. When my husband came down I was crying. I couldn’t help it. I know he doesn’t like scenes. I know he despises tears. But I couldn’t stand it. I said to him, ‘Dibs wasn’t babbling like an idiot now. He said he hated you!’ Then, my husband sat down in a chair and actually wept! It was terrible. I had never seen a man cry before. I had never thought anything could cause my husband to shed a tear. I was afraid, suddenly terrified, because he seemed to be just as scared as I was. I think we were closer to each other then than we have ever been. Suddenly, we were just two frightened, lonely, unhappy people with our defenses crumpled and deserted. It was terrible — and yet a relief to know that we could be human, and could fail and admit that we had failed! Finally, we pulled ourselves together and he said that maybe we had been wrong about Dibs. I said I ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2332))

- would come and ask you what you thought about Dibs.” She looked at me with an expression of fear and panic in her eyes. “Tell me,” she said. “Do you think that Dibs is mentally defective?” ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2348))

- No matter how many times we hear this kind of outpouring (and it happens frequently), the complexity of human motivation and behavior is demonstrated over and over again. There is no single isolated experience or feeling that triggers reaction patterns. There is always an accumulation of experiences intertwined with highly personal emotions, goals, values, that motivate the person ([Location 2392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2392))

- He reached over and tapped his fingers upon the mirrored wall. “That’s someone else’s room in there,” he said. “Before, some people were sitting in that darkened room, but not today.” I was surprised at this unexpected announcement. “You think so, do you?” I asked. “I know it,” he said. “Little sounds and hushed voices have told me so.” This bit of evidence indicates how aware children are of the things around them, even though they may make no ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2489))

- comment at the time — true of Dibs and of all children. True of us, too. We do not comment verbally about everything we hear, see, think, infer. Probably only a very small percentage of our individual learning experiences are verbally communicated to others. “Have you known it, too?” he asked me. “Yes,” I replied.

- “Yes. Once I did. I didn’t get to the top of it,” he added wistfully. “But I stood at the bottom of it and looked up. I think every child should have a hill all his own to climb. And I think every child should have one star up in the sky that is all his own. And I think every child should have a tree that belongs to him. That’s what I think should be,” he added, and he looked at me and nodded with emphasis, as he spoke. ([Location 2849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=2849))

- “What is therapy?” he asked me. I was astonished. “Therapy?” I said. “Well, let me think for a minute.” Why had he asked this question, I wondered. What explanation would make a sensible reply? “I would say that it means a chance to come here and play and talk just about any way you want to,” I said. “It’s a time when you can be the way you want to be. A time you can use any way you want to use it. A time when you can be you.” That was the best explanation I could come up with then. He took the card out of my hand. He turned it to the other side. “I know what this means,” he said. “‘Do not disturb’ means everybody please let them alone. Don’t bother them. Don’t go in. Don’t knock on the door, either. Just let them ([Location 3386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=3386))

- And I was left with my speculations and the inferences I might draw from some of this conversation with Dibs. He seemed to be more at ease in his relationship with his mother. There were indications that Dibs was being treated with more consideration, understanding, and respect at home. Even “Papa” seemed to be emerging as more of a person. But were they changing in their behavior towards Dibs? Or had Dibs changed in his capacity to relate to his mother and father so that he could receive their advances toward him more naturally? Certainly they had provided ample material things to feed his keen intellectual capacities. Certainly, they had attempted to communicate with him and to teach him many things. It was exceedingly difficult to understand how they could have felt this child was mentally defective when they had been providing materials far beyond the capacities of an average child of Dibs’ age. Certainly they must have known that Dibs’ problem was not due to any lack of intellectual ability. But why did he still maintain ([Location 3610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=3610))

- “You liked Grandma sending you the surprise, didn’t you?” I commented. “Yes. Oh, yes! And on May twelfth Grandma comes home!” Dibs announced. He looked at me, eyes shining, a big smile on his face. “Grandma comes home,” he repeated. “Be glad!” he exclaimed. “May twelfth and grandma comes home.” “I think that makes you feel very, very happy,” I said. “You’ll be glad to see Grandma, won’t you?” “That’s right!” Dibs said. “So glad I could burst.” He started to sing again.   “To Dibs, with love from Grandma To Dibs with love, with love. Grandma comes! Grandma comes! Grandma comes marching home With love!” ([Location 3753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=3753))

- He discovered a blank page in the back of the calendar. “Take this off?” he said. “If you want to.” He did. “There are no blank days in the year,” he said. “They all have a number and a name and they belong to somebody.” “They do?” “Yes,” he replied. “There are none that don’t belong to somebody.” He turned to September twenty-third. “I shall call this the first day of autumn,” he said. He printed on this date the words “Welcome Fall.” ([Location 3963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=3963))

- So many times a child is not accepted for therapy if the parents refuse to participate and get help for themselves. No one knows how many children are turned away because of this factor. Many times it is more helpful if the parents do come in and work out their share of the problems in the relationship. But it is also true that parents can agree to therapy and be so resistive that little is accomplished. If they are not ready for such an experience, they can seldom profit from it. The defensiveness of a threatened person can be insurmountable. Fortunately for Dibs, his parents were sufficiently sensitive to their child that they, too, changed in understanding and appreciation of his growth. Not only was Dibs finding himself but so were his parents. ([Location 5167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=5167))

- “Tell me,” he said suddenly. “Why do some people believe in God and some not believe?” “I don’t think I know how to answer that question, Dibs,” I said. “But it is true that some people do believe and some do not?” “Yes. I think so.” “Grandmother believes. But Papa and Mother are not church-believers. And Jake believed. He told me about it.” “I think everyone makes up his own mind,” I said. “Each person decides for himself.” ([Location 6356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079QBT2RB&location=6356))
