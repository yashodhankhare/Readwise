## Highlights
- We are all so busy talking on the phone, answering e-mails, and going to meetings that we don’t have any time left to read, think, and play with ideas. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=243))

- Most people easily appreciate the value of diverse thinking. But many readers view diversity as something that’s nice to have, not something that’s essential to success. In contrast, I have come to believe cognitive diversity is crucial to solving complex problems. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=246))

- Notwithstanding Page’s theoretical contribution, you might ask whether there’s any actual evidence for diversity’s value in predicting the outcomes of complex problems. The answer, a resounding yes, is based on psychologist Phil Tetlock’s remarkable research summarized in his book Expert Political Judgment. Tetlock asked hundreds of experts to make thousands of predictions about economic and political events over a fifteen-year span. He then did something quite rude. He kept track of their results. Expert forecasters were, on balance, deeply unimpressive. But Tetlock found some were better than others. What separated the forecasters was how they thought. The experts who knew a little about a lot—the diverse thinkers—did better than the experts who knew one big thing. Two sources in particular have inspired my thinking on diversity. The first is the mental-models approach to investing, tirelessly advocated by Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger. The second is the Santa Fe Institute (SFI… ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=251))

- Munger, a mental model is a tool—a framework that helps you understand the problem you face. He argues for constructing a latticework of models so you can effectively solve as many problems as possible. The idea is to fit a model to the problem and not, in his words, to “torture reality” to fit your model. Certain character traits encourage the mental-models method to blossom. Fortunately, these are mostly traits you can choose: intellectual curiosity, integrity, patience, and self-criticism. Problem-solving success is not just a matter of IQ. As Munger notes, the great naturalist Charles Darwin’s worldview-changing results reflect more his working method than his raw intellect. On the flip side, examples abound of smart people making bad decisions, often showing inflexibility or a failure to appreciate psychology’s lessons. A mental-models approach does not come without a cost, though. You need to spend substantial time and effort learning about various disciplines. Without a doubt, too, your learning may not be useful right away (in fact, it may never be useful). The good news is there are typically only a few big ideas in each discipline that you’ll need to… ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=262))

- Finally, a word on how to read this book. Unlike a best-selling thriller, you can read More Than You Know from back to front just as easily as from front to back. But I recommend you simply go to the table of contents, find something that interests you, and jump in. While the essays cover a range of topics, I categorize them into four parts—investment philosophy, psychology of investing, innovation and competitive strategy, and science and complexity theory. Consider these compartments in a toolbox, each addressing a distinct facet of investing. That said, every essay is meant to stand by itself.

- Investment philosophy is important because it dictates how you should make decisions. A sloppy philosophy inevitably leads to poor long-term results. But even a good investment philosophy will not help you unless you combine it with discipline and patience. A quality investment philosophy is like a good diet: it only works if it is sensible over the long haul and you stick with it. Investment philosophy is really about temperament, not raw intelligence. In fact, a proper temperament will beat a high IQ all day. Once you’ve established a solid philosophical foundation, the rest is learning, hard work, focus, patience, and experience.

- First, in any probabilistic field—investing, handicapping, or gambling—you’re better off focusing on the decision-making process than on the short-term outcome. This emphasis is much easier announced than achieved because outcomes are objective while processes are more subjective. But a quality process, which often includes a large dose of theory, is the surest path to long-term success. That leads to the second theme, the importance of taking a long-term perspective. You simply cannot judge results in a probabilistic system over the short term because there is way too much randomness. This creates a problem, of course; by the time you can tell an investment process is poor, it is often too late to salvage decent results. So a good process has to rest on solid building blocks. The final theme is the importance of internalizing a probabilistic approach. Psychology teaches us there are a lot of glitches in the probability module of our mental hardwiring. We see patterns where none exist. We fail to consider the range of possible outcomes. Our probability assessments shift based on how others present information to us. Proper investment philosophy helps patch up some of those glitches, improving the chances of long-term success. A closing thought: The sad truth is that incentives have diluted the importance of investment philosophy in recent decades. While well intentioned and hard working, corporate executives and money managers too frequently prioritize growing the business over delivering superior results for shareholders. Increasingly, hired managers get paid to play, not to win. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=321))

- The goal of an investment process is unambiguous: to identify gaps between a company’s stock price and its expected value. Expected value, in turn, is the weighted-average value for a distribution of possible outcomes. You calculate it by multiplying the payoff (i.e., stock price) for a given outcome by the probability that the outcome materializes.2 ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=366))

- Perhaps the single greatest error in the investment business is a failure to distinguish between the knowledge of a company’s fundamentals and the expectations implied by the market price. Note the consistency between Michael Steinhardt and Steven Crist, two very successful individuals in two very different fields: I defined variant perception as holding a well-founded view that was meaningfully different from market consensus.... Understanding market expectation was at least as important as, and often different from, the fundamental knowledge.3   The issue is not which horse in the race is the most likely winner, but which horse or horses are offering odds that exceed their actual chances of victory.... This may sound elementary, and many players may think that they are following this principle, but few actually do. Under this mindset, everything but the odds fades from view. There is no such thing as “liking” a horse to win a race, only an attractive discrepancy between his chances and his price.4 A thoughtful investment process contemplates both probability and payoffs and carefully considers where the consensus—as revealed by a price—may be wrong. Even though there are also some important features that make investing different than, say, a casino or the track, the basic idea is the same: you want the positive expected value on your side.

- So some high-probability propositions are unattractive, and some low-probability propositions are very attractive on an expected-value basis. Say there’s a 75 percent probability that a stock priced for perfection makes its earnings number and, hence, rises 1 percent, but there’s a 25 percent likelihood that the company misses its forecast and plummets 10 percent. That stock offers a great probability but a negative expected value.12 ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=410))

- One of my former students, a very successful hedge fund manager, called to tell me that he is abolishing the use of target prices in his firm for two reasons. First, he wants all of the analysts to express their opinions in expected value terms, an exercise that compels discussion about payoffs and probabilities. Entertaining various outcomes also mitigates the risk of excessive focus on a particular scenario—a behavioral pitfall called “anchoring.” ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=430))

- The investment community, because of incentives and measurement systems, is too focused on outcome and not enough on process. In Rubin’s words: It’s not that results don’t matter. They do. But judging solely on results is a serious deterrent to taking risks that may be necessary to making the right decision. Simply put, the way decisions are evaluated affects the way decisions are made.14 ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=441))

- Our scouting report of the S&P 500 might also note that the committee does no macroeconomic forecasting, invests long-term with low portfolio turnover, and is unconstrained by sector or industry limitations, position weightings, investment-style parameters, or performance pressures. Also critical is that index funds closely track the S&P 500 at a very low cost. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=482))

- The portfolio manager’s answer is a great lesson inherent in any probabilistic exercise: the frequency of correctness does not matter; it is the magnitude of correctness that matters. Say that you own four stocks, and that three of the stocks go down a bit but the fourth rises substantially. The portfolio will perform well even as the majority of the stocks decline.

- The percentage of stocks that go up in a portfolio does not determine its performance; it is the dollar change in the portfolio. A few stocks going up or down dramatically will often have a much greater impact on portfolio performance than the batting average.

- In his provocative book Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb relates an anecdote that beautifully drives home the expected value message.3 In a meeting with his fellow traders, a colleague asked Taleb about his view of the market. He responded that he thought there was a high probability that the market would go up slightly over the next week. Pressed further, he assigned a 70 percent probability to the up move. Someone in the meeting then noted that Taleb was short a large quantity of S&P 500 futures—a bet that the market would go down—seemingly in contrast to his “bullish” outlook. Taleb then explained his position in expected-value terms. Exhibit 3.1 clarifies his thought. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=600))

- In this case, the most probable outcome is that the market goes up. But the expected value is negative, because the outcomes are asymmetric.4 Now think about it in terms of stocks. Stocks are sometimes priced for perfection. Even if the company makes or slightly exceeds its numbers the majority of the time (frequency), the price does not rise much. But if the company misses its numbers, the downside to the shares is dramatic. The satisfactory result has a high frequency, but the expected value is negative. Now consider the downtrodden stock. The majority of the time it disappoints, nudging the stock somewhat lower. But a positive result leads to a sharp upside move. Here, the probability favors a poor result, but the expected value is favorable. Investors must constantly look past frequencies and consider expected value. As it turns out, this is how the best performers think in all probabilistic fields. Yet in many ways it is unnatural: investors want their stocks to go up, not down. Indeed, the main practical result of prospect theory is that investors tend to sell their winners too early (satisfying the desire to be right) and hold their losers too long (in the hope that they don’t have to take a loss). We now turn to three leading practitioners in separate probabilistic fields: investing, pari-mutuel betting, and blackjack.

- Warren Buffett, undoubtedly one of the twentieth century’s best investors, says that smarts and talent are like a motor’s horsepower, but that the motor’s output depends on rationality. “A lot of people start out with a 400-horsepower motor but only get 100 horsepower of output,” he said. “It’s way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all into output.” 5 And one of the keys is to consider all investment opportunities in terms of expected value. As Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger notes, “one of the advantages of a fellow like Buffett is that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees.”6 Says Buffett, “Take the probability of loss times the amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of possible gain. That is what we’re trying to do. It’s imperfect, but that’s what it’s all about.”7 Naturally, coming up with likely outcomes and appropriate probabilities is not an easy task. But the discipline of the process compels an investor to think through how various changes in expectations for value triggers—sales, costs, and investments—affect shareholder value, as well as the likelihood of various outcomes. Such an exercise also helps overcome the loss-aversion pitfall.8 The expected-value mindset is by no means limited to investing. The book, Bet with the Best, offers various strategies for pari-mutuel bettors. Steven Crist, CEO, editor, and publisher of the Daily Racing Form, shows the return on investment, including the track’s take, of a hypothetical race with four horses. To summarize the lesson, he writes, “The point of this exercise is to illustrate that even a horse with a very high likelihood of winning can be either a very good or a very bad bet, and that the difference between the two is determined by only one thing: the odds.” So a horse with a 50 percent probability of winning can be either a good or bad bet based on the payoff, and the same holds true of a 10-to-1 shot. He is saying, in plain words, it is not the frequency of winning that matters, but the frequency times the magnitude of the payoff.9 Crist also solicits a confession from his readers: “Now ask yourself: Do you really think this way when you’re handicapping? Or do you find horses you ‘like’ and hope for the best on price? Most honest players admit they follow the latter path.” Replace the word “handicapping” with “investing” and “horses” with “stocks,” and Crist could be talking about the stock market.

- Constantly thinking in expected-value terms requires discipline and is somewhat unnatural. But the leading thinkers and practitioners from somewhat varied fields have converged on the same formula: focus not on the frequency of correctness but on the magnitude of correctness.

- Investment approaches based solely on attributes, without considering the circumstances, also don’t make sense. Sometimes a stock that looks expensive is cheap, and what looks cheap is expensive. It’s context dependent. Yet investment consultants encourage, nay, compel most investment professionals to articulate an attribute-based investment approach and stick with it. The game is pretty straightforward. Growth investors strive to beat the market by filling their portfolios with companies that are rapidly increasing sales and earnings, without too much concern about valuation. Value investors load up on cheap stocks with a decent yield and consider corporate growth gravy. Organization or external constraints aside, most money managers actually believe their attribute-based investment style—combined with their skill—will generate market-beating results.2 These various investment approaches are grounded in theory: a belief that investor actions will lead to satisfactory outcomes. The word “theory,” however, makes most investors and corporate managers leery because they associate theory with theoretical, which implies impractical. But if you define theory as a contingent explanation of cause and effect, it is eminently practical. A sound theory helps predict how actions or events lead to specific outcomes across a broad range of circumstances.3 The main message is that much of investment theory is unsound because it is based on poor categorization. We can say the same about much of management theory.4 More specifically, investors generally dwell on attribute-based categorizations (like low multiples) versus circumstance-based categorizations. A shift from attribute- to circumstance-based thinking can be of great help to investors and managers. Take a lesson from the slime mold.

- All investors use theory, either wittingly or unwittingly. The lesson from the process of theory building is that sound theories reflect context. Too many investors cling to attribute-based approaches and wring their hands when the market doesn’t conform to what they think it should do.

- So how should we think about risk and uncertainty? A logical starting place is Frank Knight’s distinction: Risk has an unknown outcome, but we know what the underlying outcome distribution looks like. Uncertainty also implies an unknown outcome, but we don’t know what the underlying distribution looks like. So games of chance like roulette or blackjack are risky, while the outcome of a war is uncertain. Knight said that objective probability is the basis for risk, while subjective probability underlies uncertainty.

- In his book Calculated Risks, Gigerenzer provides three ways to get to a probability. These classifications follow a progression from least to most concrete and can help investors classify probability statements:3 ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=800))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Degrees of belief. Degrees of belief are subjective probabilities and are the most liberal means to translate uncertainty into a probability. The point here is that investors can translate even onetime events into probabilities provided they satisfy the laws of probability—the exhaustive and exclusive set of alternatives adds up to one. Also, investors can frequently update probabilities based on degrees of belief when new, relevant information becomes available. • Propensities. Propensity-based probabilities reflect the properties of the object or system. For example, if a die is symmetrical and balanced, then you have a one-in-six probability of rolling any particular side. The risk assessment in the DASA and NASA cases appears to be propensity-based. This method of probability assessment does not always consider all the factors that may shape an outcome (such as human error in the rocket launchings). • Frequencies. Here the probability is based on a large number of observations in an appropriate reference class. Without an appropriate reference class, there can be no frequency-based probability assessment. So frequency users would not care what someone believes the outcome of a die roll will be, nor would they care about the design of the die. They would focus only on the yield of repeated die rolls. What about long-term stock market returns? Much of the ink spilled on market prognostications is based on degrees of belief, with the resulting probabilities heavily colored by recent experience. Degrees of belief have a substantial emotional component. We can also approach the stock market from a propensity perspective. According to Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run, U.S. stocks have generated annual real returns just under 7 percent over the past 200 years, including many subperiods within that time.4 The question is whether there are properties that underlie the economy and profit growth that support this very consistent return result. We can also view the market from a frequency perspective. For example, we can observe the market’s annual returns from 1926 through 2006. This distribution of returns has an arithmetic average of 12.0 percent, with a standard deviation of 20.1 percent (provided that the statistics of normal distributions apply). If we assume that distribution of future annual returns will be similar to that of the past (i.e., the last eighty years is a legitimate reference class), we can make statements about the probabilities of future annual returns.5 Of the three ways to come up with probabilities, the academic finance community is largely in the last camp. Most of the models in finance assume that price changes follow a normal distribution. One example is the Black-Scholes options-pricing model, where one of the key inputs is volatility—or the standard deviation of future price changes. But stock price changes are not normally distributed, which has implications for our notions of risk and uncertainty, market timing,… ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=803))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In plain words, this analysis shows that extreme-return days play a much more significant role in shaping the market’s total returns than a normal distribution suggests. It also makes a strong case against market timing, unless an investor has a systematic way to anticipate extreme-return days. A final thought on extreme-return days is that they do not appear randomly throughout the time series but rather tend to cluster (see exhibit 5.1). So our exercise of knocking out high and low return days is not very realistic because in the real data these extreme days (up and down) come in bunches.

- How Predictions Change Future Payoffs A lot of issues surround prediction, but in this discussion of risk and uncertainty, I focus on how, in markets, acting on a prediction can change the prediction’s outcome. One way to think about it is to contrast a roulette wheel with a pari-mutuel betting system. If you play a fair game of roulette, whatever prediction you make will not affect the outcome. The prediction’s outcome is independent of the prediction itself. Contrast that with a prediction at the racetrack. If you believe a particular horse is likely to do better than the odds suggest, you will bet on the horse. But your bet will help shape the odds. For instance, if all bettors predict a particular horse will win, the odds will reflect that prediction, and the return on investment will be poor. The analogy carries into the stock market. If you believe a stock is undervalued and start to buy it, you will help raise the price, thus driving down prospective returns. This point underscores the importance of expected value, a central concept in any probabilistic exercise. Expected value formalizes the idea that your return on an investment is the product of the probabilities of various outcomes and the payoff from each outcome.6 ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=849))

- Peter Bernstein once said, “The fundamental law of investing is the uncertainty of the future.” As investors, our challenge is to translate those uncertainties into probabilities and payoffs in the search for attractive securities. An ability to classify probability statements can be very useful in this endeavor. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=861))

- Decomposing the data, Tetlock found that while expert predictions were poor overall, some were better than others. What mattered in predictive ability was not who the people were or what they believed, but rather how they thought. Using a metaphor from Archilochus (via Isaiah Berlin), Tetlock segregated the experts into hedgehogs and foxes. Hedgehogs know one big thing and extend the explanatory reach of that thing to everything they encounter. Foxes, in contrast, tend to know a little about a lot and are not wedded to a single explanation for complex problems. Two of Tetlock’s discoveries are particularly relevant. The first is a correlation between media contact and poor predictions. Tetlock notes that “betterknown forecasters—those more likely to be fêted by the media—were less calibrated than their lower-profile colleagues.”10 The research provides yet another reason to be wary of the radio and television talking heads. Second, Tetlock found foxes tend to be better predictors than hedgehogs. He writes: ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=963))

- High scorers look like foxes: thinkers who know many small things (tricks of their trade), are skeptical of grand schemes, see explanation and prediction not as deductive exercises but rather exercises in flexible “ad hocery” that require stitching together diverse sources of information, and are rather diffident about their own forecasting prowess.11 We can say that hedgehogs have one power tool while foxes have many tools in their toolbox. Of course, hedgehogs solve certain problems brilliantly—they certainly get their fifteen minutes of fame—but don’t predict as well over time as the foxes do, especially as conditions change. Tetlock’s research provides scholarly evidence of diversity’s power. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=972))

- Humans are natural pattern seekers. One well-known example is the hot hand in basketball. A player who makes a few baskets in a row is considered to have a hot hand, which implies that he has a higher-than-normal chance of sinking his next shot. Research shows that sports fans, and the athletes themselves, believe in the hot hand phenomenon. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=987))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There’s only one problem: The hot hand does not exist. Scientists studied a season’s worth of shooting statistics of the Philadelphia 76ers and free-throw records of the Boston Celtics and found no evidence for the hot hand. Players did make successive shots, of course, but those streaks were completely consistent with probabilities. Streaks and slumps lie within the domain of chance.1 We see patterns where none exist because we’re wired to expect that the characteristics of chance show up not just in a total sequence but also in small parts of the sequence. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman call this “belief in the law of small numbers.” For example, if you show someone a short section of a long coin-toss series, he will expect to see a fifty/fifty mix between heads and tails even though a short section will generally deviate systematically from chance. Even a short sequence of repeated heads is enough to convince most people (falsely) that the longer sequence is not random. That’s the reason we believe in hot hands.2 The main point here, though, is not that humans are poor at relating probabilities to sequences of outcomes. The more important issue is that streaks inform us about probabilities. In human endeavors, unlike a fair coin toss, the probabilities of success or failure are not the same for each individual. Long success streaks happen to the most skillful in a field precisely because their general chance of success is higher than average.

- Was Miller lucky along the way? Without a doubt. But as Stephen Jay Gould says, long streaks are extraordinary luck imposed on great skill.11 The central message is that across domains, long streaks typically indicate skill. And since humans have a hard time relating to all but the easiest probabilities, we often fail to see the significance of streaks.

- In the early 1960s, economist Paul Samuelson offered his lunch colleagues a bet where he would pay $200 for a correct call of a fair coin toss and he would collect $100 for an incorrect call. But his partners didn’t bite. One distinguished scholar replied, “I won’t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I’ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets” (emphasis added). This response prompted Samuelson to prove a theorem showing that “no sequence is acceptable if each of its single plays is not acceptable.” According to economic theory, his learned colleague’s answer was irrational.1 Even though the lunch bet has a positive expected value, Samuelson’s proof doesn’t feel quite right to most people. The concept of loss aversion explains why. One of prospect theory’s main findings, loss aversion says that given a choice between risky outcomes we are about two times as averse to losses than to comparable gains.2 So Samuelson’s theoretical proof notwithstanding, most people intuitively agree with his lunch partner: The prospective regret of losing $100 on a single toss exceeds the pleasure of winning $200. An opportunity to take the bet repeatedly, on the other hand, seems sensible because there are lower odds of suffering regret. One significant difference between expected-utility theory (the basis for Samuelson’s proof ) and prospect theory is the decision frame. Expected-utility theory considers gains and losses in the context of the investor’s total wealth (broad frame). In contrast, prospect theory considers gains and losses versus isolated components of wealth, like changes in a specific stock or a portfolio price (narrow frame). Experimental studies show that investors use price, or changes in price, as a reference point when evaluating financial transactions. Said differently, investors pay attention to the narrow frame.3 If prospect theory does indeed explain investor behavior, the probabilities of a stock (or portfolio) rising and the investment-evaluation period become paramount. I want to shine a light on the policies regarding these two variables. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1098))

- Explaining the Equity-Risk Premium One of finance’s big puzzles is why equity returns have been so much higher than fixed-income returns over time, given the respective risk of each asset class. From 1900 through 2006, stocks in the United States have earned a 5.7 percent annual premium over treasury bills (geometric returns). Other developed countries around the world have seen similar results.4 In a trailblazing 1995 paper, Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler suggested a solution to the equity risk premium puzzle based on what they called “myopic loss aversion.” Their argument rests on two conceptual pillars:5 1. Loss aversion. We regret losses two to two and a half times more than similar-sized gains. Since the stock price is generally the frame of reference, the probability of loss or gain is important. Naturally, the longer the holding period in a financial market the higher the probability of a positive return. (Financial markets must have a positive expected return to lure capital, since investors must forgo current consumption.) 2. Myopia. The more frequently we evaluate our portfolios, the more likely we are to see losses and hence suffer from loss aversion. Inversely, the less frequently investors evaluate their portfolios, the more likely they are to see gains. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1118))

- If Benartzi and Thaler are right, the implication is critical: Long-term investors (individuals who evaluate their portfolios infrequently) are willing to pay more for an identical risky asset than short-term investors (frequent evaluation). Valuation depends on your time horizon. This may be why many long-term investors say they don’t care about volatility. Immune to short-term squiggles, these investors hold stocks long enough to get an attractive probability of a return and, hence, a positive utility. Benartzi and Thaler, using a number of simulation approaches, estimate that the evaluation period consistent with the realized equity-risk premium is about one year. It is important to note that the evaluation period is not the same as the investor’s planning horizon. An investor may be saving for retirement thirty years from now, but if she evaluates her portfolio (or more accurately, experiences the utility of the gains and losses) annually or quarterly, she is acting as if she has a short-term planning horizon.8 I will now make a leap (and hopefully it’s not too far) and suggest that for most funds, portfolio turnover is a reasonable proxy for the evaluation period. High turnover would be consistent with seeking gains in a relatively short time, and low turnover suggests a willingness to wait to assess gains and losses. For many successful funds (and companies), the evaluation period is a policy choice. And as Warren Buffett says, you eventually get the shareholders you deserve.

- Despite consistent evidence supporting the performance benefits of a buy-and-hold strategy, the average actively managed mutual fund has annual turnover nearly 90 percent. What gives? First off, an efficient stock market requires investor diversity—across styles and time horizons. Not everyone can, or should, be a long-term investor. This fallacy of composition is the flaw behind the “Dow 36,000” theory, which argues that if all investors adopt a long-term horizon, the equity-risk premium will dissipate and the market will enjoy a onetime rise.9 Changing the nature of the investors changes the nature of the market. If all investors were long-term oriented, the market would suffer a diversity breakdown and hence be less efficient than today’s market.

- A second and much more profound reason for high turnover is agency costs. Studies show that a portfolio of stocks trading below expected value will outperform the market (adjusted for risk) over time. But because there is such a focus on outcome versus process, most institutional investors have time horizons that are substantially shorter than what an investment strategy requires to pay off. Portfolio managers who underperform the market risk losing assets, and ultimately their jobs.10 So their natural reaction is to minimize tracking error versus a benchmark. Many portfolio managers won’t buy a controversial stock that they think will be attractive over a three-year horizon because they have no idea whether or not the stock will perform well over a three-month horizon. This may explain some of the overreaction we see in markets and shows why myopic loss aversion may be an important source of inefficiency.

- Consider the observation of Warren Buffett, one of the great capital allocators in American business history: [T]he heads of many companies are not skilled in capital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such as marketing, production, engineering, administration or, sometimes, institutional politics.   Once they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities. They now must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that they may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered. To stretch the point, it’s as if the final step for a highly-talented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but, instead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve.   The lack of skill that many CEOs have at capital allocation is no small matter: After ten years on the job, a CEO whose company annually retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will have been responsible for the deployment of more than 60% of all the capital at work in the business. CEOs who recognize their lack of capital-allocation skills (which not all do) will often try to compensate by turning to their staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers. Charlie and I have frequently observed the consequences of such “help.” On balance, we feel it is more likely to accentuate the capital-allocation problem than to solve it.   In the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes place in corporate America.

In most cases, a traditional business school education won’t help you much in these crucial areas. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1349))

- it’s not enough to have your own view, you have to consider what other people think. Neoclassical economics likes to treat humans as deductive processing machines; we can go from general premises to specific conclusions. The trouble is, in all but the simplest situations (think tic-tac-toe), we simply don’t have the computational ability to operate deductively. Indeed, humans tend to be superb pattern recognizers—so good, in fact, that we see patterns where none exist. Toss out rational decision making, and things start to get complicated. Investing is interactive, probabilistic, and noisy. As a result, successful decision making requires an investor to have a good grasp of psychology. Unfortunately, there’s no one source with all of the answers, and improvement requires constant effort. But there’s no way to avoid it.

- In his delightful book Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, renowned brain researcher and stress expert Robert Sapolsky highlights a crucial point: the body’s physiological responses are well adapted for dealing with short-term physical threats. Those are the kinds of threats that we humans have faced for most of our existence. The problem is the psychological stress that we experience today triggers the same physiological responses. The source of our stress is different, but the reaction is the same. Psychological stress, if chronic, can lead to severe health and performance problems because it throws our bodies out of balance.1 What kinds of things do we do in response to stress? Sapolsky notes that our reactions are “generally short-sighted, inefficient, and penny-wise and dollar-foolish.” The body mobilizes to deal with the immediate threat. This stress response is effective in a crisis but can be very costly if you experience every day as an emergency.2 ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1394))

- The research shows that stress stems from a loss of predictability and a loss of control, where the common element is novelty. I believe that secular trends in the economy and in the money management industry are contributing mightily to the sensation of less predictability and control. The loss of predictability, for instance, reflects the accelerating rate of innovation in the global economy. For example, the average life of a company in the S&P 500 Index has gone from roughly twenty-five to thirty-five years in the 1950s to about ten to fifteen years today ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1403))

- The spectacular rise and fall of companies in recent years certainly adds to the feeling that business is less predictable than ever before. We also see the lack of predictability in the volatility data. While market-level volatility has been stable, firm-specific risk has been steadily rising since the 1970s. Although the volatility of a market portfolio has not changed much in the last few generations, money managers today have a higher risk than ever of being in the wrong stocks.4 The loss of control not only reflects actions within the portfolio but also evaluation of the portfolio by the owners. Shareholders and mutual fund rating companies judge money managers at least every ninety days, and in order to keep their assets, many money managers try to minimize tracking error versus their benchmark. Managing tracking error often requires mirroring the market and generally entails short-term trading.5 In a sense, reducing tracking error is rational for money managers because there’s no use worrying about how the portfolio will perform over the next three years if you’re out of a job along the way. But closet indexing is not ideal for shareholders. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1414))

- Go to your doctor with the symptoms of stress, and you’ll get a standard list of recommendations: seek support from social networks, exercise sufficiently, and make sure you have a healthy diet. How do you deal with the repercussions of stress in money management? The prescription is to work hard on maintaining an appropriate long-term focus. Ulysses had the crew bind him to the mast of his ship to protect him from the call of the Sirens. Money managers, especially when feeling a loss of predictability and control, are drawn to short-term activity. Like Ulysses, money managers should take the steps necessary to focus on the long term if they are to optimize long-term fund performance.

- Investors need to pay a great deal of attention to what influences their behavior. Three of Cialdini’s six tendencies are particularly relevant for investors: consistency and commitment, social validation, and scarcity. Psychologists discovered that after bettors at a racetrack put down their money, they are more confident in the prospects of their horses winning than immediately before they placed their bets.7 After making a decision, we feel both internal and external pressure to remain consistent to that view, even if subsequent evidence questions the validity of the initial decision. So an investor who has taken a position in a particular stock, recommended it publicly, or encouraged colleagues to participate, will feel the need to stick ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1556))

- with the call. Related to this tendency is the confirmation trap: postdecision openness to confirming data coupled with disavowal or denial of disconfirming data. One useful technique to mitigate consistency is to think about the world in ranges of values with associated probabilities instead of as a series of single points. Acknowledging multiple scenarios provides psychological shelter to change views when appropriate. There is a large body of work about the role of social validation in investing. Investing is an inherently social activity, and investors periodically act in concert. Awareness of breakdowns in the diversity of opinion and respect for extreme valuations can help offset the deleterious impact of social validation. Finally, scarcity has an important role in investing (and certainly plays a large role in the minds of corporate executives). Investors in particular seek informational scarcity. The challenge is to distinguish between what is truly scarce information and what is not. One means to do this is to reverse-engineer market expectations—in other words, figure out what the market already thinks.

- People base their judgments of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it but also on what they feel about it.

- Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio describes how early in his career he realized that traditional views on rationality had to be wrong. He saw a patient with all the faculties for rational behavior intact—attention, memory, logic. But brain damage had eviscerated the man’s ability to experience feelings, and this had robbed him of the ability to make successful decisions day to day. Damasio saw the link: impaired feelings and flawed decisions go hand in hand.1 Damasio’s later work confirmed his observation. In one experiment, he harnessed subjects to a skin-conductance-response machine and asked them to flip over cards from one of four decks; two of the decks generated gains (in play money) and the other two were losers. As the subjects turned cards, Damasio asked them what they thought was going on. After about ten turns, the subjects started showing physical reactions when they reached for a losing deck. About fifty cards into the experiment, the subjects articulated a hunch that two of the four decks were riskier. And it took another thirty cards for the subjects to explain why their hunch was right.2 This experiment provided two remarkable decision-making lessons. First, the unconscious knew what was going on before the conscious did. Second, even the subjects who never articulated what was going on had unconscious physical reactions that guided their decisions. When Damasio replicated the experiment on brain-damaged patients, he saw none of the typical reactions. The skin-conductance response and verbal descriptions confirmed that the patients had no idea what was going on—either unconsciously or consciously.3 ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1589))

- In Kahneman’s model, system 1 uses perception and intuition to generate impressions of objects. These impressions are involuntary, and an individual may not be able to verbalize them. He argues that system 2 is involved in all judgments, whether or not the individual is making decisions overtly. Intuition is a judgment that reflects an impression. Kahneman’s work (along with that of his collaborator, Amos Tversky) shows how impressions can lead to judgments that are suboptimal according to classical economic theory. So the evidence suggests that you can’t separate emotions (system 1) from decisions (system 2). In fact, as Damasio showed, system 1 needs to operate normally in order for you to make good judgments. From an investor’s standpoint, two questions become central: What influences our impressions, and how do these impressions shape perceptions of risk and reward?

- One of the main shapers of our impressions is what psychiatrists call “affect.”5 Affect is the “goodness” or “badness” we feel based on a stimulus.

- Affect operates in the realm of system 1 and hence is rapid and automatic. And affect often directs our impressions in a reasonable way: most things you feel good about are good. But affect, like other heuristics (or rules of thumb), has biases. Investors need to heed the biases that emanate from affect. Affect is a noteworthy extension to prospect theory—which shows that investors are risk averse when facing gains and risk seeking when facing losses. Experiments show that affect—how we feel about a financial opportunity—can amplify the suboptimal biases that arise from prospect theory (see exhibit 12.2). Let’s get more concrete. The goal of an investor is to buy an asset below its expected value. Expected value is the weighted-average value for a distribution of possible outcomes. You calculate expected value by multiplying the payoff for a given outcome by the probability that the outcome will occur. Research on affect demonstrates two central principles related to expected value. First, when the outcomes of an opportunity don’t have strong affective meaning, we tend to overweight the probabilities. Second, when the outcome does have strong affective meaning, we tend to overweight the outcome. Paul Slovic tested the first principle, probability dominance, with a simple experiment. He asked subjects to rate one of sixteen gambles by crossing various probabilities (7/36, 14/36, 21/36, and 28/36) and various payoffs ($3, $6, $9, and $12). He found that even though the subjects wanted to weight the probability and payoffs equally (and thought they had done so), the actual weighting for probability was five to sixteen times higher than for payoff.6 ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1638))

- The researchers posit that the subjects leaned on probabilities because there was no way for them to judge the attractiveness of the payoffs—the payoffs lacked affective meaning. Scientists see examples of this probability dominance in other fields as well, including studies of life-saving interventions. In contrast, when payoffs are vivid—that is, when they carry substantial affective meaning—subjects tend to place too little emphasis on probabilities and too much emphasis on outcomes. For example, researchers find that lottery players tend to have the same feelings about playing the lottery whether the probability of winning is one-in-ten million or one-in-ten thousand because the payoff is so affective. This feature of the theory also offers an explanation as ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1658))

The bottom line is that when investors feel good about an investment idea, they deem the risks low and the returns high irrespective of more objective probabilities.7 And when they dislike an idea, the inverse is true—risk is high and reward is low. Great investors aren’t too swayed by affect. Perhaps this is a result of how their system 1s are wired. ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1663))

In nonstationary systems, the underlying statistical properties of the system change over time, which means that the past may not be a good predictor of the future. The stock market exhibits both nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Accordingly, investors must take a very methodical and self-aware approach to judging expected values.

- The market is not the only decentralized system that exhibits suboptimal imitation. For example, there is the fascinating case of army ants. A group of worker ants, which are essentially blind, sometimes separates from the colony. Since no individual ant has any idea how to relocate the rest of the colony, all of the ants rely on a simple decision rule: follow the ant in front of you. If enough individuals follow the strategy (i.e., they reach the tipping point), they develop a circular mill, where ants follow each other around in circles until death. One such mill persisted for two days, had a 1,200-foot circumference, and a circuit time of two and a half hours (see exhibit 13.1). Eventually, a few workers created the requisite diversity by breaking away from the trail, and the mill dissipated.9 ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1742))

- Sorry Syllogism Classical economic theory assumes that all people have the same preferences, perfect knowledge of all alternatives, and an understanding of the consequences of their decisions. In short, people behave rationally. No one really believes that this idyllic state exists. In fact, ample empirical research and anecdotal evidence show that people are not perfectly rational. This gap between theory and practice has spawned the relatively new field of behavioral finance.1 Behavioral-finance researchers seek to bridge the gap between classical economics and psychology to explain how and why people, and markets, do what they do. Behavioral finance raises a couple of important issues for investors. The first is whether it is possible to systematically exploit irrational market behavior when it occurs. Another issue is how to avoid making suboptimal decisions as an investor. The goal is to close the gap between how we actually make decisions and how we should make decisions.2 Behavioral finance is undoubtedly important for an intelligent investor. But poor thinking sometimes sneaks under the behavioral finance umbrella—even by the field’s experts. Misusing behavioral-finance concepts can be as problematic as failing to acknowledge the role of psychology in investing.

We can express the essence of the poor-thinking problem with the following syllogism: Humans are irrational Markets are made up of humans Markets are irrational This logic stream appears to generate one of behavioral finance’s main conclusions. Hersh Shefrin, a leading behavioral-finance researcher, writes: “Behavioral finance assumes that heuristic-driven bias and framing effects cause market prices to deviate from fundamental values.”3 The simple (and somewhat intuitive) message is that the aggregation of irrational individuals must lead to an irrational market. To see the weakness in this case, we have to consider investor behavior on two levels: collective and individual. Collective behavior addresses the potentially irrational actions of groups. Individual behavior dwells on the fact that we all consistently fall into psychological traps, including overconfidence, anchoring and adjustment, improper framing, irrational commitment escalation, and the confirmation trap. Here’s my main point: markets can still be rational when investors are individually irrational.4 Sufficient investor diversity is the essential… ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1797))

- Behavioral-finance experts understand the role of diversity in price formation. As Andrei Shleifer writes in his excellent book Inefficient Markets: An Introduction to Behavioral Finance: The efficient market hypothesis does not live or die by investor rationality. In many scenarios where some investors are not fully rational, markets are still predicted to be efficient. In one commonly discussed case, the irrational investors in the market trade randomly. When there are a large number of such investors, and when their trading strategies are uncorrelated, their trades are likely to cancel each other out. In such a market . . . prices are close to fundamental values. The issue is that the field views this investor diversity as a special case, not the rule. Shleifer continues: “This argument relies crucially on the lack of correlation in strategies of the irrational investors, and, for that reason, is quite limited.”5 Finally, Shleifer argues that arbitrage—another means to bring prices in line with value—is risky and hence restrained in the real world. To sum up the case: Since investors are irrational and their strategies are rarely uncorrelated, markets are inefficient. Further, arbitrage is insufficient to bring markets back to efficiency. So inefficiency is the rule, and efficiency is the exception. Active portfolio management in a fundamentally inefficient market is a mug’s game. We suspect that most professionals have the sense that efficiency is the rule and inefficiency is the exception. Indeed, we see diverse individuals generate efficient outcomes in many complex systems. In case after case,… ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1815))

The fourth bomb, however, was lost in the Mediterranean, and its rapid recovery was essential to U.S. national security. Assistant Secretary of Defense Jack Howard called a young naval officer, John Craven, to find the bomb. Craven assembled a diverse group of experts and asked them to place Las Vegas-style bets on where the bomb landed. Craven ran their approaches and scenarios through the bet-generated probabilities and found the bomb shortly thereafter. No individual expert had the answer, but the combination of all the experts did.6 Diversity is also a fundamental feature in the problem-solving capabilities of social insects such as ants and bees, including how they acquire food and find new nests. A number of simple illustrations prove the point for human systems as well, including Jack Treynor’s famous jellybean jar experiment. Treynor fills a jar with jellybeans and asks his finance students to guess the total in the jar. He consistently finds that the average guess is both a good estimate of the actual number and better than almost all individual guesses.7 Given what we know about suboptimal human behavior, the critical question is whether investors… ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1834))

More directly, the collective level is the right place to search for investment opportunities within behavioral finance.8 Herding is a good example. Herding is when many investors make the same choice based on the observations of others, independent of their own knowledge.9 Markets do tend to have phases when one sentiment becomes dominant. These diversity breakdowns are consistent with booms (everyone acts bullish) and busts (everyone acts bearish). To the best of my knowledge, there is no one barometer that accurately and consistently measures investor diversity.

- Mark Twain defined a classic as something everyone wants to have read and nobody wants to read. One classic that deserves the attention of all investors is John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, and more specifically chapter 12, “The State of Long-Term Expectation.” Expectations are embedded in all the decisions we make, especially investment decisions, but we rarely step back and consider how and why we form our expectations. Keynes guides this reflection. Let’s take a deeper look at two facets of expectations. The first distinguishes expectations built on deductive processes from those based on inductive processes: deductive processes move from general premises to specific conclusions; inductive processes go from specific facts to general principles. Deductive rationality, a building block of neoclassical economics, breaks down in the real world because human logical reasoning can’t handle situations that are too complicated (i.e., we have bounded rationality), and any action that deviates from rationality in human interactions ignites speculation about how others will behave.1 In other words, if no one else is rational, it doesn’t pay for you to be. The second facet of expectations is that after an event occurs, humans tend to overestimate their pre-event knowledge of the outcome. This hindsight bias erodes the quality of the feedback we need to sharpen our analytical skills. Speculation and Enterprise Keynes divides the basis for expectations of future returns (he uses the word “yield”) into two parts: facts that are more or less certain, and events that you can forecast with varying degrees of confidence. These latter, uncertain events include the magnitude and type of investment, as well as demand fluctuations. He calls the psychological expectations for these events the “state of long-term expectation.” In forming forecasts, most people fall back on what Keynes calls a “convention”—they start with the current situation and modify it when they have definite reasons to expect a change.2 He notes that the magnitude of the modification reflects “the state of confidence,” a combination of actual market observations and business psychology. But there is no way to anticipate what the state of confidence will be because it relies on feedback. Markets affect psychology and psychology affects markets.3 Keynes argues that conventions are inherently precarious for a host of reasons. The most famous of these is that many investors focus not on “enterprise”—forecasting long-term return on investments—but rather on “speculation”—forecasting the market’s psychology. Here, he invokes his most famous metaphor: markets as a beauty contest. The goal is not to identify the person you find the most beautiful, or even the person you think the average beholder finds most beautiful. You soon find yourself trying to decipher what the average opinion thinks the average opinion is. Through the beauty contest metaphor, Keynes describes the limitations of… ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1866))

- This is not to say, though, that Keynes perceives markets to run solely on emotion. In his words, The state of long-term expectation is often steady, and, even when it is not, the other factors exert their compensating effects. We are merely reminding ourselves that human decisions affecting the future, whether personal or political or economic, cannot depend on strict mathematical expectation, since the basis for making such calculations does not exist.4 In what is a timeless observation, Keynes adds, “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.”5 Are today’s institutional investors more focused on enterprise or speculation? This is a difficult question to answer, and markets certainly need an ecology of investors to remain robust. But the aggregate statistics on equity portfolio turnover give any intelligent investor pause. Annual turnover has shot from… ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1893))

- Economist Brian Arthur has made important contributions to our understanding of inductive versus deductive approaches to problem solving (including stock picking). Arthur notes that you can solve only the easiest problems deductively: you can do it for tic-tac-toe but not for chess. Indeed, experiments show that humans aren’t that good at deductive logic. But humans are superb at recognizing and matching patterns. We’re inductive machines. Arthur offers a model of inductive reasoning, effectively picking up where Lord Keynes left off. The model is based on the El Farol bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which played Irish music on Thursday nights.7 Attending the El Farol when it isn’t too crowded is fun; you can enjoy your pint and the band without being disturbed. But the bar is a turn-off when it is packed—the jostling crowd spills your beer and the loud voices drown out the band. So how do you decide whether or not you should go to El Farol? To make the problem more concrete, Arthur suggests that the bar has a hundred-person capacity and that with sixty people or fewer it… ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1907))

- only basis for making a decision is past attendance. This problem has two notable features. First, the problem is too complicated for a deductive solution. As individuals can only look at past attendance, there are a large number of legitimate expectational models. The potential bar goers must use an inductive approach. Second, common expectations backfire. If all believe most will go, nobody will go. And if all believe nobody will go, all will go. Like Keynes’s beauty contest, the issue is not just what you believe but rather what you believe others to believe. Researchers have constructed models of the El Farol problem by assigning individuals evolving decision rules. With sufficient rule diversity and enough iterations, the mean attendance for the bar approximates the overcrowding threshold of sixty. One study assumed 20,000 iterations, which is about 385 years worth of Thursday nights.8 This means that even inductive approaches may generate results similar to deductive methods, provided there is sufficient strategy diversity.

- A discussion of expectation is not complete without noting an odd human feature: once an event has passed, we tend to believe that we had better knowledge of the outcome before the fact than we really did. Known as hindsight bias, or more commonly the Monday-morning-quarterback syndrome, this research shows that people are not very good at recalling the way an uncertain situation appeared to them before finding out the results.9 Finance professor Hersh Shefrin illustrates the point by analyzing the comments of a former Orange County treasurer, Robert Citron.10 In his annual report dated September 1993, Citron wrote, “We will have level if not lower interest rates through this decade. Certainly, there’s nothing in the horizon that would indicate that we will have rising interest rates for a minimum of three years.” In February 1994, the Federal Reserve Board raised rates. Citron’s response: “The recent increase in rates was not a surprise to us; we expected it and were prepared for it.” Now, there is a chance that Citron changed his view prior to the rate hike. But the much more plausible view is that he suffered from hindsight bias. Hindsight… ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1931))

- The study of decision making has a long history. The classical model of decision making that Daniel Bernoulli launched over two hundred fifty years ago is still the prescriptive model of choice in much of economics.3 But the model is not realistic. In the 1950s, economist Herb Simon fashioned an important case against the classical theory by noting that the theory’s informational requirements vastly exceed human cognitive capacity. Human rationality is bounded. As a result, people don’t make decisions based on optimal outcomes; they make choices based on what’s good enough. Simon argued that people don’t maximize; they “satisfice.” In recent years, a new approach, naturalistic decision making, has emerged to explain how experts make decisions in real-world contexts that are meaningful and familiar to them.4 Evidence suggests that the key attributes and principles of naturalistic decision making apply to experienced investors. An understanding of naturalistic decision making may help investors better appreciate their own approach and has important implications for training.5 ([Location 1963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1963))

- Chopping Down the Decision Tree In a recent paper, Robert Olsen lists five conditions that are present in naturalistic tasks and relates them to investors:6 1. Ill-structured and complex problems. In these cases, no obvious best procedure exists to solve the problem. Determining a fair value for a security, for instance, is an ill-structured and complex task. 2. Information is incomplete, ambiguous, and changing. That stock picking relies on expectations about future financial performance means that there is no way to contemplate all information. 3. Ill-defined, shifting, and competing goals. Even though investing may seem to have clear-cut goals for the long term, goals can change significantly over shorter horizons. For example, a portfolio manager may take a defensive posture to preserve performance or a more aggressive stance to make up a performance shortfall. 4. Stress because of time constraints, high stakes, or both. Stress is clearly a feature of investing. 5. Decisions may involve multiple participants. This means that the decision maker may be working with various partners who may impose decision-making constraints. How do naturalistic decision makers decide? Olsen identifies three primary behaviors. The first is an ability to rely heavily on mental imagery and simulation in order to assess a situation and possible alternatives.7 The second behavior is the ability to recognize problems based on pattern matching. Experts are able to connect a known pattern to a specific situation. Gary Klein and his colleagues studied the average move quality of chess masters and class B players under regulation (135 seconds per move) and blitz (6 seconds per move) conditions. They found that while the average move quality improved markedly for the class B players under regulation conditions, the quality of the moves under either set of conditions was relatively unchanged for the masters (see exhibit 16.1). Chess masters can glance at a board and quickly see a pattern, allowing them to make relatively good moves in a short time.8 EXHIBIT 16.1 Chess Masters Don’t Lose Average Move Quality When They Are Time Constrained ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=1972))

- Researcher Ray Christian sheds some light on the possible role of the unconscious in decision making. He notes that what we perceive at any given moment—our conscious bandwidth—is an extremely small subset of the information stream flowing to the sense organs. Specifically, he estimates that the capacity of our sensory system is 11 megabits per second while our conscious bandwidth is just 16 bits per second.10 ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2006))

- Investing au Naturel Olsen tested whether or not naturalistic decision making explains how real investors work. Since naturalistic decision theory relates to experts in a given domain, he studied investors who had earned the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®) designation. Of his 250-plus sample, over 90 percent had six or more years of investment experience and over 50 percent had been in the industry fifteen or more years. Olsen posed eight questions in order to understand their investment behavior. Exhibit 16.2 shows the results. As Olsen summarizes, the response to the first question supports the idea that expert investors make heavy use of mental imagery. Over 90 percent of the respondents say that creating a story based on facts is important to their investment decisions. The answers to questions two to four suggest that the decision process of the investment pros is context dependent. Investors change their approaches as the circumstances dictate.

- Responses to the final three questions are consistent with the idea that investors use “satisficing” behavior. Investors don’t optimize in the classical sense; they ignore outcomes or collapse categories to make their decision process more tractable.

One important implication is that investor training… ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2024))

- The Fine Print Naturalistic decision making is clearly relevant for investors and the investment process. But in thinking about the importance of the theory, there are a few points worth bearing in mind. To start, naturalistic decision making is most relevant in complex environments. When a problem is covered by rules or is simply complicated, classical frameworks are often very effective. Different decision-making approaches are relevant under different environmental circumstances. A related point is that a collective of diverse individuals often solves complex problems better than the average individual. The stock market is a great example. Even “expert” investors struggle to beat the market over time. Successful experts seem to be those who can mentally represent a complex situation in their heads. Naturalistic decision making is not synonymous with beating the market. This leads to the final point. The skill sets of the best naturalistic decision makers may not be transferable. The finest investors appear to combine innate ability (hardwiring) with… ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2030))

- Not all bits of information are created equal. Saying “I do” wearing a tuxedo in front of clergy and congregation carries greater significance than replying “I do” when your host asks if you take milk with your coffee. An ability to properly weight information is very useful in life and especially important for investors. An investment process requires gathering and analyzing information. Investors have historically emphasized either the gathering or the analyzing piece as their source of competitive advantage. But gaining an informational edge has become much more difficult in recent years as the direct result of technological advances and regulation. For example, the ubiquity of networked personal computers has made information dissemination extremely rapid and nearly costless. Today, an online day trader has at her fingertips information and access that leading institutions could only dream about twenty-five years ago. And Regulation FD (fair disclosure) seeks to assure that all investors—from the largest fund manager to the smallest individual—receive material information at the same time. Yet analysts have not given up their search for proprietary information. In recent years, we have seen a blossoming in the number of surveys and channel checks, as well as other less savory information-gathering attempts. While there is clearly nothing wrong with pursuing better information—and some firms do it very well—I question the investment value of much of today’s “proprietary” research. There are three sources of skepticism. The first is whether or not investors can properly weight information. The second is sampling problems, or the degree to which the sampling techniques analysts use actually reflect the underlying population. The final issue is whether or not today’s proprietary research leads to superior investment performance. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2051))

- Sifting Weights In the mid-1990s, Bill Gates carried with him a list of Microsoft’s business priorities. The Internet, which was starting to take off, was fifth or sixth on his list. But once Gates realized the significance of the Internet to Microsoft’s future, he moved it to the top priority.3 Gates substantially reweighted already-known information, and hence added a lot of value for shareholders. Likewise, how we weight information has a significant impact on how we view the world and how we value assets. Our degree of belief in a particular hypothesis typically integrates two kinds of evidence: the strength, or extremeness, of the evidence and the weight, or predictive validity. 4 For instance, say you want to test the hypothesis that a coin is biased in favor of heads. The proportion of heads in the sample reflects the strength, while the sample size determines the weight. Probability theory prescribes rules for how to combine strength and weight correctly. But substantial experimental data show that people do not follow the theory. Specifically, the strength of evidence tends to dominate the weight of evidence in people’s minds. This bias leads to a distinctive pattern of over- and underconfidence. When the strength of evidence is high and the weight is low—which accurately describes the outcome of many Wall Street-sponsored surveys—people tend to be overconfident. In contrast, when the strength is low and the evidence is high, people tend to be underconfident. Exhibit 17.1 shows strength and weight combinations. When both are high, the conclusion is likely to be obvious. When both are low, the finding is unlikely to be relevant. In the two remaining boxes, however, we run the risk of misjudging the evidence. The winner’s curse is another concrete example of the risk of weighting information incorrectly.5 The winner’s curse says that in a competitive auction, the highest bidder will typically… ([Location 2067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2067))

- Tell Me Something the Market Doesn’t Know The most basic test of the value of survey-based research is whether or not it leads to superior stock selection. The answer is ambiguous at best, in our view. The first reason relates to how quickly the market assimilates new information. 8 The evidence shows that the market does adjust to new information rapidly. If so, then generating excess returns from that data is unlikely. Gaining an informational edge is difficult: Sell-side-sponsored surveys and channel checks must be disseminated uniformly, of course, and incremental information that a large buy-side firm encounters is often reflected in share prices in short order. Information about what is going on now, or what is likely to happen in the near future, is most likely to be efficiently priced into stocks. In contrast, some evidence suggests that the market is short sighted with regard to long-term information.9 The second issue is that there is a substantial difference between understanding the fundamentals (or changes in fundamentals) of an industry or company and a grasp of the expectations built into the current stock price.10 Prices reflect collective expectations and generally incorporate more information than any one individual can claim. So the central question is whether or not information that is new to you is also new to the market. ([Location 2115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2115))

- Finally, at risk of exposing my own overconfidence, I tested the correlation between one well-known CIO survey and excess returns in the stock market (see exhibit 17.3).11 The evidence in favor of a link between the two is not persuasive. Some investors don’t use results for assessing the sector directly surveyed but rather look for the derivative call—which other industries are affected by perceived trends. This analysis can run into the problem of contingent probability. Say that you judge the probability of a company’s orders being below expectations at 70 percent based on some new survey results. And say that there’s a 70 percent chance that a specific supplier will suffer as well. The chance that the supplier misses its number is less than 50 percent (0.70 x 0.70 = 0.49).

This error is called the conjunction fallacy and occurs because we tend to lump thoughts into categories. Investors working off derivative calls must be very alert to avoid the conjunction fallacy.12 Seeking new information is a worthy goal for an investor.13 My fear is that much of what passes as incremental information adds little or no value, because investors don’t properly weight information, rely on unsound samples, and fail to recognize what the market already knows.

- Why should investors and businesspeople care about neural development? Neural overproduction and subsequent pruning appears to parallel closely what happens when a new industry emerges. An understanding of this process provides investors with three benefits. First, it is a model of innovation that is both theoretically sound and that researchers have tested empirically. Second, the process provides investors with a basis for understanding manias or bubbles. Finally, it shows that the innovation process often leads to investment opportunity. The Dynamics of Innovation In his thoughtful book Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation, James Utterback suggests three phases in industry innovation. The first is what he calls the fluid phase, a period in which there is a great deal of experimentation. This mirrors the upswing in synaptic connections. The transitional phase comes next, where evolutionary forces select the dominant product design. This phase is similar to the pruning process. The final phase is the specific phase, where changes in product or process are modest. That’s what most of us adults ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2331))

- face. These phases suggest a consistent pattern of a sharp upswing in the number of companies in an industry when it is in the early stages followed by a sharp downswing as the pruning process takes hold. The process appears very wasteful when we see how many alternatives it dismisses. But ultimately the interplay between technical capabilities and market choices selects a product design that best suits the environment. This pattern has played out over and over in the business world.6 Take two giants in the annals of American industry—the automobile and television (see exhibit 19.1). In both cases, investors allocated capital liberally in the early phases as each industry’s growth potential was significant but uncertain. But both industries saw steep declines in the number of competing firms over time, especially once the industry gravitated toward a dominant design. The more recent history of the disk drive and personal computer industries shows the same pattern (see exhibit 19.2), although the pruning process occurs over a much shorter period. What took thirty years in the auto industry a century ago took fifteen years for the disk drive industry and more like a decade for the PC manufacturers. The Internet, too, went through a similar process at the turn of the twenty-first century (see exhibit 19.3). Although the Internet is not an industry per se, there was a period of rampant experimentation through the late 1990s. The pruning process came forcefully in 2001; according to Webmergers.com, 544 Internet companies were shut down in 2001, up from 223 in 2000. Through the first half of 2002, shutdowns dropped almost 75 percent from the previous year’s total.7 While the excesses of the Internet and telecom booms in the late 1990s carried into the twenty-first century, this boom-and-bust pattern is by no means unique. I expect to see the same process unfold in the future. ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2340))

- Investors: Use the Brain Now that the picture has been filled out a little more, let’s return to investor benefits. The first is a basic appreciation for the existence of the boom-and-bust pattern and why it is so prevalent. In effect, when the environment is uncertain, it helps to start with lots of alternatives (e.g., synaptic connections) and then select (via pruning) the ones that are best given the environment. The process is undoubtedly costly because lots of energy and resources necessarily go to waste, but it’s the best one going.

- The second benefit is how this process plays into manias. Imagine a baby’s brain as a market, with each synapse representing a company or entrant. When the baby is born, the market is buzzing because the brain is creating a lot of synapses and some will be wildly successful. Enthusiasm reigns. Introduce prices, and you have a foundation for a mania. Investors use price as an important cue, among others, toward a business’s potential success. As the price is bid up, humans naturally want to participate. A positive-feedback loop kicks in, which bootstraps a mania. But as we know, many synapses, or companies, don’t make it. The path to innovation is paved with failure and waste. Market participants must recognize, however, that because the business environment is generally fluid in periods of innovation, it’s often hard to know which businesses will succeed or fail. The payoff for the survivors can be significant, though, which leads to my final point. ([Location 2387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2387))

- Investors are wise to look around for survivors at the end of the pruning process because a portfolio of surviving companies often presents an opportunity for attractive shareholder returns. For example, an investment in the twelve hard-disk-drive companies that survived through the beginning of 1985, held through June 2000, would have generated an 11 percent annual compound return. Further, despite continued failures and brutal competition, investors who sold their winners at peak prices would have realized compound annual returns of 21 percent (see exhibit 19.5).9 I found similar results with the PC stocks from 1989 to 2000.

- The stock market adds a wrinkle to the innovation process because stock prices are not about the here and now but rather reflect expectations for the future.3 Investors, using myriad means and methods, place a present value on a company’s future—more accurately, the present value of the company’s future cash flows. Stock prices reflect the collective expectations of investors. So investors can’t just consider innovation; they must assess how the market will consider innovation.

This diagram is useful for thinking about shifting expectations. Investors (indeed humans in general) often think linearly. So at point A, investors do not fully anticipate the growth and economic returns from an industry, and they extrapolate relatively low growth. Expectations for future financial performance are too low.

- So the obvious goal for an investor is to buy a stock at point A and sell it at point B—avoiding the unpleasant downward expectations revision at the top of the S-curve. The work of technology strategist Geoffrey Moore—including the best-selling Gorilla Game—provides a framework to anticipate such an upward revision. Moore discusses the key issues involved in getting beyond point A, or the elbow in the S-curve, and articulates strategies to identify the potential winners. The difficulty, of course, is that many companies try, but few succeed in becoming the leader in a new industry. It’s a jungle out there. My goal is to document that the transition from point A to point B presents opportunities for excess returns and that the transition from point B to point C often spells poor stock-price performance. Recognizing these inflection points can be very useful for investors for a couple of reasons. First, accelerating innovation assures that industry and product life cycles are shortening.5 Because the waves of innovation are coming faster and faster, there will be more A-to-B opportunities, and investors must be more nimble to anticipate the expectations revisions. Second, humans often fall into automatic action when an experience “imprints” on them. For instance, stocks that have performed well in the recent past leave an imprint on the minds of many investors. As a result, following difficult periods investors want to go back to the stocks that drove… ([Location 2439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2439))

- Specifically, the research shows that most of an entrant’s excess shareholder returns versus its industry come in the first five years. In the subsequent fifteen years, the entrant delivers total shareholder returns that are roughly in line with the industry. Twenty years after entry, a company’s stock tends to underperform its peers. EXHIBIT 20.2 Eventually the Edge Wears Off… Source: Foster and Kaplan, Creative Destruction, 47. Reproduced with permission. Foster and Kaplan offer three reasons for this pattern. First, competitors imitate or improve on yesterday’s innovations, leaving the original innovators with little opportunity to generate either returns above the cost of capital or meaningful growth. Second, the market reflects expectations more accurately for businesses that are more stable and that have longer operating histories than the challengers typically do. Finally, almost all companies eventually lose the innovative edge as the result of size, success, or established institutional routines (the authors call it “cultural lock-in”). Here’s the crucial message: the companies that outperform the market are “temporary members of a permanent class.” The aggregate returns of the stock market indexes belie an accelerating rate of change in the composition of those indexes as young innovators unseat their established competitors in the market-capitalization game. Corporate longevity is on the wane, and company-specific volatility is rising.7 Both companies and investors face great opportunity and risk.

- The Mind Makes a Promise That the Body Can’t Fill In 1998, the Corporate Strategy Board published a detailed study on what they called “stall points”—the inflection point at the top of the S-curve.8 Stall points are the transitions from point B to point C in exhibit 20.1. The board found that 83 percent of the companies that reach the stall point grow sales at a rate in the mid-single digits or less in the subsequent ten years. Even more relevant for investors, they show that roughly 70 percent of these companies lose at least one-half of their equity market capitalization. This is evidence that investors extrapolate trends of the recent past into the foreseeable future, only to have those expectations revised down when growth slows.

- Why should businesspeople care about Drosophila? A sound body of evidence now suggests that the average speed of evolution is accelerating in the business world. Just as scientists have learned a great deal about evolutionary change from fruit flies, investors can benefit from understanding the sources and implications of accelerated business evolution. The most direct consequence of more rapid business evolution is that the time an average company can sustain a competitive advantage—that is, generate an economic return in excess of its cost of capital—is shorter than it was in the past. This trend has potentially important implications for investors in areas such as valuation, portfolio turnover, and diversification.

- Wiggins and Ruefli propose and test four hypotheses: 1. Periods of persistent superior economic performance are decreasing in duration over time. Their analysis supports the hypothesis, showing that the probability of leaving the “superior performance stratum” has increased over time. 2. Hypercompetition is not limited to high-technology industries but will occur through most industries. Here, the evidence supports the hypothesis by showing that while nontechnology companies had a higher probability of staying in the superior-performance stratum than technology companies did, the probability of leaving the stratum did increase over time. 3. Over time, firms increasingly seek to sustain competitive advantage by concatenating a series of short-term competitive advantages. The idea here is that successful companies string together a series of short-lived competitive advantages. The data support this hypothesis, too. The researchers show that the pattern of one-period superior performance is more prevalent in the study’s later time periods.7 4. Industry concentration, large market share, or both are negatively associated with chance of loss of persistent superior economic performance in an industry. The research did not support the final hypothesis. Neither a concentrated industry nor large market shares is empirically consistent with sustainable competitive advantage.

- Clockspeed also has implications for portfolio turnover. Just as companies must string together a series of competitive advantages, optimal portfolio turnover is higher today than in the past. That said, I still suspect that aggregate portfolio turnover, which has risen sharply over the past twenty-five years, is too high. But extremely low portfolio turnover (less than 20 percent) may not provide sufficient flexibility to capture the market’s dynamics. In addition, faster clockspeed suggests the need for greater diversification. If competitive advantages are coming and going faster than ever, investors need to cast a wider net in order to assure that their portfolios reflect the phenomenon. (Ideally, of course, investors would only focus on the winners and avoid the losers. This is practically very difficult.) The data show evidence for this increased diversification. Finally, the rate of change in the business world demands that investors spend more time understanding the dynamics of organizational change. Success and failure at fast-changing companies may provide investors with some useful mental models for appreciating change at the slower evolving companies. The business world is going the way of Drosophila. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2597))

- Yet managers must clearly strike some balance between the short term and the long term. It’s like speeding down the highway in a car. If you focus just beyond the hood, you’re going to have a hard time anticipating what’s coming. Look too far ahead, on the other hand, and you lose perspective on the actions that you need to take now to navigate safely. There’s a tradeoff between the short term and the long term, and the appropriate focal point shifts as conditions warrant. The notion that managers should only focus on the long term is nonsensical. Have you ever heard of a company that blew twenty straight quarters but had a great five years? It doesn’t happen; the long term is, by definition, an aggregation of short terms. So what’s the best way to think about managing for the long term in a complex environment? ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2618))

- Strategies for Winners So how do great chess players approach the game? Chess master Bruce Pandolfini observes four behaviors that are consistent among chess champions and useful in thinking through the short-term/long-term debate.3 1. Don’t look too far ahead: Most people believe that great players strategize by thinking far into the future, by thinking 10 or 15 moves ahead. That’s just not true. Chess players look only as far into the future as they need to, and that usually means thinking just a few moves ahead. Thinking too far ahead is a waste of time: The information is uncertain. 2. Develop options and continuously revise them based on the changing conditions (see exhibit 22.1): Great players consider their next move without playing it. You should never play the first good move that comes into your head. Put that move on your list, and then ask yourself if there’s an even better move. If you see a good idea, look for a better one—that’s my motto. Good thinking is a matter of making comparisons. 3. Know your competition: Being good at chess also requires being good at reading people. Few people think of chess as an intimate, personal game. But that’s what it is. Players learn a lot about their opponents, and exceptional chess players learn to interpret every gesture that their opponents make.

- 4. Seek small advantages: You play for seemingly insignificant advantages—advantages that your opponent doesn’t notice or that he dismisses, thinking, “Big deal, you can have that.” It could be slightly better development, or a slightly safer king’s position. Slightly, slightly, slightly. None of those “slightlys” mean anything on their own, but add up seven or eight of them, and you have control. Pandolfini stresses to his students that his goal is not to make them great chess players but great thinkers: My goal is to help them develop what I consider to be two of the most important forms of intelligence: the ability to read other people, and the ability to understand oneself. Those are the two kinds of intelligence you need to succeed at chess—and in life.4 There are limits to the business-as-chess analogy. Besides the added complexity of business, the most significant limitation is that chess is a zero-sum game: for every winner, there’s a loser. The business world is not zero-sum, and the game between players has an unspecified tenure. So how can we apply these lessons from chess to the business world?

- Strategy as Simple Rules One of the characteristics of a complex system is that highly variable outcomes emerge from simple rules. Unless you deliberately replay a chess game, you’ll never see the same game twice. Herein lies the key to resolving the tension between the short term and the long term. Companies should develop long-term decision rules that are flexible enough to allow managers to make the right decisions in the short term. In this way, the company is managing for the long run even when it has no information about what the future holds. No company knows how the business landscape will develop—just as chess players don’t know how the board will develop—but decision rules provide action guidelines no matter what happens.

- Kathy Eisenhardt and Don Sull call this “strategy as simple rules.”5 They argue that companies, especially in fast-changing markets, should not embrace complex strategies but rather adopt and stick to “a few straightforward, hard-and-fast rules that define direction without containing it.” Eisenhardt and Sull specifically suggest five types of rules: 1. How-to rules spell out key features of how a company should execute a process. It answers the question, What makes our process unique? 2. Boundary rules focus managers on which opportunities they should pursue and which are outside the pale. 3. Priority rules help managers rank the opportunities they accept. 4. Timing rules synchronize managers with the pace of opportunities that emerge in other parts of the company. 5. Exit rules help managers decide when to pull out of yesterday’s opportunities. Eisenhardt and Sull argue that a company should have somewhere between two and seven rules, that young companies typically have too few, and that more mature businesses have too many. A decision rule to maintain accounting integrity (i.e., to avoid managing earnings per share versus managing the business) might also help reduce undue short-termism. This “strategy as simple rules” approach is not only strongly… ([Location 2674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2674))

- How did Woods react to his extraordinary success? He didn’t assume he had reached his potential. He didn’t sit back and enjoy. Instead, he carefully studied the videotape of his Masters performance and came to a surprising conclusion: “My swing really sucks.”1 Woods called his coach, Butch Harmon, to help revamp his swing. Harmon was sure Woods could take his game to an even higher level but knew that the results would not come instantly. Woods would have to risk getting worse in the short term in order to get better for the long term. He didn’t hesitate. Working with Harmon, Woods improved his strength and changed his grip, allowing him to maintain his power while gaining more control. Even as Woods managed to win only one Tour event from July 1997 to February 1999, he insisted he was a better golfer than before. “Winning is not always the barometer of getting better,” he asserted. In the spring of 1999, the new swing gelled. Woods went on to win ten of the next fourteen events in 1999, including eight PGA Tour victories. He tacked on another nine PGA Tour wins in 2000, and after capturing the 2001 Masters, he was the first golfer to be the reigning champion in all four majors simultaneously.

- This story is a useful introduction to the idea of fitness landscapes. Evolutionary biologists originally developed fitness landscapes to help them understand evolution—in particular, how a species increases its fitness.2 Along the way, the framework has spawned useful ideas for corporate strategists.3 ([Location 2712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2712))

- As Darwin noted, improving fitness is not about strength or smarts but rather about becoming more and more suited to your environment—in a word, adaptability. Better fitness requires generating options and “choosing” the “best” ones. In nature, recombination and mutation generate species diversity, and natural selection assures that the most suitable options survive.5 For companies, adaptability is about formulating and executing value-creating strategies with a goal of generating the highest possible long-term returns. Since a fitness landscape can have lots of peaks and valleys, even if a species reaches a peak (a local optimum), it may not be at the highest peak (global optimum). To get to a higher altitude, a species may have to reduce its fitness in the near term to improve its fitness in the long term. We can say the same about companies. This is a good metaphor for the Tiger Woods experience. Fitness landscapes are a rich way to think about businesses. For any individual company, you have to answer two questions. First, what does the fitness landscape look like from the company’s perspective? Of course, not only are a company’s decisions influenced by its fitness landscape, but the decisions themselves help define the landscape. Second, is the company pursuing the right strategies to improve its fitness (i.e., economic value) over time given its landscape? It’s important to note, though, that you can’t focus solely on the evolution of one company or industry because of the central role of coevolution. Actions trigger reactions. Sometimes companies cooperate with one another, sometimes they conflict. Nothing happens in a void—companies are always jockeying to improve their position.6 Further, the more dynamic the fitness landscape, the greater the necessary rate of adaptation.

- Ernest Ackerman was one lucky hombre. The first reported applicant for Social Security payment, Ackerman retired one day after the program was launched in 1937. During his day of participation in Social Security, his employer withheld one nickel from his pay. Upon retirement, Ackerman collected a lump-sum payment of seventeen cents. Future Social Security recipients may not be as fortunate. Even though the government has made significant changes to Social Security over the past sixty-plus years, the system faces severe challenges. In large part, these challenges reflect a change in the demographics of the U.S. population. For example, the government originally set the retirement age at sixty-five because actuarial studies showed that “using age 65 produced a manageable system that could easily be made self-sustaining with only modest levels of payroll taxation.”1 But from 1940 to today, the average percentage of men that survive from age twenty-one to age sixty-five leaped from 54 percent to 72 percent, the male life expectancy at sixty-five swelled from 12.7 to 15.3 years, and the fertility rate dipped nearly 10 percent. As a result, the worker per retiree ratio has plunged from forty-two to one in 1940 to about three to one today.

- A look at Social Security’s evolution illustrates a crucial point: It is really hard to manage a system when the underlying data are constantly changing. You can’t draw conclusions from past averages because they don’t accurately represent today’s averages. This lesson carries over directly to investing. One instance that stands out is when investors blithely apply historical-average price-earnings ratios to value either today’s market or an individual stock. Past-ratio averages are only applicable to the degree that they capture current circumstances. Just as no policymaker would dream of using old demographic data to assess the future of Social Security, investors should not casually rely on past price-earnings ratios to understand today’s market.

- Nonstationarity is a crucial concept in any time-series analysis, and it is especially relevant for fields like climatology and finance. The basic idea is that for averages to be comparable over time, the statistical properties of the population must be the same, or stationary. If the properties of the population change over time, the data are nonstationary. When data are nonstationary, applying past averages to today’s population can lead to misleading conclusions. Theoretical and empirical analysis of price-earnings ratios suggests that they are probably nonstationary.2 In fact, research shows that there has been no statistically significant relationship between a price-earnings ratio at the beginning of a year and the subsequent twelve- and twenty-four-month returns over the past 125 years. 3 More bluntly, the historical-average price-earnings ratio provides investors little or no guidance about market returns over the typical investment horizon.

- So it’s the form of investment, not just the magnitude of investment, that dictates the earnings a company reports. A tangible-oriented and an intangible-oriented business may invest an identical amount with the same return on investment and still have significantly different earnings. In general, intangible-reliant companies have a higher cash-flow-to-net-income ratio. To illustrate this point, I take two samples from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The first, which I call the tangible group, includes Alcoa, Caterpillar, United Technologies, and Wal-Mart. The intangible group comprises Altria, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and Procter and Gamble. Over the five reported fiscal years that ended with 2006, the tangible group had a cash-flow-to-net-income ratio of 28 percent, versus a 111 percent ratio for the intangible group. There is pervasive evidence that the global economy is moving from a reliance on tangible to intangible assets, including market-to-book ratios, workforce allocation, and the rising significance of education. Further, because intangible-reliant businesses have few assets on their balance sheets, they tend to show high returns on capital. With other factors held constant, higher cash-flow-to-net-income ratios and returns on capital support higher price-earnings ratios.4 The final factor that dictates the price-earnings ratio is the equity-risk premium, or the return that equity investors demand above and beyond a risk-free security. (The equity-risk premium itself appears to be nonstationary.) 5 While a number of factors come into play to determine the risk premium, including future growth estimates, the aggregate risk appetite of investors is certainly important. In periods of general optimism, equity-risk premiums shrink, and premiums expand when investors are cautious. The ebb and flow of investor risk appetite likely contributes to the nonstationarity of multiples. ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2857))

- zigzagged across this level many times during that period.6 Isn’t this proof enough that fourteen is the multiple to which the market reverts? The answer, I believe, is a qualified no. In all likelihood, two of the three drivers of nonstationarity—taxes/inflation and equity risk premium—are probably bounded. That is, they vacillate within reasonably defined, albeit large, channels. These drivers might average out over the very long term (i.e., a decade or more), but they are the source of significant, and legitimate, multiple differences over many decades. Absent a change in our accounting system, the third driver, the evolving economy, argues for higher price-earnings multiples, all else being equal. The simple basis for this conclusion is that companies that expense their investments tend to have higher cash-flow-to-net-income ratios than companies that capitalize their investments. This is likely a secular trend. Offsetting this upward bias, though, is the fact that the period of sustainable competitive advantage may well be shorter for service and knowledge… ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=2875))

- Gaining a firm grasp of a company’s prospects for economic returns requires a thorough understanding of competitive strategy.4 The goal of strategic analysis is to address three fundamental questions: 1. Is the company generating returns on investment above the cost of capital, or is there good reason to believe it will earn attractive returns in the future? 2. If returns do exceed the cost of capital, for how long can the company sustain its excess returns?5 3. Once a company’s returns dip below the cost of capital, what’s the probability it can stage a sustained recovery to above-required returns? In this piece I take a closer look at the latter two questions, drawing on empirical data from the technology and retail industries to bring the points to life.

- One microeconomic theory that is well documented empirically is the notion that a company’s return on investment reverts to the cost of capital over time.6 The theory, and intuition, is straightforward.

Similarly, capital flees poor-return industries—through bankruptcy, disinvestment, or consolidation—lifting returns back to the cost of capital.

- Why a Date and a Marriage Are So Different Game theory is the study of interactions among players trying to maximize their payoff. What makes the analysis tricky is that the actions (and reactions) of the players determine the payoff. So game theory forces executives to think not only about their own choices but also how those choices will affect the choices of their competitors. Not all executives naturally put themselves in their competitors’s shoes. Consider the following quotation from the former chief financial officer of a leading multinational paper company: If you’re thinking about building a new paper facility, you’re going to base your decision on some assumptions about economic growth . . . What we never seem to factor in, however, is the response of our competitors. Who else is going to build a plant or machine at the same time?6 One simple yet powerful model in game theory is the prisoner’s dilemma.7 Consider a case where two competing commodity producers must decide whether or not to add capacity at a cyclical peak. Exhibit 26.1 shows the payoffs. If competitor B adds capacity and A does not (upper right corner), B gets a disproportionate payoff. Alternatively, if A adds and B doesn’t (lower left corner), A gets most of the spoils. If both add capacity (lower right corner), the aggregate payoff drops and neither A nor B do as well as if only they had added capacity. Finally, the industry payoffs are the highest if neither company adds capacity (upper left corner), but each company’s payoff is not as high as it would have been if only one had added capacity.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So what should a company do if it plays the game once? Suppose you’re company A and you believe company B won’t add capacity. Your best strategy is to add capacity. But let’s say you believe company B will add capacity. Your best choice, again, is to add capacity yourself. So no matter what competitor B does, if you play the game once it pays for you to add capacity. 8 The scenario that optimizes total value, though, is for neither company to add capacity. Among other things, game theory shows that the rational solution for a company is not always the solution that is optimal for the industry in total. In business, as in our trench warfare example, the interaction is not one time but continual. So instead of playing the prisoner’s dilemma once, companies effectively play it over and over. Cooperation is much more likely to evolve in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma because companies “learn” to work together.

- Managers and investors generally consider growth to be an absolute good. Managers routinely discuss stretch objectives and sometimes even embrace “big, hairy audacious” goals to motivate their employees and to impress their shareholders. Growth investors routinely seek companies that promise rapid, sustainable increases in sales and earnings. But most investors do not intuitively understand the power, and onus, of compounding. To see how you stack up, take this little quiz: One dollar today becomes how much when compounded over twenty years? Write the amount in the space provided. Starting amount Compounded at (%) Becomes how much after 20 years? $1 2 ________ $1 7 ________ $1 15 ________ $1 20 ________ For most of us, these calculations do not come naturally. A 2 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over twenty years turns $1 into $1.49. A 7 percent growth rate equals $3.87. A 15 percent rate—a common earnings growth goal among large companies—implies a value of $16.37. And finally, $1 compounded at a 20 percent rate becomes $38.34. How did you do? If you are like most people, you had difficulty properly gauging the relationship between the growth rate and the ending value. For example, it is not intuitive to most investors that an increase from 15 to 20 percent growth implies more than a doubling in value after twenty years. That’s why Albert Einstein called compounding the “eighth wonder of the world.” The trick for investors is to make the compounding work for them, not against them.

- The entire population of company sizes, like city sizes, tends to follow a distinct distribution.4 In models that replicate this distribution, scientists note that average growth rates are independent of size and that the growth rate variance declines with size. Call it the cone of growth. Exhibit 27.4 shows this graphically. Here I looked at the ten-year compounded annual sales growth rate for over 2,600 U.S. companies. The horizontal axis is on a log scale. The chart shows that while the average growth rate for small and large companies is approximately the same, there is less likelihood that a large company will grow or shrink rapidly. Investors often call this the law of large numbers—big companies can’t grow as fast as small companies—but it’s more accurate to say that big company growth doesn’t vary much from the average growth rate.5 Readers who have gotten to this point may have the impression that all companies with high growth rate expectations are poor investments. Nothing could be further from the truth! The problem is that while we know that some companies will grow rapidly in the future, spurring upside revisions and attractive shareholder returns, we have no systematic way to identify those companies. Therein lies a great opportunity. ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3144))

- To demonstrate that growth is good but that it’s hard to take advantage of it, we turn to Jeremy Siegel’s excellent analysis of the Nifty Fifty in his investment classic Stocks for the Long Run.6 The Nifty Fifty were the leading growth stocks in the early 1970s and had high growth rate expectations and price/earnings (P/E) multiples in excess of forty. In the subsequent bear market of 1973-1974, these stocks as a group dropped sharply. Siegel asks a basic question: Were the Nifty Fifty overvalued in 1972 based on their subsequent total shareholder returns? Based on his analysis, the answer is no. While some stocks did much better than the market (Philip Morris, Gillette, and Coca-Cola) and others did much worse (Burroughs, Polaroid, and Black & Decker), on balance they delivered a return consistent with that of the overall market. Siegel’s point is that based on ensuing performance, the warranted P/E in 1972 was much higher for some companies and much lower for others. But on average, the P/E was just about right.

- That there’s a gap between expectations and reality is not new. For example, bottom-up estimates of S&P 500 earnings have consistently been more optimistic than the top-down appraisal. But today, the issue seems compounded by the earnings expectations game.7 Managers and investors engage in an expectations-bar-raising ritual. Executives work to meet or beat Wall Street’s forecasts, which encourages analysts to increase their expectations, and compels the executives to deliver even more growth—by whatever means possible. 8 Investors and managers must have reasonable expectations. The evidence shows that sustaining rapid growth is very difficult, especially for large corporations. Furthermore, while there is nothing wrong with growth stocks, the indications are that it is very difficult to know which companies will exceed expectations and which will disappoint. Investors should continue to focus on investment ideas where the expected value is favorable—where the upside opportunity outstrips the downside risk.

- Science has much to teach investors. The essays in this part are valuable because they offer some important mechanisms that explain how markets are efficient (and inefficient), delve into important empirical results that standard finance doesn’t handle well, and show why it’s futile to make simple cause-and-effect links in markets. Social insects, like ants and bees, are fascinating because they show us how decentralized groups coordinate effectively to solve problems. This part looks at various forms of collective problem solving, from a honeybee waggle dance to the Hollywood Stock Exchange. One of the best examples of a complex adaptive system—generically, a system that emerges from the interaction of lots of heterogeneous agents—is the stock market. Research suggests that when investors err independently, markets are functionally efficient. What’s more, defining the conditions under which markets are efficient provides us with a template to consider when markets are inefficient. Many models in standard finance theory assume that stock price changes are normally distributed around the well-known bell curve. A normal distribution is a powerful analytical tool, because you can specify the distribution with only two variables, the mean and standard deviation. The model, despite its elegance, has a problem: it doesn’t describe real world results very well. In particular, the model is remiss in capturing “fat tails”: infrequent but very large price changes. The failure of risk-management models to fully account for fat tails has led to some high-profile debacles, including the 1998 demise of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. Fat tails are closely associated with power laws, a mathematical link between two variables characterized by frequent small events and infrequent large events. Power laws are fascinating, and they empirically represent relationships as diverse as city sizes, earthquakes, and income distribution. While scientists still don’t have a firm grasp on the mechanisms behind power laws, their very existence provides investors with good insight. Humans have a deep-seated desire to link cause and effect. Unfortunately, markets do not easily satisfy this desire. Unlike some mechanical systems, you can’t understand markets by looking at the parts. Reductionism doesn’t work. Yet we often turn to individuals to explain the workings of the market. Just as an ant relying on local information and local interaction has no clue what’s going on at the colony level, explaining all but the most mundane market moves is beyond the ability of market mavens. Complex adaptive systems have another feature that is difficult to grasp: the magnitude of an outcome is not necessarily proportionate to the size of the perturbation. Sometimes small perturbations lead to large changes, and vice versa. We have to let go of our conventional notions of proportionality when we study markets. In recent years, scientists have renewed their efforts to find… ([Location 3191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3191))

- In the fall of 2000, I gathered a small group of leading investors to hear from various finance, strategy, and business luminaries. While these presenters were terrific, none got the award for creating the most buzz. That honor went to Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Norman Johnson, who opened his talk in a seemingly inauspicious way: “I’ve been asked here to talk about what’s wrong with experts—as an expert in this area—in a subject area, finance, that I know almost nothing about.”1 ([Location 3224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3224))

- What did Johnson say to cause these smart investors to slide forward in their chairs? Simply put, he showed how diverse groups of “average” people, acting together, solve problems better than experts do. Johnson illustrated his point by discussing the behavior of social insects, including ants and bees. It was the incredible performance of these insects, above all, that sparked the imaginations of the listeners. Most of Johnson’s talk was at the macro level, or how the collective solves problems. This has obvious relevance for understanding how market efficiency arises.2 My focus here is on the micro level, or how investors, as individuals , should organize for investment success. While the unit of analysis is different, the message is the same: diverse information and perspectives can help improve investment performance. Now think carefully for a moment about your information sources. Do you read the same newspapers, talk to the same people, and review the same type of research reports… ([Location 3228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3228))

- Before dwelling on the individual, I would like to show how diversity leads to better answers and how a lack of diversity can create inefficiencies. Johnson demonstrates how the collective is better than the average individual with a maze problem: • First, he asks individuals of identical capabilities to solve a maze. Because the individuals have no global sense of the problem, they simply explore until they find a solution. • Next, he asks the individuals to solve the problem again. With some learned information, they tend to improve. • Finally, he constructs a linear combination of each individual’s experiences and uses the same rules to find a collective solution. Because each individual’s initial search is random, a collection of individuals reflects diverse experience (maze regions), preferences (preferred paths), and performances (path lengths).3 So the collective is really just a normal individual with super information. Because of this diverse information, the collective solution is vastly more robust than the average individual solution (see exhibit 28.1). The power of this collective effect has not been lost on nature. This is where Johnson’s stories about ants come in. How do the ants do it? Foraging ants depart the nest with one job in mind, to find… ([Location 3240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3240))

- Once researchers understood this collective ability, they decided to play a trick on the ants. In a controlled setting, the scientists placed two food sources at identical path lengths from the nest. As it turned out, the ants ended up using just one of the paths, although they chose at random. Why? Because they follow chemical trails, a couple more ants going down one path will attract other ants, triggering a positive feedback loop. So instead of finding an optimal solution, the ants have one crowded path and an equally long empty path. Amazingly, though, nature anticipated this problem as well. As it turns out, ants periodically break from the main path and begin a random search process again. The ants are “programmed” to strike a balance between exploiting a known food source and exploring for the next food source (see exhibit 28.2). Johnson calls this the “wild hair” alternative. The ants are hard-wired to seek diversity. ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3260))

- Here is where Norman Johnson’s message is so important for investors. In well-defined systems, experts are useful because they can provide rules-based solutions. But when a system becomes complex, a collection of individuals often solves a problem better than an individual—even an expert. This means that the stock market is likely to be smarter than most people most of the time, a point the empirical facts bear out. To be an expert in a complex system like the stock market, Johnson continues, you need two essential features. First, you must be able to create a “simulation” in your head, allowing you to conceive and select strategies.6 A description of the legendary hedge fund manager George Soros illustrates the point: [Gary] Gladstein, who has worked closely with Soros for fifteen years, describes his boss as operating in almost mystical terms, tying Soros’s expertise to his ability to visualize the entire world’s money and credit flows. “He has the macro vision of the entire world. He consumes all this information, digests it all, and from there he can come out with his opinion as to how this is going to be sorted out. He’ll look at charts, but most of the information he’s processing is verbal, not statistical.”7 In addition, you must populate your mental system with information from diverse sources. While the ability to simulate may be largely hardwired (although you can improve your skills in this area), the pursuit of diverse ideas is within your control. Psychologist Donald Campbell describes the situation in similar terms, referring to the process of creative thinking as “blind variation and selective retention.” In other words, creative thinkers seek a variety of ideas but only choose those that are useful given their current goals. Idea diversity allows you to find what Johnson calls “weak signals.” A weak signal may be the start of a trend away from the dominant path (such as new technology or development) or the right piece of information at the right time from an unexpected source. In fact, a recent study suggests that informal learning fulfils up to 70 percent of learning needs inside some organizations.8 It’s often difficult to know where the next beneficial idea will come from. The evidence suggests that exposure to diverse information sources can improve the likelihood of finding a useful idea.

- In his wonderful book The Wisdom of the Hive, Cornell biologist Thomas Seeley explains that returning honey bee foragers do a little dance to tell their colony mates where the food is. But what’s remarkable is that the duration of the dance reflects not only the richness of the foraging site the bees are advertising but also the colony’s need for the commodity in question. In other words, each bee’s communication dance considers both the colony’s opportunities and its needs. As a result, a bee colony’s overall allocation pattern is appropriate even though no one bee is in control.1 Ants also demonstrate remarkable collective behavior. Leading ant researcher Deborah Gordon shows that ants place their cemeteries at the point furthest from the colony. But it gets better, because they place their trash heaps at the spot that maximizes its distance from the cemetery and the colony.2 Without awareness, the ants solve a tricky spatial problem worthy of a standardized intelligence test. What makes the behavior of social insects like bees and ants so amazing is that there is no central authority, no one directing traffic. Yet the aggregation of simple individuals generates complex, adaptive, and robust results. Colonies forage efficiently, have life cycles, and change behavior as circumstances warrant. These decentralized individuals collectively solve very hard problems, and they do it in a way that is very counterintuitive to the human predilection to command-and-control solutions. I look at three systems that depend on collective behavior—social insects, decision markets, and the stock market—and consider the similarities and differences to gain better insights into how markets work. I conclude that collectives are very effective in a host of circumstances, but that there are substantive differences between these systems.

- One lesson we can draw from social insects is that the whole is often greater than the sum of the parts. Yet we humans often rely on experts in all sorts of fields, including medicine, politics, finance, and public policy. Do experts give us the best answers, or is there a way to tap the collective knowledge of many individuals? Recent years have seen a rise in decision markets, where individuals bet on the outcomes of questions of interest and make or lose money based on whether or not they’re right. These decision markets have proven to be uncannily accurate and, like the social insect colonies, their success relies on distributed intelligence. The best known decision market is the Iowa Electronic Markets, founded in 1988.5 The IEM allows for bets on what percentage of the election vote individual candidates will receive. The market’s record is enviable: in the four presidential elections, the IEM’s market price was a better predictor of the election results than the polls (nearly 600 of them) three-quarters of the time. The IEM also hosts other markets.6 ([Location 3356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3356))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Why do decision markets work so well? First, individuals in these markets think they have some edge, so they self-select to participate. Second, traders have an incentive to be right—they can take money from less insightful traders. Third, these markets provide continuous, real-time forecasts—a valuable form of feedback. The result is that decision markets aggregate information across traders, allowing them to solve hard problems more effectively than any individual can.

- Stock markets share many of the same features as social insect colonies and decision markets. Markets emerge from the interaction of many individual investors. We’ve seen that both colonies and decision markets solve problems effectively. To gain better insight into the workings of these systems, we need to look at the differences as well as the similarities. Perhaps the biggest differences between the hive and the market are incentives and the role of prices. In a colony, each bee acts not to maximize its own well-being but rather the well-being of the colony (evolution shaped this behavior). In markets, each trader seeks to maximize his own utility. This difference may make colonies more robust than markets because colonies are not as susceptible to the positive feedback that creates market fragility. Also, hives do not have prices. Prices are important in a free-market economic system because they help individuals determine how to allocate resources. Bees convey information through their dances, but prices in markets often go beyond informing investors to influencing them, spurring unhealthy imitative behavior. Decision markets are also very different than stock markets because they have finite time horizons and defined outcomes. This specificity creates outcome boundaries that effectively limit speculative imitation. In other words, momentum strategies don’t work. Further, in stock markets, the performance of the stock can influence the company’s fundamental outlook.9 In decision markets, the outcome and the market are independent.

- Investors can draw a few messages from this discussion. First, decentralized systems, even with parts of limited intelligence, are often very effective at solving complex problems. The significance of distributed smarts will continue to rise as we create cheaper ways to harness the wisdom of the collective.10 Next, while we may be tempted to lump together all decentralized problem-solving systems, important distinctions exist—and those distinctions shape system performance. For example, stock prices tend to be efficient when investors are heterogeneous. But when heterogeneity does not prevail and investor errors become nonindependent, markets become subject to excesses.11 Markets are more prone to excesses than colonies and decision markets. Finally, decentralized systems tend to be robust. Despite episodic excesses, markets adapt well to change. This perspective shifts the onus of rationality away from… ([Location 3391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3391))

- Creating a market from a collective is another powerful way to aggregate information and solve problems. Here, rather than matching a problem with a unique solution, the group solves a problem better than any single individual—even an expert. Victorian polymath Francis Galton was one of the first to thoroughly document this group-aggregation capability. In a 1907 Nature article, “Vox Populi,” Galton describes a contest to guess the weight of an ox at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition in Plymouth. He collected 787 participants who each paid a sixpenny fee to participate. (A small cost to deter practical joking.) According to Galton, some of the competitors were butchers and farmers, likely expert at guessing the weight. He surmised that many others, though, were guided by “such information as they might pick up” or “by their own fancies.” Galton calculated the median estimate—the vox populi—as well as the mean. He found that the median guess was within 0.8 percent of the correct weight, and that the mean of the guesses was within 0.01 percent. To give a sense of how the answer emerged, Galton showed the full distribution of answers. Simply stated, the errors cancel out and the result is distilled information.4 Subsequently, we have seen the vox populi results replicated over and over. Examples include solving a complicated maze, guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, and finding missing bombs.5 In each case, the necessary conditions for information aggregation to work include an aggregation mechanism, an incentive to answer correctly, and group heterogeneity. Estimating Printers with Populi In the prior example, the aggregation of individuals determined a particular state—the ox’s weight, the number of jellybeans, the location of the bomb—but did not make a prediction of a future state. Is there any difference between estimating what is and estimating what is going to be? Well, solid evidence exists to suggest that the vox populi is pretty good at anticipating the future. Scientists at Hewlett-Packard have demonstrated that even small groups can predict results better than individuals. Apparently, the internal market that Hewlett-Packard set up to predict sales was more accurate than its official internal forecasts.6 And Now, For the Real World So collectives have proven adept at matching seekers and solvers and determining current or future states. How does all of this apply to the stock market? The stock market is different than the markets I’ve described because there is no answer—stocks have no specified time horizon or value. (The exception is when a company has agreed to be acquired, in which case the stock price tends to very accurately represent the ultimate value.) As a result, stock investors are susceptible to imitation because they can earn excess profits by selling to someone else willing to pay a higher price. Said differently, one or more of the three conditions for proper information aggregation—group… ([Location 3456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3456))

- In his 2001 letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett distinguishes between experience and exposure. Although Buffett’s comments are in the context of Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business, his point is valid for any exercise with subjective probabilities. Experience, of course, looks to the past and considers the probability of future outcomes based on occurrence of historical events. Exposure, on the other hand, considers the likelihood—and potential risk—of an event that history (especially recent history) may not reveal. Buffett argues that in 2001 the insurance industry assumed huge terrorism risk without commensurate premiums because it was focused on experience, not exposure. Investors, too, must discern between experience and exposure. The high-profile failures of Long Term Capital Management and Victor Niederhoffer give witness to this point. Remarkably, however, standard finance theory does not easily accommodate extreme events. Financial economists generally assume that stock price changes are random, akin to the motion of pollen in water as molecules bombard it.1 In a triumph of modeling convenience over empirical results, finance theory treats price changes as independent, identically distributed variables and generally assumes that the distribution of returns is normal, or lognormal. The virtue of these assumptions is that investors can use probability calculus to understand the distribution’s mean and variance and can therefore anticipate various percentage price changes with statistical accuracy. The good news is that these assumptions are reasonable for the most part. The bad news, as physicist Phil Anderson notes above, is ([Location 3506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3506))

- Normal distributions are the bedrock of finance, including the random walk, capital asset pricing, value-at-risk (VaR), and Black-Scholes models. Value-at-risk models, for example, attempt to quantify how much loss a portfolio may suffer with a given probability. While there are various forms of VaR models, a basic version relies on standard deviation as a measure of risk. Given a normal distribution, it is relatively straightforward to measure standard deviation, and hence risk. However, if price changes are not normally distributed, standard deviation can be a very misleading proxy for risk.2 The research, some done as far back as the early 1960s, shows that price changes do not follow a normal distribution. Exhibit 31.1 shows the frequency distribution of S&P 500 daily returns from January 1, 1978, to March 30, 2007, and a normal distribution derived from the data. Exhibit 31.2 highlights the difference between the actual returns and the normal distribution. Analyses of different asset classes and time horizons yield similar results.3 The figures show that: • Small changes appear more frequently than the normal distribution predicts • There are fewer medium-sized changes than the model implies (roughly 0.5 to 2.0 standard deviations) • There are fatter tails than what the standard model suggests. This means that there is a greater-than-expected number of large changes The fat tails, in particular, warrant additional comment. These extreme value changes happen considerably more frequently than the standard model implies and can have a substantial influence on portfolio performance—especially for leveraged portfolios. For example, during the October 1987 crash, which I excluded from my figures for presentation purposes, the *S&P 500 plummeted over 20 percent… ([Location 3521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3521))

- The pattern of many small events and few large events is not unique to asset prices. Indeed, it is a signature of systems in the state of “self-organized criticality.” Self-organization is the result of interaction between individual agents (in this case, investors) and requires no leadership. A critical state is one where small perturbations can lead to events of many types. Self-organized criticality marks systems as varied as earthquakes, extinction events, and traffic jams.5 Is there a mechanism that can help explain these episodic lunges? I think so. As I have noted in other essays, markets tend to function well when a sufficient number of diverse ([Location 3547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3547))

A burgeoning literature on herding addresses this phenomenon. Herding is when many investors make the same choice based on the observations of others, independent of their own knowledge. Information cascades, another good illustration of a self-organized critical system, are closely linked to herding.7 ([Location 3553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3553))

- OK: Big changes in prices appear more frequently than they are supposed to. What does this mean for investors from a practical standpoint? I believe there are a few important implications: • Cause and effect thinking. One of the essential features of self-organized critical systems is that the size of the perturbation and that of the resulting event may not be linearly linked. Sometimes small-scale inputs can lead to large-scale events. This dashes the hope of finding causes for all effects. • Risk and reward. The standard model for assessing risk, the capital-asset-pricing model, assumes a linear relationship between risk and reward. In contrast, nonlinearity is endogenous to self-organized critical systems like the stock market. Investors must bear in mind that finance theory stylizes real world data. That the academic and investment communities so frequently talk about events five or more standard deviations from the mean should be a sufficient indication that the widely used statistical measures are inappropriate for the markets. • Portfolio construction. Investors that design portfolios using standard statistical measures may understate risk (experience versus exposure). This concern is especially pronounced for portfolios that use leverage to enhance returns. Many of the most spectacular failures in the hedge fund world have been the direct result of fat-tail events. Investors need to take these events into consideration when constructing portfolios. A useful means to navigate a fat-tailed world is to first measure the current expectations underlying an asset price and then contemplate various ranges of value outcomes and their associated probabilities. This process allows investors to give some weight to potential fat-tail events.8 Standard finance theory has advanced our understanding of markets immensely. But some of the theory’s foundational assumptions are not borne out by market facts. Investors must be aware of the discrepancies between theory and reality and adjust their thinking (and portfolios) accordingly.

- Bernoulli’s Challenge Competent investors take great pride in their ability to place an appropriate value on a financial claim. This ability is the core of investing: markets are just vehicles to trade cash for future claims, and vice versa. OK, here’s a cash-flow stream for you to value: Say the house flips a fair coin. If it lands on heads, you receive two dollars and the game ends. If it lands on tails, the house flips again. If the second flip lands on heads, you get four dollars; if it lands on tails, the game continues. For each successive round, the payoff for landing on heads doubles (i.e., $2, $4, $8, $16, etc.) and you progress to the next round until you land on heads. How much would you pay to play this game? Daniel Bernoulli, one of a family of distinguished mathematicians, first presented this problem to the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences in 1738.1 Bernoulli’s game, known as the St. Petersburg Paradox, challenges classical theory, which says that a player should be willing to pay the game’s expected value to participate. The expected value of this game is infinite. Each round has a payoff of one dollar (probability of 1/2n and a payoff of $2n , or 1/2 x $2, 1/4 x $4, 1/8 x $8, etc.) So, Expected value = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 . . . = ∞ ([Location 3592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3592))

- Naturally, very few people would be willing to pay even twenty dollars to play the game. Bernoulli tried to explain the paradox with the marginal utility of money. He argued that the amount you would be willing to pay is a function of your resources—the greater your resources, the more you would be willing to pay. Still, Bernoulli’s explanation is not altogether satisfactory. The St. Petersburg Paradox has kept philosophers, mathematicians, and economists thinking for over two and a half centuries.2 Philosophical discourse aside, the St. Petersburg Paradox helps illuminate two very concrete ideas for investors. The first is that the distribution of stock market returns does not follow the pattern that standard finance theory assumes. This deviation from theory is important for risk management, market efficiency, and individual stock selection. The second idea relates to valuing growth stocks. What do you pay today for a business with a low probability of an extraordinarily high payoff? This question is more pressing than ever in a world with violent value migrations and increasing returns. What’s Normal? Asset price distributions are of great practical significance for portfolio managers. Standard finance theory assumes that asset price changes follow a normal distribution—the well-known bell curve. That this assumption is roughly accurate most of the time allows analysts to use very robust probability statistics. For example, for a sample that follows a normal distribution, you can identify the population average and characterize the likelihood of variance from that average. However, much of nature—including the manmade stock market—is not normal.3 Many natural systems have two defining characteristics: an ever-larger number of smaller pieces and similar-looking pieces across the different size scales. For example, a tree has a large trunk and a number of ever-smaller branches, and the small branches resemble the big branches. These systems are fractal. Unlike a normal distribution, no average value adequately characterizes a fractal system. Exhibit 32.1 contrasts normal and fractal systems visually and shows the probability functions that represent the data. Fractal systems follow a power law.4 ([Location 3605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3605))

- Using the statistics of normal distributions to characterize a fractal system like financial markets is potentially very hazardous. Yet theoreticians and practitioners do it daily.5 The distinction between the two systems boils down to probabilities and payoffs. Fractal systems have few, very large observations that fall outside the normal distribution. The classic example is the crash of 1987. The probability (assuming a normal distribution) of the market’s 20-plus percent plunge in one day was so infinitesimally low it was practically zero. And still the losses were a staggering $2 trillion-plus. A comparison of a normal coin-toss game and the St. Petersburg game illustrates the point. Assume that you toss a coin and receive $2 if it lands heads and nothing if it lands tails. The expected value of the game is $1, the amount you would be willing to pay to play the game in a fair casino. I simulated 1 million rounds of 100 tosses each, and plotted the payoffs in exhibit 32.2. Just as you would expect, I got a well-defined normal distribution.6 EXHIBIT 32.2 Standard Coin Toss Game Source: Author analysis. I then simulated the St. Petersburg game 1 million times and plotted that distribution (see exhibit 32.3). While the underlying process is stochastic, the outcome is a power law. For example, half the time the game only pays two dollars, and three-quarters of the time it pays four dollars or less. However, a run of thirty provides a $1.1 billion payoff, but this is only a 1-in-1.1 billion probability. Lots of small events and a few very large events characterize a fractal system. Further, the average winnings per game is unstable with the St. Petersburg game, so no average accurately describes the game’s long-term outcome.

- Are stock market returns fractal? Benoit Mandelbrot shows that by lengthening or shortening the horizontal axis of a price series—effectively speeding up or slowing down time—price series are indeed fractal. Not only are rare large changes interspersed with lots of smaller ones, the price changes look similar at various scales (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly returns). Mandelbrot calls financial time series multifractal, adding the prefix “multi” to capture the time adjustment. EXHIBIT 32.3 Fractal Coin Toss Game Source: Author analysis. In an important and fascinating book, Why Stock Markets Crash, geophysicist Didier Sornette argues that stock market distributions comprise two different populations, the body (which you can model with standard theory) and the tail (which relies on completely different mechanisms). Sornette’s analysis of market drawdowns convincingly dismisses the assumption that stock returns are independent, a key pillar of classical finance theory. His work provides fresh and thorough evidence of finance theory’s shortcomings.7 St. Petersburg and Growth Stock Investing The St. Petersburg Paradox also provides insight for growth stock valuation.8 What should you be willing to pay for a very small probability that a company can grow its cash flows by a very significant amount forever?9 David Durand took up this question in his classic 1957 article, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox.”10 He encourages a good deal of caution, emphasizing reversion-to-the-mean thinking and modeling. But if anything, the challenge of valuing the low probability of significant value is even more pressing today than it was when Durand took on the challenge almost fifty years ago. Consider, for example, that of the nearly 2,000 technology-stock initial public offerings from 1980 through 2006, less than 5 percent account for over 100 percent of the $2-trillion-plus in wealth creation.11 And even within this small wealth-generating group, only a handful delivered the bulk of the huge payoffs. Given the winner-take-most characteristics of many growth markets, there’s little reason to anticipate a more normal wealth-creation distribution in the future. In addition, the data show that the distribution of economic return on investment is wider in corporate America today than it was in the past.12 So the spoils awaiting the wealth creators, given their outsized returns, are greater than ever before. As in the St. Petersburg game, the majority of the payoffs from future deals are likely to be modest, but some will be huge. What’s the expected value? What should you be willing to pay to play? Integrating the Outliers The St. Petersburg Paradox may be centuries old, but its lessons are as fresh as ever. One of the major challenges in investing is how to capture (or avoid) low-probability, high-impact events. Unfortunately, standard finance theory has little to say about the subject.

- Where does consciousness come from? This question has bedeviled philosophers and scientists for centuries. We have cured diseases, put men on the moon, and probed many details of our physical world. Yet even the best thinkers today have difficulty defining consciousness, let alone explaining it. Why have we had so much success in some scientific realms and so little in others, such as unveiling the mysteries of consciousness? Not all systems are alike, and we can’t understand the workings of all systems on the same level. Let’s start with the systems that we do understand. Many of science’s triumphs over the past few centuries are rooted in Isaac Newton’s principles. Newton’s world is a mechanical one, where cause and effect are clear and systems follow universal laws. With sufficient understanding of a system’s underlying components, we can predict precisely how the system will behave. Reductionism is the cornerstone of discovery in the Newtonian world, the basis for much of science’s breathtaking advance in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. As scientist John Holland explains, “The idea is that you could understand the world, all of nature, by examining smaller and smaller pieces of it. When assembled, the small pieces would explain the whole.”1 In many systems, reductionism works brilliantly. But reductionism has its limits. In systems that rely on complex interactions of many components, the whole system often has properties and characteristics that are distinct from the aggregation of the underlying components. Since the whole of the system emerges from the interaction of the components, we cannot understand the whole simply by looking at the parts. Reductionism fails. Neuroscientist William Calvin, who is in the thick of the consciousness dialogue, notes that we can approach the problem in various ways but that the key to understanding consciousness certainly is not in the “basement” of neural chemistry or the “subbasement” of quantum mechanics. There are too many layers of interaction in the brain. The parts don’t explain the whole. Calvin calls the leap from the subbasement of quantum mechanics directly to the penthouse of consciousness the janitor’s dream.2 Why should investors care about the janitor’s dream? If the stock market is a system that emerges from the interaction of many different investors, then reductionism—understanding individuals—does not give a good picture of how the market works. Investors and corporate executives who pay too much attention to individuals are trying to understand markets at the wrong level. An inappropriate perspective of the market can lead to poor judgments and value-destroying decisions. Sorting Systems When a system has low complexity and we can define interactions linearly, reductionism is very useful. Many engineered systems fit this bill. A skilled artisan can take apart your wristwatch, study the components, and have a complete understanding of how the system works. Such systems… ([Location 3687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3687))

- Complex adaptive systems include governments, many corporations, and capital markets. Efforts to assert top-down control of these systems generally lead to failure, as happened in the former Soviet Union. Exhibit 33.1 contrasts the two types of systems. Thinking about the market as a complex adaptive system is in stark contrast to classical economic and finance theory, which depicts the world in Newtonian terms. Economists treat agents as if they are homogenous and build linear models—supply and demand, risk and reward, price and quantity. None of this, of course, much resembles the real world.5 ([Location 3732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3732))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The stock market has all of the characteristics of a complex adaptive system. Investors with different investment styles and time horizons (adaptive decision rules) trade with one another (aggregation), and we see fat-tail price distributions (nonlinearity) and imitation (feedback loops). An agent-based approach to understanding markets is gaining broader acceptance. But this better descriptive framework does not offer the neat solutions that the current economic models do. Investors who view the stock market as a complex adaptive system avoid two cognitive traps. The first is the constant search for a cause for all effects. Critical points, where large-scale reactions are the result of small-scale perturbations, are a characteristic of complex adaptive systems. So cause and effect are not always easy to link. Following the stock market crash of 1987, for instance, the government commissioned a study to isolate the “cause” of the crash. After an exhaustive study, the Brady commission was unable to find a particular cause. The point here is not that cause and effect don’t exist but rather that not every effect has a proportionate cause. As humans like to identify a cause for every effect, this concept is difficult to internalize. The second trap is to dwell on the input of any individual at the expense of understanding the market itself. For example, executives often question how it is that the empirical evidence shows the market follows cash flows when most investors talk about accounting results. The answer is that every individual operates with his or her own decision rules, while the market represents the aggregation of these rules. Further, studies of systems with sufficient complexity show that a collective of diverse individuals tends to solve problems better than individuals can—even individuals that are so-called experts.6 Using What You’ve Got Time-pressured decision makers often rely on rules of thumb, or heuristics, for their decision making. While heuristics don’t always lead to the best answer in a particular situation, they are often useful precisely because they save time for their users. However, heuristics can also lead investors to make biased decisions. One facet of successful decision making is gaining an understanding of these biases so as to mitigate their cost.7 The availability heuristic allows investors to assess the frequency or likely cause of an event by the degree to which similar events are “available” in memory. Ease of recall is one bias that emanates from the availability heuristic. In other words, investors or managers may place greater emphasis on information that is available than on information that is relevant.

- I believe this bias is at the heart of the janitor’s-dream problem. Investors and managers spend a lot of time focusing on information that is available, like current earnings and multiples, rather than on information that is more meaningful—that is, what the market reveals about expectations for future performance. Corporate managers see analyst reports that dwell on earnings and hence incorrectly assume that the market is a simple addition of these agents. Investors and corporate managers trying to understand the market must recognize that it’s a complex adaptive system.

- So we humans are wired to make links between causes and effects. And making up causes for effects is not beyond us. The events with no clear causes that baffled us for most of human existence—illness, lightning, and volcanoes—are things that we now largely understand. Unsurprisingly, our ancestors turned to the supernatural to explain these effects. Today, we comprehend many systems but remain vexed by large, interconnected systems—often called complex adaptive systems. We can’t understand the global properties and characteristics of a complex adaptive system by analyzing the underlying heterogeneous individuals. These systems are not linear or additive; the whole does not equal the sum of the parts. As a result, cause and effect defies any simple explanation. The stock market is a perfect example of such a system.4 In investing, our innate desire to connect cause and effect collides with the elusiveness of such links. So what do we do? Naturally, we make up stories to explain cause and effect. Why should investors care about cause and effect in the market? An appreciation of our need for explanation can be an inoculation against making mistakes. Investors who insist on understanding the causes for the market’s moves risk focusing on faulty causality or inappropriately anchoring on false explanations. Many of the big moves in the market are not easy to explain. ([Location 3799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3799))

- Two hundred years ago, determinism ruled in science. Inspired by Newton, scientists largely embraced the notion of a clockwork universe. The French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace epitomized this thinking with a famous passage from A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities: An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate Nature and the mutual positions of the beings that comprise it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit its data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest atom: for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain; and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.

- Philosophers and scientists now call this “intellect” Laplace’s demon. The notion that we can work out the past, present, and future through detailed calculations was, and remains, a very alluring concept precisely because it plays to our cause-and-effect bias. But complex adaptive systems do not accommodate such simple calculations. We can describe many complex systems as being in the state of self-organized criticality. “Self-organized” means that there is no leader. The system arises from the interaction of many underlying individuals. “Criticality” suggests nonlinearity. More specifically, the magnitude of a perturbation within the system (cause) is not always proportionate to its effect. Small perturbations can lead to large outcomes, and vice versa.

- Human desire to close the cause-and-effect loop combined with stock market movements that elude simple explanation can lead to some silly after-the-fact narrative. Researchers took the S&P 500 Index’s fifty biggest daily price changes from 1941 through 1987 and examined what the press reported as the cause (see exhibit 34.1). They concluded that up to half of the variance of stock prices was the result of factors other than news on fundamentals. They write: On most of the sizable return days, however, the information the press cites as the cause of the market move is not particularly important. Press reports on subsequent days also fail to reveal any convincing accounts of why future profits or discount rates might have changed.6 I did a similar exercise for the market’s biggest moves from late 2001 through March… ([Location 3833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=3833))

- As this discussion illustrates, investors should be wary of explanations for market activity. Investors that actively seek explanations for the market’s moves risk one of two pitfalls. The first pitfall is confusing correlation for causality. Certain events may be correlated to the market’s moves but may not be at all causal. In one extreme example, Cal Tech’s David Leinweber found that the single best predictor of the S&P 500 Index’s performance was butter production in Bangladesh.7 While no thoughtful investor would use butter production for predicting or explaining the market, factors that are economically closer to home may also suggest faulty causation. The second pitfall is anchoring. Substantial evidence suggests that people anchor on the first number or piece of evidence they hear to explain or describe an event. In one example, researchers asked participants to estimate the percentage of African countries in the United Nations. But before answering, the participants watched the research leader spin a wheel of fortune numbered one to one hundred. When the wheel landed on ten, one group of participants guessed 25 percent. When the wheel landed on sixty-five, another group guessed 45 percent.8 This example may appear frivolous, but investors make serious financial decisions under the influence of similar anchors.

- Here’s an activity to offset ennui on a rainy afternoon. Take a text—say, James Joyce’s Ulysses—and for all the words plot the rank (from the most widely used words to the least-used) and frequency (how often each word occurs).1 If you express this word distribution on a proportional log scale, you will find a straight line from the upper left hand of the chart to the bottom right hand of the chart.2 George K. Zipf, a Harvard linguist, noticed this relationship in a number of systems in the 1930s and summarized them in his famous book Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort. Zipf’s law, as scientists came to call it, is actually only one example among many of a “power law.” To take language as an example, a power law implies that you see a few words very frequently and many words relatively rarely. Zipf erroneously argued that his law distinguished the social sciences from the physical sciences. Since his work, scientists have discovered power laws in many areas, including physical and biological systems. For example, scientists use power laws to explain relationships between the mass and metabolic rates of animals, frequency and magnitude of earthquakes (the Gutenberg-Richter law), and frequency and size of avalanches. Power laws are also very prominent in social systems, including income distribution (Pareto’s law), city size, Internet traffic, company size, and changes in stock price. Many people recognize power laws through the more colloquial “80/20 rule.”3 Why should investors care about power laws? First, the existence of power law distributions can help reorient our understanding of risk. Most of finance theory—including models of risk—is based on the idea of normal or lognormal distributions of stock price changes. A power law distribution suggests periodic, albeit infrequent price movements that are much larger than the theory predicts. This fat-tail phenomenon is important for portfolio construction and leverage. Second, the existence of power laws suggests some underlying order in self-organizing systems. Even though scientists haven’t fully explained the mechanisms that lead to power laws in social systems, we have enough evidence that power laws exist to make some structural predictions about what certain systems will look like in the future. Finally, standard economic theory does not easily explain these power laws. For example, neoclassical economics focuses on equilibrium outcomes and assumes that individuals are fully informed, rational, and that they interact with one another indirectly (through markets). In the real world, people are adaptive, are not fully informed, and deal directly with one another. So ideally we should seek to explain the empirical findings with an approach that fits how people really act.4 The More Things Change . . . Zipf specified a very simple equation to express his law: Rank x Size = Constant This equation says that the quantity under study is inversely proportional to the rank.

- There are a number of ways that an understanding of power laws helps investors. The first way builds off Axtell’s work on company size. Given the evidence that power law distributions are robust over time, we have a good sense of what the distribution will look like in the future even though we have no idea where individual companies will fall within it.10 But given reasonable assumptions for economic growth and inflation, we can derive a good estimate of the probabilities of companies being of a particular size. We know ahead of time, for example, that a miniscule percentage of companies will be very large (e.g., > $200 billion sales). We can look at the imputed growth rates of large companies today and discern how many of them are projected, based on expected growth, to be very large. If the group projected to be very large vastly exceeds the percentage that will be large, we know there is the likelihood of substantial downward expectation revision. Another way investors can use power laws is to understand the topology of the Internet. A classic example of a self-organizing network, the Internet has spawned a host of power law relationships—including the number of links per site, the number of pages per site, and the popularity of sites. These power laws suggest uneven benefits for companies that make heavy use of the Web.11 The development of the Web may be instructive for the organization of future networks. Power laws represent a number of social, biological, and physical systems with fascinating accuracy. Further, many of the areas where power laws exist intersect directly with the interests of investors. An appreciation of power laws may provide astute investors with a useful differential insight into the investment process.

Yet there is powerful evidence that once a company’s core business has matured, the pursuit of new platforms for growth entails daunting risk. Roughly one company in ten is able to sustain the kind of growth that translates into an above-average increase in shareholder returns over more than a few years. . . .

- On the surface, the size and frequency distribution for species, cities, and company sizes may not seem like they would have a lot in common. Yet each follows a power law, which looks like a straight line when plotted on a log-log scale. Power laws indicate that there are lots of small occurrences and very few large ones.1 In nature, there are lots of ants—the combined weight of ants is larger than the combined weight of humans—but very few elephants. Similarly, we have many small companies and a modest number of huge ones. Exhibit 36.1 shows examples of these distributions side by side. Take species for a moment. Why are large carnivorous animals, like tigers, relatively rare, while small animals, like termites, are so abundant? Ecologists answer by pointing out that all animals have a niche—not just a physical location, but a real place in the grand scheme of things. A species must not only survive in its home; it must successfully interact with the other plant and animal species that share that home. The niche idea, though, still doesn’t explain why the distribution of species looks the way it does. That insight came from Oxford’s Charles Elton, who noted that larger animals need smaller animals to sustain them. (Animals rarely prey on larger animals.) So, Elton reasoned, with every increment in body size, there should be an associated loss in numbers. He called this fact of life the “Pyramid of Numbers.” Big fierce animals are rare because they have fewer sources of energy than smaller animals.2 The species power law distribution is a natural outcome of interacting animals constrained by the laws of physics.3 What does this have to do with the stock market? Investors should pay attention to these distributions for three reasons. First, companies, like species, fit into niches. Thinking about these niches and how they change can provide some insight into a company’s growth potential. ([Location 4061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=4061))

- The idea that companies find niches is certainly not new. For example, many aspects of competitive-strategy literature in general, and game theory in particular, address how and why companies should seek profitable niches. The main message here is that environments, and hence niches, change over time as the result of technological developments, regulatory shifts, and industry entry and exit. Think of mini-mills versus integrated steel companies, or Internet-based retailers compared to brick-and-mortar competitors. New niches open, and new companies exploit them. A company’s ability to adapt to a changing environment is critical—and the number of companies that can do so is small. As a result, optimal firm size may not be fixed for a particular industry, and comparing the valuations of companies with different economic models doesn’t make sense.

- Ben Graham once said, “In the stock market, value standards don’t determine prices; prices determine value standards.”3 Individuals don’t construct value standards based on intrinsic principles but rather are influenced by what other people do. Stock prices reflect the collective actions of others. But we all don’t have equal potential to be influenced. We all have what’s called an adoption threshold, which is defined by how many other people must engage in an activity before we join in. Market extremes push the sentiment beyond the adoption threshold of nearly all investors. Such extremes can create, by definition, the conditions for a sentiment reversal. Also, we interact more than ever. Scientists have made significant strides in understanding the small-world effect—colloquially known as six degrees of separation—in recent years.4 One of the central ideas in the small-world model is clustering, or the degree to which connections to one node connect to another. For example, clustering expresses the likelihood that your friends are likely to know one another. When modeling these networks, researchers discovered that just a few random links between local, clustered networks dramatically reduce the degrees of separation. Because of our modern, low-cost communications network, ideas can cascade through social clusters faster than ever. The mass media further reinforce our interconnectedness. This biological analogy reveals that almost all investors succumb to strong sentiment—either bullish or bearish—sooner or later. Further, interaction is almost assured because of our ability to communicate. Sentiment swings are age old and there are no modern inoculations.

Here’s what they said about the prevailing investor psychology in the late 1920s: The “new-era” doctrine—that “good” stocks (or “blue chips”) were sound investments regardless of how high the price paid for them—was at bottom only a means of rationalizing under the title of “investment” the well-nigh universal capitulation to the gambling fever. We suggest that this psychological phenomenon is closely related to the dominant importance assumed in recent years by intangible factors of value, viz., good-will, management, expected earning power, etc. Such value factors, while undoubtedly real, are not susceptible to mathematical calculation; hence the standards by which they are measured are to a great extent arbitrary and can suffer from the widest variations in accordance with the prevalent psychology.8 Investors must bear in mind, too, that all sentiment extremes eventually pass, as Graham and Dodd remind us: But if past experience is any guide, the current critical attitude of the investor is not likely to persist; and in the next period of prosperity and plethora of funds for security purchases, the public will once again exhibit its ingrained tendency to forgive, and particularly to forget, the sins committed against it in the past.

- Self-affinity, or the resemblance of the parts to the whole, is another crucial feature of a fractal. Think of a cauliflower. The whole cauliflower, a large bump, and a small bump all visually resemble one another. Stock price changes are also fractal: after some adjustments, the data look the same whether you look at month-to-month, week-to-week, or day-to-day changes.7 Analysis shows that distributions of the spread between returns on investment and cost of capital show self-affinity across five levels: country, industry, company, firm, and division. The best way to assess this point is through visual inspection (see exhibit 38.2). Across all levels, we tend to see the same pattern of value creation, value neutrality, and value destruction. To be sure, some of the distributions skew toward value creation and others toward value destruction, but both sides of the spectrum are consistently represented. While I show only one industry (diversified chemicals), we can look at any industry and see a similar array of value performance. Ditto for an individual company. So there is nothing unique about the country, industry, company, division, or business line we selected (besides availability of the data). Making the Art Less Abstract The usefulness of this observation may appear, on the surface, as abstract as a Pollock painting. But I believe these distributions present at least five concrete implications for investors: 1. Consider why returns are less than the cost of capital. Generating poor returns is clearly not desirable, but it is important to consider why the returns are low. For example, a company that is early in its life cycle may have depressed returns because it is investing heavily, but its economic future may be bright. Current weak returns may belie a strong outlook. In contrast, a mature company may have poor returns because competitive forces have wrung out all the attractive opportunities, and the industry may be plagued with excess capacity. Companies also invest in new businesses where they have little chance of gaining a competitive advantage. So some insight into the nature of poor returns is very useful. 2. Look for changes in returns (both positive and negative) not anticipated by the market. Empirical evidence shows that changes in returns are strongly correlated to stock price changes. Companies with the greatest return improvement, on average, tend to significantly outperform the companies with the largest return degradation. These data suggest that the market does not fully anticipate the full degree of return changes.8 Investors should carefully gauge market expectations and try to determine whether or not those expectations are likely to change. Many investment processes fail to properly measure and consider market expectations.9 ([Location 4298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097D79OG&location=4298))
