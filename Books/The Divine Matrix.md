## Highlights
- For some of you, what you’re about to read is a new and very different way of thinking about how things work in life. For others, it’s a comforting synthesis of what you already know, or at least suspect, to be true. For everyone, however, the existence of a primal web of energy that connects your bodies, the world, and everything in the universe opens the door to a powerful and mysterious possibility. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=93))

- When we look at “life”—our spiritual and material abundance, our relationships and careers, our deepest loves and greatest achievements, along with our fears and the lack of all these things—we may also be gazing squarely in the mirror of our truest, and sometimes most unconscious, beliefs. We see them in our surroundings because they’re made manifest through the mysterious essence of the Divine Matrix, and for this to be the case, consciousness itself must play a key role in the existence of the universe.

- It was this theory that opened the door to what Bohm called the “creative operation of underlying … levels of reality.”4 In other words, he believed that there are deeper or higher planes of creation that hold the template for what happens in our world. It’s from these subtler levels of reality that our physical world originates. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=123))

- His second theory was an explanation of the universe as a single unified system of nature, connected in ways that aren’t always obvious. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=126))

- The things that we can see and touch and that appear separate in our world—such as rocks, oceans, forests, animals, and people—are examples of the explicate order of creation. However, as distinct as they may appear from one another, Bohm suggested that they’re linked in a deeper reality in ways that we simply cannot see from our place in creation. He viewed all of the things that look separate to us as part of a greater wholeness, which he called the implicate order.

- Just as the universe is constantly changing from implicate to explicate, the flow from the unseen to the seen is what makes up the dynamic current of creation. It’s this constantly changing nature of creation that John Wheeler had in mind when he described the universe as “participatory”—that is, unfinished and continually responding to consciousness.

- The implication of both quantum theory and the ancient texts is that in the unseen realms we create the blueprint for the relationships, careers, successes, and failures of the visible world. From this perspective, the Divine Matrix works like a great cosmic screen that allows us to see the nonphysical energy of our emotions and beliefs (our anger, hate, and rage; as well as our love, compassion, and understanding) projected in the physical medium of life. Just as a movie screen reflects without judgment the image of whatever or whoever has been filmed, the Matrix appears to provide an unbiased surface for our inner experiences and beliefs to be seen in the world. Sometimes consciously, oftentimes not, we “show” our truest beliefs about everything from compassion ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=165))

- to betrayal through the quality of relationships that surround us. In other words, we’re like artists expressing our deepest passions, fears, dreams, and desires through the living essence of a mysterious quantum canvas. However, unlike a conventional painter’s canvas, which exists in one place at a given time, our canvas is the same stuff that everything is made of—it is everywhere and is always present. Let’s carry the artist/canvas analogy one step further. Traditionally, artists are separate from their work and use their tools to convey an inner creation through an outer expression. Within the Divine Matrix, however, the separation between art and artist disappears: We are the canvas, as well as the images upon it; we are the tools, as well as the artist using them. The very idea of us creating from within our own creation brings to mind one of those Walt Disney cartoons that were common on black-and-white television back in the ’50s and ’60s. We would first see the hand of an unidentified artist sketch a well-known cartoon character such as Mickey Mouse on a drawing pad. As the image was being formed, it would suddenly become animated and lifelike. Then Mickey would begin to create his own drawings of other cartoon characters from within the sketch itself. Suddenly, the original artist was no longer needed and out of the picture … literally. With the hand nowhere to be seen, Mickey and his friends would take on lives and personalities of their own. While everyone in the make-believe house was sleeping, the entire kitchen would become joyously animated. As the sugar bowl danced with the saltshaker and the teacup rocked the world of the butter dish, the characters no longer had any connection to the artist. While this may be an oversimplification of how we function in the Divine Matrix, it also helps anchor the subtle and abstract idea of us as creators, creating from within our own creations. Just as artists refine an image until it’s exactly right in their minds, in many respects it appears that through the Divine Matrix we do the same thing with our life experiences. Through our palette of beliefs, judgments, emotions, and prayers, we find ourselves in relationships, jobs, and situations of support and betrayal that play out with different individuals in various places. At the same time, these people and situations often feel hauntingly familiar. Both as individuals and together, we share our inner-life creations as a never-ending cycle of moment layered upon moment, day after day, and so on. What a beautiful, bizarre, and powerful concept! Just the way a painter uses the same canvas again and ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=171))

- again while searching for the perfect expression of an idea, we may think of ourselves as perpetual artists, building a creation that’s ever-changing and without end. The implications of being surrounded by a malleable world of our own making are vast, powerful, and, to some, perhaps a little frightening. Our ability to use the Divine Matrix intentionally and creatively suddenly empowers us to alter everything about the way we see our role in the universe. At the very least, it suggests that there’s much more to life than chance happenings and occasional synchronicities that we deal with the best we can. Ultimately, our relationship to the quantum essence that connects us to everything else reminds us that we’re creators ourselves. As such, we may express our deepest desires for healing, abundance, joy, and peace in everything from our bodies and lives to our relationships. And we may do so consciously, in the time and manner that we choose. However, just as the initiates in Christopher Logue’s poem at the beginning of this Introduction needed a little… ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=190))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our oldest and most cherished wisdom traditions remind us that there is, in fact, a language that speaks to the Divine Matrix, one that has no words and doesn’t involve the usual outward signs of communication we make with our hands or body. It comes in a form so simple that we all already know how to “speak” it fluently. In fact, we use it every day of our lives—it is the language of human emotion. Modern science has discovered that through each emotion we experience in our bodies, we also undergo chemical changes of things such as pH and hormones that mirror our feelings.9 Through the “positive” experiences of love, compassion, and forgiveness and the “negative” emotions of hate, judgment, and jealousy, we each possess the power to… ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=203))

- In a similar fashion, the sixth-century Hsin-Hsin Ming (which translates to Faith-Mind Verses) describes the properties of an essence that is the blueprint for everything in creation. Called the Tao, it’s ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=219))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- ultimately beyond description, just as we see in the Vedic scriptures. It is all that is—the container of all experience, as well as the experience itself. The Tao is described as perfect, “like vast space where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.”11 According to the Hsin-Hsin Ming, it’s only when we disturb the tranquility of the Tao through our judgments that its harmony eludes us. When this inevitably does happen and we find ourselves enmeshed in feelings of anger and separation, the text offers guidelines to remedy this condition: “To come directly into harmony with this reality, just simply say when doubt arises, ‘Not two.’ In this ‘not two’ nothing is separate, nothing is excluded.” ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=221))

- We clearly don’t know all there is to know about the Divine Matrix. Science doesn’t have all of the answers—in all honesty, scientists aren’t even certain where the Divine Matrix came from, and we’re also aware that we could study it for another hundred years and still not find all the answers. What we do know, however, is that the Divine Matrix exists. It is here, and we may tap its creative power through the language of our emotions. We can apply this knowing in a way that’s useful and meaningful in our lives. By doing so, our connection to one another and all things cannot be denied. It’s in light of this connection that we may realize just how powerful we really are. From the place of strength that such a realization offers, we have the opportunity to become more peaceful and compassionate people, actively working to create a world that mirrors these qualities—and more. Through the Divine Matrix, we have the opportunity to focus on these ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=235))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- attributes in our lives, applying them as our inner technology of feelings, imagination, and dreams. When we do, we tap the true essence of the power to change our lives and the world. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=242))

- In many respects, our experience of the Divine Matrix may be compared to the software that runs a computer. In both, the instructions must use a language that the system understands. For the computer, this is a numerical code of 0s and 1s. For consciousness, a different kind of language is required, one that uses no ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=244))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- numbers, alphabets, or even words. Because we’re already part of the Divine Matrix, it makes perfect sense that we would already have everything we need to communicate with it, without the need for an instruction manual or special training. And we do. The language of consciousness appears to be the universal experience of emotion. We already know how to love, hate, fear, and forgive. Recognizing that these feelings are actually the instructions that program the Divine Matrix, we can hone our skills to better understand how to bring joy, healing, and peace to our lives.

- My experience with live presentations has shown that in order to reach an audience in a way that’s meaningful, it’s important to honor the way the listeners learn. Regardless of how “left-brained” we think we are or how “right-brained” we feel we are, the fact is that we all use both sides to make sense of the world. And while some people certainly do rely more on one hemisphere or the other, it’s important to honor both our intuition as well as our logic when we invite people to make a huge leap in how they see the world. For this reason, The Divine Matrix is written in much the same way that the fabric of a tapestry is created. Throughout these pages, I’ve woven the “right-brain” descriptions of personal accounts and direct experience into the “left-brain” research and reports of discoveries that tell us why these stories are important. This way of sharing information makes the data seem ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=270))

- less textbooklike, while still keeping enough of the leading-edge science to make it meaningful. Just as all life is built from the four chemical bases that create our DNA, the universe appears to be founded upon four characteristics of the Divine Matrix that make things work in the way they do. The key to tapping the power of the Matrix lies in our ability to embrace the four landmark discoveries that link it to our lives in an unprecedented way: Discovery 1: There is a field of energy that connects all of creation. Discovery 2: This field plays the role of a container, a bridge, and a mirror for the beliefs within us. Discovery 3: The field is nonlocal and holographic. Every part of it is connected to every other, and each piece mirrors the whole on a smaller scale. Discovery 4: We communicate with the field through the language of emotion.

- Additionally, when the focus of our lives becomes how to avoid disease rather than how to live in a healthy way, how to stay out of war rather than how to cooperate in peace, and how to create new weapons rather than how to live in a world where armed conflict has become obsolete, clearly the path we’re on has become one of survival. In such a mode, no one is truly happy—nobody really “wins.” When we find ourselves living this way, the obvious thing to do would be to look for another route. And that’s precisely what this book is about and why I’m sharing this story. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=419))

- In much the same way, if we believe that the space between any two things is empty, then it seems like a tremendous waste as well. Scientists believe that more than 90 percent of the cosmos is “missing” and appears to us as empty space. That means that of the entire universe as we know it, only 10 percent has anything in it. Do you really believe that the 10 percent of creation we occupy is all there is? What’s in the space that we think of as “empty”? If it’s really vacant, then there’s a big question that must be answered: How can the waves of energy that transmit everything from our cell-phone calls to the reflected light bringing this page’s words to your eyes travel from one place to another? Just as water carries ripples away from the place where a stone is tossed into a pond, something must exist that conveys the vibrations of life from one point to another. For this to be true, however, we must upset one of the key tenets of modern science: the belief that space is empty.

- Today, modern science has refined our understanding of Planck’s matrix, describing it as a form of energy that’s been everywhere, always present since time began with the big bang. The existence of this field implies three principles that have a direct effect upon the way we live, all that we do, what we believe, and even how we feel about each day of our lives. Admittedly, these ideas directly contradict many well-established beliefs of both science and spirituality. At the same time, though, it is precisely these principles that open the door to ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=830))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- an empowering and life-affirming way of seeing our world and living our lives: The first principle suggests that because everything exists within the Divine Matrix, all things are connected. If this is so, then what we do in one part of our lives must have an effect and influence on other parts. The second principle proposes that the Divine Matrix is holographic—meaning that any portion of the field contains everything in the field. As consciousness itself is believed to be holographic, this signifies that the prayer we make in our living room, for example, already exists with our loved ones and at the place where it’s intended. In other words, there’s no need to send our prayers anywhere, because they already exist everywhere. The third principle implies that the past, present, and future are intimately joined. The Matrix appears to be the container that holds time, providing for a continuity between the choices of our present and the experiences of our future.

- Regardless of what we call it or how science and religion define it, it’s clear that there’s something out there—a force, a field, a presence—that is the great “net” that links us with one another, our world, and a greater power. If we can truly grasp what the three principles tell us about our relationship to each other, the universe, and ourselves, then the events of our lives take on an entirely new meaning. We become participants rather than victims of forces that we can’t see and don’t understand. To be in such a place is where our empowerment really begins.

- “Everything must be based on a simple idea.

- “There are many bushes in this valley,” he continued, “and every plant is joined to the others through a root system that’s beyond our view. Although they’re hidden from our eyes beneath the ground, the roots still exist—the entire field is one family of sage. And as with any family,” he explained, “the experience of one member is shared to some degree by all others.” I contemplated what Joseph was saying. What a beautiful metaphor for the way we’re connected to one another and the world around us. We’ve been led to think that we’re separate from one another, our world, and everything that happens in it. In that belief, we feel isolated, alone, and sometimes powerless to change the things that cause our own pain and the suffering of others. The irony is that we also find ourselves inundated with self-help books and workshops that tell us how connected we are; how powerful our consciousness is; and how humankind is really a single, precious family. As I listened to Joseph, I couldn’t help but think of the way in which the great poet Rumi described our condition. “What strange beings we are!” he said. “That sitting ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=862))

- in hell at the bottom of the dark, we’re afraid of our own immortality.”1 Precisely, I thought. Not only are the plants in this field connected, but they possess a power together that’s greater than any of them has alone. Any single shrub in the valley, for example, influences only the small area of earth that surrounds it. Put hundreds of thousands of them together, though, and you have a power to reckon with! Together, they change features such as the pH of the soil in a way that assures their survival. And in doing so, the by-product of their existence—their abundant oxygen—is the very essence of ours. As a unified family, these plants can change their world. We may actually have more in common with the sage in that New Mexico valley than you’d think. Just as they have the power individually and collectively to change their world, so do we. A growing body of research suggests that we’re more than cosmic latecomers simply passing through a universe that was completed long ago. Experimental evidence is leading to a conclusion that we’re actually creating the universe as we go and adding to what already exists! In other words, we appear to be the very energy that’s forming the cosmos, as well as the beings who experience what we’re creating. That’s because we are ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=871))

- This is the very essence of quantum theory that troubled Einstein so much. Until the end of his life, he held to a belief that the universe exists independently of us. Responding to analogies about our effect on the world and the experiments showing that matter changes when we observe it, he simply stated, “I like to think that the moon is there even if I am not looking at it.”2 ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=882))

- The ancient collection of writings from India called the Vedas are among the world’s oldest scriptures and are believed by some scholars to date as far back as 7,000 years. In what’s perhaps the best-known text, the Rig Veda, there’s a description of a force that underlies creation from which all things are formed—the force that was there before the “beginning.” This power, named Brahman, is identified as the “unborn … in whom all existing things abide.”6 Further in the text it becomes clear that all things exist because “the One manifests as the many, the formless putting on forms.” ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=908))

- All these experiments suggest two similar conclusions, which are the crux of this book: There is something “out there”: the matrix of an energy that connects any one thing with everything else in the universe. This connective field accounts for the unexpected results of the experiments. The DNA in our bodies gives us access to the energy that connects our universe, and emotion is the key to tapping in to the field. In addition, the experiments show us that our connection to the field is the essence of our existence. If we ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=1101))

I invite you to think about what these results and conclusions mean in your life. What problem can’t be solved, what illness can’t be healed, and what condition can’t be improved if we’re able to tap the force and change the quantum blueprint where all of these things come from? That blueprint is the previously unrecognized field of energy that Max Planck described as the “conscious and intelligent Mind.” ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DJ735LC&location=1106))
