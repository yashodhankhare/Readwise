## Highlights
- Though we didn’t have helpful ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=88))
- connections and I went to public schools, I found a resource that made all the difference: I learned how to think. Some people think in words, some use numbers, and still others work with visual images. I do all of these, but I also think using models. A model is a simplified version of reality, like a street map that shows you how to travel from one part of a city to another or the vision of a gas as a swarm of tiny elastic balls ceaselessly bouncing against one another. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=88))
- The notion that things I couldn’t even see followed rules I could discover just by thinking—and that I could use what I discovered to change the world—inspired me from an early age. Because of circumstances, I was largely self-taught and that led me to think differently. First, rather than subscribing to widely accepted views—such as you can’t beat the casinos—I checked for myself. Second, since I tested theories by inventing new experiments, I formed the habit of taking the result of pure thought—such as a formula for valuing warrants—and using it profitably. Third, when I set a worthwhile goal for myself, I made a realistic plan and persisted until I succeeded. Fourth, I strove ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=96))
- to be consistently rational, not just in a specialized area of science, but in dealing with all aspects of the world. I also learned the value of withholding judgement until I could make a decision based on evidence. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=101))
- Thorp is also known to be a generous man, intellectually speaking, eager to share his discoveries with random strangers (in print but also in person)—something you hope to find in scientists but usually don’t. Yet he is humble—he might qualify as the only humble trader on planet Earth—so, unless the reader can reinterpret what’s between the lines, he or she won’t notice that Thorp’s contributions are vastly more momentous than he reveals. Why? Because of their simplicity. Their sheer simplicity. For it is the straightforward character of his contributions and insights that made them both invisible in academia and useful for practitioners. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=109))
- Before Ed Thorp, mathematicians of gambling had their love of chance largely unrequited. Thorp’s method is as follows: He cuts to the chase in identifying a clear edge (that is something that in the long run puts the odds in his favor). The edge has to be obvious and uncomplicated. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=128))
- capturing the edge, converting it into dollars in the bank, restaurant meals, interesting cruises, and Christmas gifts to friends and family—that’s the hard part. It is the dosage of your betting—not too little, not too much—that matters in the end. For that, Ed did great work on his own, before the theoretical refinement that came from a third member of the Information Trio: John Kelly, originator of the famous Kelly Criterion, a formula for placing bets that we discuss today because Ed Thorp made it operational. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=132))
- A bit more about simplicity before we discuss dosing. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=136))
- They prefer the mouse to give birth to a mountain; it is the perception of sophistication that matters. The more complicated, the better; the simple doesn’t get you citations, H-values, or some ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=138))
- such metric du jour that brings the respect of the university administrators, as they can understand that stuff but not the substance of the real work. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=139))
- Ed was initially an academic, but he favored learning by doing, with his skin in the game. When you reincarnate as practitioner, you want the mountain to give birth to the simplest possible strategy, and one that has the smallest number of side effects, the minimum possible hidden complications. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=142))
- It is mentally easy to just bet incrementally up and down—bet larger when the number is high, smaller when it is low—and such a strategy is immediately applicable by anyone with the ability to tie his shoes or find a casino on a map. Even while using wearable computers at the roulette table, the detection of edge was simple, so simple that one can get it while standing on a balance ball in the gym; the fanciness resides in the implementation and the wiring. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=147))
- Now money management—something central for those who learn from being exposed to their own profits and losses. Having an “edge” and surviving are two different things: The first requires the second. As Warren Buffet said: “In order to succeed you must first survive.” You need to avoid ruin. At all costs. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=154))
- The Kelly-Thorp method requires no joint ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=167))
- distribution or utility function. In practice, one needs the ratio of expected profit to worst-case return—dynamically adjusted (that is, one gamble at a time) to avoid ruin. That’s all. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=167))
- So the world today is divided into two groups using distinct methods. The first method is that of the economists who tend to blow up routinely or get rich collecting fees for managing money, not from direct speculation. Consider that Long-Term Capital Management, which had the crème de la ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=172))
- crème of financial economists, blew up spectacularly in 1998, losing a multiple of what they thought their worst-case scenario was. The second method, that of the information theorists as pioneered by Ed, is practiced by traders and scientist-traders. Every surviving speculator uses explicitly or implicitly this second method (evidence: Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones, Renaissance Technologies, even Goldman Sachs!). I said every because, as Peters and Gell-Mann have shown, those who don’t will eventually go bust. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=174))
- You can detect that the man is in control of his life. This explains why he looked younger the second time I saw him, in 2016, than he did the first time, in 2005. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=189))
- A trait that showed up at about this time was my tendency not to accept anything I was told until I had checked it for myself. This had ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=227))
- consequences. When I was three, my mother told me not to touch the hot stove because it would burn me. I brought my finger close enough to feel the warmth, then pressed the stove with my hand. Burned. Never again. Another time, I was warned that fresh eggs would crack if they were squeezed just a little bit. Wondering what “a little bit” meant, I squeezed an egg very slowly until it cracked, then practiced squeezing another, stopping just before it would crack, to see exactly how far I could go. From the beginning, I loved learning through experimentation and exploration how my world worked. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=228))
- When I was reading or just thinking, my concentration was so complete that I lost all awareness of my surroundings. My mother would call me, with no response. Thinking I was willfully ignoring her, the shout would became a yell, then she would bring her flushed face right up to me. Only when she appeared in my visual field did I snap back into the here and now and respond. She had a hard time deciding whether her son was stubborn and badly behaved or was really as unaware as he claimed. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=258))
- My unusual retention of information was pronounced until I was about nine or ten, when it faded into a memory that is very good for what I’m interested in and, with exceptions, not especially remarkable for much else. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=286))
- Before the advent of writing and books, human knowledge was memorized and transmitted down the generations by storytellers; but when this skill wasn’t necessary it declined. Similarly, in our time ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=298))
- with the ubiquity of computers and hand calculators, the ability to carry out mental calculations has largely disappeared. Yet a person who knows just grammar school arithmetic can learn to do mental calculations comfortably and habitually. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=299))
- This skill, especially to make rapid approximate calculations, remains valuable, particularly for assessing the quantitative statements that one continually encounters. For instance, listening to the business news on the way to my office one morning, I heard the reporter say, “The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA] is down 9 points to 11,075 on fears of a further interest rate rise to quell an overheated economy.” I mentally estimated a typical (one standard deviation ) DJIA change from the previous close, by an hour after the open, at about 0.6 percent or about sixty-six points. The probability of the reported move of “at least” nine points, or less than a seventh of this, was about 90 percent, so the market ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=301))
- action was, contrary to the report, very quiet and hardly indicative of any fearful response to the news. There was nothing to worry about. Simple math allowed me to separate hype from reality. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=306))
- None of this would have happened if, as I wish I had done, I had asked myself beforehand, If you do this, what do you want to happen? and If you do this, what do you think will happen? I wouldn’t have liked either answer. These two questions became valuable guides for me in the future. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=997))
- The Martingale system, or doubling-up system, is one of the many betting schemes that gamblers had devised in an attempt to win. It was often used at roulette for bets with even-money payoffs, such as “red” or “black.” The standard American wheel has eighteen red numbers, eighteen black numbers, and two green numbers for a total of thirty-eight. With an even-money payoff, for each thirty-eight spins, you can expect to win a bet on red or a bet on black on average eighteen times and lose twenty for a net loss of two. In an attempt to get around this disadvantage, you start the Martingale by betting $1 on, say, red. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1030))
- After each loss, bet twice as much on the next spin of the wheel, always on red. Eventually you win—red has to come up sometime—and that win covers the previous string of losses, plus a profit of $1. Then start again by betting $1 and repeat the whole process, netting another $1 profit each time when you finally win. The catch is that after many doublings, your required bet can be so large that either you have run out of money or the casino won’t allow it. With an infinite number of possible sequences of outcomes in a gambling game, it was impossible to ever know through trial and error whether any particular betting system worked. To analyze each scheme mathematically, one at a time, was hopeless as well, as there was always a new one to test. One of the triumphs of mathematics had been to prove with a single theorem that all such systems must fail. Under fairly general assumptions, no method for varying the size of ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1034))
- your bets could overcome the casino’s advantage. Recalling my old high school ideas for the physical prediction of roulette, as I sipped my tea I argued with the others at the table that, despite all the math to the contrary, you could beat roulette. Using what I had learned from six additional years of physics, I explained that friction would gradually slow the orbiting ball in its circular track until finally gravity would be enough to cause it to spiral down and in toward the center. I argued that an equation could forecast the ball’s position during this process. Although the descending ball crosses onto the rotor, which spins in a direction opposite to the ball, a second equation could also specify the position of the rotor. Limiting the predictive power of my equations were random irregularities that can’t be forecast, what mathematicians and physicists call noise. Conventional wisdom said the noise was enough to ruin the prediction. I didn’t think so ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1041))
- and decided to find out. Fortunately, I didn’t know at the time that one of the greatest mathematicians of the previous hundred years, Henri Poincaré, had “proven” that physical prediction at roulette was impossible. His proof was sound, only assuming a modest and plausible randomness in predicting the final resting place of the ball. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1048))
- I had been told this story about Feynman and roulette in Las Vegas: Watching a man placing $5 bets on red or on black, Feynman told him betting against the casino was a losing proposition and that he, Feynman, would be happy to play the part of the casino. The two of them wandered from wheel to wheel with the gambler betting against Feynman by calling out “red” or black” before the spin, paying Feynman when he lost and getting paid in turn when he won. As it happened, even with a disadvantage, the gambler was lucky enough to get ahead by $80, at which point Feynman quit. Though he was acting as the casino and would eventually ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1113))
- come out ahead, he wasn’t willing to risk further losses. Feynman was like a casino that only had an $80 bankroll, one likely to be wiped out by a customer’s lucky run. Assuming the truth of the story, even one of the world’s greatest physicists may not have realized that he needed a much larger bankroll to cover the risk he was taking. Understanding and dealing correctly with the trade-off between risk and return is a fundamental, but poorly understood, challenge faced by all gamblers and investors. If anyone knew whether physical prediction at roulette was possible, it should be Richard Feynman. I asked him, “Is there any way to beat the game of roulette?” When he said there wasn’t, I was relieved and encouraged. This suggested that no one had yet worked out what I believed was possible. With this incentive, I began a series of experiments. One evening not long after we married, Vivian’s parents arrived for dinner and I ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1117))
- wasn’t there. Their brief search found me in our bedroom with a funny V-shaped wooden trough. One end was raised above the floor and I was releasing marbles from a marked spot on the higher end and letting them roll down the trough and across the floor, marking where each one stopped. I explained this was an experiment to predict roulette. What had this contraption to do with roulette? Imagine the circular track on the roulette wheel “unfolded” so it is straight, then rotated so it is a “trough.” Now raise one end and release a marble (the ball) from a measured height. The amount the marble drops corresponds to a “push,” in this case from gravity rather than from a hand. The marble rolling across the floor gradually slows from friction just as the roulette ball is slowed… ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1124))
- in-laws. They had hoped their daughter would marry “our son-in-law the doctor” or “our son-in-law the lawyer.” What have we here? they mused. A year or so later a wealthy older student whom I was tutoring, knowing of my interest, gave me a new half-scale replica of a roulette wheel. With Vivian’s help I made movies of the spinning ball and included a stopwatch graduated in hundredths of a second in each film to provide an accurate time for every frame. The predictions were not good enough but the wheel and ball had lots of defects; if these—as I expected—were not present on casino wheels, it would allow me to win. Vivian was remarkably tolerant of my roulette experiments, seeing as they diverted time from finishing my thesis and getting a… ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1131))
- money. What drew me was the chance of doing something people thought wasn’t possible, to be a bit… ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1139))
- I also believed then, as I do now after more than fifty years as a money manager, that the surest way to get rich is to play only ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1163))
- those gambling games or make those investments where I have an edge. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1164))
- The game I was about to play, blackjack, or twenty-one, was basically the same as the Spanish game of twenty-one, referred to as early as 1601 in a story by Cervantes. During the mid-eighteenth century, as part of the European gambling craze of that time, the French called it vingt-et-un. Later, when the game was introduced in the twentieth century to US gaming establishments, bonuses were sometimes offered for special combinations of ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1182))
- cards, among them a ten-to-one payoff if a player’s first two cards were the Ace of Spades plus one of the two black Jacks, a “blackjack.” Though the bonus was soon rescinded, this name for the game stuck, and any two-card total of 21—that is, any Ace plus any Ten-value card—is now called blackjack as well. The action starts when the players place their bets on “spots” in front of them, after which the dealer gives two cards to everyone and also two cards to himself. The first of the dealer’s cards is dealt faceup for everyone to see, and the second is placed facedown under it. Then, starting with the player on his left, the dealer asks each participant in turn how he wants to play his hand. The goal of both player and dealer is to draw cards to get as close to a total of 21 as possible without going over. Anyone who does so “busts” and immediately loses. Aces count as either 1 or 11 at the option of the player. Ten, Jack, Queen, and King all count as 10, the ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1185))
- so-called Tens or Ten-value cards. The other cards, 2, 3, and so on through 9, count as their face value. The dealer typically must draw until he has a total of 17, then he must stop or “stand.” A player may stand at any time. The dealer’s edge is that the player must risk busting first, losing immediately, even if the dealer later also goes over 21, though in effect they have tied. Because he loses when they both bust, a player who follows the dealer’s strategy for his hands has a disadvantage of about 6 percent. On the other hand, the dealer has fixed rules to follow and the player doesn’t, giving the player more choices than the dealer, and this flexibility to choose a different way to play his cards can have a remarkable impact. Among these choices, before drawing or standing, a player with two cards of the same value, such as a pair of 9s (9, 9), may split them into two new hands, adding another bet equal to his original one, and getting a second card on ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1193))
- each. He then plays out the two hands one at a time. Not all pairs should be split. Splitting a pair of 8s, for example, usually turns out to be good, but splitting Ten-value cards does not. Alternatively, the player can elect to turn his first two cards faceup, double his bet, and get exactly one more card. This is called doubling down. Unlike the dealer, the player is also free to draw or stand on any total of 21 or less. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1200))
- Fifteen minutes later, I had lost $8.50 of my $10 stake and quit. But now, to Vivian’s dismay, I was hooked on blackjack—though not in the usual sense. The atmosphere of ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1220))
- ignorance and superstition surrounding the blackjack table that day had convinced me that even good players didn’t understand the mathematics underlying the game. I returned home intending to find a way to win. Had I been more knowledgeable about the history of gambling and the centuries of effort devoted to the mathematical analysis of games, I might not have tackled blackjack. To anyone who observes the glittering Las Vegas Strip and the gambling boom that has brought lotteries and casinos to most US states, clearly a lot of people are losing a lot of money—tens of billions annually. Furthermore, for most casino gambling games, mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino’s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term because they each play for a comparatively short time, which allows some of them to be lucky winners. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1221))
- This is true for any game where you can compute the edge and the payoff does not depend on the results of previous bets or the wagers of other players. Coin tossing, craps, keno, roulette, and the money wheel are examples, provided you don’t have, for instance in the case of wheels, the help of a prediction device. Horse racing and the stock market are different, because you can’t compute the probabilities and because other players’ bets affect the payoffs. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1229))
- As a mathematician, I had heard that winning systems were supposed to be impossible; I didn’t know why. I did know that the theory of probability had begun more than four hundred years earlier with a book on games of chance. Attempts to find winning systems over the following centuries stimulated the development of the theory, eventually leading to proofs that winning systems for casino gambling games were, under most circumstances, impossible. Now I benefited from my habit of checking it out for myself. As my eyes gobbled up equations, suddenly I saw both why I could beat the game and how ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1242))
- to prove it. I started with the fact that the strategy I had used in the casino assumed that every card had the same chance of being dealt as any other during play. This cut the casino’s edge to just 0.62 percent, the best odds of any game being offered. But I realized that the odds as the game progressed actually depended on which cards were still left in the deck and that the edge would shift as play continued, sometimes favoring the casino and sometimes the player. The player who kept track could vary his bets accordingly. With the help of a mental picture based on ideas from an advanced mathematics course, I believed the player edge must often be substantial. Moreover, and this also was new, I saw how the player could condense and use this information in actual play at the table. I decided to begin by finding the best strategy to use when I knew which cards had already been played. Then I could bet more when the odds were in my favor and bet less ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1246))
- otherwise. The casino would win more of the small bets, but I would win a majority of the big wagers. And if I bet enough where I had an advantage, I should eventually get ahead and stay ahead. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1254))
- The first results indicated that the casino advantage, when you played as perfectly as possible without keeping track of the cards that have been played, was 0.21 percent. The game was virtually even for anyone. It wouldn’t take much in the way of card counting to give the player an edge! However, because even the IBM 704 was unable to do all the necessary calculations in the available time, I used approximations for some parts of the calculations. I knew that the results using these shortcuts were slightly pessimistic. This meant that the real game was even better for the player than my computer results indicated. As computers became more powerful, my approximations were removed step by step. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1351))
- Twenty years later, around 1980, computers had finally become powerful enough to show that the final figure for one deck using the blackjack rules as given in the book I would go on to write, Beat the Dealer, was +0.13 percent in favor of the player. Players using my strategy had had, all along, a small edge over the casino even without keeping track of the cards. But the real power of my method was that I could analyze the game not only for the complete deck, but for any collection of cards. I could explore the impact on the game as the cards were used during play. Now I instructed the computer to venture into the unknown: Analyze the game when all four Aces were missing. Comparing the results with those I already had for the full deck, I would see the effect Aces had on the game. With anticipation I picked up my ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1357))
- rather thick deck of punch cards a few days later from the out-bin. (It occurred to me that I was using cards to evaluate a card game.) The IBM 704 had done a thousand man-years of hand calculations in just ten minutes of computer time. I looked at these results with great excitement, for they would very likely either prove I was right or dash my hopes. The result was a player disadvantage of 2.72 percent with all the Aces gone—2.51 percent worse than the overall 0.21 percent casino edge. Although this was a huge shift in favor of the casino, it was actually great news. It proved conclusively what I believed in that Eureka moment back in the UCLA library when I thought I could beat the game, namely, that as cards were played there would be huge shifts in the edge, back and forth, between the casino and the players. The ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1363))
- math also showed me that if removing a specific group of cards from the deck shifted the odds in one direction, adding an equal number of the same cards instead would move the odds the other way about the same amount. This meant that with an Ace-rich deck rather than an Ace-poor deck, the player should have a big advantage. For instance, with twice the usual proportion of Aces, which happens when all four Aces remain among the last twenty-six cards (half the deck), the player ought to gain roughly 2.51 percent over his initial 0.21 percent disadvantage, for a net edge of about 2.30 percent. Every two or three days I went to the computer center and picked up another completed calculation, each of which would have taken a thousand man-years by hand. I now knew the impact of removing any four cards of one type from the ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1369))
- deck. Taking out four Aces was worst for the player, and removing four Tens was next worst, adding 1.94 percent to the house edge. But taking out the “small” cards, which are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, helped the player enormously. Removing four 5s was best, changing the casino edge of 0.21 percent to a huge player edge of 3.29 percent. Now I could design a great variety of winning strategies based on keeping track of the cards. My analysis using MIT’s IBM 704 had produced the basic results that gave me the Five-Count System, most of the Ten-Count System, and the ideas for what I called the ultimate strategy. The latter assigned a point value to every card,… ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1375))
- to keep track of mentally, many simpler counting systems worked quite well. One of the best compromises between ease of use and profitability was to count the small-value cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) as +1 as they are seen during play, intermediate cards (7, 8, 9) as 0, and large-value cards (10, J, Q, K, A) as −1. From the results of my computer runs anyone could work out the details of nearly all the blackjack card counting systems in use today. Intuitively, these results make sense. For instance, when the dealer has a total of 16 he has to hit. He loses if he draws a big card that puts his total over 21 and survives if he draws a small card.

- two-card totals of 21, or blackjacks. The player and the dealer each win with a blackjack about 4.5 percent of the time but the player gets paid 1.5 times his bet for this while the dealer gains only the player’s bet, for a net benefit to the player. Keeping track of the 5s leads to a very simple winning system. Suppose the player bets small whenever any 5s are left and bets big whenever all the 5s are gone. The likelihood of all the 5s being gone increases as fewer cards remain. When twenty-six cards are left, this will happen about 5 percent of the time, and if only thirteen cards are left, 30 percent of the time. Since the player then has a 3.29 percent edge… ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1387))
- the fluctuation in the percentage of Ten-value cards in the deck, even though my calculations showed that the impact of a Ten was less than that of a 5, since there were four times as many Tens. The larger fluctuations in “Ten-richness” that resulted gave the player more and better opportunities. During our family drive from Boston to California in the summer of 1960, I persuaded a reluctant Vivian to stop briefly in Las Vegas so I could test the Tens strategy. We sat down to play blackjack in one of the casinos downtown on Fremont Street. I had a $200 bankroll (worth about $1600 in 2016) and a palm-sized card with my new strategy. I… ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1393))

Specifically, the complete deck had 36 non-Tens and 16 Tens, so I started counting “36, 16,” which gives a ratio of non-Tens to Tens of 36 ÷ 16 = 2.25. Vivian and I sat down together, with her betting 25 cents a hand to keep me company. As play progressed and I kept track of the non-Tens and Tens that were used, I reduced the totals for those remaining. Whenever I had to place a bet or make a decision on how to play my hand, I used the current totals to recalculate the ratio. A ratio below 2.25 meant the deck… ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=1399))

At this point my dealer said hostilely, “You’d better take out some more money, because you’re going to need it.” Smelling a rat, Vivian said, “Let’s get out of here.” Even though I lost, I was satisfied because I had shown that I could play the Ten-Count System at casino speed without looking at the strategy card. The $32 loss was well within the range of possible outcomes predicted by my theory, so it didn’t lead me to doubt my results.

But eleven months later at a Southern California meeting of the American Mathematical Society, Taylor and I heard the great man talk. The subject was my discovery, in detail, presented as part of his original work, and it was also about to appear under his name in print, in a well-known mathematical journal.

This required a member of the academy to approve and forward my work, so I sought out the only mathematics member of the academy at MIT, Claude Shannon. Claude was famous for the creation of information theory, which is crucial for modern computing, communications, and much more. The department secretary arranged a short appointment with a reluctant Shannon at noon.

He pointed out in closing that I appeared to have made the big theoretical breakthrough on the subject, and that what remained to be discovered would be more in the way of details and elaboration.

Before I gave my talk at the meeting, I hadn’t envisaged the clamor and the sort of publicity that would follow. Instead, I’d expected scholars to look at my work, be very surprised at the results, and eventually agree that it was correct. But rather than this happening in a quiet, slow-paced academic way, I was besieged by strangers all wanting a piece of me. This kind of “fame” I didn’t need. Offers to back a casino test of my system ranged from a few thousand dollars to $100,000. The decision was being thrust upon me as to whether or not to prove my academic theory would really work at the tables.

The clincher was the casino spokesman on television who, speaking of my system said, “When a lamb goes to the slaughter, the lamb might kill the butcher. But we always bet on the butcher.” The most promising offer came from two New York multimillionaires whom I called Mr. X and Mr. Y when I wrote about them later.

As I would learn, most stock-picking stories, advice, and recommendations are completely worthless. Then Vivian remarked on my second mistake in thinking, my plan for getting out, which was to wait until I was even again. What I had done was focus on a price that was of unique historical significance to me, only me, namely, my purchase price. Behavioral finance theorists, who have in recent decades begun to analyze the psychological errors in thinking that persistently bedevil most investors, call this anchoring (of yourself to a price that has meaning to you but not to the market). Since I really had no predictive power, any exit strategy was as good or bad as any other. Like my first mistake, this error was in the way I thought about the problem of when to sell, choosing an irrelevant criterion—the price I paid—rather than focusing on economic ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2584))

After months of examining his data and predictions, I was unable to find anything of value. As Vivian said at the start, “This is going to be a waste of time.

Among them was the awareness that sooner or later, others would make the same discoveries, that scientific research ought to be a public good, and that I would continue to have more ideas.

- As an economist, Sheen felt that he understood the companies well enough to deviate from a neutral hedge. A neutral hedge gives balanced protection against loss whether the market moves up or down. Sheen, however, was willing to modify the long and short proportions in the hedge to favor either a rise in the price of the underlying stock or a fall, depending on his analysis. Given my bad experiences in picking stocks and my lack of background in analyzing companies, I wanted to do hedges that were as protected as possible against changes in the stock price, no matter in which direction. I continued to work on the theory and to invest on my own. A major theoretical breakthrough came to me in 1967. I used Occam’s razor—the principle that given more than one explanation, you should begin by choosing the simplest one—and plausible reasoning to arrive at a neat formula for determining the ([Location 2703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2703))

That same year I began using the formula to trade and hedge over-the-counter warrants and options and, a little later, convertible bonds. An option to buy a stock is similar to a warrant, the principal difference being that warrants are typically issued by the company itself and options are not. Convertible bonds are like ordinary bonds but with the additional feature that they can be exchanged for a fixed number of shares of the issuing company’s stock if the holder so desires. Having the formula further increased my confidence and returns. This, along with the fact that the available investment opportunities were much larger than I could exploit with my modest capital, led to the next step. I began to manage hedged portfolios for friends and acquaintances. ([Location 2710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2710))

Like standard dice, each face has a number between one and six, but unlike normal dice some numbers can be the same. In fact, for the dice Warren asked me about, each die has no more than two or three different numbers. These dice are used to play a gambling game: You pick the “best” of the three dice, then from the remaining two I pick the “second best.” We both roll and the high ([Location 2760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2760))

If A beats B, and B beats C, it seems plausible that since A was better than B and B was better than C, A ought to be much better than C. Instead C beats A. This puzzles people, because they expect things to follow what mathematicians call the transitive rule: If A is better than B and B is better than C, then A is better than C. For example, if you replace the phrase better than by any of the phrases longer than, heavier than, older than, more than, or larger than, the rule is true. However, some relationships don’t follow this rule. For instance, is an acquaintance of and is visible to do not.

Often a majority of voters prefer candidate A over candidate B, candidate B over candidate C, and candidate C over candidate A.

- My initial plan for Princeton Newport Partners, which for the first five years we called Convertible Hedge Associates, was to find pairs of closely related securities that were priced inconsistently with respect to each other, and use them to construct investments that reduced risk. To form these hedges, we simultaneously bought the relatively underpriced security while offsetting the risk from adverse changes in its price by selling short the comparatively overpriced security. Since the prices of these two securities tended to move in tandem, I expected the combination to reduce risk while capturing extra returns.

Bachelier used mathematics to develop a theory for pricing options on the Paris stock exchange ([Location 2966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2966))
- (the Bourse). His thesis adviser, the world-famous mathematician Henri Poincaré, didn’t value Bachelier’s effort, and Bachelier spent the rest of his life as an obscure provincial professor. Meanwhile a twenty-six-year-old Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein would soon publish in his single “miraculous year” of 1905 a series of articles that would transform physics. One of these initiated the Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized the theory of gravitation and led to the nuclear age. The second paper, on the particle nature of light, helped launch the Quantum Theory. But it is yet another of Einstein’s articles that connects with my story. In that paper Einstein explained a baffling discovery made in 1827 by the botanist Robert Brown. Brown used his microscope to observe pollen particles suspended in water. When illuminated, their tiny points of reflected light displayed a ceaseless irregular random motion. Einstein realized that this was caused ([Location 2968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2968))

Here was the final proof that atoms and molecules were real. This article became one of the most widely cited in all of physics. Unknown to Einstein, his equations describing the Brownian motion of pollen particles were essentially the same as the equations that Bachelier had used for his thesis five years earlier to describe a very different phenomenon, the… ([Location 2975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2975))

Bachelier’s paper appeared in 1964 in The Random Character of Stock Market Prices, edited by Paul Cootner and published by the MIT Press. Part of my early self-education in finance, this collection of articles applying scientific analysis to finance strongly influenced me and many others. Bachelier had assumed that changes in stock prices followed a bell-shaped curve, known as a normal or Gaussian distribution. This didn’t match real prices well, especially for periods longer than a few days. By the 1960s, academics had improved on Bachelier’s work by using a more accurate description of stock price changes. Even so, these newer formulas for fair option prices, which applied as well to warrants, were not useful for trading because they included two quantities that could not be estimated satisfactorily from data. One of these was a growth rate for the stock between “now” and the warrant’s expiration date. The other was a discount factor that was applied to the warrant’s uncertain payoff at expiration in order to obtain its present value. This discount factor, or markdown, accounted for the fact that investors tend to value an uncertain payoff less than if it was a sure thing. For example, if you toss a fair coin—which by definition has equal chances of coming up heads or tails—an investor who is paid $2… ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=2981))

Back in 1967, I had taken a further step in figuring out how much a warrant was worth. Using plausible and intuitive reasoning, I supposed that both the unknown growth rate and the discount factor in the existing warrant valuation formula could be replaced by the so-called riskless interest rate, namely that which was paid by a US Treasury bill maturing at the warrant expiration date. This converted an unusable formula with unknown quantities into a simple practical trading tool. I began using it for my own account and for my investors in 1967. It performed spectacularly.

- expensive for portfolio insurance programs continually to sell equities as the market drops, then buy them back when it rises due to commissions paid to brokers to execute the trade and because of the impact on the market price from the sale or purchase. The institutions using portfolio insurance, even though they paid lower rates on commissions than smaller investors, cut trading costs even more by using, instead of the underlying stocks, contracts to buy (or sell) at a specified future date the basket of stocks that made up the S&P 500 Index. These so-called futures contracts traded on exchanges along with those for future delivery of other assets, including bonds, currencies, metals, oil and gas, and agricultural products such as corn, wheat,… ([Location 3436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3436))

Known as margin, these funds are a fraction of the total contract amount. Since the futures contract will be exchangeable for the underlying asset, the two prices tend to track each other closely. The stage was set for disaster. By October 1987, futures contracts on the S&P 500 Index had been trading for a few years and were a popular way either to gain exposure to the market (buy, or “go long”) or to shed it (sell or “go short”) quickly and cheaply. Normally, the prices of these futures contracts were very close to the price of the S&P 500 Index itself. That was… ([Location 3442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3442))

After thinking hard about it overnight I concluded that massive feedback selling by the portfolio insurers was the likely cause of Monday’s price collapse. The next morning S&P futures were trading at 185 to 190 and the corresponding price to buy the S&P itself was 220. This price difference of 30 to 35 was previously unheard of, since arbitrageurs like us generally kept the two prices within a point or two of each other. But the institutions had sold massive amounts of futures, and the index itself didn’t fall nearly as far because the terrified arbitrageurs wouldn’t exploit the spread. Normally when futures were trading far enough below the index itself, the arbitrageurs sold short a basket of stocks that closely tracked the index and bought an ([Location 3450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3450))

When the price of the futures and that of the basket of underlying stocks converged, as they do later when the futures contracts settle, the arbitrageur closes out the hedge and captures the original spread as a profit. But on Tuesday, October 20, 1987, many stocks were difficult or impossible to sell short. That was because of the uptick rule. The rule was part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (rule 10a-1). It specified that, with certain exceptions, short-sale transactions are allowed only at a price higher than the last previous different price (an “uptick”). This rule was supposed to prevent short sellers from deliberately driving down the price of a stock. Seeing an enormous profit potential from capturing the unprecedented spread between the futures and the index, I wanted to sell stocks short and buy index futures to capture the excess spread. The index was selling at 15 percent, or 30 points, over the ([Location 3456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3456))

I called our head trader, who as a minor general partner was highly compensated from his share of our fees, and gave him this order: Buy $5 million worth of index futures at whatever the current market price happened to be (about 190), and place orders to sell short at the market, with the index then trading at about 220, not $5 million worth of assorted stocks—which was the optimal amount to best hedge the futures—but $10 million. I chose twice as much stock as I wanted, guessing only about half would actually be shorted because of the scarcity of the required upticks, thus giving me the proper hedge.

If that was his choice, I told him I would later tell all the other partners how the profit I made would have, but for him, belonged to the partnership rather than to me. Here was my reasoning. If, because of the uptick rule, only about half the shorts got off, then we would be properly hedged and make about $750,000.

We had about $9 million worth of futures long and $10 million worth of stock short, locking in $1 million profit.

- What could PNP have been worth twenty-five years later, in the year 2015? How could I possibly have any idea? Amazingly enough, a market-neutral hedge fund operation was built on the Princeton Newport model—the Citadel Investment Group. It was started in 1990 in Chicago by former hedge fund manager Frank Meyer when he discovered the young quantitative investment prodigy Ken Griffin, who was then trading options and convertible bonds from his Harvard dorm room. I met with Frank and Ken, outlining the workings and profit centers of PNP, as well as turning over cartons of documents outlining in detail the terms and conditions of older outstanding warrants and convertible bonds. These were valuable, because they were no longer available. ([Location 3616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3616))

Ken’s net worth in 2015 was estimated at $5.6 billion. As Princeton Newport Partners closed I reflected on the proposition that what matters in life is how you spend your time. When J. Paul Getty was the richest man in the world and manifestly not fulfilled, he said the happiest time of his life was when he was sixteen, riding waves off the beach in Malibu, California. In 2000, Los Angeles Times Magazine, speaking of new multibillionaire Henry T. Nicholas III of Broadcom Corporation, said, “It’s 1:30 a.m. He’s just turned 40—at his desk, in a dimly lit office. He hasn’t seen his wife and children, ‘my reason ([Location 3621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3621))

This is reminiscent of the so-called secretary or marriage problem in mathematics. Assume that you will interview a series of people, from which you will choose one. Further, you must consider them one at a time, and having once rejected someone, you cannot reconsider.

- Our computer simulations and experience show that this portfolio is close to market-neutral, which means that the fluctuations in the value of the portfolio have little correlation to the overall average price changes in the market. Our level of market neutrality, measured by what financial theorists call beta, has averaged 0.06. When beta is zero for a portfolio, its price movements have no correlation with those of the market, and it is called market-neutral. Portfolios with positive beta tend to move up and down with the market, more so for larger beta. The beta of the market itself is chosen to be 1.0. Negative beta portfolios tend to fluctuate oppositely to the market.

- competitive. Why is statistical arbitrage so-called? Arbitrage originally meant a pair of offsetting positions that lock in a sure profit. An example might be selling gold in London at $300 an ounce while at the same time buying it at $290 in New York for a $10 gain. If the total cost to finance the deal and to insure and deliver the New York gold to London were $5, it would leave a $5 sure profit. That’s an arbitrage in its original usage. Later the term was expanded to describe investments where risks are expected to be largely offsetting, with a profit that is likely, if not certain. For instance, in what is called merger arbitrage, company A trading at $100 a share may offer to buy company B, trading at $70 a share, by… ([Location 3993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=3993))

But the deal is not certain until it gets regulatory and shareholder approval, so there is a risk of loss should the negotiations fail and the prices of A and B reverse. If the stocks of A and B returned to their preannouncement prices, the arbitrageur would lose $12 = $100 − $88 on his short sale of A and $13 = $83 − $70 on his purchase of B, for a total loss of $25 per $83 invested, or 30 percent.

We called the system MUD, as it was constructed from the “most-up, most-down” stocks. As UCI mathematician William F. Donoghue would joke, “Thorp, my advice is to buy low and sell high.” The portfolio of long stocks tracked the market and the short portfolio did the opposite, so the two sides together mostly canceled the movement of the market.

- To decide whether to buy Berkshire one can do a little analysis. Berkshire, as remarked earlier, has three major parts. First are the positions in publicly traded companies like Coca-Cola, The Washington Post, and Gillette. The securities markets price these every day. Is this Buffett portfolio worth more than, less than, or the same as its market price? Should one add a premium for Buffett’s market timing and stock-picking prowess? Second are numerous wholly owned ([Location 4321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4321))
- companies such as See’s Candies, Clayton Homes, and NetJets. We can value these by applying the principles of security analysis to the balance sheets, and by considering the growth rates of the companies, their “franchise value,” and the quality of management. The third component is the insurance group, with GEICO the most important. To value these non-public companies we use, in addition to security analysis as above, the value of the “float.” This is money paid as premiums that is currently being held to pay off future claims. Buffett invests this and has made a profit well in excess of the projected cost of claims. To the extent Warren makes superior returns on the float, as well as follows his practice of selling insurance when prices are high and stepping aside when competition drives prices down, the value of Berkshire is greater. For a few years prior to 2008 Berkshire had an uninvested cash surplus of as much as $40 billion, as Buffett found stocks ([Location 4325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4325))
- generally overpriced. This “cash drag” slowed the price increase of Berkshire during that period. When the market collapsed in 2008, he put this money to work. As Berkshire has grown, Buffett’s gain over the S&P 500 has diminished, as he predicted. Table 2, which covers my experience, shows this. The edge dropped in each new period. Beating the index in the future will be ever more difficult. There is also price risk arising from the uncertainty when Buffett ceases to manage Berkshire. Despite the likelihood that his replacements will be unusually talented, the stock price may fall sharply, perhaps for an extended time.

- Hedge fund operators have ways of ending up with far more than the 20 percent of profits typically specified as their management fee. One of these I call “Heads we win, tails you lose.” To see how this works, go back to 1986 when I was interviewing a wealthy hedge fund manager to see if my fund of hedge funds, OSM Partners, should invest with him. Times were good, his flock of hedge funds were prospering, and he invited me to leave PNP, bring my expertise and employees, and join him. I’d get half the management fee on a much larger pool of money. No, thanks. The following year the crash of October 1987 hit his funds with losses varying from 30 percent to 70 percent. Performance fees would not be paid to him again until these losses were recovered. It might take years. If he’s down 50 percent, for example, he has to ([Location 4471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4471))
- double the money, making 100 percent, just to get even again. Facing no performance fees for years, he chose to terminate his hedge funds, leaving himself rich and his investors with losses. The net result was that he made off with all the profits. In less than a year he launched a fresh set of hedge funds, from which he could have the chance to immediately collect performance fees. Cherry-picking, as I call it, is another way some hedge fund managers milk their limited partners. I first came across this in the late 1970s. It was a lackluster decade for equities. A guru had been picking undervalued companies and making 20 percent or so per year before his fee. After friends recommended I invest, I did some digging and learned he had another pool that was making 40 percent. That was just for himself, his family, and close friends. That pool got its fill of the best situations. The rest went to the 20 percenters.

Improperly charging expenses to the partnership is another way that the limited partners get less than they should.

Most people I’ve met haven’t thought through the comparative values to them of time, money, and health. Think of the single worker who spends two hours commuting forty miles from hot and smoggy Riverside, California, to a $25-an-hour job in balmy Newport Beach. If the worker moves from his $1,200-a-month apartment in Riverside to a comparable $2,500-a-month apartment in Newport Beach, his rent increases by $1,300 a month but he avoids forty hours of commuting. If his time is worth $25 per hour he would save $1,000 ($25 × 40) each month. Add to that the cost of driving his car an extra sixteen hundred miles.

- costs him 50 cents a mile or $800 a month to operate, living in Newport Beach and saving forty hours’ driving time each month makes him $500 better off ($1,000 + $800 − $1,300). In effect he earned just $12.50 per hour during his commute. Does our worker figure this out? I suspect he does not, because the extra $1,300 a month in rent he would pay in Newport Beach is a clearly visible cost that is painfully and regularly inflicted, whereas the cost of his car is less evident and can be put out of mind. Americans supposedly spend an average of forty or more hours a week watching television. Those who do have plenty of “junk time,” which they can use instead for an exercise or fitness program.

- Call any investment that mimics the whole market of listed US securities “passive” and notice that since each of these passive investments acts just like the market, so does a pool of all of them.

But “everybody else” means all the active investors, each of whom ([Location 4759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4759))
- has his own recipe for how much to own of each stock and none of whom has indexed. As Nobel Prize winner Bill Sharpe says, it follows from the laws of arithmetic that the combined holdings of all the active investors also replicates the index. Although this idea is well known, and I’m not sure where it first appeared, I first heard it from him and he has given the clearest exposition I’ve seen. I’ll call it Sharpe’s Principle.

- Before costs, each passive investor gets the same return as the index. This is also true for the active investors as a group but not for each one individually. Holding a larger percentage than the index in some stocks and less in others, they may do better or worse than the index in various periods. Although the results (before costs) for the entire group of active investors matches the return on the index, their individual returns are statistically distributed around it with most fairly close ([Location 4774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4774))
- and some quite different. They have more risk without the expectation of more return. Reducing risk through diversification is one reason to buy an index, but an even more important one is reducing the costs that investors bear. Index funds trade infrequently, with stocks turning over just a few percent a year as the “keepers” of the index occasionally add and remove stocks, or because cash flows into or out of the fund. On the other hand, active investors as a group have been trading more than 100 percent of their portfolio per year. This imposes a substantial cost on them from commissions and by their impact on market prices. To illustrate the losses from market impact, suppose XYZ stock has a “true” price of $50 a share. Assuming for simplicity that it trades in 10-cent increments, between trades there will be buyers bidding for various amounts at $49.90, $49.80, $49.70, and so forth. Similarly, sellers will be asking $50.10, ([Location 4777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4777))
- $50.20, et cetera. Someone who places an order to buy at whatever price is available in the market, called a market order and one of the most common types, will pay $50.10, a little above the true price. This 10-cent difference between the price paid and the “true” price is called market impact. Market impact increases with order size since, to continue our example, a large market order may clean out not only the offering at $50.10 but also stock offered for sale at higher prices, resulting in an average purchase price above $50.10 and a market impact greater than 10 cents per share. When Steve Mizusawa and I operated Ridgeline Partners, we reduced these costs by dividing large orders into smaller ones of $20,000 to $100,000, and waiting a few minutes between transactions to allow the market price to recover. We know the “true” price is somewhere at or between the highest bid price (the Bid) and the lowest asking price ([Location 4784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4784))
- (the Asked), but not exactly where. On average, it is about halfway between the two. To see that market impact is a real cost, suppose in our example that just after buying stock at $50.10 the buyer wants to sell it at market. He gets $49.90, for an immediate loss of 20 cents or about 0.4 percent. ([Location 4791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=4791))
- Taxable investors need to review their holdings on a case-by-case basis. For instance, in 2015, with a cost basis of about $1,000 a share, a market price of $225,000 a share, and a combined federal and state tax rate of, say, 30 percent, I would net about $157,800 per share after a sale of my Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock. An index fund purchased with this smaller amount would have to do about 43 percent better than Berkshire in the future for me to catch up. This seems extremely unlikely. Like me with Berkshire, investors who don’t trade, and use no advisers, will avoid the usual expenses paid by active investors.

- costs may be even less than those of indexers. If such a buy-and-hold investor were, for instance, to choose stocks at random, purchasing an amount of each proportional to its market capitalization, we could show, by reasoning like that used to prove Sharpe’s Principle, that the expected return is the same as for the index from which the stocks were chosen minus the presumably small costs of acquiring the stocks. The main disadvantage to buy-and-hold versus indexing is the added risk. In gambling terms, the return to buy-and-hold is like that from buying the index then adding random gains or losses by repeatedly flipping a coin. However, with a holding of twenty or so stocks spread out over different industries, this extra risk tends to be small. The threat to a buy-and-hold program is the investor himself.

- My understanding of how to use leverage began with my experience in the casinos. When I deployed my card counting system for blackjack, it made intuitive sense to bet more when the expected gain, or edge, was greater. The question was, how much? The answer was in a 1956 article by Bell Labs physicist John L. Kelly, who some said was the smartest person there, after Claude Shannon. In his fascinating history of the topic, Fortune’s Formula, William Poundstone points out that for a favorable bet that pays odds of $A for a bet of ([Location 5226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5226))
- $1, the optimal Kelly bet is the percent of your capital equal to your edge, divided by the odds, A. In blackjack, the typical favorable edge was usually between 1 and 5 percent and the odds, or payoff per dollar bet, averaged a little more than 1. So, following the criterion when the card count was good, I bet a percentage of my bankroll that was a little less than my percent advantage. Kelly’s criterion is not limited to two-value payoffs but applies generally to any gambling or investing situation in which the probabilities are known or can be estimated. What happens if you do this? Kelly showed mathematically that the wealth of someone following his system would, with increasing likelihood, exceed the fortune of a competitor using an essentially different betting scheme. From blackjack, I went on to use Kelly’s formula to manage bets in baccarat and to allocate money among investments. Some key features of the Kelly Criterion are: ([Location 5230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5230))
- (1) The investor or bettor generally avoids total loss; (2) the bigger the edge, the larger the bet; (3) the smaller the risk, the larger the bet. The Kelly Criterion, not having been invented by the old-line academic economists, has generated considerable controversy. Bill Gross, co-founder of PIMCO, who learned about the Kelly Criterion in the summer of 1969 when he played blackjack in Nevada, is still influenced by it in making investment decisions. As he told The Wall Street Journal, “Here at PIMCO, it doesn’t matter how much you have, whether it’s $200 or $1 trillion. You’ll see it throughout our portfolio. We don’t have more than 2 percent in any one credit. Professional blackjack is being played in this trading room from the standpoint of… ([Location 5237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5237))
- typically one-half Kelly or less; (2) for investors with short time horizons or who are averse to risk, other approaches may be better; (3) an exact application of Kelly requires exact probabilities of payoffs such as those in most casino games; to the extent these are uncertain, which is generally the case in the investment world, the Kelly bet should be based on a conservative estimate of the outcome. As I pointed out in Wilmott magazine, Warren Buffett’s thinking is consistent with the Kelly Criterion. In a question and answer session with business students at Emory University, he was asked, in view of the popularity of Fortune’s Formula and the Kelly Criterion, to describe his process for choosing how much to invest in a situation.

- What if you want the payouts to continue “forever,” as you might for an endowment? Computer simulations showed me that with the best long-term investments, such as stocks and commercial real estate, annual future spending should be limited to the inflation-adjusted level of 2 percent of the original gift. This surprisingly conservative figure assumes that future investment results will be similar in risk and return to US historical experience. In that case, the chance that the endowment is never exhausted turns out to be 96 percent.

- The next part of the story begins back in 1966 when a senior at Duke University had a horrible automobile accident. He lost his scalp and most of his blood. Fortunately a state trooper found the scalp and it was reattached. It took a long time for his body to heal. While spending much of his senior year in the hospital, he read Beat the Dealer. That summer, between graduation and an upcoming three-year enlistment in the navy, he ignored his mother’s advice to the contrary and went to Las Vegas as one of the early card counters. Using Beat the Dealer as a guide, he brought a bankroll of $200 and ran it up to $10,000. It took four months. The grueling days at the green felt tables often ([Location 5326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5326))
- lasted sixteen hours. It was a hard way to earn money but the real value, as with so many before and after him, was in what the young man learned. As he later said, “I had no clue that my four months at the tables in Las Vegas were to lay the foundation for a successful career in Wall Street. [It] taught me several important principles that I’ve employed for the past twenty-five years…” Returning from Vietnam in 1969, the card counter went to UCLA to get a master’s degree in business. He read about convertible bonds in Beat the Market, which influenced him to write his master’s thesis on that topic. Graduating two years later in 1971, he found that jobs for MBAs were scarce. But when he answered an ad for a junior credit analyst at Pacific Mutual, they liked both the man and the thesis topic.

Gross, the Bond King. Bill and his wife, Sue, had already donated tens of millions for medical causes, so a group at UCI arranged a lunch meeting with Bill to see if he and Sue would give $10 million and become the lead donors for a new CIRM-subsidized stem cell research center. In the course of the conversation, I mentioned that a $10 million gift would lead to as much as $600 million in the years to come, leveraging their donation sixty times. I saw an instant flash in Bill’s eyes and thought: Bill and Sue must value the chance to make an impact far greater than the value of the amount donated, just as Vivian and ([Location 5338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5338))

- In 2004, five major investment banks persuaded the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase their allowable leverage. Previously, they could borrow $11 for every $1 of net worth. This meant they only had $1 out of every $12, or 8.33 percent, as a cushion against disaster. Under its chairman Christopher Cox, the SEC allowed Goldman Sachs, ([Location 5530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SEFEYCI&location=5530))
- Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers to expand their leverage to something like 33:1, rivaling the levels that doomed the ill-fated hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management just six years earlier. With, say, $33 in assets and $32 of liabilities for each $1 of net worth, a decline of a little over 3 percent in assets would wipe out their equity. Once this happened and a bank was known to be technically insolvent, creditors would demand payment while they could still get it, triggering a classic run on the bank, just as in the 1930s. When the crisis hit four years later in 2008, the same length of time it took excess leverage to destroy LTCM, the run on the bank threatened to destroy all five of these geared-up Goliaths.

The elimination or marginalization of some rivals was not a bad thing. Appearing pixyish in his public appearances, when CEO Lloyd Blankfein was asked about the gigantic bonuses, he explained that the firm was “doing God’s work.” The argument is the standard academic one that more trading creates efficient capital markets, with better prices for buyers and sellers, for the benefit of all humankind.

When a lion roared, you instinctively climbed the nearest tree and thought later about what to do next. Today we often have the time to think, calculate, and plan ahead, and here’s where math can help us make decisions. For instance, are seatbelts and air bags “worth it”? Suppose we upgrade a hundred million vehicles at a cost of $300 each, a total of $30 billion, and have five thousand fewer traffic deaths per year. If these vehicles with their added safety features are around for ten years, that’s fifty thousand lives saved at a cost of $30 billion, or $600,000 per life.

Some smokers do not die of smoking-related diseases, whereas others die at an early age. It’s like gambling at roulette. On average you lose 5 cents when you bet $1. But this is an average.
