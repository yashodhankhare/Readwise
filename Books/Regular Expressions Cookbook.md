## Highlights
- The following typographical conventions are used in this book: Italic Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions. Constant width Used for program listings, program elements such as variable or function names, values returned as the result of a regular expression replacement, and subject or input text that is applied to a regular expression. This could be the contents of a text box in an application, a file on disk, or the contents of a string variable. Constant width italic Shows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by values determined by context. ‹Regular●expression› ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=91))

- Represents a regular expression, standing alone or as you would type it into the search box of an application. Spaces in regular expressions are indicated with gray circles to make them more obvious. Spaces are not indicated with gray circles in free-spacing mode because this mode ignores spaces. «Replacement●text» Represents the text that regular expression matches will be replaced within a search-and-replace operation. Spaces in replacement text are indicated with gray circles to make them more obvious. Matched text Represents the part of the subject text that matches a regular expression. ⋯ A gray ellipsis in a regular expression indicates that you have to “fill in the blank” before you can use the regular expression. The accompanying text explains what you can fill in. CR, LF, and CRLF ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=99))

- CR, LF, and CRLF in boxes represent actual line break characters in strings, rather than character escapes such as \r, \n, and \r\n. Such strings can be created by pressing Enter in a multiline edit control in an application, or by using multiline string constants in source code such as verbatim strings in C# or triple-quoted strings in Python. ↵ The return arrow, as you may see on the Return or Enter key on your keyboard, indicates that we had to break up a line to make it fit the width of the printed page. When typing the text into your source code, you should not press Enter, but instead type everything on a single line.

- But with the proper regular expression, as shown in Recipe 4.1, it takes just a few lines of code, or maybe even one line. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=190))

- Search and Replace with Regular Expressions Search-and-replace is a common job for regular expressions. A search-and-replace function takes a ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=278))

- subject string, a regular expression, and a replacement string as input. The output is the subject string with all matches of the regular expression replaced with the replacement text. Although the replacement text is not a regular expression at all, you can use certain special syntax to build dynamic replacement texts. All flavors let you reinsert the text matched by the regular expression or a capturing group into the replacement. Recipes 2.20 and 2.21 explain this. Some flavors also support inserting matched context into the replacement text, as Recipe 2.22 shows. In Chapter 3, Recipe 3.16 teaches you how to generate a different replacement text for each match in code. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=279))

- Many Flavors of Replacement Text Different ideas by different regular expression software developers have led to a wide range of regular expression flavors, each with different syntax and feature sets. The story for the replacement text is no different. In fact, there are even more replacement text flavors than regular expression flavors. Building a regular expression engine is difficult. Most programmers prefer to reuse an existing one, and bolting a search-and-replace function onto an existing regular expression engine is quite easy. The result is that there are many replacement text flavors for regular ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=286))

- expression libraries that do not have built-in search-and-replace features. Fortunately, all the regular expression flavors in this book have corresponding replacement text flavors, except PCRE. This gap in PCRE complicates life for programmers who use flavors based on it. The open source PCRE library does not include any functions to make replacements. Thus, all applications and programming languages that are based on PCRE need to provide their own search-and-replace function. Most programmers try to copy existing syntax, but never do so in exactly the same way. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=291))

- Tools for Working with Regular Expressions Unless you have been programming with regular expressions for some time, we recommend that you first experiment with regular expressions in a tool rather than in source code. The sample regexes in this chapter and Chapter 2 are plain regular expressions that don’t contain the extra escaping that a programming language (even a Unix shell) requires. You can ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=328))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- type these regular expressions directly into an application’s search box. Chapter 3 explains how to mix regular expressions into your source code. Quoting a literal regular expression as a string makes it even harder to read, because string escaping rules compound regex escaping rules. We leave that until Recipe 3.1. Once you understand the basics of regular expressions, you’ll be able to see the forest through the backslashes. The tools described in this section also provide debugging, syntax checking, and other feedback that you won’t get from most programming environments. Therefore, as you develop regular expressions in your applications, you may find it useful to build a complicated regular expression in one of these tools before you plug it in to your program.

- RegexBuddy (Figure 1-1) is the most full-featured tool available at the time of this writing for creating, testing, and implementing regular expressions. It has the unique ability to emulate all the regular expression flavors discussed in this book, and even convert among the different flavors. RegexBuddy was designed and developed by Jan Goyvaerts, one of this book’s authors. Designing… ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=340))

- The Create panel automatically builds a detailed English-language analysis while you type in the regex. Double-click on any description in the regular expression tree to edit that part of your regular expression. You can insert new parts to your regular expression by hand, or by clicking the Insert Token button and selecting what you want from a menu. For instance, if you don’t remember the complicated syntax for positive lookahead, you can ask RegexBuddy to insert the proper characters for you. Type or paste in some sample text on the Test panel. When the Highlight button is active, RegexBuddy automatically highlights the text matched by the regex. Some of the buttons you’re most likely to use are: List All Displays a list of all matches.

- Treats the regular expression as a separator, and splits the subject into tokens based on where matches are found in your subject text using your regular expression. Click any of these buttons and select Update Automatically to make RegexBuddy keep the results dynamically in sync as you edit your regex or subject text. To see exactly how your regex works (or doesn’t), click on a highlighted match or at the spot where the regex fails to match on the Test panel, and click the Debug button. RegexBuddy will switch to the Debug panel, showing the entire matching processes step by step. Click anywhere on the debugger’s output to see which regex token matched the text you clicked on. Click on your regular expression to highlight that part of the regex in the debugger. On the Use panel, select your favorite programming language. Then, select a function to instantly generate source code to implement your regex.

- When you find a regex in source code you’re maintaining, copy it to the clipboard, including the delimiting quotes or slashes. In RegexBuddy, click the Paste button at the top and select the string style of your programming language. Your regex will then appear in RegexBuddy as a plain regex, without the extra quotes and escapes needed for string literals. Use the Copy button at the top to create a string in the desired syntax, so you can paste it back into your source code. As your experience grows, you can build up a handy library of regular expressions on the Library panel. Make sure to add a detailed description and a test subject when you store a regex. Regular expressions can be cryptic, even for experts. If you really can’t figure out a regex, click on the Forum panel and then the Login button. If you’ve purchased RegexBuddy, the login screen appears. Click OK and you are instantly connected to the RegexBuddy user forum. Steven and Jan often hang out there.

- To try one of the regular expressions shown in this book, browse to http://regexpal.com. Type the regex into the box at the top. RegexPal automatically applies syntax highlighting to your regular expression, which immediately reveals any syntax errors in the regex. RegexPal is aware of the cross-browser issues that can ruin your day when dealing with JavaScript regular expressions. If certain syntax doesn’t work correctly in some browsers, RegexPal will highlight it as an error. Now type or paste some sample text into the large box at the center. RegexPal automatically highlights the text matched by your regex. There are no buttons to click, making RegexPal one of the most convenient online regular expression testers. RegexMagic RegexMagic (Figure 1-3) is another tool designed and developed by Jan Goyvaerts. Where RegexBuddy makes it easy to work with the regular expression syntax, RegexMagic is primarily designed for people who do not want to deal with the regular expression syntax, and certainly won’t read 500-page books on the topic.
