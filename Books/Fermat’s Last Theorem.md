## Highlights
- Pascal was even convinced that he could use his theories to justify a belief in God. He stated that ‘the excitement that a gambler feels when making a bet is equal to the amount he might win multiplied by the probability of winning it’. He then argued that the possible prize of eternal happiness has an infinite value and that the probability of entering heaven by leading a virtuous life, no matter how small, is certainly finite. Therefore, according to Pascal’s definition, religion was a game of infinite excitement and one worth playing, because multiplying an infinite prize by a finite probability results in infinity.

- Calculus is the ability to calculate the rate of change, known as the derivative, of one quantity with respect to another. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=746))
- Euclid was born in about 330 BC. Like Pythagoras, Euclid believed in the search for mathematical truth for its own sake and did not look for applications in his work. One story tells of a student who questioned him about the use of the mathematics he was learning. Upon completing the lesson, Euclid turned to his slave and said, ‘Give the boy a penny since he desires to profit from all that he learns.’ The student was then expelled.

- One story claims that a young student by the name of Hippasus was idly toying with the number √2, attempting to find the equivalent fraction. Eventually he came to realise that no such fraction existed, i.e. that √2 is an irrational number. Hippasus must have been overjoyed by his discovery, but his master was not. Pythagoras had defined the universe in terms of rational numbers, and the existence of irrational numbers brought his ideal into question. The consequence of Hippasus’ insight should have been a period of discussion and contemplation during which Pythagoras ought to have come to terms with this new source of numbers. However, Pythagoras was unwilling to accept that he was wrong, but at the same time he was unable to destroy Hippasus’ argument by the power of logic. To his eternal shame he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=837))
- The Pythagoreans made the extraordinary discovery that 220 and 284 are friendly numbers. The divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and the sum of all these is 284. On the other hand the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and the sum of all these is 220. The pair 220 and 284 was said to be symbolic of friendship. Martin Gardner’s book Mathematical Magic Show tells of talismans sold in the Middle Ages which were inscribed with these numbers on the grounds that wearing the charms would promote love.

- I have a truly marvellous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=999))
- Leonhard Euler, and it was he who made the first breakthrough towards proving Fermat’s Last Theorem. Euler had such an incredible intuition and vast memory that it was said he could map out the entire bulk of a calculation in his head without having to put pen to paper. Across Europe he was referred to as ‘analysis incarnate’, and the French academician François Arago said, ‘Euler calculated without apparent effort as men breathe, or as eagles sustain themselves in the wind.’ ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=1105))
- form of proof by contradiction known as the method of infinite descent. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=1226))
- the final years of his career he was totally blind. His loss of sight began in 1735 when the Academy in Paris offered a prize for the solution to an astronomical problem. The problem was so awkward that the mathematical community asked the Academy to allow them several months in which to come up with an answer, but for Euler this was unnecessary. He became obsessed with the task, worked continually for three days and duly won the prize. However, poor working conditions combined with intense stress cost Euler, then still only in his twenties, the sight of one eye. This is apparent in many portraits of Euler.

- Euler continued to produce mathematics for the next seventeen years and, if anything, he was more productive than ever. His immense intellect allowed him to juggle concepts without having to commit them to paper, and his phenomenal memory allowed him to use his own brain as a mental library. Colleagues suggested that the onset of blindness appeared to expand the horizons of his imagination. It is worth noting that Euler’s computations of lunar positions were completed during his period of blindness. For the emperors of Europe this was the most prized of mathematical achievements, a problem that had confounded the greatest mathematicians in Europe, including Newton.

- Number theorists consider prime numbers to be the most important numbers of all because they are the atoms of mathematics. Prime numbers are the numerical building blocks because all other numbers can be created by multiplying combinations of the prime numbers.

- The first woman known to have made an impact on the subject was Theano in the sixth century BC, who began as one of Pythagoras’ students before becoming one of his foremost disciples and eventually marrying him. Pythagoras is known as the ‘feminist philosopher’ because he actively encouraged women scholars, Theano being just one of the twenty-eight sisters in the Pythagorean Brotherhood.

- his life at Syracuse, studying mathematics in relative tranquillity, but when he was in his late seventies the peace was shattered by the invading Roman army. Legend has it that during the invasion Archimedes was so engrossed in the study of a geometric figure in the sand that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman soldier. As a result he was speared to death. ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=1525))
- In mathematics a property which always holds true no matter what is done to the object is called an invariant. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=1841))
- day. The definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself.’ ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UKUGXC&location=2328))
- Mathematics consists of islands of knowledge in a sea of ignorance. For example, there is the island occupied by geometers who study shape and form, and then there is the island of probability where mathematicians discuss risk and chance. There are dozens of such islands, each one with its own unique language, incomprehensible to the inhabitants of other islands. The language of geometry is quite different to the language of probability, and the slang of calculus is meaningless to those who speak only statistics.
