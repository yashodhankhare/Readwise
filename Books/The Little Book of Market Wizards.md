## Highlights
- There are two key lessons that can be drawn from this chapter. First, failure is not predictive. Even great traders often encounter failure—and even repeated failures—early in their careers. Failure at the start is the norm, even for those who ultimately become Market Wizards. As a related comment, the fact that most people who attempt trading fail at the beginning suggests that all novice traders should start with small amounts of cash because they might as well pay less for their market education. Second, persistence is instrumental to success. Most people faced with the types of failures encountered by the traders detailed in this chapter would have given up and tried some other endeavor. It would have been easy for the traders in this chapter to have done the same. Were it not for their relentless persistence, many of the Market Wizards would never have discovered their ultimate potential.

- There are a million ways to make money in the markets. Unfortunately, they are all very difficult to find. But there are many, many ways to succeed. Some traders, such as Rogers, succeed using only fundamental analysis; others, such as Schwartz, succeed using only technical analysis; and still others use a combination of the two. Some traders succeed holding positions for months, or even years, while others succeed on a time scale measured in minutes. Market success is a matter of finding the methodology that is right for you—and it will be different for everyone—not a matter of finding the one true methodology.

- So, while there is no single correct way to trade the markets, in order to be successful, you need to find the one way that is right for you—a methodology that suits your personality. It is the one thing that all the successful traders I have ever interviewed had in common: They all developed a trading style that was consistent with their personality and beliefs. This observation seems very logical to the point of even sounding obvious. You might wonder, “Doesn’t everyone trade in line with their personality?

- The idea that using a methodology that suits your personality is an essential component of trading success also helps explain why most people lose money using trading systems they bought. Why is that true? Is it because most trading systems don’t work on data not used in their development? I am not implying that. Actually, I have no idea what percentage of trading systems sold to the public provide a market edge. But even if I assumed that more than 50 percent of the systems sold would be profitable if applied as instructed, I would still expect over 90 percent of the buyers of those systems to lose money trading them. Why? Because every trading system, regardless of the strategy employed, is going to hit periods when it does poorly. Now, if you buy a system, by definition, it has nothing to do with your personality or beliefs. In many, if not most, cases, you won’t even have any idea what drives the system’s signals. Consequently, the first time the system hits a bad period, you are not going to have the confidence to stay with the system, and you will stop trading it. That is why, invariably, most people who buy systems will end up losing: They will stop using the system when it goes through a bad period, and they won’t be there when the system recovers.

- There is a Wall Street adage that says, “Even a poor trading system could make money with good money management.” Have you heard that saying before? Well, if you have, forget it, because it is really one of the stupidest things that has ever been said about trading. If you believe that good money management can salvage a poor system or methodology, I invite you to go to a casino, walk over to a roulette wheel, use your best money management system to bet, and see how well that works out for you. In fact, if you asked a hundred mathematicians the question, “I have $1,000 that I want to bet in roulette—what is the optimal betting strategy I should use?,” all 100 should give you the same answer: Take the entire $1,000 and place it on red or black (or on odd or even) for one spin, and then, win or lose, walk away. That betting strategy will give you the highest probability of being a winner in roulette.1 Of course, your odds of winning are still less than 50 percent—47.37 percent, to be exact, for a wheel with a double zero—but your negative edge will be smallest for one spin. The more times you play, the greater the probability that you will lose. And if you play long enough, it is a mathematical certainty you will lose. So the point is that if you don’t have an edge (implying you have a negative edge), then the optimal money management strategy is to bet it all at once—the epitome of bad money management. Money management cannot save you if you don’t have an edge. It is helpful in mitigating losses and preserving capital only if you do have an edge. So, it’s not enough to have money management; you also need to have an edge. Having an edge means that you have a method. So, it’s not enough to have money management; you also need to have an edge. Having an edge means that you have a method. No trader I ever interviewed for any of the Market Wizards books when asked how he did what he did gave a response like, “I look at the screen, and if bonds look good, I’ll buy some.” None of them approached trading with a cavalier, shoot-from-the-hip attitude. They all had a specific methodology. Some of them could describe their methodology in very specific, almost step-by-step terms. Others described their approach in more general terms. But it was clear they all had a specific methodology. So what exactly is your methodology? If you can’t answer that question, you are not ready to be risking money in the markets. If you can answer that question, the next question is, “Does your trading method provide an edge?” If you are unsure about the answer, again, you are not ready to be risking money in the markets. Successful traders are confident that their methodology provides an edge. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=539))

- Just as money management is insufficient without an edge, an edge is insufficient without money management. You need both. Monroe Trout, who achieved one of the best long-term return/risk records ever recorded, nicely summarized this concept. When I asked him what trading rules he lived by, he replied, “Make sure you have the edge. Know what your edge is. Have rigid risk control rules . . . To make money, you need to have an edge and employ good money management. Good money management alone isn’t going to increase your edge at all. If your system isn’t any good, you’re still going to lose money, no matter how effective your money management rules are. But if you have an approach that makes money, then money management can make the difference between success and failure.” We explore the money management part of the equation in Chapter 8. Note 1. The question presupposed that you were going to play roulette, which ruled out the even better strategy of not playing at all.

- Now here is the irony. Why are so many people attracted to trading? Because it seems like an easy way to make a lot of money. But the fact is that the people who are really successful in trading are tremendously hard workers. This dichotomy between perception and reality as it pertains to trading success and work leads to the following paradox. You’ll grant me that no sane person would think of going into a bookstore (assuming you could still find one these days), walking over to the medical books section, finding a book titled Techniques of Brain Surgery, studying it over the weekend, and then Monday morning walking into a hospital operating room believing he was ready to perform brain surgery. The operative word here is sane—that is, no sane person would think that way. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=616))

- Why? Because there are only two things you can do in trading: You can buy or you can sell. And, as a matter of probability, some significant percentage of people will be right more than 50 percent of the time—at least in the beginning. As an analogy, if you have 1,000 people toss 10 coins in the air, on average, nearly 30 percent of them will toss 60 percent or more heads. In the coin toss experiment, the 60 percent-plus heads flippers will realize their results are a matter of luck and not due to any innate skill in tossing heads. But when it comes to trading, the amateur traders who are right more than 50 percent of the time when they are starting out will attribute their success to their superior decision-making skills, rather than simply being a matter of chance. The fact that it is possible to achieve short-term trading success by pure luck beguiles people into thinking that trading is a lot easier than it is. It fools people into believing that they possess trading skill. The same misperception can’t happen in any other profession. If you never trained as a surgeon, the odds of your performing successful brain surgery are zero. If you have never played the violin, the odds of your getting up in front of… ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=632))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The same principles apply in trading. If trading is going well, it will seem effortless. If trading is not going well, you can’t force it right by working harder. If you are in a particularly bad trading period, when nearly every decision you make seems to be wrong, trying harder won’t help. It will probably only make matters worse. You can work harder in doing more research. You can work harder in trying to figure out what’s going wrong. But you can’t work harder at trading. If you are out of sync with the markets, trying harder is often likely to make matters even worse. So if trying harder is not the solution for handling a losing streak, what is? We will address this question in the next chapter. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=665))

- The essence of the idea is that you have to learn to let the arrow shoot itself. . . . In trading, just as in archery, whenever there is effort, force, straining, struggling, or trying, it’s wrong. . . . The perfect trade is one that requires no effort.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Okay, good trading should be effortless. But what do you do when you hit prolonged periods when trading is a struggle? How do you handle the periods when almost everything seems to be going wrong and you are in a steadily deepening drawdown? This question came up in multiple interviews. Even great traders can experience demoralizing losing periods. The Market Wizards were quite consistent in the advice they offered about handling difficult losing periods. They had two basic recommendations: 1. Reduce your trading size. Paul Tudor Jones said, “When I am trading poorly, I keep reducing my position size. That way, I will be trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst.” Ed Seykota, a pioneer in systematic futures trading who achieved astounding cumulative returns, offered similar advice when I asked him if he had locked away several million dollars to avoid the Jesse Livermore experience. (Livermore was a famous speculator of the early twentieth century who made and lost several fortunes.) Seykota replied that a better alternative was to “Keep reducing risks during equity drawdowns. That way you will approach your safe money asymptotically and have a gentle financial and emotional touchdown. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=708))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 2. Stop trading. Sometimes reducing trading size is simply not enough, and the best remedy to break the downward spiral is to simply stop trading. As Michael Marcus explained, “I think that, in the end, losing begets losing. When you start losing, it touches off negative elements in your psychology; it leads to pessimism. . . . When I have had a bad losing streak, I have been able to say to myself, ‘You just can’t trade anymore. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=726))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The flip side of persistent losing periods are times when things are going almost unbelievably well. Oddly enough, these are also times to consider playing smaller. After a particularly strong period of profits, Marty Schwartz will also reduce trading size, just as he does after particularly bad losses, because he notes, “My biggest losses have always followed my largest profits.” I am sure many traders have had a similar experience. The worst drawdowns often follow periods when everything seems to be working perfectly. Why is there a tendency for the worst losses to follow the best performance? One possible explanation is that winning streaks lead to complacency, and complacency leads to sloppy trading. In these strongly winning periods, the trader is least likely to consider what might go wrong, especially worst-case scenarios. An additional explanation is that periods of excellent performance are also likely to be times of particularly high exposure. The moral is: If your portfolio is sailing to new highs almost daily and virtually all your trades are working, watch out! These are the times to guard against complacency and to be extra cautious.

- One of Kovner’s core money management principles was that before he entered any position, he predetermined his exit point based on assessment of where the market should not go if he was right about the trading idea. “That is the only way I can sleep,” said Kovner. “I know where I’m getting out before I get in.” Why is determining where you will get out before you get in so important? Because before you get into the trade is the last time you have complete objectivity. Once you get into the trade, you lose objectivity, which makes it easier to procrastinate by rationalizing a losing position. By making the loss-limit exit decision before he enters a trade, Kovner ensures a disciplined risk control strategy and removes emotionalism from the money management process.

- O’Shea described how stops should be set and then contrasted that recommended approach to what many traders actually do. “First,” said O’Shea, “you need to decide where you are wrong. That determines where the stop level should be. Then you work out how much you are willing to lose on the idea. Last, you divide the amount you’re willing to lose by the per-contract loss to the stop point, and that determines your position size. The most common error I see is that people do it backwards. They start with position size. Then they know their pain threshold, and that determines where they place their stop.

- BlueCrest’s flagship fund, a multimanager fund run by Michael Platt, which is designed to keep losses very constrained, has achieved annual returns in excess of 12 percent2 (after deducting all fees) over a 13-year period, while keeping the peak-to-valley equity drawdown under 5 percent for the entire period. How could BlueCrest deliver double-digit returns over an extended period while keeping the maximum drawdown so low? The answer lies primarily in the portfolio risk management strategy, which tightly limits the amount each manager can lose before capital is withdrawn. Each calendar year starts with a clean slate. Each manager is allowed to lose only up to 3 percent before his allocation is cut by 50 percent. If the manager then loses another 3 percent on the remaining assets, the entire allocation is withdrawn for the year. These rigid risk control rules are designed to keep each manager’s maximum loss for the year under 5 percent. (The combination of two successive 3 percent losses is less than a 5 percent loss because the second 3 percent loss is incurred on only 50 percent of the assets.) You might think that maintaining such tight reins on the maximum allowed loss would also keep returns very subdued. How then has the fund managed to attain annual returns that have averaged two-and-a-half times the size of the single largest equity drawdown for the entire period? The key is that the 3 percent/3 percent risk rule applies only to a manager’s starting stake for the year. So while the risk control rules encourage the fund’s managers to be very cautious at the outset, managers can take increasingly greater ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=849))

- risk as they build a profit cushion. Effectively, a manager can risk the original 3 percent plus any accrued profits for the year before an allocation reduction would be triggered. This structure assures capital preservation while, at the same time, keeping upside potential open-ended by allowing greater risk taking with profits.

- Here is a common dilemma, which most traders have faced at one time or another: You have a position that is going against you, but you still believe in the trade. On the one hand, you don’t want the loss on the position to get any worse, but, on the other hand, you are concerned that as soon as you get out, the market will turn around in favor of the liquidated trade. This conflict can cause traders to freeze and do nothing as their losses mount. Steve Cohen also had some useful advice about how to handle this type of situation. “If the market is moving against you, and you don’t know why, take in half. You can always put in on again. If you do that twice, you’ve taken in three-quarters of your position. Then what’s left is no longer a big deal.

- Taking a partial loss is much easier than liquidating the entire position and provides a way to act rather than procrastinate. Yet, most traders will resist the idea of partial liquidation. Why? Because partial liquidation absolutely guarantees that you will be wrong. If the market reverses, then you shouldn’t have liquidated anything, and if continues to move further against you, then you should have just liquidated the entire position. No matter what happens, you will be partially wrong. The need to be 100 percent right ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=884))

- prevents many traders from considering partial liquidation. Unfortunately, by trying to be 100 percent right, many traders end up being 100 percent wrong. The next time you are undecided between liquidating a losing position and gritting your teeth and riding it out, remember that there is a third possible choice: partial liquidation—an alternative that, as Cohen points out, can be used multiple times on the same position.

- The direct adverse consequence of letting a loss grow unnecessarily large is quite obvious. However, there is another far less obvious consequence of large losses that can have a major negative impact on equity. Large losses will mentally impede the trader and result in missed winning opportunities. This observation was colorfully expressed by Michael Platt, talking about the aftermath of taking a large loss: “You feel like an idiot, and you’re not in the mood to put on anything else. Then the elephant walks past you while your gun’s not loaded. It’s amazing how annoyingly often that happens. In this game, you want to be there when the great trade comes along. It’s the 80/20 rule of life. In trading, 80 percent of your profits come from 20 percent of your ideas. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=902))

- There is nothing magical about the 1 percent limit; you could use 0.5 percent, or 2 percent, or whatever number is most appropriate for your strategy.

How will you know when you are confident enough to succeed as a trader? Based on the interviews I have done, all I can say is that you will know when you are there. If you are unsure, you are not there yet, and you need to be aware of that lack of absolute confidence and move more cautiously in committing risk capital. One sure sign that you lack confidence is seeking the advice of others. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1087))

But that is not at all in keeping with Raschke’s personality. She is not bragging about her trading. Effectively, what Raschke is really saying is: “I have a methodology that I know is going to win in the long run. Along the way there are going to be some losses. If I lose now, I will win subsequently. As long as I stick with my methodology and keep doing what I am doing, I am going to come out ahead.” She is saying that losing is part of the process and that a trader needs to understand that to be successful.

- One of the most important lessons Marcus learned from Seykota was patience. As Marcus recalls, “One time, he was short silver, and the market kept edging down, a half penny a day, a penny a day. Everyone else seemed bullish, talking about why silver had to go up because it was so cheap, but Ed stayed short. Ed said, ‘The trend is down, and I’m going to stay short until the trend changes.’ I learned patience from him in the way he followed the trend.” When I interviewed Seykota, I was surprised that he did not have a quote machine on his desk and asked him about it. Seykota wryly replied, “Having a quote machine is like having a slot machine on your desk—you end up feeding it all day long. I get my price data after the close each day.” Seykota’s systems would give him trade signals when the conditions for a trade were met based on daily price data. Seykota did not even want to know about intraday market gyrations, as they could only provide a temptation to trade more frequently than dictated by his methodology. The dangers of watching every tick are twofold: It can lead to overtrading, and it is likely to increase the chances of prematurely liquidating good positions on insignificant adverse market moves.

- Now, why will the monkey do better? The monkey will do better because humans have evolved to seek comfort, and the markets don’t pay off for being comfortable.

- As an example of doing what feels good in the markets, Eckhardt cites what he terms “the call of the countertrend.” Buying on weakness and selling on strength appeals to the natural human desire to buy cheap and sell dear. If you buy a stock when it falls to a six-month low, it feels good because you are smarter than everyone else who bought that stock in the past six months. Although these trades may feel better at the moment of implementation, for most people, following such a countertrend approach will be a losing, and possibly even disastrous, strategy.

- As another example, Eckhardt explains that because most small profits tend to vanish, people learn the lesson to cash in profits right away, which may feel good, but is detrimental over the long run because it will also impede the ability earn large profits on any trade. As a third example, Eckhardt says that the tendency of markets to trade through the same price repeatedly leads people to hold on to bad trades in the hope that if they wait long enough, the market will return to their entry level. In all these cases, the action that feels good—getting a bargain, locking in a profit, holding out hope for avoiding a loss—is usually the wrong thing to do. The need for emotional satisfaction will lead most people to make decisions that are even worse than random, which is why the dart-throwing monkey will do better.

- The Inadvertent Experiment In his book The Little Book That Beats the Market, Joel Greenblatt provided a value-based indicator for ranking stocks. He called this ranking indicator the Magic Formula, a name that poked fun at the hype normally accompanying market indicators, but also referred to the surprising efficacy of the measure. In fact, Greenblatt and his trading partner, Rob Goldstein, were so impressed with how well the Magic Formula worked that they set up an eponymous website that ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1517))

- investors could use to pick their own stocks from a limited list of equities selected based on the value rankings of the formula. Investors were encouraged to pick at least 20 to 30 stocks from the list to get close to the average performance of these stocks, as opposed to being overly dependent on a few names. As a last-minute addition, they also included a check box that gave investors the option of having their account managed rather than picking the stocks themselves. It turned out that less 10 percent of people using the site for investment chose to do their own selection—the original concept—while the overwhelming majority chose the managed portfolio option. Greenblatt then tracked how the self-managed portfolios fared versus the managed portfolios. After the first two years, on average, the managed portfolios outperformed the self-managed portfolios by 25 percent, even though both were constructed from the same list of stocks. The differential between the managed and the self-managed portfolios reflected the impact of human selection and timing decisions. Letting investors make their own decisions (picking specific stocks from the list and timing the purchase and sale of these stocks) destroyed all the performance vis-à-vis investing equal-dollar amounts in a diversified portfolio of these stocks without any attempt to time the entries and exits of the holdings.

- I asked Greenblatt why he thought the investors making their own decisions did so much worse. Greenblatt replied, “They took their exposure down when the market fell.

They did much worse than random in selecting stocks from our prescreened list, probably because by avoiding the stocks that were particularly painful to own, they missed some of the biggest winners.” Think about it. Don’t these sound like decisions made to seek comfort? Greenblatt had inadvertently created a control group experiment that demonstrated the impact of human decisions in the market vis-à-vis a well-defined benchmark—a diversified portfolio consisting of the same list of stocks without any selection or timing inputs. Investors could have achieved the same expected return (with sampling variation) if they had randomly selected their stocks, investing equal-dollar amounts in each, and applying the same timing-free buy-and-hold approach.

- Behavioral Economics and Trading Eckhardt ties in human biases to the tendency for the majority of market participants to lose. As Eckhardt explains it, “There is a persistent overall tendency for equity to flow from the many to the few. In the long run, the majority loses. The implication for the trader is that to win you have to act like the minority. If you bring normal human habits and tendencies to trading, you’ll gravitate toward the majority and invariably lose.” Eckhardt’s observations are well aligned with the findings of behavioral economists whose research has demonstrated that people inherently make irrational investment decisions. For example, in one classic experiment conducted by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, pioneers in the field of prospect theory, subjects were given a hypothetical choice between a sure $3,000 gain versus an 80 percent chance of a $4,000 gain and a 20 percent chance of not getting anything.1 The vast majority of people preferred the sure $3,000 gain, even though the other alternative had a higher expected gain (0.80 × $4,000 = $3,200). Then they flipped the question around and gave people a choice between a certain loss of $3,000 versus an 80 percent chance of losing $4,000 and a 20 percent chance of not losing anything. In this case, the vast majority chose to gamble and take the 80 percent chance of a $4,000 loss, even though the expected loss would be $3,200. In both cases, people made irrational choices because they selected the alternative with the smaller expected gain or larger expected loss. Why? Because the experiment reflects a quirk in human behavior in regard to risk… ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1548))

- Ramsey considers the relative strength of markets an important factor in all circumstances, not just crisis events. He always wants to be long the strongest market and short the weakest. As an example, when QE2 (the second phase of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve) was ending, Ramsey expected that the shift of assets out of the dollar would stop and the dollar would recover. The question was which currency should be used as the short against the dollar. “The weak link,” Ramsey said, “turned out to be the Turkish lira, which was breaking out to a two-year low against the hated dollar. If it couldn’t rally versus the dollar when the Fed was printing money like crazy, what was it going to take?

- Most novice traders will seek to buy the laggards in a sector based on the premise that these markets provide the best return/risk potential because they have not yet moved as much as the others. Marcus and Ramsey are saying that traders should do the exact opposite. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1919))

- I learned that there is an incredible beauty in mistakes because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle and a gem that I could get if I solved it (i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future). I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. . . . While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that the most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.

- Dalio has written down his life philosophy and management concepts in Principles, a 111-page document that is required reading for all Bridgewater employees. The second portion of this work is a list of 277 management rules, which, not surprisingly, includes rules that pertain to mistakes. A sampling: Recognize that mistakes are good if they result in learning. Create a culture in which it is okay to fail but unacceptable not to identify, analyze, and learn from mistakes. Recognize that you will certainly make mistakes and have weaknesses; so will those around you and those who work for you. What matters is how you deal with them. If you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that can yield rapid improvement if handled well, you will be excited by them. If you don’t mind being wrong on the way to being right, you will learn a lot. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1951))

- Marty Schwartz drew a contrast between trading and other careers in regard to how people respond to mistakes, “Most people, in most careers, are busy trying to cover up their mistakes. As a trader, you are forced to confront your mistakes because the numbers don’t lie.” ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H7JE8W8&location=1958))

- “One of the things I did that worked in those early years was analyzing every single trade I made. Every day, I made copies of my cards and reviewed them at home. Every trader is going to have tons of winners and losers. You need to determine why the winners are winners and the losers are losers. Once you can figure that out, you can become more selective in your trading and avoid those trades that are more likely to be losers.” Each mistake, if recognized and acted upon, provides an opportunity for improving a trading approach. Most traders would benefit by writing down each mistake, the implied lesson, and the intended change in the trading process. Such a trading log can be periodically reviewed for reinforcement. Trading mistakes cannot be avoided, but repeating the same mistakes can be, and doing so is often the difference between success and failure.

- How a trade is implemented can be more important than the trade idea itself. Colm O’Shea viewed the runaway bull market in NASDAQ in 1999 and early 2000 as a bubble. When the market broke sharply in March 2000, he was relatively sure that a major top was in place and that equities would surrender most of their prior gains. Despite this expectation, O’Shea never considered going short equities. Why? Because, as he explained, while the price rise during a bubble can be quite smooth, the price decline after a bubble bursts is typically interspersed by treacherous bear market rallies. O’Shea thought the repercussions of a market top would be much easier to play than a direct short in equities. Specifically, he reasoned that the U.S. economy had been artificially boosted by the massive mispricing of assets. Once the NASDAQ bubble burst, O’Shea thought it was clear that the economy would slow down. A weakening economy would, in turn, lead to a decline in interest rates. So instead of implementing a short equity position, O’Shea went long bonds. Although both trends materialized—that is, stocks declined and interest rates declined—the big difference was that, as O’Shea had anticipated, the stock price decline was highly erratic, while the interest rate decline (bond price rise) was relatively smooth.

- Even though the March 2000 peak in the NASDAQ led to a plus-80 percent decline lasting two and a half years, in the summer of 2000 the NASDAQ witnessed a plus-40 percent rebound. If O’Shea had executed his idea through a short stock index position, he would have been correct in his call, but most likely would have lost money by being stopped out during this massive bear market rally. In contrast, the long bond position, which he had implemented instead of going short equities, witnessed a fairly smooth uptrend. The trade was highly successful, not because the underlying premise was correct, which it was, but rather because of the way the trade was implemented.
