- I always told our agents, “Make your clients think they’re your friends—but remember that they’re not.” Yet it would be my clients who’d stay loyal, for the most part, and my friends who’d betray me. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=224))

- Ron and I developed an effective one-two punch. After I opened with a hard line, asking for an amount somewhere between more than we expected to get and ridiculous, execs would back-channel Ron and say, “My God, he asked for six million for Warren Beatty against ten of the gross”—meaning 10 percent. “Can you help us out?” Ron would smooth their feathers and say, “I’ll talk to him,” or “Try this.” After they called me back, I’d tell Ron where things stood for the next round. On occasion I would offer a small concession. More often I’d hold firm and close the deal where I started, but the buyers always felt better because they’d been listened to. They never seemed to get that Ron was my agent. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=1455))

- 1979, when I was thirty-three, Ted Ashley at Warner Bros. took me aside and said, “I’m going to give you some great advice.” He grinned ruefully. “And, knowing you, you’re not going to take it. But here it is: I could have worked ten percent less, and it wouldn’t have made a difference in my professional success. But I would have been a lot happier.” Ted was absolutely right on both counts—it was great advice, and I didn’t take it. I see now that I could have worked as much as 20 percent less, and it wouldn’t have cost me. If I’d worked even 10 percent less, across thirty years, that’s three whole extra years of life I’d have enjoyed. On the other hand, Ted himself stepped down from Warner Bros. at a relatively young age, in his late fifties, and when I saw him a few years later, I was stunned by how listless he seemed.

- CAA had four commandments: (1) Never lie to your clients or colleagues. (2) Return every call by end of day (or at least have your assistant buy you a day’s grace). (3) Follow up and don’t leave people guessing. Every desk phone at CAA bore the message COMMUNICATE. After our Fred Specktor heard me use that word in every speech I gave, he stuck the plaques on Ron’s phone and mine—and when we admired them, he stuck them on everyone’s phone. It was our version of IBM’s famous imperative to THINK. The last commandment, and the hardest one to follow, was (4) Never bad-mouth the competition. Gossip was a tool of the trade. Other agencies routinely disparaged soon-to-be-released films by directors they hoped to sign. The performances stink. The studio’s pulling back on publicity. It won’t make a dime. The worse the buzz and the weaker the box office, the more open a director might be to changing representation. But if you were confident about your own work, why snipe? Why tear down someone you’re hoping to be in business with? We built our company around positive thinking. We had no hierarchy, no titles, no reporting lines, ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=1503))

- At staff meetings and retreats, I began to talk about the philosophy of the Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu, whose The Art of War I’d read in college. We took his ideas on loyalty, on teamwork, and on how having complete information was the key to decision making. The book also resonated with me because it prioritized strength and toughness. Ron and Bill thought my emphasis on Sun Tzu was crazy, until they realized that it worked—that our team bought in. In truth, though, the Chinese general was always a bit of a prop. It wasn’t so much what he said that inspired CAA, as the idea that we, a five-year-old company, were adhering to a philosophy from 2,500 years earlier. It gave us instant roots.

- People still wrote letters in longhand then, and their impact was underrated. I often sent out more than a thousand letters a year, commemorating every opening of a film (I’d send along a lucky horseshoe from our gift office), award nomination, or award—and those were just the rote letters. The ones that really had an effect were the personal ones, the ardent ones, wooing and praising and letting people know: I saw what you did and it was terrific.

- Every actor, writer, or director believes he or she is responsible for his or her own success. All I did was sell that belief back to them. “Look, you’re going to make it with or without us,” I’d say. “But we can keep you at the top, because we see every project first, we develop for you, we represent every important studio executive—so we can match you with the perfect projects. And we take care of all your other personal needs so you can focus on your work. Going with us is just like taking out career insurance.” A lot of agents preyed on people’s anxiety and desperation, pitching themselves as a golden ticket: “You can’t make it without me!” To me, that went against the grain of human nature. If a potential client was reluctant, I’d say, “You should take all the time you need. No pressure.” And by “no pressure,” I meant, “No pressure until the next time I’m in touch, which may be in an hour.” I tried to avoid coming across as a nudge, while making myself ubiquitous and inexorable. The smarter clients could see what I was doing, see how it worked, but it worked nonetheless because everyone wants to be wanted. And the realization that your would-be agent has a plan to handle whatever may be coming, and that he can execute it, is reassuring.

- Creating a zone of calm, in a chronically overexcited world, proved disarming. Whenever disputes arose with a studio, and I had to deal with an exec sputtering with outrage, I’d go even calmer and say, “I’m confused about something.” Or, slightly more aggressively: “Could you educate me?” They’re expecting you to ream them, and you’ve put them at ease by being neutral and mildly curious. Also, you’ve gotten them talking, and you’re learning. It preserves your options. ([Location 2593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=2593))

- Another move I developed, almost unconsciously, was ground shifting. If someone on the other side of the table very confidently asserted a number that was confidential or that was plausibly in dispute—the budget of a rival studio’s competing film, for instance—I would instantly say “It’s higher” or “It’s lower,” depending on which served our interests. That assertion would throw the other guy off balance, and suggest that I knew everything, when in truth I only knew some things. At the very least, it would give me a gauge of how solid their information was, and how confident they were. If they fired right back with “No, you’re absolutely wrong,” I’d just say, “That’s not what I’m hearing from the highest levels,” or something equally ominous, then change the topic. I resented it when people called these techniques agent tricks. I viewed them as tactics for achieving a preconceived strategy. My whole affect was transactional: I was soft-spoken because I wanted people to have to work hard to hear me, to have to move closer. When I did explode, which was rare, it was almost always expedient. When an agent named Robb Rothman left us for Jim Berkus’s agency, which later merged into UTA, I screamed at him, “I’m going to make your life a living hell!” It was the Hail Mary after I’d done everything I could to express how much we wanted him to stay. Then, and only then, did I pick up the club and threaten to drop him into a boiling lake of fire. You want the guy to reconsider. Do I regret screaming those sorts of threats, as I did whenever an agent left us? Yes and no. Yes, because it never worked and because it reinforced my image as a vindictive bastard. No, because it’s who I had to be. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=2597))

- If someone needed a personal trainer or a dog groomer or an impossible dinner reservation, our assistants were on the phone until it got done. Multiply that process by a thousand, and you get a reputation for taking care of everything. We gave the wedding party for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and counseled each of them during their divorce, and both stayed with the agency. We gave advice to both Rob Reiner and Penny Marshall during their divorce, and both stayed with the agency. We got Bette Midler’s kid into a private school with four weeks’ notice, and she stayed with the agency through enormous career ups and downs. One of my best trainee assistants, David O’Connor, got a call one afternoon from a furious Micheline Connery. Her rental car had stalled in the middle of the San Fernando Valley, and David was surely to blame, as he’d brought her the vehicle that morning. After rushing to Micheline’s aid, David discovered she was out of gas; she had driven all day and drained the tank. It had never occurred to Micheline that even a car provided by CAA might, eventually, need gas. David found a gas station. Problem solved. Clients would often ask to be set up with other clients, but I had no interest in being the house pimp. One of the most excruciating requests came from a movie star who ([Location 2694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=2694))

- wanted me to set him up with a woman he’d spotted in our mailroom. I temporized, put him off, hoped he’d forget about it—but he kept hounding me. I finally said, “It would look like I was asking an employee to go out with a prized client. You can see why I can’t do that, right?” He glumly assented. I went to Rupert Murdoch’s house for lunch once, and, always looking for an edge, asked who his internist was. When he said he didn’t have one, I immediately made an appointment for him with the head of internal medicine at UCLA. He got great care and became a donor to the institute. Years later, in the early ’90s, I had a problem when one of our top stars had been caught on video being chased by a disgruntled husband. It seems the star had slept with the guy’s wife on one of his films. A Fox entertainment show was planning to run the video, and our client, who was also married, was very upset. I called Rupert and explained the situation and said, “I would be eternally grateful if this problem went away.” He said, “Michael, I cannot interfere with any of our shows or magazines—you better than anyone should understand that.” He paused, then added, “But I will look into it.” He called back the next day and said, “We have looked high and low for any such video in the Fox library, and we simply cannot find it.” Then he hung up. I owed Rupert forever after that, and contributed to every charity and political candidate he asked me to. The most urgent personal asks were medical. One day Dustin Hoffman called me and said, “I’m sitting in an emergency room with Barry Levinson at Santa Monica Hospital. Barry’s son had a bad fall and keeps blacking out.” I said, “I am sending you an ambulance right now to take him to UCLA to be looked at by Dr. Warwick Peacock, the leading child neurologist.” We sent a mobile ER over to pick up Barry’s son, and when it got to UCLA, Peacock and twelve of his residents were waiting at the door. I had reached him at home, where he told me he was recovering from a bad flu, and insisted he go in, saying, “You’re the only guy I’d trust to lay eyes on him.” As I kept Barry company all night, Peacock decided, at 3:00 a.m., not to operate on Barry’s son’s brain, which was a giant gamble. But the kid pulled through. And then Peacock collapsed and he went into the ER. When he got out, I sent him a giant TV set, which his wife told me he really wanted. Barry was one of my closest friends, but I would have done that for any client. That sort of when-the-chips-are-down reliability, that total focus on others when it’s life or death, reassures me that I can be a decent person. It reflects the best part of me to myself.

- scene in Patton where George C. Scott says, “I don’t want to get any messages saying we are holding our position. We’re not holding anything. . . . We’re advancing constantly.” That scene when Patton slaps the shell-shocked soldier to get him back onto the battlefield—I wouldn’t have slapped him, but I would have talked him out of there somehow and back into the fight. Patton was a threatening motherfucker, and so was I. Or so I’d become, anyway. Over the years I’d split off most of my feelings and emotions, the human part of me, and let Ron display them for both of us—just as he’d off-loaded his cunning, ambitious side and let me express that for him. As a result I got the credit as the agency’s visionary, and he got to retain most of his soul and to serve as the caretaker of mine.

- Every year I wrote up a one-year, three-year, and five-year plan for us. At year’s end I’d destroy the old ones—I feared another agency getting wind of our plans—and write new ones. The one-year and three-year plans proved to be the most useful: often we accomplished the three-year plan in two. But Ron and Bill had no strategic instincts for that kind of thing. Ron was a purist who just wanted to represent more and better clients, and Bill didn’t want the extra work of new challenges, though he always did the work, and superbly, once I’d cajoled him into it. By the nineties, I’d stopped showing them my plans because my unceasing ambitions just pissed them off. My thinking was that I’d go do what was best for us, and they’d be grateful later. Right.

I couldn’t, though, and from then on I was constantly worried that Ron would take the agency down. Still, it never occurred to me to think through the logic of the way Ron introduced himself to people as my agent—to think about how much any agent keeps secret from his client. And it certainly never crossed my mind to worry that Ron would take me down. ([Location 3105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=3105))

- we told our clients the truth. That didn’t mean we told everyone else the truth. I often had to offer more than I could deliver in order to be able to eventually deliver what I had offered. If the truth was bad for us, we had to change the reality, and then deliver it as what we’d said it was all along. In the meantime, well, you’d get creative. One of our best cover-up jobs was convincing the town, for two years, that Michael was hard at work when he was actually curled up in a ball. We didn’t get caught on this kind of smokescreen because it hardly served the client we were protecting to throw us under the bus. I never viewed this kind of misdirection as lying. Lying, to me, is a point-blank misstatement with no purpose in mind. I viewed what we did as positioning, molding, manipulating: taking fact sets and making them work for the result we wanted. That mind-set underpinned every single conversation we had with the buyers and they had with us, all day long.

- As a high school freshman, I did gymnastics after school. I remember being stunned by the Sakamoto Brothers, respected local gymnasts who showed us martial-arts wrist locks. What awed me was their discipline. They had a stillness that set them apart from the kids I grew up around—or from me and my temper. Inspired, I taught myself budo, the philosophy of martial arts and self-defense. I soon learned about the danger of a little knowledge. When I tried my beginner’s judo moves on a bully named Scott Craig, he beat the crap out of me. After I lost, I thought, I do not want to keep being terrorized by a bully who only lives a few blocks away. So I congratulated Scott on beating the crap out of me, praising his power and technique. After that, whenever he came around the corner on his American Flyer bike, I’d wave and call out. A few weeks into my charm offensive, he became my friend and then my protector. It was a great lesson in how to make your enemies your friends. ([Location 3284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B2HS77M&location=3284))

You have to hit through the target to really smash it.” To get where you want to go, you have to set out to go even further.
