## Highlights
- This is a story of a man who believes in hard work and treating people right. Willis always says things like, “If you take care of the company, the company will take care of you,” and “Watch your pennies and your dollars will take care of themselves,” and “Don’t forget a lot of people are counting on us.” These values led to his desire to have no debt on his balance sheet, to go public on the NASDAQ Exchange, and to build a great company from the ground up.

- Dad also had an expression: “Take care of your pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves.” It’s a phrase I have also passed on to others so they would learn the same lesson I learned from him—that small amounts of money can add up to either big profits or big losses. You can’t ignore the small expenses or the small amounts of money unaccounted for if you hope to succeed at the end of the day. Another phrase Dad used to say all the time was, “If you take care of your business, the business will take care of you.” ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=267))

- I guess I just don’t like people telling me I can’t do something. When people tell me, “Willis, you can’t do that,” it just pushes me to show them I can. It wasn’t that I thought I was better than anybody; I just always thought if you wanted something bad enough and worked hard enough for it, it would happen.

- Every time you can add a revenue stream to the same pipeline, the profit margins change drastically. You are putting more through that pipe. That’s what I always tried to do in my businesses, and it is how we were successful. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1302))

- I’d tell him how much I liked a certain motor because it broke a lot. Jay didn’t understand that at first; why would a motor that broke all the time be so great? But I told him, “You’re never going to sell it if it doesn’t break. What are you going to do with a bunch of motors that never break?” It was a big learning curve.

- But maybe most importantly, PIP represented a significant shift in the industry. Now the salvage auction was a partner with the insurance company, with the goal of getting the best possible price for each car, eliminating any arguments over fees.

- Jay helped me remodel the Fresno office in one weekend—ripping down walls, building a new counter, and putting in new floors. Jay was getting more interested in Copart and started asking me about the financial side of the business. Like me, he also saw the potential for expanding Copart across California. The summer after his first year in college, Jay stopped just being the gofer and went to work for me at the Copart office. But when the summer was over, Jay didn’t want to go back to school. Like me, he had become tired of sitting in a classroom learning about doing things instead of actually doing them. Jay told me he wanted to quit college and become a businessman. And he wanted me to teach him how. I handed him a broom and told him to start sweeping; that was his first step to being a businessman. There were no free rides in life, and I expected Jay to earn his way up in the company. Jay grabbed the broom and got to work. And when I told him to learn how to drive a forklift, he did that too. Next I had him tackle organizing the mechanic shop. It turned out whatever Jay tackled, he changed for the good, so I began to trust Jay to do even more. Jay had initiative and a sense for how to make things better. While driving forklift, he found a way to move ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1454))

- cars more efficiently that streamlined the routes, saving time and fuel. He paid attention to where the company was spending money and how we could cut costs. All through my business life, when I shook hands with people, I would mentally put them in a category of where they could go in the company. I got to be a pretty good judge of people, and I saw that Jay had an ability to really make the company run better. And I thought, Well if he can do this outside in the yard, how can he improve the inside—the office? That’s something a lot of guys can’t handle. They can do the work in the shop, in the yard—but they can’t handle the paperwork that comes with the inside of the business. So I gave Jay the daunting task of running the titling department and improving the DMV side of the business. Jay jumped in and caught on immediately. He changed the process and the work flow to make it more efficient, so titles could be processed faster, and therefore sales could close more… ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1464))

- Efficiency is what excites Jay. Looking at something and finding a better way to do it is his forte. And that’s something I not only valued but embraced. I’m not the kind of guy who says, “Look, kid, I’ve been doing this for twenty years, and I’m not interested in changing.” I never have a problem if someone tells me something is broken. I have always wanted to do things better and improve on the model. Jay tells me I embrace change almost to a fault, though. He was always afraid he—or someone else, for that matter—may give me a bad idea, and then I’d hand over the power to break something that didn’t need to be fixed in the first place. But I never really worried about that with Jay. Our friendship was slowly turning… ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1473))

- Jay also worried about how he was going to fit in because he knew I liked coming in every day and doing what I did. If he did more, what the heck was I going to do? Then something happened that changed everything, squashing any doubts Jay had about if the company had room for him to grow. I heard from Marv Schmidt that his biggest competitor, Insurance Auto Auctions (IAA) had gone public and had raised enough money to expand at a rapid pace. They were trying to gobble up as many auctions as they could and had approached Marv about buying his. I had never cared about the stock market. The stock page in the newspaper was as foreign to me as the sports page and about as useful. I hadn’t a clue about Wall Street. But when I heard that IAA was making big moves that could affect my business, I decided I should start to care. Marv sent me IAA’s prospectus, and I read it. Then I read it again. And again. I didn’t understand most of it at the time, but I did understand this: IAA had not been making the money I thought it should be to go public. They were in debt. Going public allowed them to raise a ton of money, and they didn’t even have to pay it back. ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1494))

- “We’re a utility. Nothing can get rid of us—nothing. Two of the biggest businesses in the world are car manufacturers and insurance companies,” I went on. “If insurance companies don’t write insurance policies on cars, then they’re out of business. If manufacturers don’t make cars, then they’re out of business. They’re always gonna make cars, and they’re always gonna insure them. We’re the guy in between.” ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1564))

- I looked him right in the eye and said, “As long as we’ve got the land in the right place to put the cars on, we can’t fail. We are like the septic tanks of the sewer system. You can’t have the system without us.” ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1568))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But he still had to let me know what we were up against. Barry said, “Willis, this is the deal. Ninety-seven percent of people who try to go public don’t make it. You need to remember what your odds are.” Well, I never have been the kind of guy who played the odds. I take chances. Besides, the odds had always seemed to end up in my favor in the end. And again, I just never thought I couldn’t do it. It didn’t even cross my mind that I might be part of that 97 percent. “Okay,” I said. “I don’t have a problem with that. Let’s do it.” ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1581))

- Steve told me later that he admired my principles and the fact that failure wasn’t an option for me. But while I was driven, I was also willing to wait to do it the way I wanted, without cutting deals I shouldn’t or selling myself or the business short. John and Steve respected that, which I appreciated it. ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1589))

- People call my “unusual” twists on the English language “Willisisms,” and I don’t mind. I may not say things the same way other people do, but that’s what keeps things interesting. One time I was at a meeting with some investment bankers, explaining an unusual situation or “aberration.” “It’s an aborigine,” I said. When the bankers left the room, I realized my error, turned to Jay, and said, “Is an aborigine one of those guys in Australia?” Jay nodded. Oh well. They understood what I meant in the end.

- business with just anyone with a checkbook. I have to trust you—and you have to be someone I feel good about being associated with. When Barry was first trying to raise us money, I sat across the table from some potential investors I knew weren’t the kind of people I wanted to do business with or be associated with. So I looked across the table, and said, “You know what? I don’t want your money.” Then I stood up and walked out the door. Back at the yard, Barry went ballistic. “What do you mean, you don’t want their money?” Barry asked incredulously. I looked back at Barry and said, “I don’t like them.” Barry couldn’t believe that this was a conversation he was having. This wasn’t how things happened on Wall Street, that was for sure. “You don’t like them?” I tried to explain, “Look, if I’m going to make somebody money, I’ve got to like them.” I’ve been in business a long time, and if I don’t trust people from a conversation across a dinner table, I’m pretty sure I’m not going to trust them with my reputation or my money. And if I don’t trust them with my money, I’m sure not going to go making money for them. I told Barry, “They’re not good partners. I don’t want to deal with them.” Seemed pretty straightforward, I thought. “Are you trying to kill me?” Barry was furious. He stomped around the office and then lay down on the floor. “Barry? What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m stretching out my aching back, Willis. You are a pain in my … back.” ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1609))

- Jay, Barry, and I also met with Jim Grosfeld, who had been CEO of Pulte Homes for seventeen years before stepping down to get into private investing. I needed someone with his reputation and experience on Copart’s board of directors, and Jim was also interested in investing in the business. We all met at a restaurant—which had become my favorite place for these things because deals just go better on a full stomach. I told Jim my plans for taking Copart public. Toward the end of the conversation, Jim asked me how much I was planning to pay myself to run the company. I don’t remember exactly how much I told him, but I don’t think it was unreasonable—around $100,000 and a company car every two years. But Jim questioned the amount. “Don’t you think you’re paying yourself too much?” he asked. Jay, still young and hot-headed, lost his temper.

- “Who do you think you are! He owns all of it. He doesn’t even need your rotten money,” Jay said. I ended the meeting and left with Jay before eating my dinner. I decided I didn’t need Jim’s money after all. A short time later, Barry gave me a call. I was already expecting another lecture and more groaning about the pain I was causing him. “You guys are giving me a headache,” Barry told me. “This guy has a lot of money he can invest, and you are just messing it up for me. I can’t do it! You can’t just walk out on people who want to give you money!” “Look, I’ve told you before, Barry. I’m not making money for people I don’t like. I’ll do it without him,” I said. An hour later, Barry called back. “Willis, Jim Grosfeld loved you guys, and he’s in.” Jim wasn’t in just a little bit either. He ended up being the biggest investor, putting in $4 million. When we met with him again, Jim seemed like a different guy. “Why are you so nice and last time you weren’t?” I asked him. “Well before I was trying to get into business. Now I own part of the business so we are friends. I’m on your side now, Willis.” ([Location 1682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1682))

- From that moment, we developed a friendship that included Jim being a key member of Copart’s board. I also learned that sometimes it pays to give people a second chance and very few things are worth leaving the dinner table in a huff over.

- I had no idea what a road show was at first. Steve would have five minutes to talk about the financials, and then I had twenty-five minutes to tell my story and why Copart was going to succeed. At the end of thirty minutes, we’d leave and go to the next one, and Barry’s people would stay behind and take orders. Every hour on the hour we were meeting with someone else—up to ten in a day. And it wasn’t just in New York, it was in Chicago and ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1831))

- Just as I got to the door, the stock opened. The bankers had wanted to open it at ten dollars a share, but Barry insisted they open at twelve dollars. By opening it at ten dollars, investors would have made more money as the stock value increased. But opening it at twelve dollars meant I would get more money for my investment. They had also sold more stock than they had originally been allotted—called a greenshoe. A greenshoe allows underwriters to sell up to 15 percent more shares offered in a registered securities offering at the offering price, if demand for the securities exceeds the original amount offered. The greenshoe option is popular because it is ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1844))

- a risk-free way to stabilize the price of a newly issued stock post-pricing. Jay described it as the most amazing feeling in the world when we went public. I had given up 26 percent of the company for the right to borrow $10 million. But as Copart went public, Copart’s share price was valued at $12, with 6.5 million shares outstanding. That put the company’s value at between $75 and $80 million. ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=1848))

- As I heard them open up the stock, I could feel the weight of the world lifting off my back. All the investors I had now owned shares. They were now shareholders, not partners.

- I also knew Copart was mine again. At the time, I had three million shares, making me the biggest shareholder, with 40 percent ownership of the company. I could do one of two things—use my stock as currency to buy other companies or go back to Wall Street to raise more money. Now that Copart was public, raising more money would be easy.

- I just didn’t want to grow to grow. I wanted to build a brand. I wanted anything with a Copart logo on it to run the same way—same computer system, same pricing, same way of treating our employees—so people started relating our name to a certain way of doing business. We spent time converting things over and converting employees over and teaching them our way of doing things because in many cases, the old way they were doing things hadn’t been working. That’s why they had to sell. That’s also why I think IAA’s approach to keeping newly acquired yards running the same way was wrong. They weren’t fixing what was broken in the first place.

- I had the advantage there. IAA bought companies the Wall Street way—based on pretax or after-tax earnings. I had my own method based on how many cars the auction sold and the value of the land. I knew what didn’t show up on the balance sheet of a private, family-owned company—that many of these business owners used a lot of their profits to buy personal cars or pay salaries and benefits to their family members.

- the businesses were undervalued as a result. I paid a little more for these businesses, but I was also able to see their potential. With my operating systems and business model, I also knew we could increase profits almost instantly. The other philosophical difference between Copart and IAA was that IAA purchased the cars from the insurance companies while Copart charged fees to store, clean up, and sell the cars. The advantage of this was Copart could limit its liability and get a greater percent of earnings per investment, since they were putting out less cash. The downside was IAA could show more revenue on its books, which people on Wall Street saw as having more potential. I didn’t care though because I knew in the long run, it was about earnings. The bottom line is: what percentage are you making on your business? If we are pulling 30 to 40 percent to their 10 percent, we are a stronger company.

- We had also seen on the news that commercial planes all over were being grounded—not because the government was grounding them but because no one wanted to fly. On the other hand, car rental companies were booming. You could hardly find a car that wasn’t already rented. I told Jay people weren’t going to fly as much after this. Instead, they were going to drive. If that was the case, they were going to wreck more cars. That meant our business was due to grow again. I told Jay, “I’m going to call Salomon Smith Barney and see if we can do another offering.” ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=2209))

It didn’t mean that if the opportunity wasn’t right we wouldn’t jump; we just made sure it was right to keep the stock healthy.

- We decided our job was to help buyers purchase cars easier so we could get the most money for the sellers. That was our job—to get the insurance company more money. That superseded anything else. ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=2288))

- People from all over the world were buying Copart cars. Between press coverage and word of mouth, car buyers in other countries started to hear about VB2 and to realize they could bid on cars to use for parts or to fix up and sell without leaving their shops in Lithuania, Russia, or South America. We even listed brokers on our website that buyers could hire to pick up and ship the ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=2310))

- cars for them. Copart made it so easy that geography ceased to be an issue anymore. And with more buyers around the globe in the mix, returns just kept going up. After VB2 was launched in 2003, 14.5 percent of all bids were awarded to buyers out of the country. ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0792L6Z1M&location=2313))

- I didn’t see it from a seller’s perspective, though. I didn’t expect returns to go up. I wasn’t thinking that by making it easier, more buyers would use it—and that buyers from all over the world would be able to use it. With all those buyers competing over the cars, it was a natural result that the returns would go up. That was the kicker for me.

- It goes to show you that any company today has to pay attention to technology and how the world is changing and incorporate that if it wants to survive. You can’t do things the same way and expect to be around in ten years. The world moves too quickly. The moment you snooze, you lose.

- In my wildest dreams, when I first computerized my wrecking yards, I never thought we’d be selling a car online every five seconds of every working day. I never thought that if you went to a shipping dock in Lithuania or the United Arab Emirates you’d see hundreds and hundreds of shipping containers holding cars that had “Copart” printed on their windshields because we had buyers in other countries importing them.

- It again goes back to the lesson that when something bad happens, like the union problem in Michigan, you don’t need to panic or get mad; you just need to step back and find a new way. And more times than not, that bad thing that happened will turn into a good thing if you listen to the lessons it is teaching you.

- Don’t get a big head and think you know it all, because that’s when you’ll lose. You’re really good in the car business. You’re really good in the recycling business. You’re not necessarily good in everything else, and you need to understand that. Stay with what you are good at, venture out if you see an opportunity, but pull your horns in if you make a mistake.
