## Highlights
- The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those who have been brought up, as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds. J. M. KEYNES ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=190))

- I guess it proves the old adage “If a dog is going to bite, he’s going to do it as a pup.” ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=198))

- For a common stock to be an attractive investment, The Aggressive Conservative Investor outlined four essential characteristics: • The company ought to have a strong financial position that is measured not so much by the presence of assets as by the absence of significant encumbrances, whether a part of a balance sheet, disclosed in financial statement footnotes, or an element that is not disclosed at all in any part of financial statements. • The company ought to be run by reasonably honest management and control groups, especially in terms of how cognizant the insiders are of the interests of outside security holders. • There ought to be available to the investor a reasonable amount of relevant information that is akin to full disclosure, though this will always be something that falls somewhat short of the mark. • The price at which the equity security can be bought ought to be below the investor’s reasonable estimate of net asset value. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=258))

- These four characteristics describe common stock investment under both a financial-integrity approach and a safe and cheap approach. Especially since there have been quantum improvements in the quantity and quality of information available, these four concepts hold as firm today as in 1979.

- The other terminology change is the use of the acronym OPMI (outside passive minority investor) to describe outside investors and passivists as well as non-control and unaffiliated security holders. OPMIs run the gamut from day traders to most institutional investors to safe and cheap investors who do not seek elements of control over the companies in which they hold securities positions. The reason for using the term OPMI rather than investor is that the word investor is one of the most misused and misunderstood words on Wall Street. Most of the time it seems as if those using the term Investor really mean short-run speculator—either individual or institutional—so we’ve mostly discontinued use of the word investor in favor of OPMI.

- How have the two funds fared from 1984 through mid-2005? They have vastly outperformed any relevant market index on a long-term basis, on average, and for a majority of the time. Efficient market theorists will carp that the funds have not outperformed relevant indexes consistently. Consistently is really a dirty word meaning all the time. In investing, consistently should have relevance only for day traders, not long-term buy-and-hold investors. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=279))

- The secret to success in safe and cheap investing is not to obtain superior (or earlier) information, but rather to use the available information in a superior manner. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=372))

- The first attribute of a strong financial position is a relative absence of liabilities, whether disclosed on the balance sheet in the financial statement footnotes, or existing outside of any financial disclosures. The second attribute of a strong financial position is the existence of high quality assets, i.e., either cash or assets convertible into cash. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=378))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The third attribute of a strong financial position exists where a company has free cash flows from operations available for its common shareholders. These free cash flows, however, are a relative rarity since most companies, as going concerns, seem to have earnings rather than free cash flows. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=384))

- We now believe that the most attractive value investments are in the common stocks of extremely well financed companies, which sell at material discounts from readily ascertainable net asset values. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=412))

- We believe that the new academic discipline, behavioral finance, has very limited applicability to safe and cheap investing. Behaviorists are people who ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=474))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- believe that more than economic rationality drives market forces. Market participants are also influenced by emotions—fear, greed, political correctness, style, and fashion. Behaviorists, though, seem to ignore the basic point that even if investors were reasonably rational, it is context rationality that counts. Different market participants have different rationalities. What is rational for safe and cheap investors (e.g., ignore near-term market swings) would be utterly irrational for heavily margined day traders who know little or nothing about the securities they buy and sell, and vice versa.

- The general theory of market efficiency states that some markets will tend toward instantaneous efficiency; some markets will tend toward long-term efficiency but rarely achieve it; and some markets are inefficient inherently. Which market exists is a function of four variables: • Who the market participant is • How complex the security, or the situation, being analyzed • The time horizons of the participants • The strength of external forces imposing oversight on a market (i.e., government external forces and private sector external forces) ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=507))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is a myth from a safe and cheap point of view that most markets are efficient or tend toward instantaneous efficiency because an army of trained analysts causes it to be so. First, the army probably has been trained by financial academics who are strictly top-down analysts. Second, the army is mostly analyzing the wrong things. They primarily believe in: • Primacy of the income account • Short-run outlooks • Technical considerations (e.g., predictions about the near-term outlook for the general market, or a possible overhang of specific securities being readied for sale) • What the numbers are rather than what the numbers mean ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=525))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Financial markets almost never approach instantaneous efficiency unless they are strictly regulated. A market is defined as any financial or commercial arena where participants reach agreements about price and other terms, which each participant believes is the most reasonable terms achievable under the circumstances.

- Portfolio analysis differs from individual securities analysis. For portfolios, there is no such thing as a value trap. If a portfolio performs poorly over time, blame it on poor analysis, not on value traps where cheap common stocks stay cheap forever.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In safe and cheap investing and control investing what the numbers mean tend to be much more important than what the numbers are. This is a point that cannot be overstated for economic analysis in general. The Toyota Industries example shows the difference between what the numbers are and what the numbers mean. Reported earnings for GAAP purposes are what the numbers are. Attributing some weight to the unreported equity in the undistributed earning of companies held in the company’s investment portfolio indicates that the analyst should weight heavily what the numbers mean.

- There is a long-term arbitrage between business value and common stock prices: if common stock prices are high relative to business value, go public; if common stock prices are low relative to business value, go private, or semiprivate.

- In terms of avoiding investments in areas likely to be characterized by political instability and violence in the streets, the safe and cheap, passive investor always will eschew investments in those countries where population is rapidly increasing and family size is large, say five or more live births per adult woman. These countries will likely continue to fail to enjoy economic prosperity and be inclined to have a young average age of death, be a spawning ground for terrorism and tribal genocide, have corrupt, dictatorial governments, and have a population prone to become ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=606))

- infected with AIDS and/or tropical diseases. Such countries include most of the Middle East, most of Africa, and some of Latin America and South America. The post World War II economic miracles occurred in Germany, Japan, the Asian Tigers, China, and India—all countries in which population growth was controlled and family size limited. Any and all resource conversion activities (e.g., mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, restructuring troubled companies, refinancings) involve huge costs payable to investment bankers, commercial bankers, brokers, lawyers, accountants, lenders, and promoters. This expense problem seems exacerbated for small cap companies. There exist strong Wall Street pressures to have periodic IPO booms. These pressures arise out of huge gross spreads, exclusive product, and an easy sale—all of which encourage securities salespeople to push IPOs. Passive investment products tend to be sold by salespeople rather than bought by investors. For proof look at the relative popularity of load funds compared with no-load funds in the mutual fund industry. A load is a commission paid by an OPMI, a portion of which goes to securities salespersons. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=610))

- The markets for top management compensation tend to be inefficient given top management entrenchment. Therefore, top managements, as a group and individually, earn excess returns relatively consistently. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=621))

- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is a nonstarter for two reasons. First, from a creditor’s point of view (and without getting into the issue of effective differences in cost between, say, short-term senior secured issues and long-term subordinates), the cost of creating corporate creditworthiness is very different in the case where the company issues debt securities that have a required cash cost on the one hand, and where the company issues equity securities that don’t require cash payments on the other hand. Second, the vast majority of equity financing takes place via having the company retain earnings rather than having the company market new issues of common stock. The PE ratio, or cap rate, at which a common stock sells in an OPMI market, has no particular ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=656))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- meaning for a company increasing its equity base through retaining earnings. Here return on equity (ROE) gives a better estimate of the cost of equity capital to the company than does a cap rate measured in part by OPMI market prices, albeit many cash conscious managements and companies will view retaining earnings as a cost-free method of increasing equity capital.

- It is our thesis that minimizing risk does not reduce profit potentials for investors in common stocks; rather, minimizing the downside tends to enhance the realistic upside potential, especially for noncontrol investors in common stocks.

- In contrast to our emphasis on financial position, conventional fundamental analysis rests on a primacy-of-earnings theory—that is, reported earnings are a principal determinant of common-stock prices. To us, the primacy-of-earnings approach is valid in special cases—that is, it is more applicable than a financial-position approach for those common-stock traders whose one consuming interest is day-to-day stock market fluctuations. It seems reasonable to suppose that most of the time, accounting earnings as ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=801))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- reported will have a more significant impact on immediate stock prices than will perceived changes in financial position. Yet, we view financial position as normally the more fundamental factor because it is a better aid in understanding a business than are reported earnings, especially since most enterprises are not strict going concerns. In addition, most securities holders, including creditors, are not stock traders. Primacy-of-earnings concepts therefore appear to be more limited in applicability than is popularly supposed.

- Note that by “understanding the business,” we mean specifically understanding the finances and operations of a company, its problems and its potentials. Thus, we focus on the analysis of internal factors, especially financial position, that we believe affect the value of business. By “understanding the business,” we do not mean understanding stock-price movements, interest-rate fluctuations or even prognostications about the overall economy. This is not because we feel that predictions of general economic activity are unimportant, but rather because we believe that everyone, ourselves included, has limited abilities in macroeconomic forecasting. On the other hand, we believe that the “nitty-gritty” fundamentals we stress ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=839))

- In the language of modern capital theory, our focus is on unsystematic risk, factors that are peculiar to specific enterprises. In stark contrast to modern capital theorists, we believe that an outside investor can obtain excess returns if he is willing to apply himself so that he can benefit from the knowledge available in public documents and thus guard against unsystematic risk. Put simply, modern capital theorists believe it is practically impossible to guard against unsystematic risk because common-stock prices are almost always in equilibrium, neither too high nor too low. We are convinced that most common-stock prices are almost always in disequilibrium, certainly for activists and also for those outsiders willing to work and think like activists.

- If there is one thing that differentiates our approach from that of others writing on investments, it is our underlying conviction that the value of a business has no necessary relationship to the price of its common stock. Of course, business values are related to stock market prices: in some instances—for example, the going-concern analysis of electric utilities—virtually the same standards that seem to result in a price for the stock are used to value the business it represents. And it is also true that over time there probably is a tendency for stock prices to be equated with business values, though frankly it would be hard to demonstrate just how strong or how weak this tendency is. In a dynamic economy, moreover, disequilibrium, not equilibrium, is the rule. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=865))

- This book seems to us to be distinguishable from most other investment books of which we are aware, whether fundamental or technical, in that it offers no arithmetical formulas to noncontrol investors. Our “magic formula” for investment success—the understanding of a business—has to grow out of experience, insight and maturity of judgment. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that what we have to say ought to help investors in gaining these requisites. We attempt to do this by covering three general topics. First, we try to educate the outside investor to think about investment questions the way insiders and deal promoters tend to. Second, we start the outsider onto the road to obtaining familiarity with the uses and limitations of the required disclosures, including accounting disclosures, of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Third, we attempt to impart understanding about who the various role players in the financial community are and how they each participate in the investment process. There are many ways to invest in securities, some of which (such as short selling, option writing and arbitrage) are relatively esoteric. This book, insofar as it is directed to the non-insider, is directed toward unhedged investments in relatively conventional securities—say, commercial paper, corporate bonds, certain leases, preferred stock, limited partnership interests and common stocks, among others. Although these types of investments are frequently hybrids—that is, securities purchased in order to achieve a varied bag of investor objectives—we divide them into four types:   1. Trading investments 2. Investments in the securities of emerging companies or industries 3. Workout and special-situation investments 4. Cash-return investments ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=879))

- In looking at a transaction, the single most important question seems to be, What have I got to lose? Only when it seems that risks can be controlled or minimized does the second question come up: How much can I make? The second attitude has to do with a basic feeling that risk—how much one can lose—is essentially measured internally, not externally. The possibilities of unsatisfactory results from an investment or loan are to be found internally in the performance of the ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=991))

- underlying business and the resources in the business, not externally in the market prices at which a company’s securities might trade. Successful activists and creditors, while not unmindful of the “value messages” that are delivered by markets, tend not to be overly influenced by such messages. Their attitude is, As far as my objectives are concerned, I know much more about the situations in which I invest or in which I lend than the stock market does.

- Our views as developed in this book are that attractive equity investments for outside investors ought to have the following four essential characteristics:   1. The company ought to have a strong financial position, something that is measured not so much by the presence of assets as by the absence of significant encumbrances, whether a part of a balance sheet, disclosed in financial statement footnotes, or an element that is not disclosed at all in any part of financial statements. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=1010))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 2. The company ought to be run by reasonably honest management and control groups, especially in terms of how cognizant the insiders are of the interests of creditors and other security holders. 3. There ought to be available to the investor a reasonable amount of relevant information, although in every instance this will be something that is far short of “full disclosure”—the impossible dream for any investigator, whether activist, creditor, insider or outside investor. 4. The price at which the equity security can be bought ought to to be below the investor’s reasonable estimate of net asset value.   These four elements are the sine qua non for an investment commitment using the financial-integrity approach, because their presence results in a minimization of investment risk. But they are not simply by their presence sufficient reasons for an investment commitment. The absence, however, of any one of them is reason enough to forgo any passive investment, regardless of how attractive it might appear based on other standards.

- comes about by indirection—for example, by buying good values as determined under the financial-integrity approach, and sticking with those holdings in the absence of clear-cut evidence that a significant mistake has been made. Evidence of such mistakes will be found in the results achieved by the business rather than in the price of the business’s securities, which at any moment may or may not reflect business reality.

- Indeed, for most investors, market performance as an element in measuring true investment results should have a weight of less than 100 percent. An outside investor holding a completely marketable security should give weight of close to zero to market performance whenever he knows or has reason to believe that the security’s real worth is not closely related to current market prices, and when he knows that he will neither need to liquidate in the near future nor to use the security owned as collateral for borrowings.

- investments in companies over which they have no control are bound to be unsuccessful—that the real world just never justifies so much confidence in a security. We disagree. It appears that many of the most successful outside investments have resulted from having such confidence, whether it was by buying and holding General Motors common through the 1933 decline, or by acquiring Japanese insurance stocks at the depth of that country’s extremely sharp business recession and stock market crash of 1965, or even by buying such Japanese securities in 1970 after they had doubled, or Xerox and Holiday Inn when they were emerging securities, or Chicago Northwest Railway and Berkshire Hathaway when they were workout situations, or deepdiscount, high-yield, medium-grade bonds in 1974.

- In considering the weight that should be given to stock market prices, it is important to remember that a stock market price is not business or corporate value, but a realization value based on the price at which a common stock could be sold. Therefore, market value as a realization figure is a very realistic figure for a shareholder who owns, say, 1,000 shares of Chase Manhattan Corporation common selling at 35. However, it does not follow that 35 represents a realistic value for all the Chase Manhattan common shares outstanding. There is no way other than in a merger ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0096CE2VG&location=1418))

- For another thing, efficient-market theories assume that outside investors and their advisers are highly capable and are able on the average to interpret information properly. As far as we can tell, there is no empirical evidence to support such a view. Indeed, we suspect that many stock researchers and security analysts are relatively incompetent in either analyzing or understanding businesses. Incompetence of analysts, incidentally, is just as logical an explanation of why equity markets seem efficient as the view that information is competently absorbed and immediately reflected in market prices. Unquestionably, there are many, many extremely competent practitioners within the financial community. Relatively few of them, however, seem to make a career out of servicing the perceived needs of total-return, outside investors. Rather, the best and finest brains on Wall Street seem to gravitate to fields such as arbitrage, corporate finance, private placements, mergers and acquisitions, and becoming control principals in companies.
