## Highlights
- As was the case during the early days of the World Wide Web, however, the quality of the information was highly varied. While the printing press paid almost immediate dividends in the production of higher quality maps,10 the bestseller list soon came to be dominated by heretical religious texts and pseudoscientific ones.11 Errors could now be mass-produced, like in the so-called Wicked Bible, which committed the most unfortunate typo in history to the page: thou shalt commit ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097JYVAU&location=97))

- This exponential growth in information is sometimes seen as a cure-all, as computers were in the 1970s. Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired magazine, wrote in 2008 that the sheer volume of data would obviate the need for theory, and even the scientific method.37 This is an emphatically pro-science and pro-technology book, and I think of it as a very optimistic one. But it argues that these views are badly ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097JYVAU&location=188))

Like Caesar, we may construe them in self-serving ways that are detached from their objective reality. Data-driven predictions can succeed—and they can fail. It is when we deny our role in the process that the odds of failure rise. Before we demand more of our data, we need to demand more of ourselves.

- Karl Popper, the philosopher of science, recognized this view.45 For Popper, a hypothesis was not scientific unless it was falsifiable—meaning that it could be tested in the real world by means of a prediction.

Specialized: Often have spent the bulk of their careers on one or two great problems. May view the opinions of “outsiders” skeptically. Adaptable: Find a new approach—or pursue multiple approaches at the same time—if they aren’t sure the original one is working.

As we have found, sometimes an honest and accurate expression of the uncertainty is what has the potential to save property and lives.

- Although Israel is targeted by terrorists much more frequently than the United States, Israelis do not live in fear of terrorism. A 2012 survey of Israeli Jews found that only 16 percent described terrorism as their greatest fear81—no more than the number who said they were worried about Israel’s education system. No Israeli politician would say outright that he tolerates small-scale terrorism, but that’s essentially what the country does. It tolerates it because the alternative—having everyone be paralyzed by fear—is incapacitating and in line with the terrorists’ goals. A key element in the country’s strategy is making life as normal as possible for people after an attack occurs. For instance, police typically try to clear the scene of an attack within four hours of a bomb going off,82 letting everyone get back to work, errands, or even leisure. Small-scale terrorism is treated more like crime than an existential threat. ([Location 7233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097JYVAU&location=7233))

Mathematics classrooms spend more time on abstract subjects like geometry and calculus than they do on probability and statistics. In many walks of life, expressions of uncertainty are mistaken for admissions of weakness. When you first start to make these probability estimates,… ([Location 7328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097JYVAU&location=7328))

Our brains process information by means of approximation.8 This is less an existential fact than a biological necessity: we perceive far more inputs than we can consciously consider, and we handle this problem by breaking them down into regularities and patterns. Under high stress, the regularities of life will be stripped away.

With experience, the simplifications and approximations will be a useful guide and will constitute our working knowledge.11 But they are not perfect, and we often do not realize how rough they are.

Tetlock found, however, that his hedgehogs were very poor at making… ([Location 7362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0097JYVAU&location=7362))
