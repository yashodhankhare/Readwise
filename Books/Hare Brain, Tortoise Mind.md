## Highlights
- There is an old Polish saying, ‘Sleep faster; we need the pillows’, which reminds us that there are some activities which just will not be rushed. They take the time that they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. If the roast potatoes are slow to brown, you can turn up the oven. But if you try to speed up the baking of meringues, they burn. If you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speed; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up – we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. ‘Think fast; we need the results’ may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night’s rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of different ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. ‘He who hesitates is lost’, says one proverb. ‘Look before you leap’, says another. And both are true. Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motor-bike skidded on a wet manhole cover in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat – and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of ‘intelligence’ that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast, physical intelligence could be called our ‘wits’. (The five senses were originally known as ‘the five wits’.) Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a family arguing over the brochures about where to go for next summer’s holiday, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an examination question: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence ‘intellect’ – though to make the idea more precise, I shall call it d-mode, where the ‘d’ stands for ‘deliberation’. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call ‘bright’ or ‘clever’. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=286))

- But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. We may be pondering a problem, rather than earnestly trying to solve it, or just idly watching the world go by. What is going on in the mind may be quite fragmentary. What we are thinking may not make sense. We may even not be aware of much at all. As the English yokel is reported to have said: ‘sometimes I sits and thinks, but mostly I just sits’. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. These leisurely, apparently aimless, ways of knowing and experiencing are just as ‘intelligent’ as the other, faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part of the cognitive armamentarium. We need the tortoise mind just as much as we need the hare brain. Some kinds of everyday predicament are better, more effectively approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be penetrated with a relaxed, unquesting mental attitude. Some kinds of understanding simply refuse to come when they are called. As the Too Te Ching puts it: Truth waits for eyes unclouded by longing. Those who are bound by desire see only the outward container. Recent scientific evidence shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined. Deliberate thinking, d-mode, works well when the problem it is facing is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are: how much we can afford, when we can get away, what kinds of things we enjoy doing, and so on. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose – or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought – we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is not whether to go to Turkey or Greece, but how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit quietly and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This third type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even ‘wisdom’. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=308))

- The fact that language can handle only so much complexity is easy to demonstrate. Take the sentence The ecologist hated the accountant. This is trivially easy to understand. Now take The accountant the ecologist hated abused the waiter. This is still perfectly manageable. Add another (quite grammatical) embedded clause The waiter the accountant the ecologist hated abused loved the archbishop. Understanding begins to get slightly tenuous. And when we get to The archbishop the waiter the accountant the ecologist hated abused loved joined the conspiracy you have to work quite hard. You begin to need some kind of cognitive prosthesis, like a diagram, if you are to overcome the limitations of memory and understanding that are being revealed. Without the build-up, it would take some very deliberate unpacking to figure out who it was who abused whom. D-mode stretched to its limit becomes cumbersome and inept.

- Much of human intelligence, too, has little to do with d-mode. A baby is being intelligent when it smiles hopefully at its mother, or turns its head away from a looming object. A teenager is being intelligent when learning to get along in school by blending into the background, or deploying a disarming humour. A poet is being intelligent when considering a variety of candidates for the mot juste. And though a mathematician is also being intelligent as she tries to work out the solution to a complex problem, her finely honed intellectual ability is just one variety of intelligence, and a rather peculiar and arcane one at that. Intelligence may be associated with words, logical argument, explicit trains of thought or articulate explanation, but it may equally well not be. Fundamentally, intelligence helps animals, including human beings, to survive. The most basic of these strategies, common to all levels of life from amoebas to archbishops, is the bred-in-the-bone tendency to approach and maintain conditions which favour survival, and to avoid or escape from conditions which are aversive. The former conditions we call ‘needs’; the latter ‘threats’. Evolution has equipped every animal with a repertoire, large or small, of ways to minimise the risk of damage and enhance its wellbeing.

- So the next stage in the evolution of intelligence is learning. Gathering knowledge and developing expertise are survival strategies. In unfamiliar situations, animals are at risk. They are unable to predict and control what is going on. Potential sources of succour may go unrecognised. Actual threats may not be perceived until it is too late. Uncertainty may always conceal danger. The ability to reduce uncertainty, to convert strangeness into known-ness, therefore offers a powerful evolutionary advantage. All the different ways of learning and knowing which human beings possess, however sophisticated, spring ultimately from this biological imperative. Crudely, we might say that ‘knowing’ is a state in which useful patterns in the world have been registered, and can be used to guide future action. ‘Learning’ is the activity whereby these patterns are detected. And, at this level, ‘intelligence’ refers to the resources that make learning, and therefore knowing, possible. This ability to detect, register and make use of the patterns of relationships that happen to characterise your particular environment is widespread in the animal world.

- Past mistakes can be avoided and new mistakes made, until, with luck, an effective way of dealing with ‘this type of thing’ – a big dog, a puncture, an angry face, a new teacher – emerges and confidence is restored. Coming to know the world in this way, to register its patterns and to develop and coordinate skilful responses, is what a sophisticated nervous system – what I shall call a ‘brain-mind’ – does. It is built to tune itself to certain wavebands of information, and to coordinate these with its own expanding range of capabilities. After plasticity, the next great development in the evolution of knowing is curiosity. Instead of learning simply by reacting to uncertainty, animals became proactive – inquisitive, adventurous, playful. When no more urgent need is occupying your attention, it pays to extend your knowledge, and hence your competence and your security, by going out and actively exploring. So useful is this that evolution has installed it in many species as one of their basic drives. Rats who are allowed to become thoroughly familiar with a maze will quickly explore a new section that is added to it, even though they are being consistently and adequately fed elsewhere. Monkeys kept in a box will repeatedly push open a heavy door to see what is going on outside, and will spend hours fiddling with mechanical puzzles even though they receive no reward for doing so. Human beings who have volunteered to take part in a ‘sensory deprivation’ experiment, in which all they have to do, to earn forty dollars a day, is to stay in a room with no stimulation, rapidly become desperate for something – anything – to feed their minds, and will repeatedly press a button to hear a voice reading out-of-date stock market quotations.6 Being receptive, attentive and experimental, seeking to expand competence and reduce uncertainty, are the design functions of a plastic and enquiring brain-mind. No added encouragement or discipline – no conscious intention, no effort, no deliberation, no articulation – is needed to fulfil this brilliant function. The original design specification of learning does not include the production of conscious rationales. Knowing, at root, is implicit, practical, intuitive. The brain discovers patterns and tunes responses, it is programmed by experience, but this programming is recorded in millions of minute functional changes in the neurons, and manifested in the way the whole organism behaves. Given the evolutionary priority of this unconscious intelligence – the primacy of know-how over knowledge – what would we expect the main differences between unconscious and conscious ways of knowing to be?7 First, we might expect the unconscious to be more robust and resilient, more resistant to disruption, than our conscious abilities. This is exactly what neurological studies of brain damage reveal. When memory, perception or the control of action are degraded, it is the conscious aspects that tend to be lost first, while abilities… ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=629))

- Broadbent and Berry’s laboratory results are by no means unfamiliar in everyday life. Sportspeople and musicians develop high levels of expertise which they are often hard put to analyse or explain. Teachers come to be able to make on-the-spot decisions about how to present a topic or manage a classroom situation, yet may be quite unable to justify their actions to an inquisitive student.

- Other aspects of this ‘implicit learning’ have been investigated experimentally by Pawel Lewicki and his colleagues at the University of Tulsa in the United States.12 Though some of their long series of experiments arc rather stylised, they are very illuminating. Like the British researchers, they explored kinds of learning in which people can get better at doing a particular job by picking up subtle patterns embedded in hundreds of examples, but the experimental designs are rather different. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=723))

- The evidence from these studies is clear: we are able unconsciously to detect, learn and use intricate patterns of information which deliberate conscious scrutiny cannot even see, under favourable conditions, let alone register and recall. The complexity of Lewicki’s patterns (like my impossible-to-understand sentences in the last chapter) was just too great for d-mode to deal with. But when the hare of conscious comprehension ran out of ideas, tortoise mind just kept going. Simply by attending and responding to the situation, without thinking about it, people are able to extract complex patterns of useful information. Of course there are limits to the powers of observation and detection even of the unconscious brain-mind. There must be a great deal of potentially valuable information in the world that is too faint or subtle even for the undermind to detect. But we might, en passant, wonder at the wisdom of a society which ignores these unconscious powers, or treats them as ephemera; and of an education system that persists in privileging just one form of conscious, intellectual intelligence over all others. Mention of education should remind us that even intellectual understanding itself often benefits from this gradual, soaking-it-up-through-the-pores approach. Really ‘getting your brain round’ a topic seems to depend at least as much on the slower processes of ‘mulling over’ and ‘cogitating’ as it does on being mentally busy. Yet many educators seem to be under the impression that people can (and should) master a body of knowledge entirely through d-mode, via intentional study and ‘hard work’. One of the ‘fathers’ of research on unconscious learning, Arthur Reber of Brooklyn College in New York, described in a recent overview of the field how it was that he first came to be interested in it. I was drawn to the problem of implicit learning simply because that has always been, for me, the most natural way to get a grip on a complex problem. I just never felt comfortable with the overt, sequential struggles that characterised so much of standard learning . . . As a result of this stance I was not a particularly good ‘standard’ student . . . I found that what seemed for me to be the most satisfactory of ‘learnings’ were those that took place through what we used to call ‘osmosis’, that is, one simply steeped oneself in the material, often in an uncontrolled fashion, and allowed understanding to emerge magically over time. The kind of knowledge that seemed to result was often not easily articulated; and most interesting, the process itself seemed to occur in the absence of the effort to learn what was in fact learned.13 (Emphasis added) The studies by Broadbent and Berry, Lewicki and others have made it very clear what learning by osmosis is, what its value is, and the conditions it needs to operate. It extracts significant patterns, contingencies and relationships that are distributed across a diversity of situations in both time and space. It… ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=757))

- Adults, like myself, were prone to become rather frustrated – even infuriated – with ‘the stupid cube’, and to feel embarrassed and inadequate in the face of the apparent ease with which children – even not very ‘bright’ children – seemed able to master it.1 We could not understand how to do it, and after toying with it for a while, we would give it back to its small owner, as if it were too trivial to be worth bothering with, and find something with which to repair the small dent to our self-esteem. The trouble was that we grown-ups went immediately into d-mode, trying to figure it out, and, in the case of the Rubik cube, this was not the right mode to be in. It is just too complicated for that. As with Lewicki’s patterns, or the incomprehensible sentences, the powers of logic and memory needed were beyond our normal range. What was required, if one was to master the cube, was a gradual build-up of the ability to see various recurrent patterns, and to adjust one’s moves accordingly: to sharpen our wits through the non-intellectual process of observing and experimenting that we have just discussed. And this is just the kind of ‘knowing’ that my twelve-year-old scientist’s ‘messing about’ was good at delivering. She had not yet lost the knack of this casual, apparently incidental, way of learning; nor did she seem to mind if she could not articulate its results. I, a long-time d-mode addict, had, and did. What is the relationship between implicit know-how – the practical intelligence that enables us to function well in the world – on the one hand, and the explicit, articulated understanding that d-mode delivers on the other? It is widely assumed, in education and elsewhere, that conscious comprehension – being able to articulate and explain – is of universal benefit. To understand how and why to do something ought to help us to do it. But does it? In the case of the adults’ response to the Rubik cube, it seems as if there is an acquired need to understand which may actually block the use of our non-intellectual ways of knowing. We have forgotten them, or do not ‘believe’ in them any more. There is now good evidence that this suspicion is well founded.

- The ‘stupid cube’ effect appeared in Broadbent and Berry’s studies. Not only does people’s intuitive ability to control the factory output develop much faster than their ability to explain what they were doing; their confidence in their ability tends to follow their explicit knowledge, rather than their know-how. Unless they are able to explain what they are doing, they tend to underestimate quite severely how well they are doing it. People feel as if they are merely guessing, even when they are in fact doing well, and, if they had felt free to, many of the subjects would probably have withdrawn from the game, for fear of looking foolish. It is only because they would have felt even more foolish dropping out that they persevered with the task, despite their lack of confidence – and actually gave their unconscious learning a chance to reveal itself. The subjects have learnt to put their faith in d-mode as the indicator of how much they know, and therefore to distrust, at least initially, perfectly effective knowledge that has not (yet) crystallised into a conscious explanation. You would at least imagine that there would be a positive link between the two kinds of knowledge, implicit and explicit: that people’s sense of having a conscious handle on what they are up to should correlate with how well they are in fact doing. After all, we expect airline pilots and medical students to take written examinations, as well as practical ones, so we must assume that the verbal tests of knowledge and understanding are assessing something relevant. Unfortunately, this does not always seem to be the case. In several investigations of the Broadbent and Berry type, people’s ability to articulate the rules which they think are underlying their decisions turns out to be negatively related to their actual competence.2 People who are better at controlling the situation are actually worse at talking about what they are doing. And conversely, in some situations it appears that the more you think you know what you are doing, the less well you are in fact doing. You can either be a pundit or you can be a practitioner, it appears; not always can you become both by the same means. The situations where this dislocation between expertise and explanation appears most strongly are those that are novel, complicated and to some extent counterintuitive; where the relevant patterns you need to discover are different from what ‘common sense’ – the ‘reasonable assumptions’ on which d-mode rests – might predict.3 In situations where a small number of factors interact in a predictable fashion, and where these interactions are in line with what seems ‘plausible’ or ‘obvious’, then d-mode does the job, and trying to figure out what is going on can successfully short-circuit the more protracted business of ‘messing about’. But where these conditions are not met, then d-mode gets in the way. It is not the right tool for the job, and if d-mode is persistently misused, the job cannot be… ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=827))

- Student: 3, 5, 7? Wason: Yes (that meets the rule). S: 10, 12, 14? W: Yes. S: 97, 99, 101? W: Yes. S: OK, the rule is obviously n, n+2, n+4. W: No it isn’t. S: (very disconcerted) Oh. But it must be! The problem is that the students thought the rule was obvious from the start, and were making up numbers only with the intention of confirming what they thought they already knew. If their assumption had been correct, their way of tackling the problem would have been logical and economical. But when what is plausible is not what is actually there, those operating in this manner are in for a nasty shock. In fact, Wason’s rule is much more general: it is ‘any three ascending numbers’. So ‘2, 4, 183’ would have been a much more informative combination to try – even though, to someone who thinks they know the rule, it looks ‘silly’. When d-mode is disconcerted like this, it often responds by trying all the harder. Instead of flipping into a more playful or lateral mode, in which silly suggestions may reveal some interesting information, people start to devise more and more baroque solutions. ‘Ah ha,’ they may think, ‘maybe the rule is the middle number has to be halfway between the first and the third. So let’s try 2, 5, 8 and 10, 15, 20.’ When Wason agrees that these too conform to the rule, they heave a sigh of relief – only to be flummoxed once again when they announce the rule and are told it is incorrect. Or, even more ingeniously, they may cling to the original hypothesis – which they have clearly been told is not the solution – by rephrasing it. So they might say, ‘OK, it’s not n, n+2, n+4, but perhaps it is take one number, add four to it to make the third number, and then add the first and third together and divide by two to get the middle number’ – which… ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=856))

- The corollary of these results is that, when people find themselves in situations where learning by osmosis is what is called for, then they ought to learn better if they have given up trying to make conscious sense of it. If you have abandoned d-mode, it cannot get in the way. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=899))

- The only effective strategy is to try to observe what is happening with as few preconceptions as possible. Thus subjects should do better on the illogical task if they have somehow been persuaded to give up d-mode before they start. Conversely, if they have abandoned d-mode they should do worse on the logical version. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=912))

- If the main task is actually the illogical one, this puts you at an advantage. Your learning-by-osmosis is unimpeded by the intellect. But if the main task is one which is amenable to being figured out, then you are disadvantaged if you have abandoned d-mode. Whether to back the hare or the tortoise depends crucially on the nature of the situation. If it is complex, unfamiliar, or behaves unexpectedly, tortoise mind is the better bet. If it is a nice logical puzzle, try the hare brain first. There are indeed many cases in which d-mode is the right tool, and in which the hare clearly comes out the winner.

- So in order to learn the patterns in the experiment, they were required to go against their normal assumptions. What effect did this have, Lewicki asked, either on the speed with which the subjects learnt the experimental pattern, or on the strength of their pre-existing rules of thumb? Should the mismatch not slow down the new learning, and/or cause some shifting in what is known consciously? You would think so – if you make the commonsense assumption that people’s self-knowledge is an accurate reflection of the way they go about things. In fact, Lewicki found that the subjects’ pre-existing conscious beliefs a) had no effect on the speed or efficiency with which the contrary associations were learnt through experience; and b) were themselves unaffected by the unconscious learning that had taken place. The undermind is acquiring knowledge of which consciousness is unaware, and by which it is unchanged, and using it to influence the way people behave. Consequently a schism develops between what people think they know ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=960))

- (about themselves), and the information that is unconsciously driving their perceptions and reactions. The views that they espouse about themselves, we might say, become at odds with the ones that their behaviour in fact embodies. This small experiment thus furnishes us with a neat illustration of the kind of ‘split personality’ phenomenon with which we are all familiar, but which it is often convenient to ignore: the existence in the mind of a second centre of operations which is capable of going its own way, untroubled by what conscious ‘headquarters’ happens to be saying. And consciousness itself can remain unruffled by the discrepancy, by the simple expedient of not noticing that it exists. At the end of a review of his experiments, Pawel Lewicki concludes that ‘our non-conscious information processing system appears to be faster and “smarter” overall than our ability to think and identify meanings . . . in a consciously controlled manner. Most of the “real work” [of the mind] is being done at a level to which our consciousness has no access.’6 This, from the hard-nosed world of cognitive science, is an extraordinary conclusion. Yet it is what these carefully controlled experiments reveal. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=967))

- The studies we have reviewed so far demonstrate that the urge to be articulate is a mixed blessing when it comes to learning. But there are other areas of life where the same might be said. What about the execution of a skill that is already well learnt, for example? Does it make any difference to one’s expertise whether one is able to put what one knows into words, or not? In a paper entitled ‘Knowledge, knerves and know-how’, R. S. Masters of the University of York has shown that people who can articulate what they are doing may go to pieces under pressure more than those whose skill in entirely intuitive.7 He studied people who were learning to play golf, focusing particularly on their putting skill. One group of learners was taught how to putt ‘explicitly’ – they were given a set of very specific instructions which they were asked to follow as carefully as they could. Another group was given no instructions – they simply practised – and they were even asked to occupy their minds with an irrelevant task to prevent them thinking about their putting as they were doing it. After their training, both groups were tested on their putting ability by an imposing ‘golfing expert’ whom they had not met before; and there were also significant financial rewards and penalties depending on how well they did. Both the ‘expert’ and the money were designed to make the test stressful. Masters discovered that the performance of those who had learnt intuitively held up much better than that of those who had been following instructions. His explanation was that the breakdown of performance under pressure – what sportspeople refer to as ‘choking’, or ‘the yips’ – was due to the instructed group flipping back into d-mode and trying to remember and follow instructions, rather than just play… ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=977))

- Our know-how is in general of this ad hoc, smart, opportunistic kind. The know-how regions of our minds are organised less like the Library of Congress than a well-used kitchen: logic continually gives way to convenience. I do not have to make my kitchen so rational that anyone could come in and figure out where the Tabasco sauce is from first principles. If I did have such a logical layout, I would not be so well set up to cook the kinds of things that I like to cook, and habitually do. Know-how is, as I say, formatted differently to knowledge in that it grows by osmosis (rather than comprehension); manifests itself in specific domains of expertise (rather than in abstractions); capitalises on serendipity (rather than first principles); and is organised idiosyncratically (rather than systematically). No wonder that the ways of knowing that use and create it are very different in their time characteristics from d-mode. Western -culture’s over-reliance on d-mode reflects a lack of appreciation of these vital differences between knowledge and knowhow. We tend, as a society, to make what was originally only an academic error: what Pierre Bourdieu refers to as the scholastic fallacy. ‘This fallacy . . . induces people to think that agents involved in action, in practice, in life, think, know and see as someone who has the leisure to think thinks, knows and sees.’9 By assuming that knowledge is similar to know-how, we are led to suppose that knowhow can – even should – be acquired through knowledge, and that knowledge, once acquired, ought to transform itself automatically into know-how. Managers are sent on a five-day course on ‘leadership’, and are immediately supposed to come into work the following Monday and start leading. The frustration with, and frequent cynicism about, such short courses, in the business world and elsewhere, is not due to lack of commitment on the part of participants, nor of skill on the part of the trainer. It reflects a deep confusion about the nature of learning and knowing. The confusion makes us promote ‘book learning’ and formal education (and training) as the proper medium for acquiring everything. Adults pore over the instruction manual for a new computer, afraid to plug it in until they know how it works and what to do, while their children have already discovered, just by ‘messing about’, how to make it do the most complicated tricks. Apprentice midwives used to learn their craft by assisting their more experienced mentors at hundreds of births. Now they have to have a degree. There are even those who argue that couples should have to attend a series of seminars on ‘parenting skills’ before they are allowed to have a baby. The tragedy is that now there may even be some sense to this. If the other ways of knowing have been effectively disabled by the belief that intellect is the only mode we have, or the only mode we need, then the belief becomes the reality. D-mode does then provide the only avenue open to us for… ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1020))

- D-mode is like map-reading: with a map we are able to get our bearings, and see how one area relates geographically to another. But maps must be simpler and more static than the world they represent; and they contain conventions that aid the interpretation of the map, but which are not ‘real’. As we climb the mountain, we do not periodically have to step over the contour lines. As we cross from England to Wales, the terrain does not change from pink to blue. It is not the case that we cannot go where there is no track, nor, certainly, that the motorway is always the best route. When the map is good enough, and we understand the status of the conventions, then d-mode works well. When we forget, as Alfred Korz-ybski11 insisted, that ‘the map is not the territory’, or when we need, to resolve a predicament, a finer-grain, more subtle or more holistic image than language provides – it is then that we need recourse to our other, slower ways of knowing. Some predicaments cannot be dealt with effectively with the tools of analysis and reason. And there are some, too, that will not succumb to an increase in expertise, such as learning by osmosis delivers. To deal with such problems, we need access to those slow ways of knowing we have preliminarily called rumination or contemplation; mental modes which deliver, it is claimed, forms of creativity and intuition.

- In Spencer’s opinion ‘a solution reached in the way described is more likely to be true than one reached in pursuance of a determined effort to find a solution. The determined effort causes perversion of thought. . . An effort to arrive forthwith at some answer to a problem acts as a distorting factor in consciousness and causes error, [whereas] a quiet contemplation of the problem from time to time allows those proclivities of thought which have probably been caused unawares by experience, to make themselves felt, and to guide the mind to the right conclusion.’ (Emphasis added)1 The ways of knowing with which both Pooh Bear and Herbert Spencer are familiar are different from d-mode in a number of ways.

- therefore they require patience: a relaxed, unhurried, unanxious approach to problems. In this they resemble ‘learning by osmosis’, but they are not the same. In learning by osmosis, the undermind gradually uncovers patterns that are embedded in, or distributed across, a wide variety of experiences. Know-how is distilled from the residue of hundreds of specific instances and events. But while Spencer’s insights into the organisation of society undoubtedly drew on much prior thought and observation, the process that he is referring to is one that goes beyond this unconscious distillation. This process seems to reflect not the acquisition of new information so much as the mind’s ability to discover, over time, new patterns or meanings within the information which it already possesses, and to register these consciously as insight or intuition. Though experience provides the data, the process is not acquisitive but ruminative. Pooh’s song that prompted Rabbit’s question demonstrates the same process on a smaller scale. He was not announcing the inductive discovery of a new generalisation, but simply producing something which came ‘out of the blue’. Despite the widely-held assumption that d-mode represents the most powerful thinking tool we possess – which makes it the one we call upon, or revert to, in the face of urgent demands for solutions – the truth is that our ideas, and often our best, most ingenious ideas, do not arrive as the result of faultless chains of reasoning. They ‘occur to us’. They ‘pop into our heads’. They come out of the blue.

- largely by intuition. We don’t usually offer a detailed rationale for our restaurant preference: we say ‘I feel like Thai’. We happily allow ourselves to be nudged by feelings and impulses that do not come with an explicit justification. Yet when we are put ‘on the spot’ in a meeting, or are faced with an urgent ‘problem’ that demands ‘solution’, we may act as if these promptings were weak, unreliable or negligible. We feel as if intuition will not stand up to scrutiny, and will not bear much weight. There is now a body of research which shows that intuition is more valuable and more trustworthy than we think; and that we disdain it, when we are ‘on duty’, to our practical detriment. We need a more accurate understanding of the nature and status of intuition: one which neither under nor overvalues it. Those who disparage intuition are reacting, often unwittingly, against the presumption that intuition constitutes a form of knowledge that is ‘higher’ than mere reason, or even infallible. The dictionary definitions still carry some of that inflated view, and by doing so they create expectations that are patently false.

- Intuitions can be wrong, but that does not mean they are worthless. Intuitions are properly seen as ‘good guesses’; hunches or hypotheses thrown up by the undermind which deserve serious, but not uncritical, attention. They offer an overall ‘take’ on a situation that manifests not – not yet – as a reasoned analysis, but as an inkling or an image. Behind the scenes, the undermind may have integrated into this tangible prompt a host of different considerations, including analogies to past experience and aspects of the present situation, of which the conscious mind may not have even been aware. And this integration can happen, as the dictionary definitions say, ‘immediately’, or it may take time – even, as in Spencer’s case, up to years. But the result, when it does ‘pop up’, is always provisional.

- Fast intuitions – ‘snap judgements’ and quick reactions – are vital responses for the human being, just as they are for animals. When the present event is a variation on a familiar theme, it pays to be able to classify it and react in habitual fashion. To spend time pondering on insignificant details is sometimes wasteful, or even dangerous. No need to inspect the number plate of the bus as it bears down upon you. But these reflexes work to our detriment when a new situation looks similar to ones we have experienced in the past, but is actually different. Then the balance of priorities shifts, and it is now the quick, stereotyped response that is the risky one, while more leisurely scrutiny can pay dividends. The importance of this shift from fast to slow thinking was graphically demonstrated in the laboratory by Abraham and Edith Luchins as long ago as the 1950s. They set people puzzles of the following sort. ‘Imagine that you are standing beside a lake, and that you are given three empty jars of different sizes. The first jar holds 17 pints of water; the second holds 37 pints; and the third holds 6 pints. Your job is to see whether, using these three jars, you can measure out exactly 8 pints.’ After some thought (which may, to start with, be quite logical), most people are able to end up with 8 pints in the largest jar. Then they are set another problem of the same type, except this time the jars hold respectively 31, 61 and 4 pints, and the target is to get 22 pints. And then another, with jars holding 10, 39 and 4 pints where the target is 21 pints. (You may like to try to solve these puzzles before consulting the notes for the solutions.)3 You will find that the same strategy will work for all three problems. But now comes the critical shift. You are next given jars of capacity 23, 49 and 3 pints, and asked to make 20 pints. If you have stopped thinking, and are now applying your new-found rule mindlessly, you will solve the problem – but you will not spot that there is now a much simpler solution. The problem looks the same, but this particular one admits of two solutions, one of which is more elegant and economical than the other. We can easily imagine a business company – or any other kind of organisation – falling into the same trap. They may ‘think they are thinking’ about each problem as it comes along; but if they are unable to think freshly,… ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1205))

Many people reported that they made up their minds quickly about the answer, and then spent the enforced interval thinking about all kinds of unrelated things – ‘making plans for Saturday night’s party’, ‘thinking about letters I had to write’, ‘counting the holes in the tiles on the ceiling’, and so on – and for them, the extra time obviously did nothing to improve their creativity. What was more interesting, however, was the mental activity of the subjects who did find the new solution. They were not earnestly figuring out the answers, or making calculations on bits of scrap paper. They were actually musing in a much more general way on what type of questions were being asked, and what the experimenter was up to.

- Fast intuitions depend on the undermind taking a quick look at the situation and finding an analogy which seems to offer understanding and prediction. These unconscious analogies surface as intuitions. Whether they are right or not depends not on how ‘intuitive’ they are, but on the appropriateness of the underlying analogy. Often we are absolutely right. But sometimes the undermind is fooled by appearances, and then it leads us off in the wrong direction.

- Intuitions can also go wrong when they are based on inaccurate judgements about what is relevant and what is not, as we saw earlier with the ‘mutilated chessboard’. Here is another example. A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller one, about 15. As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys and 50% girls. The exact percentage of girls however naturally varies from day to day. Some days it may be over the 50%; some days under. As a check on this variation, for a period of one year, both of the hospitals recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were girls. Over the year, which hospital do you think recorded more such days? The large one? The small one? Or about the same? When psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky asked nearly a hundred people this question, 22 per cent said the larger; 22 per cent said the smaller; and 56 per cent said ‘about the same’.9 Nobody sat down and worked it out with a calculator, so we must suppose that all these were intuitions. But more than three-quarters of them were wrong. (I was one of those who said ‘about the same’.) A moment’s reflection should be enough, ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1289))

- however, to convince you – as it did me – that the correct answer is ‘the small one’. The smaller the sample, the easier it is to get a larger percentage skew by chance. (It only takes two ‘boys’ to turn out to be girls for the small hospital to exceed its 60 per cent point.) A relevant piece of information – the size of the hospital – is actually being tacitly disregarded by half the population when they are generating their intuitive response (even though they are perfectly able to see its relevance when it is pointed out). These ‘fast intuitions’ are susceptible to all kinds of invisible influences, some of which will be appropriate and beneficial, and others of which will, in a particular instance, be misleading. If fast intuition is vulnerable when responding to predicaments that look familiar but which are not as they seem, in what circumstances are the slower ways of knowing of most value? As with learning by osmosis, it turns out that slow intuition is good at uncovering non-obvious relationships between areas of knowledge; at seeing ‘the pattern that connects’ experiences that are superficially disparate. Intuition proves its worth in any situation that is shadowy, intricate or ill defined – regardless of whether the focus of concern is a mid-life crisis, a knotted-up relationship, an artistic project or a scientific conundrum.

But at other times, even for scientists, the undermind speaks in a variety of different voices.

Kekuté first discovered that the carbon atoms of the benzene molecule linked up into a ring through watching the flames of his fire transform themselves, in his mind’s eye, into snakes that turned round and bit their own tails.

Certain individuals . . . in some undefinable way, can put together something which has a certain style, or a certain class, to it. A certain rightness to it.’ For others intuition manifests itself as a vague but trustworthy feeling of direction or evaluation – one ‘just knows’ which of several lines of enquiry to pursue, or which of a range of experimental results to take seriously, and which to ignore.

Some of the puzzles were accompanied by helpful ‘clues’ (such as ‘precise’ for the second example above), or unhelpful ones (such as ‘beside’ for the first one). Those problems that the subjects failed to solve the first time round were re-presented for a second try either immediately, or after a delay of five or fifteen minutes. When they had a second go immediately, subjects showed no improvement over their initial score. But when they were retested after a delay, performance improved by 30 per cent on the puzzles that had been accompanied by the unhelpful clues; and the longer (fifteen-minute) delay produced greater improvement than the shorter (five-minute) one. Significantly, the improvement did not depend on whether subjects had been able to work consciously on the problems during the delay, or ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1410))

- be forgotten, so that when you come back to the task, you do so with a more open mind. There is a tendency to get fixated on a particular approach, even when it is patently not working. The delay increases the chances that your mind will stop barking up the wrong tree. ‘When the thinker makes a false start, he slides insensibly into a groove and may not be able to escape at the moment. The incubation period allows time for an erroneous set to die out and leave the thinker free to take a fresh look at the problem.’16 The idea that delay encourages a release from fixation, that it enables you to shake off unpromising approaches or assumptions that have been blocking progress, is certainly one aspect of incubation, but it cannot be the whole story, for it fails to take into account the active workings of unconscious intelligence. The fact that we can tell with a fair degree of accuracy when we are in the TOT state, whether we would be able to recognise the name if it were shown to us, and even, sometimes, retrieve its initial letter, or some other characteristic such as the number of syllables, suggests that the undermind has an idea what the word is, but for some reason is not yet willing or able to release that… ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1428))

- used these words, along with other new words, in a ‘lexical decision task’, in which strings of letters were flashed on to a computer screen, and subjects had to press one of two keys to indicate, as quickly as they could, whether the string was a real word or not. It has been shown previously that words which have recently been seen, prior to the test, are recognised as being real words faster than other words which are equally familiar but which have not been recently ‘activated’ in memory. Yaniv and Meyer found that, even though the TOT words had not been consciously recalled, they still showed this ‘priming’ effect, indicating that they had been activated in memory, despite the fact that the ‘strength’ of the activation had not been great enough to exceed the threshold required for consciousness.17 One of the effects of this partial activation is to increase the likelihood that some chance event may provide the extra little ‘nudge’ that is needed to get the word to tip over the threshold into consciousness – and this provides another way in which incubation can come about. Consciously you may think that you have made no progress towards the solution of the problem, and may even feel that you have given up.

In such situations, we can show that we know more than we think we know. Does the same apply to the kinds of problem-solving that we are looking at in this chapter?

- There are a number of metaphors that creators use to describe their process, but none more common than that of gestation. ‘Having’ a good idea is akin, they say, to having a baby. It is something that needs a seed to get started. It needs a ‘womb’ to grow in that is safe and nurturing, and which is inaccessible. The progenitor is a host, providing the conditions for growth, but is not the manufacturer. You ‘have’ a baby, you do not ‘make’ it – and so with insight and inspiration. Gestation has its own timetable: psychologically, as biologically, it is the process par excellence that cannot be hurried. And it cannot be controlled; once the process has been set in motion it happens by itself, and will, barring any major accident or intervention, carry through to fruition. It is not just romantics who see the mind this way. Even the arch-behaviourist B. F. Skinner once gave a lecture at the Poetry Center in New York which he entitled ‘On “Having” a Poem’, and which he started by explaining that his talk had the curious property of illustrating itself, in that he was at that moment in the throes of ‘having’ a lecture.1 And he went on to develop the metaphor in more detail. ‘When we say that a woman “bears” a child, we suggest little by way of creative achievement. The verb refers to carrying the foetus to term.’ And then, after she has ‘given’ birth to the child – as if birth were some kind of property or gift that can be bestowed – we tend to say merely that she has ‘had’ a baby, where ‘had’ can seem to mean little more than ‘came into possession of’. What precisely is the nature of the mother’s contribution? She does not decide upon the colour of the baby’s eyes or skin.

The poet is also a locus, a place in which certain genetic and environmental causes come together.’ And, as we have seen, what is true of the poet can be equally true of the scientist, the novelist, the sculptor or the product designer. The analogy reminds us that, although the process of creativity is essentially organic rather than mechanical, nevertheless the nature of the ‘incubator’ is vital to the germination of the seed. The mother does not engineer her child’s intrauterine development, but she influences it enormously through her lifestyle and her sensitivity, her anxieties, appetites and attitudes, her history and her constitution. Who she is, and the physical and emotional environment that she herself inhabits, affects the nature and the quality of the sanctum that she provides for the growing form of life within her. And so it seems to be with intuition: there are conditions which render the mental womb more or less hospitable to the growth and birth of ideas; and differing ways in which, and extents to which, different people are able, wittingly or unwittingly, to provide those conducive conditions. The more clearly we can identify what these conditions are, the more… ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1564))

I think that my own case, though I may not deal with the material so cleverly as the oyster does, is the latter.’2 For scientists, the stimulus is often an unexplained detail or incongruity. The imaginative seed that finally flowered in the theory of relativity was the teenage Einstein’s attempt to imagine what it would be like to ride on a beam of light. While making a routine check through three miles of computer print-out from the radio telescope, a young Cambridge astrophysicist spotted just a few traces that puzzled her. They could easily have been ignored, or written off as noise. But, with a lot of subsequent hard work, this observation finally resulted in the discovery of a completely new type of star.

In the preface to his story ‘The Spoils of Poynton’, Henry James explains how essential such details are. One Christmas Eve he was dining with friends when the lady beside him made, as he puts it, ‘one of those allusions that I have always found myself recognising on the spot as “germs” . . . Most of the stories straining to shape under my hand have sprung from [such] a . . . precious particle.

Even if the issue is an intellectual rather than an artistic one, its recognition is personal, affective, and even aesthetic (such as Nobel laureate Paul Berg talking about how important, in his work, was the sense of ‘taste’ for a problem or an approach).

We talked very little, odds and ends of neighbourhood gossip, until the old man, shifting his position, drew a long breath and said, ‘Seems to me I never heard the brook sound so loud as it has this spring.’ There came instantly to my mind the recollection that his grandfather had drowned himself in that brook, and I sat silent, shaken by that thought and by the sound of his voice . . . I felt my own heart contract dreadfully with helpless sympathy . . . and, I hope this is not as ugly as it sounds, I knew at the same instant that I would try to get that pang of emotion into a story and make other people feel it.5 Stephen Spender said that his experience of inspiration was that of a ‘line or a phrase or a word or sometimes something still vague, a dim cloud of an idea which I feel must be condensed into a shower of words’. So the seed will not germinate unless it makes contact with a ‘body of knowledge’ of the right kind, in a congenial state. But what exactly is the ‘right’ kind?

Recall the experiments with the water jars, and the fact that people quite quickly became ‘set in their ways’.

- Seeing through an existing, invisible assumption, which is often the key to creativity, requires a mind that is informed but not deformed; channelled but not rutted.7 Intuition, as we have seen, tends to work best in situations that are complex or unclear, in which the information that is given may be sketchy or incomplete, and in which progress can only be made by those who can, in Jerome Bruner’s famous phrase, ‘go beyond the information given’, and are able to draw upon their own knowledge in order to develop fruitful hunches and hypotheses. Both novelist and scientist may well need to go out and collect more ‘data’, but the creative idea comes from bringing into maximum contact the ‘problem specification’, the data, and one’s own store of experience and expertise; allowing these to resonate together as intimately and as flexibly as possible, so that the full range of meaning and possibility of both current data and past experience are extracted. The good intuitive is the person who is ready, willing and able to make a lot out of a little. If you insist on having high-quality information from impeccable sources before you are willing to form a judgement, you may reduce the occasions on which you are obviously ‘wrong’. You will make instead ‘errors of omission’ that are often less visible. By adopting such a conservative attitude, you may also fail to make use of the more tentative, holistic responses that are authorised by the unconscious. On the other hand, if you are indiscriminately intuitive, you are more ready to back hunches on the faintest of whims. The crucial question concerning intuition, therefore, is how to relate to conscious and unconscious in such a way that both kinds of mistake are minimised; so that you are open to the promptings of the undermind, willing to hear and acknowledge them, yet not overrespectful or lacking in discernment. Are people differentially willing to make judgements and decisions on the basis of inadequate (conscious) information? And if so, of those who are willing, are some better at it than others? Studies by Malcolm Westcott at Vassar College in America show that the answer to both these questions is a clear ‘yes’. Westcott gave his undergraduate subjects one example of a relationship that could hold between two words or two numbers, and their task was to show that they had discovered the rule or relationship by adding the correct ‘partner’ to another word or number. So they might be shown ‘2, 6’, and asked to complete the pair ‘10, ?’, or ‘mouse, rat’, and then ‘weekend, ?’. But subjects were also given other sealed clues, which they could ask to be revealed, one by one, before they were ready to give their answer. They were free to look at as many or as few of these other clues as they wished before responding. When the students gave their answers, they were also asked to rate how confident they were that they were in fact correct. Westcott was thus able to take three measures for each problem:… ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1622))

- that it was possible to identify four quite different sub-groups. There were those who typically required very little information before offering their solutions, and who were likely to be correct. These he called the ‘successful intuitives’. Then there were those who also took little extra information, but who tended to be wrong – the ‘wild guessers’. The third group required a lot of information before being willing to respond, but were generally successful when they did: the ‘cautious successes’. And finally there were those who made use of all the information they could lay their hands on, but who still made a lot of mistakes, the ‘cautious failures’. Westcott also gave various personality tests to his subjects, so that he was able to see what the characteristics of the successful intuitives (and of the other groups) were. He found that the good intuiters tend to be rather ‘introverted’; they like to keep out of the social limelight, but feel self-sufficient and trust their own judgement. They like to make up their own minds about things, and to resist being controlled by others. They tend to be unconventional, and comfortable in their unconventionality. In social gatherings they are ‘composed’, but are capable of feeling strongly, and showing their feelings in more intimate or solitary situations. They enjoy taking risks, and are willing to expose themselves to criticism and challenge. They can accept or reject criticism as necessary, and they are willing to change in ways they deem to be appropriate. They describe themselves as ‘independent’, ‘foresighted’, ‘confident’ and ‘spontaneous’. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1647))

- ‘They explore uncertainties and entertain doubts far more than the other groups do, and they live with these doubts and uncertainties without fear.’8 In contrast, the ‘wild guessers’ are much more socially orientated. But ‘their interactions are characterized by considerable strife, they seem to be quite self-absorbed, and their “affective investments” seem to be directed towards themselves’. These traits often manifest themselves as ‘a driven and anxious unconventionality, coupled with strong and rigid opinions, and overlaid with cynicism. . .’ They describe themselves as ‘alert’, ‘quick’, ‘headstrong’ and ‘cynical’. Westcott comments that these people ‘appear to be striving for a grasp of reality which so far eludes them, and they are likely to attempt different modes of attack [on uncertainty] in a somewhat chaotic manner’. The ‘cautious successes’ are distinguished by ‘a very strong preference for order, certainty and control’, and they have a high respect for authority. They are well-socialized, in the sense that their stated interests and values are in the mainstream of their culture, but they do not recognize that they have been influenced in this. Their desire for certainty and order seems to lead them to some social awkwardness and anxiety in the uncertain world of interpersonal relations. Affect is difficult for them to handle, unless it is very well structured, and they describe themselves as ‘cautious’, ‘kind’, ‘modest’ and ‘confident’. The overall picture of this group, according to Westcott, is ‘one of conservative, cautious, somewhat repressive people who function well in situations where expectations are well-established and well met’: d-mode types, we may assume. Finally, the ‘cautious failures’ have a view of the world ‘in which everything is risky at best, and they are essentially powerless to influence or control it. There is a broadly generalized passivity, a sensitivity to – and felt inability to deal with – injustice, and a wish for a quiet, certain status quo; through all of this they lack self-confidence . . . They are quite conservative, presumably as the best defence against the great uncertainties of life, and they seem to wander through life just managing to keep their heads above water, not making waves. They see themselves as “cautious”, “kind” and “modest”.’ Perhaps the most significant of all these interesting findings is… ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1659))

- absent or limited, or when the time necessary for explicit manipulation of data is not available. . . These are all conditions which remove the thinker from direct application of adult, socially validated logic.’9 American social scientist Donald Schon has recently argued that it is situations of just this sort that are routinely faced by professionals such as teachers and lawyers.10 Although there are bodies of helpful precedents and maxims, such people spend much of their time dealing with cases that are sufficiently unique, and sufficiently complex, to prevent the straightforward application of any rule-book. They are off the well-laid-out highways of ‘technical rationality’, trying to find their way through what Schon refers to as the ‘swampy lowlands’ of professional practice. Sometimes this resonating of data and experience – perception and cognition – happens quickly. Westcott’s puzzles are sufficiently simplified and stylised to allow intuition to work quite rapidly. Not much experience has to be brought to bear. No remote analogies or metaphors need to be found. No very subtle patterns connecting apparently disparate elements have to be uncovered. Very often, though, when the predicament is more intricate… ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1683))

- Someone who cannot abide uncertainty is therefore unable to provide the womb that creative intuition needs. Milton Rokeach, having, as we saw in Chapter 4, showed that creativity is enhanced when people are forced to slow down, concludes that ‘differences between people characterised as rigid, and others characterised as less rigid, may be attributable . . . to personality differences in time availability . . . Time availability [i.e. the willingness to think slowly] makes possible broader cognitions, more abstract thinking . . . and consequently greater flexibility.’ And he goes on to offer a plausible speculation as to how these differences may arise. ‘Some individuals, because of past experiences with frustrating situations involving delay of need satisfaction, become generally incapable of tolerating frustrating situations. To allay anxiety, such individuals learn to react relatively quickly to new problems . . . The inevitable consequence is behavioural rigidity.’11 Whether one is or is not a good intuiter therefore turns out to be a matter of cognitive habits or dispositions – but these are underpinned by emotional and personal characteristics that may be quite deep-seated. If one is threatened by the experience of ignorance, then one cannot dare to wait, and may, as a result, cling to a mode of cognition – d-mode – that is purposeful and busy, seeming to offer a sense of direction and control, which may be the wrong tool for the job in hand. There is a wealth of evidence to confirm the common impression that when people feel threatened, pressurised, judged or stressed, they tend to revert to ways of thinking that are more clear-cut, more tried and tested and more conventional: in a word, less creative. Studies with the Luchins’ water jars problem have shown that adherence to the over-complicated solution, when an easier one becomes available, is increased by stress. In an old study (which would certainly not be approved these days by an ethics committee), students were told that, on the basis of a previously administered questionnaire, there was evidence that they possessed some ‘maladapted personality features’, and that their performance on the water jars problem would clarify the situation. The more threatened the subjects felt, the more tenaciously they clung to the outdated solution, and the less likely they were to spot the new possibility… ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1695))

- creativity required is minimal, the exhortation to ‘hurry up’ is entirely counterproductive.13 The deleterious effect of time pressure on the quality of thinking is also shown in a study by Kruglansky and Freund. Students were given some personal data about a hypothetical applicant for a managerial job and asked to predict his likely success in the position. Half the students were given positive information followed by negative, and the other group were given the same information in the reverse order. Those students who received the positive information first gave significantly higher predictions of success than the others. And this tendency was exaggerated when the students were asked to make their judgements against the clock. What seems to happen is that we build up an intuitive picture of the situation as we go along, and it takes work to ‘dismantle’ this picture and start again. So if later information seems to be at odds with the picture so far, we may unconsciously decide to reinterpret the dissonant information, rather than radically reorganise the picture. And the more we feel under pressure, the less likely we are to make the investment of ‘starting from scratch’. This tenacity is a considerable pitfall for intuition, for when we are… ([Location 1718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1718))

- Just as mothers-to-be may become rather particular about the conditions in which their gestation, and eventually the birth, takes place – traditionally demanding special foods or comforts that may seem to others somewhat eccentric – so too do creators, according to their own testimony, sometimes develop personal rituals and requirements that establish the conditions which are felt to be safe and conducive to intuition.

- Efraim Fischbein from Tel Aviv University comments on the inertia of science in this regard, but the same principle applies to the informal, everyday mind just as well. A scientist who has formulated a certain hypothesis did not formulate it by chance; it optimally suits his general philosophy in the given domain, his usual way of interpretation, his knowledge and his research methodology. He is certainly very anxious to preserve his initial interpretation not only for his own prestige – which is certainly an important factor – but chiefly because it is the hypothesis which is best integrated in the structure of his reasoning. He will be unwilling to give up this first hypothesis because by renouncing it he has to re-evaluate a whole system of conceptions.17 Hence what has come to be referred to as ‘Planck’s dictum’, after the German physicist Max Planck: major advances in science occur not because the proponents of the established view are forced by the weight of evidence to change their minds, but because they retire and eventually die. It is not only the whole class of things that we refer to as ‘threats’ which militates against the relaxed and hospitable mood that encourages creativity: anything that simply makes you try too hard has the same effect.

- In the 1960s poet Ted Hughes gave a series of talks for young people on the radio about writing. In one of these, he described very beautifully this quality of gentle attentiveness to one’s own mind. At school . . . I became very interested in those thoughts of mine that I could never catch. Sometimes they were hardly what you could call a thought – they were a dim sort of a feeling about something . . . [and] for the most part they were useless to me because I could never get hold of them. Most people have the same trouble. What thoughts they have are fleeting thoughts – just a flash of it, then gone – or, though they know they know something, or have ideas about something, they just cannot dig those ideas up when they are wanted. Their minds, in fact, seem out of their reach . . . The thinking process by which we break into that inner life . . . is the kind of thinking we have to learn, and if we do not somehow learn it, our minds lie in us like fish in the pond of a man who cannot fish . . . Perhaps I ought not to call it thinking at all. I am talking about whatever kind of trick or skill it is that enables us to catch these elusive or shadowy thoughts, and collect them together, and hold them still so we can get a really good look at them.20 Hughes goes on to say that he is not very good at this kind of mental fishing, but that what skill he does have he acquired not at school, but through . . . fishing: literally coarse fishing, with a rod and a float. When you are spending hours gazing at the red or yellow dot in the water in front of you, all the normal little nagging impulses that are competing for your attention gradually dissolve away, and you are left with the whole field of your awareness resting lightly but very attentively on the float, and on the invisible, autonomous world of water things suspended below it, and moving – perhaps – towards the surface, and towards your lure. Your imagination and your perception are both working on and in the water world. Thus fishing is an exercise which cultivates the kind of relaxed-yet-attentive, perceptive-yet-imaginative mode of mind that fosters intuition; and at the same time it offers a metaphor for the way in which ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1795))

- As Emerson said in his essay on ‘Self-reliance’, talking of creativity: ‘A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within . . . In every word of genius we recognise our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.’21 Several studies show that there are large differences between how well people are able to access these states of reverie, and that these correlate with how creative they are judged to be. People who have vivid imaginations, for example, being able to lose themselves at will in fantasy, or to recall childhood memories in great sensory detail, also score highly on standard tests of creativity.22 ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1817))

- The findings of the study were clear. The pictures produced by the students who had considered more objects, and more unusual ones, who played with them more, and who delayed foreclosing on the final form of the picture for as long as possible, changing their minds as they went along, were judged of greater originality and ‘aesthetic value’ than the others. What is more, when the students were followed up seven years later, of those who were still practising artists, the most successful were those who had adopted the more playful and patient modus operandi. These were clearly people who had learnt how to stay open to the promptings of their intuition, and who were comfortable setting out on a journey of discovery without the reassurance of knowing in advance where they were going. They are in good company. Picasso said of his own painting: ‘The picture is not thought out and determined beforehand, rather while it is being made it follows the mobility of thought.’25 There is a whole variety of ways in which people differ with respect to intuition – and therefore an equal variety of ways in which we can set about trying to improve the hospitality of the conditions, both inner and outer, within which intuition can blossom. Being a ‘mother of invention’ is an art that we can learn. We can learn to acknowledge, and to take more seriously, the small seeds of poignancy and puzzlement that occur to us, and the gleams of thought that flash across the periphery of the mind’s eye. We can discover the contexts and moods in which we are most creative and receptive, and make sure ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1858))

We can practise the art of not neatening problems up too quickly, and of not making up our minds too soon about what would count as a ‘solution’. And we can cultivate patience. As the Tao Te Ching asks: Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment. Not seeking fulfilment they are not swayed by the desire for change. Empty yourself of everything. Let the mind rest at peace.

- Is it possible to think too much? Though people who cannot get to sleep for churning over their problems might answer in the affirmative, conventional wisdom sometimes seems to suggest not. In the classroom, the consulting room or the boardroom, we may operate as if the more analytical we were, the better. Or even if we do not, we may assume that we ought to; that a detailed listing and weighing up of considerations, for example, represents some kind of ideal cognitive strategy to which our actual behaviour approximates. As Benjamin Franklin wrote to the British scientist Joseph Priestley: My way [of tackling a difficult problem] is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then during three or four days’ consideration, I put down under the different headings short hints of the different motives, that at different times occur to me, for or against each measure . . . I find at length where the balance lies; and if, after a day or two of further consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly . . . When each [reason] is thus considered, separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less likely to make a rash step.1 The rationale for such a modus operandi is, presumably, that by making our thoughts and motives explicit and orderly, we can evaluate and integrate them better, and thus make better decisions. Or, as an influential textbook on decision-making puts it: ‘The spirit of decision analysis is divide and conquer: decompose a complex problem into simpler problems, get your thinking straight in these simpler problems, paste these analyses together with a logical glue, and come out with a program for action for the complex problem.’2 Be as explicit, as articulate and as systematic as you can be, and you will be ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1888))

- On the basis of these studies, the researchers argue that there are a number of potentially negative effects of encouraging people to be more reflective and explicit about their decisions. In choosing a picture, or a jam, or a course, there are many interwoven considerations to be taken into account, not all of which are (equally) verbalisable. When the decision is made in an intuitive way, these considerations are treated in a more integrated fashion, and those that are hard to articulate are given due weight – which actually may be considerable. However, when people are forced (or encouraged) to be analytical, the problem is deconstructed into those considerations that are more amenable to being put into words. Thus the way the predicament is represented to consciousness may be, to a greater or lesser extent, a distortion of the way it is represented tacitly, and decisions based on this skewed impression are therefore less satisfactory. In particular, d-mode may exclude or downgrade those nonverbal considerations that are primarily sensory or affective. Analytic thinking therefore tends to overestimate cognitive factors, which may be more easily expressed, resulting in decisions which seem ‘sensible’, but which fail to take into account non-cognitive factors.

- Additionally, the more carefully one analyses the different alternatives, the more one finds that there are good and bad aspects to each, and the greater the consequent tendency for judgements to become more moderate, more similar and therefore less decisive. Hence the tendency to come to decisions that differ from those which the acknowledged experts would have advised, and to feel obscurely dissatisfied with the choice one has made. Anyone who has ever agonised over a choice while shopping, and then regretted the decision immediately they have got the item home, will be familiar with this phenomenon. It is the dislocation between conscious and unconscious decision-making that people are referring to when they say that they should have listened to their ‘heart’, or their ‘gut feeling’, or their intuition. As usual the issue is not black and white. We might now suspect that where a problem can be adequately represented verbally, and where the solution lies at the end of a logical chain of reasoning, a predominantly d-mode approach will be effective and efficient. While where the problem is more complex, contains aspects that are hard to articulate, or demands an insightful leap, d-mode will be less successful than a more receptive, patient approach.

- But with the insight problems, we might argue that a different kind of ‘thinking’ is required, one which is more of the intuitive, behind-the-scenes kind; and in this case if people are required to think aloud, this might actually interfere with the intuitive process. As Schooler says in his paper: ‘Verbalisation may cause such a ruckus in ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=1972))

- the “front” of one’s mind that one is unable to attend to the new approaches that may be emerging in the “back” of one’s mind.’ Schooler’s study did in fact analyse what subjects said as they were working on the two types of problem, and found exactly what had been predicted. Subjects who are solving analytical problems are neither helped nor hindered by the demand to think about and to verbalise what they are doing. But when they are attempting insight problems, they are very considerably hampered when they are simultaneously required to attend to and articulate what is going on in their minds.

- The suspicion that something might be trickier than it actually is causes the confident use of d-mode to falter, as people endeavour to seek out – intuitively – complexities that do not exist.

- Jonathan Schooler’s general point is of enormous significance. Some of what we know is readily rendered into words and propositions; and some of it is not. Some of our mental operations are available to consciousness; and some of them are not. When we think, consciously and articulately, therefore, we are not capturing accurately all that is going on in the mind. Rather we are selecting only that part of what we know which is capable of being verbalised; only those aspects of our cognition to which conscious awareness has access. We think what is thinkable; not what is ‘true’. And the disposition to treat all problems as if they were d-mode problems thus skews our thoughts and our mental operations towards those that can be made explicit.

- The problem with description is twofold. First, the effort to describe the face forces one to break it up into its articulable features, and focuses attention on what can be said at the expense of what is genuinely (but non-verbally) distinctive. And secondly, at the time of recognition one may be trying to retrieve the ‘written records’ ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2018))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- from memory, and match these to the pictures that one is being shown, rather than relying on the non-verbal, sensory records that have been registered. If this retrieval effect is a significant part of the problem, performance might be improved by preventing people from using the verbal ‘code’ while they are doing the recognition test. This could be achieved by forcing people to make their memory judgement very fast, perhaps. If you deprive them of the time it takes to think, they might have to fall back on the visual information which has been overshadowed by the verbal description, and thus overcome the interference. This is exactly what Schooler showed. When people had to make their recognition decisions quickly, the deleterious effect of verbalisation was removed. In this case a ‘snap judgement’ is more reliable than a considered one. ‘Decide first, and ask questions afterwards’ may be the right strategy when dealing with non-verbal information. One can escape from the negative effects of d-mode by responding faster than thought, as well as more slowly.4 The conventional wisdom that says we should always benefit from thinking and reflecting more is again seen to be in need of revision. There are interesting practical implications from this study for the handling of eye-witness testimony, identity parades, and so on. Asking witnesses to ‘think carefully’, and to describe what they have seen, may well interfere with their subsequent ability to recognise a face from a photograph or a line-up.

- Schooler’s studies have extended the range of everyday mental tasks with which articulation has been shown to interfere. In Chapter 3 we saw that learning to manage complex and unfamiliar situations, and to perform under pressure, can both be undermined by too strong a commitment to intellectual comprehension and control. Now we know that the same can be true when we are making choices and decisions, solving problems that involve insight, and even when we are simply recognising faces or other visual stimuli. However, again we should beware of falling into the trap of exaggerating the downside of d-mode. There is no value in demonising the intellect. There are many situations in life where an explicit grasp is useful or necessary. When we have to communicate our ideas to other people, in order to get practical tasks accomplished, we must obviously articulate as clearly as we can. But we do not need d-mode just for communication. There are times when we need its analytical powers to test and refine ideas that have been thrown up by the undermind. The study of creativity in many different areas shows that what is required for optimal cognition is a fluid balance between modes of mind that are effortful, purposeful,… ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2032))

- It seems as if full-blown creativity works in a way that is not unlike biological evolution. As long ago as 1946, R. W. Gerard suggested that imagination and intuition are to ideas what mutation is to animals: they create a diversity of new forms, many of which are less viable, less well suited to the demands of the environment, than those that existed already, but some of which, perhaps only a ([Location 2076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2076))

- few, contain features and properties that are adaptive as well as novel. The undermind accounts for the ‘arrival’ of ideas, both fit and unfit. Reason and logic then act like the environment, putting each of these candidates to the test, and ensuring that it is only the fittest that survive.10 ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2079))

- The analogy is limited, however, by the fact that the undermind, unlike the process of genetic mutation, generates not just random variations of what exists already, but complex, well-worked-out candidates; not just guesses but good guesses, educated guesses. The undermind is intelligent in a way that mutation, as far as we know, is not. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2084))

- The creative mind possesses a dynamic, integrated balance between deliberation and contemplation. It is able to swing flexibly between its focused, analytical, articulated mode of conscious thought, and its diffused, synthetic, shadowy mode of intuition. But the mind may lose its poise and get stuck in one mode or the other. And if its balance has been disturbed in this way, it takes time and effort to free it up again. This process of rediscovering the complementarity of the mind’s different modes has been graphically charted in a study of ‘women’s ways of knowing’ by Mary Field Belenky and others.14 They made a detailed study of the experiences of women of a wide variety of ages and backgrounds who were studying within the formal education system, and identified five stages through which these women seemed to pass on their journey towards expanded sophistication and confidence as ‘knowers’. In the early stages of this development, they claim, many women, particularly those who have previously had little successful experience of formal education, start out ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2107))

- feeling very powerless and inept in the face of the rational, articulate way of knowing. They feel as if they have no ‘voice’ of their own, and are in awe of others (principally but not exclusively men) whose d-mode voices sound loud, self-confident and authoritative. But at some point, they may realise that they do ‘know’, and that there is validity to their experiences, feelings – and intuitions. In this stage of what the authors call ‘subjective knowing’, their respondents feel the first stirrings of their own ‘epistemological authority’; though this is associated not with their ability to be rational and explicit, but with the emergence of a new respect for ‘the inner voice’. ‘Truth’ is discovered not through argument and articulation, but through the promptings of gut feelings. It is as if there is ‘some oracle within that stands opposed to the voices and the dictums of the outside world’. I just know. I try not to think about stuff because usually the decision is already made up inside you and then when the time comes, if you trust yourself, you just know the answer. There’s a part of me I didn’t even know I had until recently – instinct, intuition, whatever. It helps me and protects me. It’s perceptive and astute. I just listen to the inside of me and I know what to do . . . I can only know with my gut. My gut is my best friend – the only thing in the world that won’t let me down or lie to me or back away from me.

- This discovery is experienced as vital and welcome; but it is accompanied, for some women, by an over-reaction in which thought-out knowledge is disdained as ‘remote’ and ‘academic’, while the inner voice is accepted as inevitably right and trustworthy simply by virtue of its ‘innerness’. If it ‘feels right’, it is impossible for it to be wrong; even for it to be questioned can be taken as a mark of disrespect or felt as a violation. The sense of self as a valid knower is so precious, and yet so tenuous, that its source has to be defended against all conceivable threats, real or imagined. Instead of there being an absolute authority which is external, now this absolute is shifted inside. The feeling that there is an omniscient source of certainty remains; it is just relocated. In this move, the domains of logic, articulation and science may be completely rejected. The authors comment that: ‘It was as if, by turning inward for answers, they had to deny strategies for knowing that they perceived as belonging to the masculine world.’ It is not that these women have become familiar with logic and theory as tools for knowing and have chosen to reject them; they have only a vague and untested… ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2128))

- For some women this attitude may become as arrogant and offensive as that which they are at pains to denounce. A few of the women . . . were stubbornly committed to their view of things and unwilling to expose themselves to alternative conceptions. Although they might have described themselves as generous and caring, they could be, in fact, impatient and dismissive of other people’s interpretations. They easily resorted to expletives when faced with others’ viewpoints – ‘That’s bullshit!’ . . . These were women at their most belligerent . . . adept at turning the tables on authorities by bludgeoning them with wordy, offensive arguments. In the classroom, as in life, they warded off others’ words and influence via ploys to isolate, shout down, denigrate and undo the other.

- ‘just know’. Things are not always what they seem to be. Truth lies hidden beneath the surface, and you must ferret it out. Knowing requires careful observation and analysis. You must ‘really look’ and ‘listen hard’. They have realised that their love affair with the inner intuitive voice – and particularly with the brittle certainty of its ‘snap judgements’ – was a vital stage on the road to establishing their confidence in their own minds, and in developing their portfolios of ways of knowing; but that it was also tainted by the fear of uncertainty, and driven by more than a little wishful thinking. The ‘inner voice’ can easily be interpreted as telling you that things are the way you want them to be. As Minna, emerging slowly from a bad marriage and studying to become an occupational therapist, reflected: ‘I was confused about everything. I was unrealistic about things. I was more in a fantasy world. You have to see things for what they are, not for what you want to see them. I don’t want to live in a dream world [any more].’ At this later stage, knowing is characterised more by a respect for plurality and relativity, complexity and patience. The women in this study seem now to be discovering a more contemplative, less impulsive, form of intuition. The forced choice between feeling-laden subjectivity and remote objectivity begins to collapse, and knowing emerges from interaction and respect. It is no coincidence that, for these women, an interest in poetry often resurfaced at this stage. One of the women, a college senior, spoke scornfully of critics who use their ‘so-called interpretations’ as ‘an excuse to get their own ideas off the ground’.

- We are more in touch with, and more influenced by, the world around us than we know. In the 1960s, there was a belief that cinema audiences were being unconsciously manipulated into buying soft drinks that they didn’t really want by messages flashed on to the screen too briefly to be detected consciously. Though it turns out that subliminal advertising is much less effective in persuading us to act against our best interests than we might fear, subliminal influences are indeed ubiquitous. They do not just occur when we are watching a screen or listening to a tape; they are present the whole time, and we could not manage without them. The undermind stays in continuous communication with the outside world without many of these conversations appearing in consciousness. Not only do we fail to comprehend what is going on in our own minds; we may not even see what is happening either. Subliminal perception is hard to write about, because the relevant terms in the language are so muddled. It is symptomatic of our cultural neglect of the undermind that we have no word for ‘being influenced by something of which we are unconscious’. Although it may conflict with the way some people use the word, I am going to use ‘awareness’ to refer to the general phenomenon of ‘picking up signals’ from the environment (or from the body), regardless of whether they get represented in consciousness. And I shall reserve ‘consciousness’, and ‘conscious awareness’, for what appears before the mind’s eye. Thus, in my usage, there is nothing paradoxical about using the expression ‘unconscious awareness’ to refer to the state of being affected or influenced by some stimulation that is not itself present in consciousness.1 ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2173))

- The classic example of unconscious perception is driving a car and suddenly ‘coming to’; you realise that you have driven for the last twenty minutes, absorbed in a conversation or a train of thought, without apparently – consciously – noticing anything at all of the road, the traffic or the operation of the controls. Consciousness has been absorbed in one world, while the unconscious ‘automatic pilot’ has been in quite another, coping very nicely on its own with roundabouts, traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. And the same ability to pursue flexible, intelligent routines, while being ‘elsewhere’, is manifest just as much in walking along a crowded street, doing the washing up, playing the piano, taking a shower or getting the children’s tea. The ability to do things mindlessly, even cognitively quite demanding things like chatting to a friend or giving a lecture, is notorious. (You may recall the old story of the vicar who dreamt that he was delivering a sermon, and woke up to find that he was.) The automatic pilot is sensitive to what is happening, and how things are going, just as the computer that controls the real automatic pilot in a plane is sensitive. On automatic pilot we do not just respond like stupid robots; we respond appropriately, like intelligent ones. Or we do most of the time. Sometimes we are caught out, and then we have behaved ‘absent-mindedly’. You find that you are halfway to work before you remember that you were supposed to be going to the doctor’s. Or, in William James’ famous example, you go upstairs to change for the party, and suddenly realise that you are in your pyjamas ([Location 2212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2212))

- and cleaning your teeth. Especially when ‘we’, that is, our conscious minds, are preoccupied, we may find ourselves pouring the hot water into the sugar jar or lighting the fire with today’s newspaper. But when consciousness is not so totally obsessed, merely entertaining itself with a fantasy or a rehearsal, then we do find that the unusual breaks through, it ‘grabs our attention’ and we wake up. A ball bounces out from between two parked cars just ahead, and suddenly we slow down and are on the alert for the child who may be about to dash out after it. Consciousness is re-engaged with perception and action; the conversation stops in mid-sentence. But here again there is evidence for unconscious perception, for how did we know to lock consciousness on to just this small detail, out of the stream of impressions that is constantly flooding in? How is it, when we impulsively turn our head, or stop and listen for a moment, that we frequently find there is something there to be attended to? The faint, unrecognised night noises of a friend’s country cottage keep jerking me back from the edge of sleep; while the taxis that used to rattle past my London flat throughout the night left me unmoved. The only possible explanation for these phenomena is that the undermind is keeping a continual check on what is happening below the horizon of conscious awareness, detecting what might be important or dangerous, and deciding when to butt in to consciousness with a ‘news flash’. Of course it does this fallibly. Sometimes it interrupts me with false alarms – the noise which wakes me is just the beams creaking, not burglars or a fire – and sometimes it fails to alert me to what matters. But its existence is all I am trying to highlight at the moment, not its omniscience. The movements of consciousness, and the pictures it presents, reflect, like the news flash on the television, the judgements of editors, and the alertness of reporters whose existence we must infer, but whose faces we may never see. We are constantly reacting to things not solely in terms of what they are, but in terms of what we expect them to be. We prepare ourselves, physically and mentally, for what is going to happen next on the basis of cues that frequently do not themselves enter consciousness. While this process continues in a routine and successful fashion, it usually remains unnoticed. But it reveals itself through its errors.

- The undermind routinely makes all kinds of adjustments to the data it receives before it hands them on to consciousness – because it is usually advantageous to do so. These everyday examples of unconscious perception often concern aspects of the world which are perfectly visible, audible and so on, but which, though they are registered by the undermind, do not make it into consciousness.

However, when he asked them to name the characters on the cards, they were correct much more often than they would have been by pure guessing, even though that is exactly what they felt they were doing. Sidis concluded from his experiments that there is ‘within us a secondary subwaking self that perceives things which the primary waking self is unable to get at’.4 Even earlier, in 1884, philosopher C. S. Pierce carried out a series of tests with his graduate student Joseph Jastrow at Johns Hopkins University in America, in which they judged over and over which of two nearly identical weights was in fact the heavier. Again, despite the fact that their subjective confidence was effectively zero, they were able to do much better than chance would dictate. Over the thousands of trials on which they made complete guesses, indicating ‘the absence of any preference for one answer over its opposite, so that it seemed nonsensical to answer at all’, they were in fact correct between 60 and 70 per cent of the time. What was particularly interesting about their study was their recognition that these results were not just of curiosity value; they are of real significance for… ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2269))

The insight of females as well as certain ‘telepathic’ phenomena may be explained in this way. Such faint sensations ought to be fully studied by the psychologist and assiduously cultivated by everyman.5 (Emphasis added) Not only do they see the relevance of these findings for everyday life; they also suggest that people may increase their sensitivity to such faint sensations. Just as intuition can be educated and sharpened (as I argued in Chapter 5), so can one’s ability to make use of the mass of weak impressions that underlie – and are usually neglected by – our normal ways of seeing and knowing. It is as if the mind has two thresholds, one below which it registers nothing at all, and a second above which something becomes conscious.

- threshold of awareness, but not to become conscious itself, is nevertheless able to influence what does appear in consciousness. As we saw with intuition, consciousness seems to demand evidence that is more definitive than does the undermind. Another implication of the Pittman and Bornstein study discussed earlier is that, because subjects do not know how or even that they have been influenced subliminally, they are unconscious of the true source of their decision, and they are therefore unable to use consciousness to guard against the influence itself. They are susceptible to the subliminal message precisely because they do not know it is there. People may have many tendencies that they try to control or mitigate, but unless these are picked up by the ‘radar’ of consciousness, those controls may not be able to operate. Just as we saw with intuition, the undermind may work with a richer database than consciousness, but the tapestry it weaves may contain threads and assumptions that are false or out of date. This opens up the intriguing possibility that, by bypassing the checks and inhibitions of consciousness, a subliminal stimulus may actually have a greater effect on behaviour than one perceived clearly.

- An experiment by Larry Jacoby at McMaster University in Canada emphasises both the depth of the unconscious interpretations we make, and the power that conscious awareness has to reorganise these interpretations. His study shows that the unconscious can even mislead us about what kind of experience we are having: whether it is a new perception or a memory, for example. These basic categories of experience are not ‘given’; they, too, are judgements or attributions about which it is possible to be mistaken. Jacoby has shown that these judgements tend to be heavily influenced simply by how easily or fluently something is processed by the undermind. We know from many previous studies that having recognised something once makes it easier to recognise again; there is a residual effect of the first recognition that facilitates the second. And it may be this relative ease of processing that underlies the judgement that something has occurred in the recent past. The decision to treat an experience as a memory, rather than as a fresh perception, is, at least in part, an inference based on the fact ([Location 2354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2354))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that we were able to identify and categorise it faster than might have been expected. If this is so, we might be able to trick the undermind into calling something a memory by making it easier to process. (There is clearly the basis of a psychological explanation for déjà. vu experiences here.) Jacoby’s experiment managed to create exactly this confusion.10 He and his colleagues showed their volunteers a list of words, and after a short delay, showed them another longer list, one word at a time, that contained the words from the first list mixed up with some new words. Subjects were asked to say, of each word on the second list, whether it had been on the first list or not: in other words, to classify their experience of each word on the second list as a ‘memory’ or just a ‘perception’. The experimenters’ cunning manipulation was to make some of the test words slightly easier to read than others by varying the clarity of the print. They found that new words in clearer type were likely to be falsely ‘recognised’ as having been on the original list. Unconsciously people thought that the relative ease of processing the clear words was due to having seen them before, so they judged them to be memories. Recent laboratory studies of ‘false memory syndrome’ have shown that judging an experience to be a ‘memory’ (and therefore ‘real’), rather than a fantasy, is also influenced by the nature of the experience. It may be that the more vividly you can get someone to fantasise, the more likely they are subsequently to misrepresent this ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2361))

- experience as a true memory.11 Certainly, it is not uncommon to experience some confusion, especially just after waking, as to whether one is recalling a lifelike dream from the night before, or a memory of an event several days ago. There is an additional feature of Jacoby’s study that is very significant. The illusion of memory is removed if people are told (or if they notice for themselves) that the visual clarity of the second batch of words is being manipulated. If they are conscious that ease of processing is being influenced by another factor, they can take this into account in their judgements. They can keep the two variables separate. But if people don’t know what is going on, then the undermind bundles the two different sources of ease – memory and clarity – together, and comes up with some wrong answers. As with the previous examples, when we are consciously aware of an influence, we may be able to guard against it or compensate for it. We can see that what we are doing is making an inference or an assumption. When we are not aware of the same influence, when it comes to us subliminally and is, so to speak, already… ([Location 2373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2373))

- Many people think that the doctor might say something like ‘You look quite slim to me’, while thinking to himself ‘I wonder if we have a case of anorexia nervosa here?’ In fact what the doctor says is: ‘Don’t worry; a lot of men tend to put on weight around your age.’ Even those who pride themselves on their sensitivity to gender issues may unconsciously be trapped by the picture into assuming that the man is the doctor. When the stereotype is unconsciously stirred into the perception, then we may start to try to make sense out of a seemingly puzzling situation – not realising that it is the assumption that is problematic, not the reality. But of course once we are aware of the assumption, the whole picture – literally – changes.12 There is a third feature of unconscious perception which the original experiment by Pittman and Bornstein reveals, and that is the tendency for consciousness to ‘fill the explanatory gap’ with a plausible story, and not to recognise that this is what it has done. Their subjects ‘explained’ their selection of one job candidate over the other on the basis of an apparently rational appraisal of the relative importance of computing and writing ability. They did not offer this as a conjecture about their thought processes, but as a bona fide account of what actually happened in their minds. Yet the evidence shows that they are mistaken. Their choice is clearly and powerfully influenced by the manipulation of which they have no conscious knowledge. Their explanation of the choice, though they genuinely believe it to be true, is actually based on what would have been plausible. They do not intrinsically value computing over writing (or vice versa); they are just trying to generate a rationale for how their preference came about. This tendency to confabulate is not an isolated or occasional phenomenon. There is plenty of evidence that we do it much more than we think. Occasionally we may acknowledge that there is an element of surmise in our reasoning, as when we account for behaving unreasonably by saying ‘I must have been tired’; but often we buy our own reasoning uncritically, and with complete conviction (and confidently assert that ‘I snapped because I was tired’). There are now many experimental illustrations of the ways in which we misconstrue our own motivation.

- But such careful and even-handed investigations do at least require us to respect the powers of the undermind, and they might, regrettably to some people, advise caution in interpreting such exotic phenomena as out-of-the-body and near-death experiences, clairvoyance and divination, and so on. There are those who see such experiences as incontrovertible evidence of supernatural powers or influences, and use them as ‘proof’ that there is more to life than is dreamt of in our current psychology. It is often claimed that they could not have come from ‘within’; that there must be real spirits out there who are talking to us, or real powers of telepathy which defy the known laws of physics and physiology. Maybe there are. But the case for the very existence of some of these strange experiences, let alone any particular explanation, is not yet established. And at least in some cases the magical conclusion may be premature – because the role of the unconscious has not been fully appreciated. The implicit identification of mind with consciousness is manifested time and again in esoteric circles in the assumption that, if we cannot find an explanation for some phenomenon in conscious terms, then ‘the mind’ cannot have been responsible at all.

The therapist, Joseph Masling, observed: ‘You seem to think you have no right to be happy.’ The man immediately began to fidget almost uncontrollably, before eventually subsiding into stillness. After a long silence, he said, ‘What did you say?’ Another of Masling’s clients, a young woman on the verge of successfully completing her graduate training programme, behaved in almost exactly the same way when Masling commented, ‘Have you noticed how much easier it is for you to tell me about your failures than your successes?’ She too, after a lot of squirming, had to ask him to repeat what he had said.

- I have suggested that one way of expressing this disparity between conscious and unconscious is in terms of two thresholds, a lower one, above which the undermind becomes active, and a higher one, above which information enters consciousness. The closer together these two points are, the more ‘in touch’ with the unconscious we are, and the more complete is our conscious awareness of what is happening across all the mental realms. The further apart they are, the more our conscious perception is impoverished. This quantitative notion of thresholds is rather crude, but it enables us to formulate an important question: what is it that determines how near or how far apart the two thresholds are? More generally, is the relationship between conscious and unconscious forms of awareness a dynamic one, subject to change, and if so, what are the forces that control it? In cases such as Masling’s, it seems clear that some information received unconsciously can cause a considerable amount of nonverbal discomfort, and that, as a result, it is gated out of consciousness. The therapist’s remark occasions a very rapid raising of the conscious threshold. Perhaps it is specifically things that are threatening that cause the conscious threshold to shoot up.

- Conversely, we can demonstrate that access to information in the undermind that is dubious, not because it is directly threatening, but because it is faint or ephemeral, can be increased by making subjects feel more relaxed and ‘safe’. One way to do this is to ask subjects to express this weak information without feeling that they are under pressure, or being judged in any way. Normally when people are asked to recall something previously shown, they feel that they are being tested.3 Psychologists’ experiments are designed to be hard enough for people to make ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2495))

- The nineteenth-century French physician Claparede, for example, concealed a pin between his fingers when he was introduced to one of these amnesic patients, giving him a prick as they shook hands. On leaving the room and reappearing a few minutes later, Claparede was, as expected, treated by the patient as if they had never met before – yet the patient was curiously reluctant to shake his hand. When queried about this antisocial behaviour, he rather vaguely explained that ‘you never know with doctors; sometimes they play tricks on you’.5 It is no coincidence that it was a painful stimulus that was unconsciously registered, for the undermind is particularly concerned with things that are of significance for our survival and wellbeing. The suspicion that amnesiacs have more memory than it appears has recently been confirmed in the following way. Subjects are given some time to study a list of words which they are asked to remember, and then the list is removed. A little later, instead of asking the subjects to recognise or recall the words in the conventional manner, they are shown the first two or three letters of a word and asked to respond with ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2518))

- the first word beginning with those letters that comes into their heads. As far as the patients are concerned, this a completely new exercise. But the prompts they are given have been selected so that they can be completed with one of the words on the original list – and this to-be-remembered word has been chosen to be less common in the language than some alternative words that could also be used to complete the frame. So if one of the words on the original list was CLEAT, the patients are asked to think of a word that completes the frame CLE—. Without any memory of the list, people would respond to the cue with a more common word like CLEAN or CLEAR, but in fact the amnesic patients tend to produce the rarer word which they recently saw, but cannot ‘remember’. The words must have been recorded, but the memories only reveal themselves in the way they influence the (apparently) ‘free’ association. It begins to look as if the ‘amnesia’, in these cases at least, is more to do with an inaccessibility of memories to consciousness than with an inability to register what has happened. This same effect has now been reproduced in people with undamaged memories, using subliminal perception techniques. Subjects are presented with a number of words on a screen, one by one, too briefly for conscious perception. If they are subsequently asked to recall the words, they will, like the amnesiacs, say ‘What words?’ Yet, if they are tested with the same ‘free association’ game, the words they did not even ‘see’ are found to have made a significant difference to how their minds are spontaneously working. They behave exactly like the memory-impaired patients. ([Location 2527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2527))

- We are all familiar with more mundane versions of the same phenomena, such as ‘unconscious driving’, which I used as an example in the last chapter. Though the idea of ‘unconscious seeing’ may strike us at first as weird or paradoxical, it does so only because it conflicts so strongly with our implicit beliefs about how the mind works, and this dissonance simply makes us unaware of how much of the time we respond appropriately in the absence of conscious awareness. If we were ‘seeing unconsciously’ in the absence of any conscious experience at all – if we were able magically to find our way around a strange house in pitch darkness, as it were – we would indeed be stunned. But our reliance on the undermind is conveniently masked by the fact that the ‘hole’ in consciousness is almost always plugged by some other content that is drawing our attention. It is only because our conscious mind is occupied with something else that we usually fail to observe the extent to which the ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2603))

- visual information on which we have been relying has bypassed conscious awareness. We are familiar too with the effect of ‘self-consciousness’ on behaviour as well as perception. Think of someone who is being interviewed for a job they desperately want, or a child who has been specifically enjoined to carry a full cup of tea very carefully. In such situations there is a sense of vulnerability, of a precarious balancing act, the successful execution of which depends on a degree of skill or control that we do not confidently possess. Thus there is anxiety and apprehension. And this leads to a coarsening of motor control, making us clumsy, in addition to the constriction of attention. Under pressure, we seize up, or ‘go blank’. The interviewee fails to understand a perfectly straightforward question. The child concentrates so hard on not spilling the tea that her coordination goes, and she becomes graceless and gauche. It was the very day, in 1984, when my long-standing (and long-suffering) partner had finally finished our relationship that I dived – without any conscious suicidal intention – into the shallow end of a swimming pool and split my head open on the bottom. Losing keys, breaking plates and denting the car are similar symptoms of stress. It is when consciousness is most fiercely preoccupied, usually with a difficult and emotionally charged predicament, that it disregards information (like a large sign saying DEPTH ONE METRE) most egregiously, and siphons off from the unconscious the resources that it needs to function well. One way in which the relationship between consciousness and the undermind can be radically transformed is through hypnosis (a phenomenon the existence of which, unlike the paranormal, is now established beyond empirical doubt).

- are relaxation and trust: allowing yourself to be hypnotised involves giving up your normal sense of controlling your own actions, of planning and striving, and putting yourself in someone else’s hands. And in this state, for those who can attain it, the relationship between conscious and unconscious becomes unusually labile and permeable. The hypnotist is able to speak directly to the undermind, and is able to adjust, sometimes to an extraordinary extent, which aspects of the unconscious gain access to consciousness, and which do not. Under so-called ‘hypnotic age regression’, for example, you may gain conscious access to long-forgotten childhood memories. Or you may have compelling hallucinations that you take to be ‘reality’. While on the other hand you may be rendered functionally deaf or blind, either to particular kinds of events, or across the board. In one case the conscious threshold is lowered so that normally inaccessible memories surface into conscious awareness; in the other the threshold is raised so high that even mundane experience is blocked out. Though consciousness may be drastically altered or reduced, we can show that the undermind continues to function. The fact that you no longer… ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2623))

- Yet, despite the dramatic alteration of the conscious experience, some responses to the painful stimuli remain. The registration of pain can be demonstrated through physiological measures, for example. One widely used indicator of general arousal is the ‘galvanic skin response’, GSR, a measure of the resistance of the skin to the passage of electrical current. People who, as a result of hypnotic analgesia, show no visible reaction to a painful electric shock nevertheless show GSR reactions that are typical of the more normal response.12 Also, it turns out that you can talk to a ‘hidden part’ of the person who can tell you about the pain, even though its conscious intensity is reduced or non-existent. If hypnotised subjects are asked to sit with their left hands in a bucket of iced water – which is normally quite painful – they will appear relaxed and will say that they genuinely feel little or no discomfort. However, if they are asked to respond with the other hand to a written list of questions about their general physical state, as it were inadvertently, they will report, in their answers, the pain that they do not ‘feel’. One of the clearest demonstrations of this so-called ‘hidden observer’ effect was recorded by Ernest Hilgard, a long-time hypnosis researcher, in a student practical class. One of the students, a suitable subject, was rendered functionally deaf: he denied hearing anything and failed to flinch at loud noises. While he was in this state, Hilgard whispered softly in his ear: As you know, there are parts of our nervous system that carry on activities that occur out of awareness, like circulating the blood . . .

- There may be intellectual processes also of which we are unaware, such as those that find expression in dreams. Although you are hypnotically deaf, perhaps there is some part of you that is hearing my voice and processing the information. If there is, I should like the index finger of your right hand to rise as a signal that this is the case. The finger rose, and the hypnotised student spontaneously commented that he felt his index finger rise, but had no idea why it had done so. Hilgard then released the student from the hypnotic deafness, and asked him what he thought had happened. ‘I remember’, said the volunteer, ‘your telling me that I would be deaf at the count of three, and would have my hearing restored when you placed your hand on my shoulder. Then everything was quiet for a while. It was a little boring just sitting here, so I busied myself with a statistical problem I was working on. I was still doing that when suddenly I felt my finger lift.’ ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2651))

- An intriguing study by Ellen Langer at Harvard suggests that even such a basic psychological attribute as our visual acuity is determined by who we happen to believe ourselves to be. Her subjects were invited to ‘become’ air force pilots for an afternoon. They were dressed in the appropriate uniform and given the chance to ‘pilot’ a jet airplane on a flight simulator. The context was made as ‘real’ as possible, and the subjects were asked to try to become a pilot, not merely to act the part. At the beginning of the study, before the simulation had been introduced and explained, each subject was given a short physical examination, which included a routine eye test. During the flight simulation, while they were being pilots, they were asked to read the markings on the wings of another plane that could be seen out of the cockpit window. These markings were actually letters from an equivalent eye chart to the one used in the physical. It was found that the vision of nearly half of the ‘pilots’ had improved significantly. Other groups of subjects, who were equally aroused and motivated, but who were not immersed in the role, showed no such improvement. By changing the sense of self, more precise sensory information can become available to consciousness.13 The self also contains core assumptions about psychological aspects of our make-up that are generic and cultural as well as those that identify us as individuals. Some of these core beliefs concern consciousness itself: when conscious awareness occurs, what it is for, how well it can be trusted and so on. And one of these tacit assumptions is that ‘What we see – consciously – is what is “there”, and it is all that is there’. If we subscribe to this model of perception, we will unquestioningly assume that ‘When I have no conscious visual experience, I cannot have registered anything about what is happening out ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2664))

So if by some tragic accident I were to be deprived of conscious visual experience, but not of unconscious visual information, it is possible that I would be prevented by this belief from reacting appropriately to visual events. Someone who is involuntarily deprived of conscious sight may thus, as a result of their fundamental belief that consciousness and perception are the same thing, handicap themselves further by cutting themselves off from their residual unconscious visual capacity.

- The more self-conscious we are – the more fragile our identity – the more we shut down the undermind. As people feel increasingly vulnerable, so their access to, and reliance on, information that is faint or fleeting declines. They become not just physically but also mentally clumsy, losing access to the subtler ways of knowing. Conversely, the less self-conscious we are, the more ‘at home in our skins and our minds’, the more it seems we are able to open ourselves to the undermind, and to the mental modes through which it speaks. Self-consciousness is a graded phenomenon; there are milder, more chronic and more widespread degrees of self-consciousness, in which the kinds of deleterious effects we have been discussing still occur, albeit in less intense forms. Extrapolating from the experimental studies, we might hazard the suggestion that many people (at least in busy, d-mode cultures), much of the time, are in a state of low-grade, somewhat pressurised self-consciousness, and that in this state, consciousness is edited and manipulated so that its contents are as congenial and unthreatening to the operative model of self and mind as possible.

- ourselves of valuable data. Though we are in fact sensitive to the shimmering reality that underlies consciousness, we act as if we were not – because we do not ‘believe’ in it, do not trust it, or do not like what it has to say. Blindsight research suggests that one area in which we might expect to see the effects of ‘self’ on consciousness is where people are acting deliberately or intentionally, as opposed to accidentally, playfully or impulsively. The sense of self is associated most crucially, after all, with plans and actions which are designed to serve our own conscious purposes. Intentions are the conscious expressions of our valued goals – of our selves, in other words. One of the features of the blindsight syndrome seems to be the decoupling of patients’ unconscious seeing from their own intentions. We can show that they have residual sight, and we can do so best under precisely those conditions when they are not acting on the basis of any internally generated intention: when they are not trying to achieve anything, or prove themselves in any way.16 This inhibiting effect of intention certainly has its parallels in everyday life. The phenomena of ‘not being able to see for looking’, or of ‘trying too hard’, are commonplace. Perhaps the presence of a strong intention locks consciousness too firmly into a predetermined framework of plans and expectations, so that other information, which could potentially be useful or even necessary, is relegated to unconscious processes of perception, where it is, in these cases, ignored. Intention drives conscious attention, to the detriment, sometimes, of intelligence. In d-mode, we are not just ‘looking’, we are looking for, and what we are looking for has to be, to an extent, pre-specified. Attention is focused and channelled by the unconscious decisions we have made about what may be ‘relevant’ to the solution of the ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2718))

Sigmund Freud made exactly this point in his ‘Recommendations to physicians practising psychoanalysis’, published in 1912. The technique of psychoanalysis, he said, consists simply in not directing one’s notice to anything in particular, and in maintaining the same ‘evenly-suspended attention’ . . . in the face of all that one hears. In this way . . . we avoid a danger. For as soon as anyone deliberately concentrates his attention to a certain degree, he begins to select from the material before him; one point will be fixed in his mind with particular clearness and some other… ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2732))

- This line of thought suggests that threat or desire may make consciousness narrower as well as coarser, and may explain the experiments described in Chapter 5 which showed that the creativity of intuition and problem-solving is reduced by a feeling of threat or pressure. One of the major reasons why too much effort, too purposive an attitude, or a general increase in stress or anxiety is counterproductive is because it creates ‘tunnel vision’. We might imagine that, at any given moment, people are shining a ‘beam’ of attention outward on to their environment, through the five senses, and inward, too, on to their own physiological,… ([Location 2740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2740))

- People working under pressure, whether environmental or psychological, tend to select out and focus on those aspects of the situation as a whole which they judge to be the crucial ones. And this judgement must to a certain extent, as Freud realised, be a prejudgement. You make an intuitive decision about what is going to be worth paying attention to. If this ‘attentional gamble’ is correct, people may learn the task, or figure out a solution, quicker, but at the expense of a broader overview. They see in terms of what they expect to see, and if this self-imposed blinkering reflects an adequate conceptualisation of the problem, time may be saved. But if it is not, or if (as in the Luchins’ jars experiments) the situation changes but because of the tight focus the change is not noticed, then a commitment to the spotlight processing strategy is going to let them down. As Jerome Bruner says, reflecting on the adverse effect of motivation: ‘Increase in incentive leads to a higher degree of selective attention for those parts of a complex task that subjects interpret as more important, with a concomitant tendency to pay less attention to other features of the situation.’21 Broad, diffuse attention is precisely what is needed in non-routine, ill-defined or impoverished situations, where data is patchy, conventional solutions don’t work, and incidental details may make all the difference. And that is why too much effort inhibits creativity. ([Location 2763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2763))

- The brain is composed of two types of cells – glial cells and neurons – both in profusion. The glia seem to be mainly responsible for housekeeping: they mop up unwanted chemical waste, and make sure that the brain as a whole stays in optimal condition.

The neurons in the brain vary considerably in their actual size and shape. Some are straggly and leggy, with long axons running for some millimetres through the brain; others are short and bushy, with dense dendritic branches, but perhaps measuring only a few thousandths of a millimetre from end to end. However, all the neurons have the same function: they carry small bursts of electric current from one end to the other.

- The brain works by routing activity from neural cluster to neural cluster according to the pattern of channels and sensitivities that exist at any moment, and that is all it does. Just as a pebble thrown into a pond starts an outward movement of concentric ripples, so activity in one area of the brain forms what Oxford neuroscientist Susan Greenfield calls an ‘epicentre’ from which activity spreads out, interacting with other flows of activation, and triggering new epicentres, as it goes. One can literally watch it happening. ([Location 2986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2986))

- The distributed nature of the neural clusters has been demonstrated by Wolf Singer in Germany. Singer has found that neurons that are widely separated across the visual cortex can nevertheless synchronise their firing patterns in response to a stimulus. Thus, as I have already suggested, the flow of activity is not literally from place to place, but between distributed patterns that continuously segue into one another. The brainscape is, as I have argued, delineated functionally, not physically. If we were able to track the brain’s activity, and simplify it, we should see something that looked not like a brightly lit train travelling at night, but more like a luminous kaleidoscope being continually shaken. But to show these iridescent patterns shimmering across the brain is beyond our technical capacity, not least because they move so fast. Ad Aersten and George Gerstein have shown that neuronal groups are highly dynamic, forming and reforming within periods as short as a few dozen milliseconds. And what is more, the same neuron may take part in different patterns from moment to moment. Despite the huge technological problems, there is already some direct evidence for the existence and the properties of these neural patterns.6 ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=2993))

- In a state of high arousal, a single chain of associations that is more conscious and more conventional will tend to be followed. In a state of relaxation, activity may ripple out simultaneously from a range of different centres, combining in less predictable ways. And finally the rate of flow can vary. In a state of low arousal, a weak pool of activity may remain in one area of the network for some time before it moves on or is superseded. Under greater arousal – when threatened or highly motivated – activity may flow more rapidly from concept to concept, idea to idea.

- Interesting intuitions occur as a result of thinking that is low-focus, capable of making associations between ideas that may be structurally remote from each other in the brainscape. Creativity develops out of a chance observation or a seed of an idea that is given time to germinate. The ability of the brain to allow activation to spread slowly outwards from one centre of activity, meeting and mingling with others, at intensities that may produce only a dim, diffuse quality of consciousness, seems to be exactly what is required. There is direct evidence that creativity is associated with a state of low-focus neural activity. Colin Martindale at the University of Maine has monitored cortical arousal with an encephalograph, or EEG, in which electrodes attached to the scalp register the overall level and type of activity in the brain. When people are more aroused, these ‘brainwaves’ are of a higher frequency, and are more random, more ‘desynchronised’. When they are relaxed (but still awake), their brainwaves are slower and more synchronised: the so-called ‘alpha’ and ‘theta’ waves. Martindale recorded the EEGs of people taking either an intelligence test – one that required analytical thought – or a creativity test – one which asked people to discover a remote associate that linked apparently disparate items, or to generate a wide range of unusual responses to a question such as ‘What could you use an old newspaper for?’ ([Location 3042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3042))

- I showed in Chapter 4 that incubation also supports better thinking through allowing time for false starts and erroneous conceptualisations to fade away, and to be superseded by a different approach. We can now see how the brain makes this process of ‘reappraisal’ possible. Imagine that activity in the neural network is flowing along a channel and comes to a point of choice – a T-junction. Which way is it to go? Under normal circumstances, we can assume (for purposes of illustration) that all the activity has to follow the most well-established route. If one arm of the T is worn deeper, and/or is more highly primed, than the other, then that will be the path that ([Location 3099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3099))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is preferred. We can represent the relative facilitation of each pathway, as in Figure 10, by the thickness of its line. At each junction, the activity has to ‘choose’ the thicker line.2 Now suppose the starting point for thinking about a particular problem, given the way it has been initially construed, is at point ‘A’; and where you need to get to, the ‘solution’, is at point ‘!’. If you follow the thickness of the lines, you will see that the nature of this bit of the network is such that you can never get from A to !. You just keep going round in a circle. However, if for some reason you were to stop thinking about the problem in terms which require you to start at A, and were instead, by accident, to access the same bit of circuitry via another point, B, you would ‘magically’ find that now you are able to get from B to ! very easily. ‘BING!’, as Konrad Lorenz would say. You have an ‘insight’. When you drop out of d-mode, and just let the mind drift around all kinds of ‘irrelevant’ or even ‘silly’ associations, you may well, by chance, find yourself thinking not about A but about B – and the recalcitrant solution suddenly becomes obvious. Thus it is, for example, that the most effective antidote to the ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ state is to stop trying to recall the word that stubbornly refuses to come to mind, and to allow yourself to drift off, or to do something else. And then, at some unpredictable moment, the word comes to you, out of the blue. The head-on assault contains the seeds of its own destruction, while the sideways approach, in which you allow the undermind to sneak up on the item you want, wins the day. That is why brainstorming and daydreaming are – as creative people have always known – effective ways of knowing: they capitalise on the brain’s biochemistry.

- This neural model also makes it clear why creativity favours not just a relaxed mind, but also one that is well-but not over-informed. In those parts of the neural network that represent the most familiar or routine areas of life, the continual repetition of patterns in experience may have carved out mental canyons and ravines so steep-sided that even when excitation is generally increased and inhibition relaxed, the course of activation flow will still be set. We cannot but construe the world in terms of concepts that are so engrained. However, where the brainscape is contoured enough to formulate an interesting problem, but not so deeply etched that a single approach is inescapable, then moving to the broad focus mode may well reveal novel associations.

- unconscious level, without bothering to wait for consciousness to develop. A pool of neural activation may split into two, one part resonating with the self, and thus subserving the emergence of conscious awareness, while the other carries on with further processing such as planning a response. This makes sense, particularly if time is short. It may pay you to continue with the preparations for building an extension on to your house at the same time as you are waiting for formal ‘planning permission’ – on the assumption that the permission will be forthcoming in the end. If permission is in the event refused, you can abort the plan before you have started the actual process of construction. Provided you have not physically ‘jumped the gun’, nothing, except the planning time, is lost. If the brain were capable of operating in this dual-track manner, we would have to rethink the function of consciousness. Far from being the instigator of action, the source of orders and decisions, consciousness could, at least under some conditions, simply be receiving notification of what was in fact being decided elsewhere.

Firstly, by virtue of electrodes attached to the person’s head, he was able to pinpoint the moment at which the precursors of the action were discernible in the brain’s patterns of electrical activity (the EEG).

- the physical movement itself began. He found that the voluntary action began to develop in the brain about 350 milliseconds – a third of a second – before the appearance of the conscious intention, which occurred, in turn, some 200 milliseconds before the start of the action itself. These results indicate clearly that it is the unconscious brain which decides what to do, and when; and that what we experience as an intention is merely a post hoc confirmation of what has already been set in motion. Consciousness receives a kind of corollary ‘despatch note’, and then presents this as if it were the original order. ‘Will’, or even ‘free will’, on this evidence, seems to belong to the brain, rather than to consciousness. But this does not mean that consciousness is left without any function at all. If conscious awareness is associated with the process of checking a situation for concealed threats to self, it may also be instrumental in inhibiting actions and experiences that are adjudged to be risky, rather than in routine instigation and construction.

- This chapter explores four different ways of paying attention, or ‘slow seeing’: detection, focusing on inner states, poetic sensibility, and mindfulness. The habit of attending closely and patiently to the evidence, even – sometimes especially – to tiny, insignificant-looking shreds of evidence, is characteristic of skilled practitioners of a variety of arts, crafts and professions, prototypically the hunter. From a bent twig, a feather or a piece of dried excrement the expert hunter can recreate an animal, its age and state of health; and he does so in an apparently leisurely fashion in which these scraps of information are allowed to resonate, largely unconsciously, with his mental stock of lore and experience. You can’t rush a tracker. Each detail, slowly attended to, is allowed to form a nucleus, an epicentre in the brain, around which associations and connotations gradually accrete and meld, if they will, into a rich, coherent picture of the animal and its passage. As Carlo Ginzburg, author of a fascinating essay on ‘Clues’, has surmised, the hunter squatting on the ground, studying the spoor of ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3344))

- his quarry, may be engaged in the oldest act in the intellectual history of the human race.1 Many other feats of vernacular connoisseurship – telling an ailing horse by the condition of its hocks, an impending storm by a change in the wind, a run of salmon by a scarcely perceptible ripple on the river, a hostile intent by a subtle narrowing of the eyes – are of the same kind. Each is an act of high intelligence, bringing to bear on the present a complex body of past knowledge, and accomplished by the eye, with little if any assistance from deliberate thought. In this process of attentive resonance, knowledge does not become the object of explicit thought; rather it implicitly dissolves itself in a gathering sense of the situation as a whole. There is an apocryphal story of a venerable factory boiler that broke down one day, and of the old man who was called to fix it. He wandered around among its convoluted pipework, humming quietly to himself and occasionally putting his ear to a valve or a joint, and then pulled a hammer out of his toolbag and banged hard on one small obscure corner. The boiler heaved a deep sigh and rumbled into life again. The old man sent in a bill for £300, which the manager thought excessive, so he sent it back with a request that it be itemised. When it came back, the old man had written: for tapping with hammer: 50p for knowing where to tap: £299.50p. Similarly, the painter J. M. Whistler, at the trial of John Ruskin, was asked by the judge how he dared ask £350 for a ‘Nocturne’ that had taken him only a few hours to paint. Whistler replied that the fee was not for the painting, but for ‘the knowledge of a lifetime’. In the late nineteenth century, three new professions came into being that explicitly relied on ([Location 3352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3352))

- the ability to read clues: the authentication of artworks, police detection, and psychoanalysis. In the mid-1870s, Giovanni Morelli developed a method for discriminating original paintings from copies and fakes, based not on overall composition or draughtsmanship but on the execution of such tiny details as earlobes and fingernails. He argued that it was precisely in these unimportant details, when both the ‘master’ and the copyist were ‘off guard’, that differences of technique would manifest themselves most clearly. As with a casual signature, rather than a self-conscious script, it was in these inadvertent trivia that personality would reveal itself – but only to the eye which understood this to be the case. Like the hunter, one had to be alert to the presence of meaning in the scraps and marginalia. Morelli directly influenced the development of the ‘science’ of detection, which was to be dramatised by the emerging writers of detective fiction, such as Gaboriau in France in the late 1870s, and, a little later, most famously, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes stories. Gaboriau, in one of his ‘Monsieur Lecoq’ adventures, contrasts the novel approach of the detective Lecoq with the ‘antiquated practice’ of the old policeman Gevrol, ‘who stops at appearances, and therefore does not succeed in seeing anything’.2 While in the Sherlock Holmes story called ‘… ([Location 3367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3367))

- You are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear . . . I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert, and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my surprise then, when, on looking at Miss Cushing, I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just inspected . . . I saw at once the enormous importance of the observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation, and probably a very close one.3 Sigmund Freud too was influenced, in his developing formulation of the psychoanalytic method, by Morelli, and quite possibly by Conan Doyle as well. Freud is recorded as speaking of his fascination with the Sherlock Holmes stories to one of his patients (the so-called ‘wolf-man’). Certainly he had become intrigued by the techniques of Morelli at least ten years before he began to develop his ideas about psychoanalysis in print. In a retrospective essay, ‘The Moses of Michelangelo’, published in 1914, Freud writes of this influence thus: Long before I had any opportunity of hearing about psychoanalysis, I learnt that a Russian art-connoisseur, Ivan Lermolieff [a pseudonym of Morelli’s], [was] showing how to distinguish copies from originals . . . by insisting that attention should be diverted from the general impression and main features of a picture, and he laid stress on the significance of minor details . . . which every artist executes in his own characteristic way . . . It seems to me that his method of inquiry is closely related to the technique of psycho-analysis. It, too, is accustomed to divine secret and concealed things from unconsidered or unnoticed details, from the rubbish heap, as it were, of our observations.4 (Emphasis added) It is interesting to observe, in this context, the changing approach to medical diagnosis over the course of the last two hundred years. The process of detection and identification of disease these days is often devoid of this leisurely resonance of attentive observation with the working knowledge of a lifetime’s experience. The modern general practitioner makes a succession of snap decisions as to either the nature of the disorder with which she is confronted, or what further objective, ‘scientific’ tests to order. She is now so rushed, and so enchanted (as we all are) by technology, and… ([Location 3381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3381))

- the odour deeply three times. His examination was over. He had still not uttered a single word. His diagnosis, whatever it was, would be based solely on his protracted attention to the appearance, the feel and the smell of the woman’s sick body. Back in the conference room Yeshi Dhonden, through his young interpreter, delivered his verdict in curiously poetic terms. ‘Between the chambers of the heart, long, long before she was born, a wind had come and blown open a deep gate that must never be opened. Through it charge the full waters of her river, as the mountain stream cascades in the springtime, battering, knocking loose the land, and flooding her breath.’ Finally the woman’s consultant disclosed his diagnosis: ‘congenital heart disease: interventricular septal defect with resultant heart failure’. Unless he was very lucky, or had been secretly primed, we may conclude, with the originally sceptical Selzer, that Yeshi Dhonden was ‘listening to the sounds of the body to which the rest of us are deaf’. Having stilled his mind through the practice of meditation, he looks, listens, feels and smells without thinking, without trying to make any sense, allowing all his sensory impressions to seep at their own speed into the furthest corners of his vast, largely inarticulate storehouse of knowledge, and to deliver back to him, in consciousness, images and figures that make sense of the whole.6 This kind of detection comes into its own under certain conditions. It needs a problem that can be clearly formulated – how long since the horses passed?; who planted the bomb?; what is causing the fever? – but to which the answer is not obvious. It requires ‘clues’: pieces of information whose significance, or even presence, is not immediately apparent. It works with a mind that has a rich database of potentially relevant information, much of which is tacit or experiential rather than articulated. And this kind of detection requires a particular mental mode in which details can be dwelt upon, at first without knowing what their meaning may be, so that slow ripples of activation in the brain may uncover any significant connections there may be. Without this patient rumination, the clue, the problem and the database will not come into the fruitful conjunction that reveals the ways in which they are related. The successful detective trains her awareness on the outside… ([Location 3421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3421))

- time; to cease deliberately thinking, analysing, explaining and theorising, and to sit silently while, it seemed, they paid attention to an internal process that could not yet be clearly articulated. They were listening to something inside themselves that they did not yet have words for. They acted as if they were waiting for something rather nebulous to take form, and groping for exactly the right way of expressing it. Often this period of silent receptivity would last for around thirty seconds; sometimes much longer. And when they did speak, struggling to give voice to what it was they had dimly sensed, they spoke as though their dawning understanding was new, fresh and tentative – quite different from the tired old recitation of grievance or guilt which frequently preceded it. Gendlin called this hazy shadow which they were attending to, and allowing slowly to come to fruition, a felt sense, and it was quite different both from a string of thoughts and from the experience of a particular emotion or feeling. It seemed to be the inner ground out of which thoughts, images and feelings would emerge if they were given time and unpremeditated attention. It appeared that many people lacked the ability, and perhaps the patience, to allow things to unfold in this way. Instead they would, in their haste for an answer, pre-empt this process of evolution, creating a depiction of the problem which told them nothing new, and which gave no sense of progress or relief. Gendlin discovered that the felt sense will form not in the head, but in the centre of the body, somewhere between the throat and the stomach. The awareness is physical and when it has been allowed to form, has been heard, and accurately captured in a phrase or an image, there is a corresponding physical sense of release and relaxation. It is as if some inarticulate part of the person, almost like a distressed child, feels understood, and has responded with a sigh of relief: ‘Yes. That’s exactly how it is. You understand. Thank you.’ When this ‘felt shift’ happens, then the previous feeling of blockage eases, and by going back again patiently to the felt sense, people find that it is ready to tell them something further; to unfold a little more. In focusing one takes an issue to consider, asks oneself ‘What is this whole thing about?’, and then shuts up. Over the course of half a minute or so, by… ([Location 3449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3449))

- the one with which people are most familiar. As with a medical student learning to read X-rays, it takes time to ‘see’ what is there, and to stabilise these unfamiliar, shadowy objects of attention. But the tentative, exploratory ‘feel’ of focusing soon becomes unmistakeable. In one session in which I took part, the focuser said: ‘I feel kind of scared, but I don’t know what of. Inside it’s like an animal that’s totally alert, ears pricked . . . It’s like something’s coming, and some part of me has picked it up and is getting ready for it, but “I” don’t know what it is yet.’ It is this sense of the imminence of meaning not yet revealed that characterises focusing. The fruit of the felt sense is often an image or an evocative phrase, rather than a fully fledged story – such as the image quoted above of a startled animal, sensing danger, or the unknown, but not yet able to identify it. The first form that the emerging meaning takes is often poetic or symbolic, rather than literal and transparent. Focusing is not, of course, a new discovery (though turning it into a technology certainly fits with the Promethean spirit of the age). It is very akin, for example, to the Japanese concept of kufti, which D. T. Suzuki in Zen and Japanese Culture describes as: not just thinking with the head, but the state when the whole body is involved in and applied to the solving of a problem . . . It is the intellect that raises a question, but… ([Location 3477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3477))

- and let it work itself out quite independently of any kind of interfering consciousness . . . One may say, this is literally groping in the dark, there is nothing definite indicated, we are entirely lost in the maze.10 It may also have been Gendlin’s ‘felt sense’ which was referred to as thymos by the classical Greeks. Located in the phrenes, again the central part of the body – lungs, diaphragm, abdomen – thymos is that part of a person which ‘advises him on his course of action, it puts words into his mouth . . . He can converse with it, or with his “heart” or his “belly”, almost as man to man . . . For Homeric man the thymos tends not to be felt as part of the self: it commonly appears as an independent inner voice.’11 It appears that, in other cultures and other times, ‘thinking with the abdomen’ was a routine and familiar way of knowing. It is only in our contemporary European d-mode culture, dominated by the idea that thinking is the quick, conscious, controlled, cerebral manipulation of information, that the ability to think with the body has to be isolated, repackaged and taught as a novel kind of skill. With focusing one has, as with detection, a predetermined agenda – a problem to solve or clarify – and the process of dwelling on the details is therefore circumscribed and channelled by a purpose. There is openness and patience, but there is also a background monitoring of progress and relevance. However, the third way of paying… ([Location 3491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3491))

- by more urgent business, and of ways of knowing and seeing that are, perhaps, more intimate and less egocentric. As we gaze out to sea or up at a cloudless sky, listen to the sound of goat-bells across a valley or to a Beethoven quartet, we may sense something that lies beyond the preoccupations of daily life. We feel perhaps a kind of obscure wistfulness, a bitter-sweet nostalgia for some more natural, more simple facet of our own nature that has been neglected.12 Returning home from a day in the country, people commonly feel calmer, more whole, more balanced. We may not have understood anything, not arrived at any insights or answers, yet we may feel somehow transformed, as if something healing or important has been intimated, but not revealed. In some moods it is possible to gain glimpses of what seems to be knowledge or truth of a sort – of a rather deep sort, perhaps – which is nor an answer to a consciously held question; and which cannot be articulated clearly, literally, without losing precisely that quality which seems to make it most valuable. There is a kind of knowing which is essentially indirect, sideways, allusive and symbolic; which hints and evokes, touches and moves, in ways that resist explication. And it is accessed not through earnest manipulation of abstraction, but through leisurely contemplation of the particular. When we lose ourselves in the present, we do just that: lose our selves.

- in this single object, lives in it, loses itself in it.’13 One slips away from self-concern and preoccupation into the sheer presence of the thing, the scene, the sound itself, until, as Keats said:     Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought     As doth eternity . . . The ego, or the ‘self’, is essentially a network of preoccupations: a set of priorities that must be attended to in the interests of our survival, our wellbeing, or even our comfort. When the ego is in control of the mind, we act, perceive and think as if a wide variety of things – reputation, status, style, knowledgeability – mattered vitally, and as if their antitheses – unpopularity, ignorance and so on – constituted dire threats. When we are lost in the present, these conditioned longings fall away, and anxious striving may be replaced by a refreshing sense of peaceful belonging. Unskewed by hope or fear, perception is free simply to register what is there. As Hermann Hesse wrote in his essay ‘Concerning the soul’ in 1917: ‘The eye of desire dirties and distorts. Only when we desire nothing, only when our gaze becomes pure contemplation, does the soul of things (which is beauty) open itself to us.’ By its very nature, this more dispassionate, yet more intimate, way of knowing cannot be brought about by an effort of will. It arises, if it does at all, spontaneously. The experience is like that of seeing the three-dimensional form in a ‘Magic Eye’ image.… ([Location 3519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3519))

- in this state of patient incomprehension, then the details begin to dissolve and melt into one another, and a new kind of seeing spontaneously emerges, one which reveals the ‘hidden depths’ in the picture. There is no doubt when this revelation has occurred: it has a visceral impact which cannot be forced or feigned – just as the ‘getting’ of a joke is a spontaneous, bodily occurrence that cannot be engineered. Someone who ‘thinks’ they see the image, like someone who ‘understands’ a joke, simply has not got it. Though poetic sensibility cannot be commanded, it can, as with the three-dimensional visual image, be encouraged. One can make oneself prone to it by cultivating the ability to wait – to remain attentive in the face of incomprehension – which Keats famously referred to as ‘negative capability’: ‘when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.’ To wait in this way requires a kind of inner security; the confidence that one may lose clarity and control without losing one’s self. Keats’s description of negative capability came in a letter to his brothers, following an evening spent in discussion with his friend Charles Dilke – a man who, as Keats put it, could not ‘feel he had a personal identity unless he had made up his mind about everything’; and who would ‘never come at a truth so long as he lives; because he is always trying at it’.14 The domination of culture and education by… ([Location 3534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3534))

- they are much better than older children and adults at producing and using metaphors. Psychologists Howard Gardner and Ellen Winner have found that three- and four-year-old children produce many more appropriate metaphors for a situation than do seven- and eleven-year-olds, and all children are much more fluent users and creators of spontaneous metaphor than college students.15 And Wordsworth, in his ‘Ode to Immortality’, famously bemoans the loss of his childhood ways of knowing.     There was a time when meadow, grove and stream,     The earth, and every common sight,     To me did seem     Apparelled in celestial light,     The glory and the freshness of a dream.     It is not now as it hath been of yore; –     Turn whereso’er I may,     By night or day,     The things which I have seen I now can see no more. It may well have been the child’s ability to be lost in the present that prompted the following exchange: ‘Come along!’ the nurse said to Félicité de la Mennais, eight years old, ‘you have looked long enough at those waves and everyone is going away’. The answer: ‘ils regardent ce que je regarde, mais ils ne voient pas ce… ([Location 3548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3548))

- wait and see. As Jacques Maritain, author of the monumental Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry, has said of ‘poetic intuition’: It cannot be improved in itself; it demands only to be listened to. But the poet can make himself better prepared for or available to it by removing obstacles and noise. He can guard and protect it, and thus foster the spontaneous progress of its strength and purity in him. He can educate himself to it by never betraying it.17 Many writers and artists have commented on the quality of knowing that emerges from patient absorption. Kafka, in his ‘Reflections’, says: ‘You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Do not even listen, simply wait. Do not even wait, be quite still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.’18 T. S. Eliot in ‘East Coker’ enjoins us to ‘be still, and wait without hope/for hope would be hope for the wrong thing’.19 Martin Heidegger’s Discourse on Thinking puts it very clearly. Normally when we wait we wait for something which interests us, or can provide us with what we want. When we wait in this human way, waiting involves our desires, goals and needs. But waiting need not be so definitely coloured… ([Location 3566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3566))

- Rainer Maria Rilke, in his Letters to a Young Poet, has this advice for his self-appointed poetic apprentice: If you hold to Nature, to the simplicity that is in her, to the small detail that scarcely one man sees, which can so unexpectedly grow into something great and boundless; if you have this love for insignificant things and seek, simply as one who serves, to win the confidence of what seems to be poor: then everything will become easier for you, more coherent and somehow more conciliatory, not perhaps in the understanding, which lags wondering behind, but in your innermost consciousness, wakefulness and knowing.21 Poetic sensibility is available to everyone. It is not the special preserve of Poets with a capital P: people who deliberately create those forms of words called ‘poems’. To be a Poet it is necessary to see ‘poetically’: necessary, but not sufficient. In addition, the Poet must be able to use language in such a way that the reader of the poem is invited not just into the Poet’s world, but into the same mental mode, the same slow, poetic way of knowing, that gave rise to the poem in the first place. When we look at things in their own right, without referring them immediately to our own self-interest – which is what the poet invites us to do – then we are in a mode of sensing, knowing and learning that can reveal to us aspects of the world that… ([Location 3581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NLL76U2&location=3581))
