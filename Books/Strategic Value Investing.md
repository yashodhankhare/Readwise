## Highlights
- All intelligent investing is value investing—acquiring more than you are paying for. You must value the business in order to value the stock. —Charlie Munger ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=66))
- What is value investing? Like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder. Some view value investing as purchasing shares of companies that have been beaten down and are out of favor—selling at a cheap price relative to other available investments. Others may define value investing in contrast to something else—typically growth investing. Stock indices are often broken down into value and growth components, and a stock must either be classified under the value category or the growth category, but not both. In practice, however, value investing is not so limiting or narrow. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=69))
- Ideally, the shares in the company should be trading at a price that is less than the intrinsic value of the shares and hence be considered a value stock. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=75))
- Value investing can be characterized by the practice of buying companies when their intrinsic value exceeds ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=84))
- the current market price and selling companies when the current market price exceeds their intrinsic value. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=85))
- At its core, value investing is indeed contrarian by nature; it does something different from other types of investing. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=87))
- Intrinsic value is what ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=95))
- we should be willing to pay for the asset based on our assessment of its current fundamentals and long-term prospects. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=95))
- Ideally, one would like to think that there is a single measure of intrinsic value that all value investors would agree upon. The truth is, however, that intrinsic value is in the eye of the beholder. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=98))
- A single intrinsic value is rarely obtainable except with hindsight and may be unknowable even then (except perhaps when a company is liquidated). Whether a value investor purchased the stock at a good ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=100))
- price is recognizable only as time passes. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=102))
- Balance sheet or book value is therefore not a good measure of what the assets of the company are currently worth. Further, not all assets are reflected on a company’s balance sheet (such as ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=106))
- the value of the company’s employee workforce) so book value is even further removed from the value of the company as a whole. At times, value investors may look at book value to approximate what it might cost a company to replace and rebuild or what might be obtained in an orderly liquidation. However, book value is generally not a realistic measure of the value of a company as a going concern. That said, as we shall see later, book value can be a useful benchmark against which we can measure the degree to which a stock might be considered a value stock. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=108))
- Skeptics of equity investing claim that the stock market is simply a gamble, like trying your luck in Las Vegas. Although at times it may seem like that, nothing could be further from the truth. The underlying economics of gambling on one hand and financial markets on the other are starkly different. When we go to Las Vegas and play a fair game of chance, we cannot expect to consistently win or lose over a long time period. When we consider the house’s take, we can expect to lose over repeated trials.1 In contrast, investors can ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=113))
    - Note: Read the footnote at the end of the para marked 1
- reasonably expect to earn a positive return on their investment as compensation for delaying consumption and bearing risk. Investing emphasizes the long term, and returns are derived from income and capital gains. Gambling, or speculating, is more often than not short-term oriented and is typically less focused on income and capital gains. It should be said that speculating often gets a bad rap, and speculators are often demonized in the popular press. We do not share that view because, within certain parameters, speculators perform important economic functions in capital markets, such as providing liquidity. That said, our focus in this book is on investing. Investing involves:   1. An analysis of the current state of the economy ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=116))
- and its future trajectory; 2. An evaluation of which industries are expected to do well in that economic environment; and 3. An evaluation of the companies within the industry that are priced below their intrinsic value given the state of the economy, the industry, and the fundamental characteristics of the company (earnings, cash flows, assets, liabilities, and the like).   Defined in this way, one could argue that all investing could be considered value investing. Too often, however, what is called investing is merely speculation. The purchase of a security with the hope that a buyer will pay a higher price for it at a later date—perhaps because its price had been following a similar trajectory in the past—is ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=122))
- speculation, not investing. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending upon your perspective, hope is not a strategy. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=128))
- Market efficiency requires rational economic behavior, which is something often lacking in market participants. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=157))
- In fact, we would prefer that they are not efficient. Inefficiencies create opportunities for price and value to diverge—exactly the types of opportunities value investors need to be able to exploit. So bring on the biases and anomalies! ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=163))
- As noted earlier, stocks are ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=166))
- often classified as either value or growth. Value stocks are those selling at a low price relative to some underlying fundamental factor, such as earnings. Growth stocks are those whose price reflects future expectations about the company’s future growth. Why might we expect to pay more for a growth stock relative to its current earnings? If earnings are expected to grow in the future, then—all else being equal—the stock should be priced higher. However, this dichotomy is arbitrary. In reality, an… ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=166))
- As noted earlier, value investing is contrarian. A value investor perceives that the intrinsic value of a company’s shares differ from the current market price—perhaps because of short-term imbalances in supply and demand,… ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=174))
- never makes a decision based on price alone. Price is always compared to intrinsic value, and intrinsic value is measured (or estimated, as we shall see) based on fundamental data about the economy, industry, and company. On the other hand, momentum investing (not to be confused with growth investing although the two are often confused by market participants and pundits) involves buying shares or other securities that have exhibited strong recent increases in prices—in essence, going with the flow or investing with the crowd. Momentum investing is quite different from value investing. Value investors should not be lured into… ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=176))

In this circumstance, the key for the value investor is to determine when the price has reached or exceeded fair value, given all available information, and exits the investment. The decision on when to sell is the most difficult… ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=181))

- extraordinarily profitable in earnings and cash-flow terms, but in order to be a good investment, it must… ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=186))
- Warren Buffett famously remarked that investing is like playing hockey. Players do not go to where the puck is; they go to where the puck is going to be. In the same way, a strategic value investor anticipates price changes by identifying discrepancies between price and underlying fundamentals.… ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=189))

- Overall, Berkshire and its long-term shareholders ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=247))
- benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices. So when the market plummets—as it will from time to time—neither panic nor mourn. It’s good news for Berkshire. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=247))
- Buffett noted that all of these investors had outstanding records and were value investors of the Graham and Dodd school. However, each approached value somewhat differently and held different securities in their portfolios. Buffett notes that the main commonality is the viewpoint that these investors are buying companies and not stocks, while exploiting divergences between market prices and intrinsic value. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=258))
- Value investors do not take investing lightly; they do their homework, only investing when there is a sufficient discount of price to intrinsic value to create an adequate margin of safety. For those of you who are sports enthusiasts, both Buffett and Klarman use a baseball analogy. Value investors do not swing at every pitch—they wait for pitches in the ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=265))
- sweet spot. For those of you who are poker players, this is analogous to not playing every hand. You need to know when to hold them and know when to fold them. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=268))
- Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: “value” and “growth.” … In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=280))
- importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=282))
- One of the most important studies of purported market inefficiency was published in 1985 by Werner DeBondt and Richard Thaler in the Journal of Finance. Their research demonstrated that we may be able to predict future price movements simply based on past movements, which is an apparent violation of the weak form of market ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=297))
- efficiency we described in the previous chapter, at least in the extremes. Before this time, researchers had great difficulty demonstrating that past price movements told us much about future price movements. DeBondt and Thaler showed that if an ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=299))
- investor were to purchase the 35 stocks that dropped the most in price over the previous three years of all the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange from 1933 to 1980, they would have outperformed the market by about 20 percent over a subsequent three-year period. If that same investor were to have purchased the 35 best-performing stocks over the previous three years, they would have underperformed the market by 5 percent over the subsequent three-year period, for a total difference between the winning and losing portfolio of about 25 percent. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=301))
- More recently, Stephen Foerster of the University of Western Ontario looked at stocks that have doubled over a four-year period. In a 2011 study, he finds that stocks that have doubled in the previous four-year period have a cumulative underperformance of 28 percent in the next four-year period. Those that double more quickly (say, in less than 12 months) underperform by 53 percent over the subsequent four-year period. All of this implies, of course, that nondoublers outperform by these margins. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=305))
- Earning returns like these in the real world is very different than documenting them in a hypothetical study. For one thing, these studies ignore bid-ask spreads, commissions, market impact, and other transaction costs. It’s also fair to ask whether one is really comparing apples to apples if the risk profile of the loser portfolio is different from the risk profile of the winner portfolio. Even if these kinds of results were achievable moving forward, it would take nerves of steel and a titanium backbone to implement such a contrarian strategy. We will discuss the barriers to successful strategic value investing, some of which relate to emotional fortitude, in the next chapter. Suffice it to say for now, however, that successful value investing often requires investors to be contrarian or go against the grain of prevailing market sentiment as described in Box 2-1. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=309))
- So, although strategic value investing is a promising investment philosophy, it is often a contrarian strategy and not the path of least resistance. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=338))
- Nor is strategic value investing for the impatient investor. As we mentioned previously, the results of the DeBondt and Thaler study hold for different portfolio formation and holding periods. However, it is worth noting that the returns between the portfolio of winners and losers as much as 12 months after they had been chosen are virtually indistinguishable. The positive results were achieved for a three-year holding period. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=340))
- Over shorter time horizons, stocks tend to exhibit momentum rather than contrarian tendencies, which can further test the resolve of the strategic value investor. For example, Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman of UCLA demonstrated in the 1990s that individual stocks that performed the best over the previous 3 to 12 months outperformed stocks that had performed the worst. The forward-looking period of outperformance is about another 3 to 12 months, and the general results have been confirmed in subsequent studies. The most pronounced effect is buying (selling) 12-month winners (losers) and holding (shorting) them for another 3 months, which produces a return of over 1 percent per month. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=347))
- These types of trading strategies ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=352))
- are often referred to as relative strength strategies and are not considered value strategies. Like any study of past returns, we should not be led to believe that just because they prevailed in the past that they will necessarily prevail in the future. The Jegadeesh and Titman effect is less pronounced than the long-term price reversals that DeBondt and Thaler demonstrate, but they too suggest that markets may not be efficient. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=353))
- Although capitalizing on price reversals is one variety of value investing, we should not be misled into believing that value investing is necessarily predicated on this kind of technical analysis or contrarian sentiment. We mentioned growth at a reasonable price in the previous chapter as an example. In fact, value investing (and especially “strategic” value investing) is associated ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=356))
- much more strongly with fundamental analysis than technical analysis. Technical analysis focuses exclusively on past price and trading volume changes to predict future price changes. Fundamental analysis, on the other hand, focuses on evaluating firm, sector, and market characteristics as a means to estimate a security’s intrinsic value. We believe that strategic value investing is most powerful when it is based primarily on fundamental investing, which will be the focus of this book. That said, however, an awareness of a security’s past performance and an understanding of how past performance can potentially relate to future performance is a great way to augment solid fundamental analysis. In fact, value investors sometimes use technical indicators to identify entry points for companies identified as value opportunities through fundamental analysis (and subsequent exit points when it is time to ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=359))
- sell). ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=365))
- We will say more about the different ways value investing is defined in Chapter 6, but suffice it to say for the time being that Fama and French focus on a stock’s price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The price-to-book ratio is a stock’s current price divided by the net balance sheet (book) value of the stock. Book value is the recorded accounting “value” of the firm’s assets (which can either be their cost or some estimate of the value at which they could ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=372))
- be sold) minus the accounting “value” of the firm’s liabilities. In other words, the P/B ratio measures the market’s perception of the stock versus what the underlying assets are “worth” from an accounting sense. Stocks with P/B ratios in the lowest 30th percentile at the beginning of a given year are considered value stocks (they are selling for a low price relative to their underlying net assets), while stocks with P/B ratios in the highest 30th percentile are considered growth stocks for that year.2 ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=376))
- It is foolish to talk about return without also talking about risk. With investments, risk is often measured as the variability of returns. One common way we measure this return variability is by standard deviation, a statistical measure that describes how uncertain or variable the average return has been. It incorporates more information than simply the highest and lowest values. For normally distributed returns (we will say more about what that means shortly, as well as how real life returns depart from normality), we can expect the return in any given year to fall within one standard deviation of the average about two-thirds of the time. For example, the standard deviation ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=394))
- for the overall market is 20.3 percent, and the average return is 11.8 percent. Therefore, we would expect the overall stock market to record a return within –8.5 percent and 32.1 percent in any given year about two-thirds of the time. We derive these figures by subtracting the standard deviation from the average return and adding the standard deviation to the average return. This range is quite large because the standard deviation is relatively high, which is an indication of risk and the overall stock market. The range defined by adding and subtracting one standard deviation from the mean will tend to capture only about two-thirds of the returns. If we want to be more than two-thirds confident that the return in a given year will fall within a particular range, we need to widen the range to capture more of the returns. We ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=399))
- can expect returns to fall within two standard deviations of the average about 95 percent of the time. Therefore, we would expect the overall stock market to record a return within –28.8 percent and 52.4 percent in any given year. Because this range is so wide, it is not terribly informative. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=405))
- Small capitalization stocks generally have higher standard deviations than large capitalization stocks regardless of whether they are considered to be value or growth. Interestingly, ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=410))
- however, small capitalization value stocks actually have a slightly lower standard deviation than small-cap growth stocks (32.9 percent compared to 32.4 percent, respectively). ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=411))
- Because we should not view either return or risk in isolation, we need to come up with a way to view the two together. In the industry, a common way to do this is to look at the Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio compares the average excess return on a risky investment with its standard deviation. Excess return is the average return on a risky investment (like the stock market) less what could have been earned on a risk-free investment (like three-month Treasury bills). The ratio of this excess return to the standard deviation is called the Sharpe ratio. Therefore, investments with a high standard deviation are penalized under the Sharpe ratio and investments ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=418))
- with high return are rewarded. The Sharpe ratio for the overall stock market was about 0.404 from 1926 to 2012. Although large capitalization value stocks were more volatile during this period, their higher average return more than compensated for the extra risk. Their Sharpe ratio was 0.405. By contrast, the Sharpe ratio for large capitalization growth stocks was only 0.372. On this basis, it seems as if the reward from value investing more than compensates for the added risk. The risk-adjusted performance edge of value investing is even more pronounced among small capitalization stocks. Among small capitalization stocks, value stocks have a Sharpe ratio of 0.471 compared to 0.314. That is a remarkable differential. It is important to note, as well, that ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=422))
- this is an attractive result before we even become “strategic” about our value investing, which we will discuss in more detail in the following pages. By “strategic,” we mean being thoughtful about the characteristics of a particular security rather than blindly applying some sort of trading or classification rule. If we are successful in adding a strategic element to our investing, then we can expect risk-adjusted performance to improve further. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=428))
- It bears emphasizing that because this “average” return is not consistent, there is considerable variability around the average. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=432))
- The measure of “average” that we had been using thus far is the simple arithmetic average with which we are all familiar. The problem with this measure is that it overestimates the amount of capital we will accumulate over time. Specifically, although the stock market has an overall return of 11.8 percent per year, we ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=437))
- cannot simply compound this return over a specified number of years to estimate how much money we are likely to have in the future. For example, if we can earn 11.8 percent consistently each year for 10 years, we will triple our money. That is, $1,000 will grow to just over $3,000. If this average return is not consistent, however, we will accumulate less. The more volatile the returns are over this time period, the less we will accumulate. This phenomenon is called the volatility drag, which is determined in large part by the standard deviation. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=440))
- This is not some numerical trickery. The higher the standard deviation, the… ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=447))
- So, we need to be just as concerned about variability of return as we are about the average returns themselves. The geometric mean allows us to incorporate both these factors. The geometric… ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=450))
- consistently year in and year out, would produce the same result as the arithmetic average return with variability. In Table 2-1, you can see that the annual geometric mean to large-cap value investing is two percentage points greater than the large-cap growth investing. In the small-cap universe, it’s almost five percentage points greater. The greater geometric mean implies that we would have accumulated more capital with value stocks than with growth stocks over this period, even after… ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=452))
- This performance differential can become larger when the returns are not “normal.” The traditional bell curve in which observations tend to be symmetrically clustered around a central result is considered normal. In addition, bell curve observations farther away from the average are less common. One way returns might not be normal is if they are skewed. In other words, they are not symmetrically distributed on either side of the average. For example, a distribution is negatively skewed when some returns below the average are more extreme than returns above the average. It is positively skewed when some returns above the average are more… ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=458))
- the amount of capital on which we can earn future returns and reduces our compounding effect. Unfortunately, according to Table 2-1, the stock market exhibits negative skewness. That is, some negative outcomes are more extreme than the positive outcomes. As a result, it becomes more difficult to accumulate capital over time when a few really bad years dissolve the capital base on which to earn future returns. So, skewness can really hurt (or help) our ability to accumulate capital, even when average returns and standard deviations are the same. Interestingly, value stocks do not tend to exhibit the same negative skewness that the… ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=464))
- Another way in which returns may not be “normal” is if returns farther away from the center of the distribution, or the average, are more or less frequent than the bell curve would suggest. We can measure the frequency of extreme occurrences with something called kurtosis. When extremely positive or negative returns are more common than the bell curve would suggest, those returns are said to exhibit excess kurtosis. As a result, the returns are more risky than a limited examination of only standard deviation would suggest. In other words, there is hidden risk that our traditional measure of volatility does not capture. So, we want to be aware of it. Return distributions such… ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=470))
- markets exhibit such unpredictable, yet catastrophic, events that they completely change the frame of reference from then on. Currencies becoming nearly worthless, the crash of tulipmania, and the unexpected default of sovereign debt can all be considered black swans. The difference between fat tails and black swans is that black swans are even rarer and more extreme than what we would normally classify as a fat tail. To help put this concept in perspective, consider October 19, 1987, known as Black Monday. On this day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined by 22.6 percent in a single day—a very unexpected and unprecedented event. In fact, to this day that loss is still the record daily percentage loss on the DJIA. If you examine the daily stock returns on the DJIA from inception (October 1, 1928) through September 23, 2011 (20,839 days), you will find that the daily average return was 0.025 percent with a standard deviation of 1.16 percent. Extreme events, which we will define as positive or negative daily returns in excess of three standard deviations (also known as three-sigma events) away from the average, should occur only 0.27 percent of the time or on about 56 days during this time period. Unfortunately the daily returns are not strictly… ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=476))
- So, how do return, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis all pan out? What’s the bottom line? You can see how the additional return associated with value investing tends to compensate for the additional variability and, in some cases, excess kurtosis. In Figure 2-1, every dollar invested in small-cap value strategy in 1926 grew to over $89,000 in 2012 compared to only $2,100 for a small-cap growth strategy.

- Therefore, the higher returns and more favorable skewness associated with value investing tends to more than compensate for its higher variability and greater incidence of extreme events (e.g., “fat tails”). In reading Figure 2-1, note that the Y-axis is logarithmic, which means that vertical increments relate to percent changes rather than absolute changes. For example, each major increment on the Y-axis relates to a tenfold increase. We do this because the numbers grow very large compared to their initial values, and a traditional scale would make it difficult to read the smaller figures. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=507))
- The point is that strategic value investing tends to work, but not necessarily each and every year. Although it can be variable and a bit of a roller coaster ride (note 2008 in the preceding figure), the ride is worth it. To reiterate a point we made earlier, value investing takes some ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=516))
- fortitude and discipline, as well as a long-term mindset. Investors who are easily swayed by market sentiment have difficulty implementing true value strategies.

- It should be clear by now that not only do value and growth stocks exhibit different return characteristics, they also have different risk characteristics. Professionals disagree about why this might be the case. One group argues that investors fundamentally underestimate the growth prospects of out-of-favor value stocks. The market is consistently surprised when things turn out better than expected. This tendency for markets to ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=522))
- be repeatedly “fooled” would seem to indicate that markets are inefficient. That is, markets do not properly incorporate the impact of new information on security prices when the information arrives, presumably because investors let their cognitive and emotional biases get the best of them. Another camp argues that the higher returns associated with value stocks reflect fundamentally higher risk levels associated with value stocks. Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny (1994) try to disentangle this puzzle. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=524))

- The Financial Analysts Journal study shows that the initial reaction to earnings surprises is more muted for value stocks than for glamour stocks.

Not to have the wool pulled over their eyes again, investors more than made up for the missed opportunity by doubling the rate at which they committed capital to equity funds through the end of 1999 and the beginning of 2000. In fact, we have not seen that rate of capital commitment since then. Of course, this all happened after the market had already rebounded. We all know what happened next. The tech bubble burst, and we entered a multiyear bear market. Not only did investors reduce their rate of investment in equity mutual funds during this period when the S&P 500 lost half its value, they actually started pulling money out, especially in 2002, right before the market strongly rebounded.

As a subset of the parent company, a subsidiary cannot be worth more than the parent unless all the other parts of the parent company combined have a negative value.11 ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=824))
    - Note: Does Apple's services business have negative stub value?
- Pristine arbitrage opportunities are extremely difficult to come by. That said, it is not uncommon for the market value of the parent company to be less than the value of one of its subsidiaries. As implausible as it seems, Mark Mitchell, Todd Pulvino, and Erik Stafford examined 82 such situations from 1985 to 2000.

- Other People’s Money. It is one thing to manage your own money. You may be a very patient soul and have complete confidence that time will eventually reveal the wisdom of your investment decisions.

- Investment Diary To help overcome investment challenges, Joachim Klement (2009) also suggests keeping a financial diary for each investment decision and comparing it to the outcome of the decision.

The investment thesis (i.e., motivation). In a sentence, briefly articulate the reason for the trade. For a buy decision, it might be something like:     “The breakup value of the assets exceeds the current market price.”     “The firm is a takeover candidate.”     “Worst case sales growth exceeds market expectations and produces an intrinsic value in ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=984))

- There are literally tens of thousands of companies in which you could invest. As we will see in later chapters, analysis and valuation of these companies takes time. Therefore, you need a way to strategically identify those companies for further analysis and valuation. In this chapter, we discuss alternative methods of identifying good strategic value investments. While each investor may have his own method of analysis, there are two basic styles, top-down or bottom-up, as depicted in Figure 4-1. As the titles suggest, a top-down investor first analyzes the economy as a whole, then industries, and finally tries to identify firms within the selected industry expected to outperform rivals relative to expectations. From a value investor’s perspective you must also determine whether these companies are a good value relative to other potential investments. A bottom-up investor first identifies companies and then considers industry and economy-wide dynamics when deciding whether or not to invest. Central to each methodology is a consideration of the broader economy and industry, as well as an analysis of the individual firm. We will provide an overview of these processes in this chapter with a primary focus on analysis of the economy and industries. We will also introduce company analysis—a topic that is critical to value investors. We will provide more details on company analysis in the next chapter.

An analysis of the global/domestic economy is first performed to determine what portion of a portfolio will be allocated to international and domestic equities.

Bottom-up analysis is used by both growth and value-oriented investors. A growth-oriented investor may screen for companies with high revenue or earnings growth. A value investor may screen for companies with low price multiples (for example, price-to-book and price-to-earnings) and a high return on equity. Strategies may also be combined, for example by looking for high-growth companies selling at reasonable price multiples (sometimes referred to as “growth at a reasonable price,” or GARP).

- In 1979 the Harvard Business Review published an article by a young and relatively unknown economist named Michael Porter.5 The article, entitled “How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy,” has become a staple of business school education and has shaped the way a generation of business strategists and financial analysts approach industry analysis. Porter’s model offers the strategic value investor a framework for approaching the question of the sustainability of an industry, and, by extension, a firm’s business model—integral aspects of the investment decision-making process. Although we will briefly describe the five individual competitive forces, it is incumbent upon the investor to consider them holistically and not simply focus on one or two of the individual factors. Additionally, Porter urges analysts to focus not simply on a snapshot of the industry structure in time but also on anticipated changes in the competitive forces—in Buffett’s terms, skating to where the puck is going to be. According to Porter, the five competitive forces that determine industry profitability are: Threat of new entrants Bargaining power of suppliers Bargaining power of buyers Threat of substitute products or services Rivalry among existing firms ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1270))
- Each of these competitive forces has multiple elements that determine the overall level of competition. The threat of new entrants is a function of capital requirements, government policy, and ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1283))
- access to distribution (among other elements). Some industries are simply much easier to enter than other industries. Contrast, for example, the passenger airline industry and the restaurant industry. The airline industry has a much lower threat of new entrants than the restaurant industry as a result of larger capital requirements to purchase planes, government policy regarding regulation/deregulation, and higher costs to access distribution (landing and gate rights), to cite a few factors. On the other hand, the restaurant industry is relatively easy to enter—all one really needs is a location, an idea, and a knack for delivering meals that people are willing to pay for. All else equal, industries that have significant barriers to entry are more attractive. However, the fact that an industry is difficult ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1284))

Supplier bargaining power is impacted primarily by supplier concentration, switching costs, and differentiation of inputs. When you look at suppliers, you are looking at suppliers of all of the factors of production. Here again, the passenger airline industry has not been very attractive. There are a limited number of airplane manufacturers (e.g., Boeing and Airbus).

- who are unionized—and there are no alternatives to those groups—the balance of power tips heavily with suppliers in the passenger airline industry. The third competitive force is the power of buyers. Buyers are more powerful if there are a relatively few buyers or if the buyers purchase in large volumes. However, buyers are also powerful if the industry’s products are considered homogeneous or standardized. An industry that has difficulty differentiating its product (in essence, a commodity business) cedes a great deal of power to buyers. The passenger airline industry is certainly not attractive on this… ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1295))
- This issue has certainly been exacerbated in recent years by the proliferation of travel websites such as Expedia.com and Travelocity.com and the ease with which consumers can shop for flights on the basis of fare. Airlines have tried to differentiate their products by creating loyalty programs and providing frequent travelers with upgrades and other benefits. These developments have led to more loyalty on the part of business passengers. Still, the balance of power in the passenger airline industry falls on the side of buyers.

Several years ago, many contended that videoconferencing would reduce business travel substantially. Despite extensive promotion, technological advances, increased travel hassles with tighter security, and a poor economy in recent years, videoconferencing has not eroded the popularity of business airline travel. The final competitive force cited by Porter is rivalry among existing competitors. Rivalry is partly a function of industry growth, barriers to exit, and current industry… ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1307))
- the overall market. High exit barriers that are due, for instance, to specialized assets result in increased rivalry among competitors. A large number of similarly sized competitors results in more rivalry, as no firm is really seen as the industry leader. The passenger airline industry is characterized by substantial rivalry among competitors and has resulted in fierce price wars, weakening market participants. However, just because the economics of an industry appear poor doesn’t mean that it is foolish to invest in firms within that industry. Nor does it mean that firms cannot create a long-term, sustainable business model. In order to prosper in a competitive industry environment, a company must engage in a well-defined competitive strategy, such as cost leadership or product differentiation. Southwest Airlines has been profitable for years pursuing a low-cost strategy. Its success is the result of entering cities and driving weaker competitors out of business on the basis of price. In essence, Southwest Airlines is the Walmart of the airline industry. It remains to be seen, however, if this strategy will continue to succeed as Southwest enters new markets and expands its flight offerings. The investor cannot be lulled into believing that the status quo in the market will extend indefinitely into the future. Other similar firms, such as Jet Blue, recognized the successful business model of Southwest and have adopted it as their own. While the five competitive forces may simply resemble a qualitative list, an astute investor can actually quantify many of the factors. For instance, one can look at… ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1312))

- is an analysis of the industry life cycle, that is, an analysis of the viability of an industry over time. It is informative for an investor to understand what stage of the industry life cycle characterizes a particular industry. This will allow the investor to estimate the potential future growth for the industry as a whole and for the subject firm. The industry life cycle theory postulates that there are four phases that delineate the beginning to the end of an industry: the pioneer, growth, mature, and decline phases. The pioneer stage is when the industry is attempting to establish a market for its products. This stage is characterized by venture capital financing and high failure rates. Industries in the pioneer stage are generally not profitable, as they are investing heavily and are, by nature, quite speculative. Often, market participants are overly optimistic about the prospects for industries and firms within the industry during this stage. The Internet boom of the late 1990s is a prime example of an industry in the pioneer stage. Think of how many firms failed as a truly revolutionary and successful technological innovation, the Internet, fueled rampant speculation about the potential for e-commerce. Many Internet-based firms went public and speculation sent the NASDAQ index soaring. It turns out that only a small percentage of those firms had a business model that was viable in the long term, and many investors lost substantial sums as the industry winners and losers were being identified. In the growth stage, ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1334))
- the market for the product or service being produced has been established and is well recognized. Many successful growth industries create markets for products that consumers didn’t even recognize that they needed. This stage is also characterized by increasing applications of an existing product or technology. A current example of an industry in the growth stage is the Global Positioning System (GPS) industry and all of the applications that it has spawned. GPS technology has applications in the automobile, outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segments, to name a few. GPS technology is replacing the need for physical… ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1346))
- enjoy large profit margins, as it takes time for potential competitors to ramp up and participate in a burgeoning industry. Growth stock investors typically look for firms in the growth stage of the industry life cycle. The third stage of the industry life cycle is the mature stage. The overall growth rate of industries in the mature stage matches that of the overall economy as a whole. The products or services produced by industries in the mature stage have become staples to consumers. Examples of industries in the mature stage are the passenger airline industry, the automobile industry, and the food service industry. Firms in industries in the mature stage of the industry life cycle can certainly grow at rates higher than the industry as a whole. The industry life cycle looks at the industry in aggregate rather than at individual firms within the industry. Firms in this situation can typically grow in two ways. First, a firm can gain market share at the expense of other competitors. For example, the passenger airline industry is in the mature stage, while a relatively recent entrant like Jet Blue has a growing market share within that mature industry. Second, a firm can gain market share by acquiring other firms within the industry via a merger or… ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1351))

- Morningstar has adopted the concept of an economic moat and classifies them into five main types: low-cost producer, switching costs, the network effect, efficient scale, and intangible assets.7 As described earlier, in the retailing industry, Walmart has adopted the low-cost producer strategy and has built a fairly wide ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1370))
- moat, allowing the firm to have an astonishing market share of over 10 percent of the enormous U.S. retailing market. However, in 2010, Walmart’s market share actually fell to 13.4 percent from the 2009 market share of 13.9 percent of the U.S. market. Some analysts believe that this is a signal that the Walmart economic moat is being breached by other competitors, chiefly due to the changing nature of e-commerce. Just the fact that the durability of the Walmart economic moat is being challenged by some observers should serve as a warning to investors that assuming a business model can exist forever is fraught with peril. A firm can enjoy an economic moat by operating in an environment characterized by high switching costs. Switching costs are one-time inconveniences or expenses that a customer must incur in order to change from one product to another. Often, the costs are not monetary but rather involve consumer time and effort. Cell phone companies (Verizon and AT&T) have pricing models that encourage consumers to stay with their current provider by establishing high switching costs and making it difficult to switch carriers. Bundling goods and services is an effective way of increasing the switching costs and widening that economic moat. Deep and wide economic moats can be created by firms in which a strong network effect is evident. A network effect occurs when the value of a good or service increases as more people use that particular good or service. FedEx is a prime example of a firm that has a strong network effect. As ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1373))

- In order to really assess how the company performed in generating profits, we need to remove “size” as a factor. We can do this in two different ways: We can calculate each income statement item as a percentage of revenue for the same year (analysts call this vertical common size analysis) or we can compute the year-over-year change for each item (analysts call this horizontal common size analysis).

- We should also spend a little time considering what led to the increase in revenues. Did the company sell more goods in every store, did they open more stores, or were other factors involved? In the MD&A section, the company states that same store sales in the United States actually declined year over year. In other words, revenue at stores that had been open in both years actually declined 0.6 percent. This is worrisome, but perhaps not unexpected given the poor economic environment. The majority of the increase in revenues came from the opening of new ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1530))

([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1533))
- Within the operating section it is also useful to examine the relationship between net income and operating cash flow. Ideally, you would like to see operating cash flow higher than net income. In fact, over the long-term, operating cash flow should exceed net income due to noncash expenses like depreciation on equipment (remember cash paid for equipment belongs in the investing section). However, in any particular year, operating cash flow can be less than or greater than net income. For example, if the company is making a lot of credit sales to customers, the company will be generating net income but no cash flow from those sales in the current period. However, if you see that operating cash flow is consistently lower than net income, closer scrutiny of the details is warranted. The company could simply be in a growth phase, or it could be that it is having problems collecting from customers. You can examine the investing section in more detail to determine where the company is making investments. In Walmart’s case, the vast majority of investments are for property and equipment as they open new stores. A much smaller amount is used for acquisitions. As we will see later, an important concept for the value investor is free cash flow—how much excess cash flow the company generates from operations that could be used to repay owners. A simple measure ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1602))
- of free cash flow (we will cover this concept more extensively in Chapter 8) is operating income minus capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment). Value investors love to see companies that generate free cash flow because doing so indicates that the company can fund its own growth through operations with cash left over for the owners. It is good sign that management is avoiding unwise capital investments, choosing instead to (hopefully) return the excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock repurchases (see next paragraph). In Walmart’s case, the company is generating about $11 billion of free cash flow. Lastly, we can take a look at how the company is spending its free cash flow (or, alternatively, where it is getting financing to pay ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1611))
- for any cash flow deficit) by examining the financing cash flow section. Walmart is spending most of its excess cash flow returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchasing its own stock in the open market. This is a good sign for value investors: Investors are receiving cash flows through dividends, and the company likely views its own stock as undervalued. Interestingly, the company is also a net borrower. It is issuing more new debt than it is repaying, and this cash is supplementing the free cash flow to repurchase stock. This is very likely due to the low interest rate environment—management believes that they can earn more on borrowed funds than the cost of those funds—and we should expect to see the debt ratios on the balance sheet (see next section) increase somewhat, as well. In a nutshell, Walmart’s cash flow statement… ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=1617))

By contrast, the bottom-up approach would involve the analyst building a sales forecast from smaller units and the company.

The less confident you are about the main value drivers and the more sensitive intrinsic value is to those inputs, the greater the required margin of safety. Also, all investment decisions should be considered within the context of your overall portfolio, not in isolation.

- Suppose an investor decided to diversify their portfolio of oil stocks with gold, copper, and other commodity-based companies. These additions provide some insulation against oil price declines. However, oil, gold, copper, and other commodities are driven to a large extent by the same macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and the value of the U.S. dollar.

Relative value measures market value in relation to fundamental value, which can be expressed in a number of ways discussed in the following pages.

- Because earnings may fluctuate dramatically from one quarter and one year to the next, analysts often calculate a normalized P/E ratio, which uses the average earnings over the most recent full business cycle in the denominator in an attempt to smooth cyclical fluctuations. As if that were not enough variations on a theme, some analysts adjust earnings for extraordinary items. ([Location 2183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2183))

- point is that when you read about the P/E ratio, you understand how it is calculated. Moreover, when pundits compare it to the market or other stocks in the industry, it is important that they are comparing apples to apples and that the benchmark ratios used as a point of reference are calculated in an identical fashion. For example, comparing the forward P/E for Monsanto with the trailing P/E of the market or industry would not be meaningful and would likely make Monsanto look more attractive than it would on a more contemporaneous and comparable basis. ([Location 2186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2186))
- The strategic value investor also needs to have a sense of what constitutes a high versus a low P/E ratio. Table 6-2 displays P/E ratios based on trailing 12-month earnings as of June 2011. The median P/E ratio at that ([Location 2190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2190))
- time was 17.39 for NYSE-listed stocks. Relatively less expensive stocks in the 25th percentile traded at 13.21 times earnings. Deep value stocks in the 5th percentile traded at almost half that level. By contrast, P/E ratios for growth stocks can be very high. Stocks in the 75th percentile traded at over 25 times earnings. Highflying growth stocks in the 95th percentile traded at 75 times earnings and higher, which is far greater than the median.3 ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2192))

- P/E ratios in the upper percentiles distort the average P/E ratio for the market as a whole. The median P/E ratio (or that value at the 50th percentile) is less influenced by extreme values. Because P/E ratios on some stocks are so high, it is often better to look at the median P/E ratio rather than the average P/E ratio. We can see how large some P/E ratios can be in relation to most other stocks in Figure 6-1, which displays these P/E ratios over time from 1951 to 2011. High P/E ratios are much farther above the median than low P/E ratios are below the median. ([Location 2198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2198))
- Figure 6-1 also illustrates that the definition of a high or low P/E ratio varies considerably over time. The P/E ratio stocks in the 95th percentile are especially volatile. Therefore, measures of relative value are a moving target. They need to be placed in context of current market conditions. In general, you can see that while P/E ratios collapsed in the 1970s, they have generally increased since 1951. ([Location 2205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2205))
- The main point here (and the main theme for this chapter) is that there is no single, uniform way to measure value. The value investor should be aware of the differences and ([Location 2225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2225))
- make the necessary adjustments. Judgments should be based on a variety of factors rather than rely on a single factor. ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2226))
- Average P/E ratios and other measures of relative value vary from one industry to another. For example, stocks in the computer software industry generally have much higher P/E ratios than utility stocks because their growth prospects are generally more promising. Therefore, most analysts look at P/E ratio and other measures of relative value in relation to other stocks in the same industry rather than simply the market as a whole. The idea is that direct competitors and other stocks in the same industry are more comparable. ([Location 2227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2227))
- So, the P/E takes on meaning and significance when we understand how it compares to that of other stocks (especially comparable firms that might be in the same industry) and how it has varied through time. ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2232))
- Value stocks can trade at a fraction of book value, whereas growth stocks can trade at several multiples above book value. Like the P/E ratio, the P/B ratio can get fairly high relative to the median, which can skew the calculation of the average. So, as with P/E ratios, analysts often focus on the median value. ([Location 2245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2245))
- As with the P/E ratio the P/B method of valuation looks at price relative to some underlying fundamental factor (book value in this case) and relative to other securities. ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2253))
- We mentioned earlier that Fama and French might use a variety of measures to classify stocks as either value or growth.

([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2259))
- We mentioned earlier that the P/E ratio is a noisy measure of value because earnings can fluctuate substantially over time. Another weakness of the P/E ratio is that earnings are subject to manipulation through different accounting treatments. Ultimately, the investor is interested in the cash flows to which they are entitled as a shareholder. Therefore the price-to–cash flow ratio is ([Location 2263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2263))
- intended to remove distortions that might be caused by alternative accounting conventions and potential earnings manipulation. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2265))
- Table 6-4 shows the price-to–cash flow ratios of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange as of June 2011. Figure 6-3 shows how these breakpoints have varied over time from 1951 to 2011. Because earnings and cash flows tend to correlate over time, these figures and trends look similar to those for the P/E ratio. Specifically, the median stock trades at about 12 times cash flow. Deep value stocks in the 5th percentile trade at less than half that at five times cash flow. Highflying growth stocks can trade at over 40 times cash flow. ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2267))
- Because some stocks trade so far above the median, the average price-to–cash flow ratio for the market tends to be distorted and biased upward. So, a good measure of the market’s price-to–cash flow ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2276))
- that is less influenced by these extreme values is the median rather than the average ratio. Like P/E ratios, price-to–cash flow ratios collapsed in the 1970s and have steadily increased since then as interest rates have declined. ([Location 2277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2277))
- Therefore, many analysts look at the dividend yield as an indication of value because it highlights changes in price and eliminates much of the noise associated with changes in earnings and cash flow. It is, however, a crude measure in part because management, rather than markets, determines dividend policy. That said, it is nonetheless an important tool in the strategic value investor’s toolkit. ([Location 2284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2284))
- A related figure is operating cash flow, estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Removing noncash expenses, like depreciation and amortization, from the earnings figures produces a measure of cash flow—operating cash flow, in particular. Operating cash flow focuses on cash flow derived from ongoing operations and excludes the cash flow effects associated with investing and financing activities. Focusing just on cash flow removes distortions associated with ramping up capital expenditures or issuing stock.

- Central to the concept of investing is the most basic concept of finance: present value. Simply stated, present value is the fundamental principle that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received tomorrow. Likewise, a dollar to be received tomorrow is worth more than a dollar received in two days. The rationale is that a dollar received today can be invested to earn interest and will be worth more at a later date. Mathematically, the present value of an amount of money to be received at a future point—let’s say a year from now—if the appropriate interest rate is r (more about that later) is: ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2389))
- So, the present value of one dollar to be received one year from today if the appropriate interest rate is 3 ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2394))
- percent is: What this means is that if the appropriate interest rate is 3 percent, an investor should be indifferent to receiving $0.9709 today or $1.00 a year from today. This simple idea is the basis of all discounted cash flow models. ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2395))
- Further extrapolating the concept, the value of a dollar to be received in two years is discounted (the opposite of compounded) for two periods: If that dollar were to be received 10 years from today, the present value is: So, the general formula for the present value of a lump sum to be received in the future at time n is: ([Location 2398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2398))
- The critical concept to ([Location 2409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2409))
- present value is that once dollars to be received in the future are discounted back to a present value, they can be added together to determine the value of a series of future cash flows (CF). Finance professionals would say that adding together dollars in hand today and dollars to be received at some time in the future is akin to adding U.S. dollars and euros. You can certainly add dollars and euros together, but you have to convert them into the same currency first. In its most basic form, the value of any investment (stock, bond, real estate, etc.) is simply the future value of all the cash flows discounted back to the present time (or put in present value terms). The general formula for the value of any investment is: ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2410))
- Note that these cash flows can be dividends, interest payments on a bond, rent flows on a real estate investment, or any other payout from an investment. As you will see, the valuation model is simple. The art of investing comes with estimating both the magnitude of the future cash flows and the appropriate interest (or discount) rate.

- of cases. A more realistic assumption for most firms is to assume an “abnormal” growth rate in the short term and then a “normal” growth rate in dividends thereafter. As was shown in Chapter 4 in the discussion on the industry life cycle, industries and firms typically go through four different stages of growth: pioneer, growth, mature, and decline. Firms likely aren’t publicly traded in the pioneer stage and the discounted cash flow models generally aren’t applicable to firms in the pioneering or venture capital stage. However, once firms have advanced into the growth and mature stages, the models are wholly appropriate. The two-stage dividend growth model is theoretically the same as the constant growth model: The value of a share of stock is equal to the sum of the discounted value of all future dividends. But we can think of it as two separate streams of cash flows: (1) the present value of the dividends during the abnormal growth period, and (2) the present value of the dividends during the normal growth period.

- While the discounted cash flow models may be mathematically simple, estimating future dividends with any degree of accuracy is quite challenging for some firms. First, analysts rarely estimate future dividends directly. Most often, analysts will estimate earnings per share and assume a fixed dividend payout ratio (dividends per share/earnings per share) to obtain a dividend estimate. If one assumes that the dividend payout ratio is constant through time, then the earnings growth rate and dividends per share growth rate are identical. However, with some firms—those that have consistently paid and consistently increased dividends through time— ([Location 2525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2525))
- one can examine the history of dividend payments and extrapolate that payment history into the future and infer a dividend growth rate. Second, as shown in the previous section, dividends (and earnings) typically don’t grow at a constant rate forever. Estimating growth rates of earnings and dividends, particularly many years in advance, is fraught with peril, and the further out in time one goes, the less accurate are the estimates. Some solace can be drawn, however, from the fact that near-term cash flows generally represent a greater portion of the value of a firm, due to present-value considerations. In this section, we will describe a method for estimating a dividend growth rate for Johnson & Johnson, a firm that is a perfect candidate for the constant ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2529))

In fact, 2012 represented the fiftieth consecutive year that Johnson & Johnson has raised its dividend payments to shareholders. Box 7-5 provides the dividend history of Johnson & Johnson since 1997.

- Box 7-5  Application: Valuation of Johnson & Johnson Using Constant Growth Dividend Model Data: Current (2012) dividend = $2.40 Constant dividend growth rate = 8.17% Appropriate interest (discount rate) = 12% ([Location 2538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2538))
- This compares to a market price at mid-March of 2013 at around $75 per share. Another way to apply the dividend growth model and compare your assessment of Johnson & Johnson’s growth prospects to the market’s assessment is to solve for the growth rate using the market price. For example, the growth rate that justifies a market price per share of $75 is equal to: The second term in this expression is called the expected dividend yield. Therefore, the implied growth rate is equal to the discount rate less the expected dividend yield. In this case, the market price of $75 per share implies that other investors ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2543))

- it is an interest rate, but it is referred to as a discount rate because it is used to convert (or discount) future dollars into today’s dollars. We cannot specify one discount rate to use for all investments at a particular point. In addition, discount rates for all securities will vary through time as market conditions change. Specifically, the discount rate will vary according to several conditions, including the returns (or yields) on other investments in the marketplace, as well as the perceived riskiness of the dividend stream being analyzed. The basic principle is that the discount rate should be higher for riskier dividend streams, and it should be higher when the yields on other investments—namely, riskless U.S. government securities—are higher. The basic concept ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2601))

And we should use a higher discount rate the higher the uncertainty level.

- of the U.S. government. Thus in finance when we talk about the risk-free rate, we are generally referring to the yield on U.S. government securities; however, we must acknowledge that no investment, including U.S. government securities, is truly risk free. When we are figuring out a discount rate, we begin with that risk-free rate and add to it a risk premium that takes into account (or compensates) the investor for the risk of that particular investment. One of most common methods of determining the risk premium is to use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). CAPM is an asset pricing model developed by (… ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2612))
- Markowitz.3 CAPM states that the appropriate discount rate (or required rate of return on an investment) can be found by the following equation: Now, here is where both the disagreement and the art of investing play major roles. Even professional investors who employ the CAPM to determine their discount rate estimates will disagree on the specific values for the inputs. Some choose to use historical values, while others use their own estimates of current values.

- referred to as the market risk premium. Instead of trying to estimate a current market risk premium, many analysts use long-term historical averages. For example, from 1926 through 2010, the average annual return on large company stocks (the S&P 500) was 11.9 percent, and the average return on long-term U.S. government bonds was 5.9 percent. A reasonable long-term estimate of the market risk premium is therefore 6.0 percent. On average, investors in a diversified index… ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2624))
- There is certainly no requirement to use an historical market risk premium. Some professional investors choose to provide estimates of what they believe the market risk premium will be. Professionals tend to widely disagree about the appropriate forward-looking equity risk premium. In a survey of 19 professional investors, as of 2001 the average equity risk premium was estimated to be 3.7 percent.5 The estimates ranged from a low of 0 percent to a high of 7 percent. The survey of… ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2632))
- the S&P from 2001 through 2011 was around 2.7 percent. Once you subtract out the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium was virtually zero. Even if an analyst uses the historical market risk premium, there is a strong likelihood that the same individual will use a current value of the risk-free rate in the CAPM equation. To find the risk-free rate, one simply needs to see what the current yield is on long-term government bonds. As of mid-March 2013, the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds was approximately 3.2 percent. It is quite likely that the market risk premium changes over time. The difference between yields on high-risk bonds and government bonds (another form of risk premium called the default risk premium) tends to increase dramatically in periods of market crisis when fear is prevalent. This was certainly the case in 2008 and 2009 at the depths of the financial crisis. In bull markets, the default risk premium tends to be very thin. You may want to factor an estimate of this time variability into your calculation, or you may choose to assume such variations are likely to smooth out over time as investors’ “animal spirits” ebb and flow.

Investments with a beta greater than 1.0 are said to be riskier than the market, while stocks with a beta of less than 1.0 are less risky than the market. The intuition is that, on average, when the market is up, stocks with a beta of greater than 1.0 are up more than the market. Likewise, when the market is down, stocks with a beta of greater than 1.0 are, on average, down more than the market.

- These models should give you ideas for how to determine the rate of return that you and other investors might seek from investing in a security. However, ultimately, you are the investor (and we hope a value investor at that!). You should therefore use a required rate of return (discount rate) that will make you happy by compensating you for the risk you are assuming, even if it is beyond these models. For example, if you feel ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2685))

This chapter shows that in addition to providing a means of relative valuation, you can estimate the intrinsic value of a firm through an analysis of free cash flow. Specifically, we show that the value of a firm can be estimated by computing the present value of all future free cash flows to the firm. Likewise, we can estimate the value of a share of common stock in the firm by computing the present value of all future cash flows that accrue to stockholders whether or not these cash flows are distributed to shareholders year to year.1 ([Location 2724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2724))

Readers interested in a more detailed, robust and calculation-intensive treatment should refer to Pinto, Henry, Robinson, and Stowe (2010).

- We have to be a bit more precise when computing free cash flow for valuation purposes. There are two definitions of free cash flow that are relevant to the valuation process: free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to equity. We distinguish between the two concepts below and show how you can use the concepts to estimate the value of a share of stock. Free cash flow to the firm is the cash flow available to a firm’s ([Location 2739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2739))

Free cash flow to the firm is: The firm’s suppliers of capital include common stockholders, preferred stockholders, and bondholders. Simply put, free cash flow to the firm is that cash flow available after everyone but the suppliers of capital have been paid and necessary investments have been made to ensure the proper functioning of the firm, both now and in the future. The analogy is to that of running a household. Cash flow to a household is what is left after all routine expenses (groceries, mortgage, fuel, etc.) have ([Location 2742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2742))
- been paid. But to maintain a household, one must periodically spend money on maintenance and upkeep or the home will decline in value. Think about a situation where a homeowner does not perform routine upkeep on the house—paint, replace the furnace and appliances. The value of the house will erode. In the same way, all of the cash flow from operations is not freely available to claimants. Some portion of cash flow must be spent to maintain and improve the business. A firm must replace machinery; invest in new property, plant, and equipment; and invest in research and development to remain viable in the long term and… ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2748))
- circumstances. Under U.S. accounting standards, interest expense is deducted on the cash flow statement in order to arrive at cash flow from operations. Because FCFF is free cash flow available to all capital suppliers (including debt holders) and interest flows to those debt holders, it needs to be added back (net of taxes) when computing FCFF. However, under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) companies are permitted so show interest expense in either operating cash flow or financing cash flow.

There are other suppliers of capital—namely, bondholders—who must also be paid. When valuing equity, we are interested in only that portion of free cash flow that is the “property” of stockholders. Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) is the cash flow available to the company’s common stockholders after all operating expenses, interest, and principal payments have been paid and after all necessary payments to fixed capital have been… ([Location 2760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2760))

However, forecasting these amounts for future years is much more problematic and requires several simplifying assumptions. You will find that using spreadsheet models makes this process manageable. Additionally, when you employ spreadsheet models you can… ([Location 2766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2766))
- Note that in computing FCFE from an historical perspective we are including borrowings from debt holders. This may seem odd, as it implies that borrowing could increase FCFE and somehow increase the value of the firm, as well. We do not use historical FCFE for valuation—we want to forecast future average FCFE, which includes borrowing to the extent that it pays for some portion of capital expenditures. This ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=2782))

As potential shareholders, we are ultimately interested in the market value of the equity rather than the market value of firm.

- purchase stocks because they believe that these investments will generate substantial future cash flows and earnings. But there are reasons other than ability to generate earnings and cash flows that warrant the strategic value investor to consider purchasing or short selling the stock of a firm. Some firms may be good investments because the net assets (assets less the liabilities) held by the firm are, for whatever reason, undervalued or underappreciated by the market. These firms are purchased primarily based on the value of their underlying assets. Asset-based approaches sometimes have the advantage of providing clarity and objectivity in an otherwise ambiguous setting.

In fact, Tobin himself theorized that q would average 1.0 for all companies because economic rents or profits earned by assets would average to zero. From an investor’s standpoint, a high Tobin’s q signals a possible overvaluation and high level of market risk. Conversely, a low Tobin’s q indicates that the market may be undervalued and investors have less risk in the market at that time.

- market. The main difficulty in computing Tobin’s q is the lack of reliable information on the replacement cost of assets. As you can imagine, calculating the replacement value of corporate assets for individual firms is fraught with great difficulty and will necessarily involve many assumptions and estimates. Unlike book value, where there can be no disagreement among investors, rational investors are likely to disagree on the replacement value of Microsoft. This disagreement reflects the reality that rational investors will have divergent views on the value of the brand equity inherent in the firm. The general market, however, is a different story for investors.

- One of the most successful conglomerate enterprises is the investment vehicle used by the world’s greatest value investor, Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway was a New England–based textile manufacturer in the early 1960s. But Buffett didn’t make his fortune in textile manufacturing. In fact, the textile operations were an underperforming part of Buffett’s operations in the early days of his involvement, and Buffett acknowledges that his investment in Berkshire Hathaway was one of the least savvy investments in his distinguished career. How does an investor go about valuing a complex organization like Berkshire Hathaway? Tom Gayner, value investor and president and chief investment officer of Markel Corporation advocates employing the sum-of-the-parts valuation ([Location 3234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3234))
- method.13 He contends that Berkshire Hathaway has evolved into a company with three major business lines: an investment portfolio, insurance operations, and non-insurance operating businesses. The basis of applying a sum-of-the-parts valuation to Berkshire Hathaway involves making certain assumptions (estimates) about each of the business lines and aggregating the results. Bear in mind that an analyst can make things as easy or as complicated as need be. However, increased complexity does not necessarily equate into greater precision or better estimates of value.14 Greg Speicher is an Ohio-based value investor who followed Gayner’s general approach to estimate the value of both the A and B shares of Berkshire Hathaway.15 While Berkshire Hathaway ([Location 3240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3240))
- is a complicated enterprise with many moving parts, Speicher’s model is relatively simple. It separately determines the net profit from each of the three business components by making some assumptions about performance of each business line and also assumptions about market multiples (P/E ratios) to be applied to the aggregated earnings. Specifically, for the insurance division Speicher considers a low case where Berkshire does not earn any underwriting profit, a middle case where it earns a 4.5 percent profit, and a high case where it earns 9 percent.

He then sums the earnings from the three parts and applies a 10x, 14x, and 18x multiple.

- Banks have fundamentally dissimilar business models and types of cash flows from manufacturing companies, retailers, and the like. They collect cash from customers and use this cash to make loans. They earn a spread on the difference in interest rates between borrowed and lent funds. True operating cash flow can be difficult to determine for these types of firms. Fortunately, another approach exists that focuses on book value and earnings. This method is called a residual income1 model and is quite effective for valuing many companies, particularly those in the financial industry.

- (relative to) some underlying fundamental value. However, we must take relative a step or two further. Relative value is different from the absolute valuation methods we discussed in the last few chapters. Relative valuation requires that you compare a relative value metric for one company to something else: the same metric for peer companies, the industry, or the market. As value investors, we are looking to buy companies that are selling at a lower multiple relative to other companies of similar quality and similar risk. (We will define what we mean by quality with regard to companies in the next section.)1 Alternatively, we could be looking to buy companies that are trading at a lower multiple than their historical norms, assuming the fundamental value drivers have not ([Location 3490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3490))
- substantially changed.2 By comparing one company’s price multiples to its peers, you are likely assuming that the comparable firms or market are fairly valued and you are looking to identify a bargain. We would urge you to make such assumptions carefully. For example, recall the long-term chart of P/E ratios presented in Chapter 4 and replicated in ([Location 3496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3496))

- have looked like an attractive value relative to the others, but in reality the subject stock was not such a bargain in the context of the historical P/E ratio of approximately 15 for the market. This example illustrates the value of both comparison to peers and comparisons over time. You should take some time to consider the overall valuation of the market before rushing to judgment on the relative value of an individual security. You can do this by looking at the historical context: What multiple has the company traded at over time, and where is the market multiple relative to its history?

- MULTIPLES? Most investors use price multiples without spending any time thinking about what underlying factors drive them. This is the case because multiples are easy to use, widely available, and are known by some as the tool of the armchair analyst. Some investors use them without reference to any underlying factors. We hope that this is not you—at least, not after you have read this book. As with any valuation method, you need to thoroughly research the company you want to own before you consider the price that you are willing to pay. You want to buy a good company at a good price, so you also need to understand what quantitative and qualitative factors (quality mentioned in the introduction above) should make a company sell at a higher or lower multiple than others.

For example, a company that makes consumer nondiscretionary goods like food staples is generally less risky than a biotechnology company. Leverage: While leverage can have its benefits, including higher returns to equity if used appropriately, having more leverage is riskier and should command a higher desired return and result in a lower P/E multiple.

- The first step in performing a relative valuation is to identify peer companies for comparison.

Sometimes, however, you will not find perfect matches and may have to select less than perfect peers.

- An extension of a P/E approach is the PEG ratio. The PEG ratio is the P/E ratio relative to growth prospects. Recall that higher growth typically implies a higher P/E multiple. Dividing the P/E ratio by the growth rate (ignoring ([Location 3627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3627))
- the percent sign) attempts to adjust for this. The idea is that a lower PEG ratio means a lower P/E relative to expected growth and connotes greater value. ([Location 3628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3628))
- You should interpret PEG ratios cautiously, however. The PEG ratio assumes a linear (or a one-to-one) relationship between growth and P/E ratios, meaning it is OK to divide the two. In reality, the relationship is more complex—certainly nonlinear. In this case, the growth period forecasted is the same length of time, which certainly helps. You would not want to compute PEG ratios using different time lengths of growth for your comparison companies. You will hear many value investors say an ideal PEG ratio is one or less; that is, the P/E ratio should be lower than the growth rate. Although we do not hold to the one threshold, lower is definitely better and both of these companies appear pretty richly priced on a PEG basis—another reason for us to take a more contrarian approach and look for ([Location 3632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3632))

- The price-to-book ratio is another popular price multiple for assessing the relative value of stocks (although no other multiple is as popular as the price-to-earnings ratio). The price-to–book value multiple has tremendous flexibility and can be used in some circumstances in which the price-to-earnings measure cannot be used, such as when companies have negative earnings. The price-to–book value multiple is also significantly less variable than the price-to-earnings measure, as book value is a cumulative amount whereas earnings (estimated or actual) is for a single year. Lastly, as we saw in the residual income chapter, there is a direct relationship between residual income and the price-to-book ratio. Thus, it is appropriate to use the price-to-book approach in ([Location 3651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3651))

- A price-to–cash flow (P/CF) ratio is an attractive measure in that cash flow is one of the most important drivers of firm value. Companies not only need to generate earnings but also need to turn these earnings into cash flows in order to have a long-term and sustainable business model. As we saw in previous chapters, a common absolute valuation method is to discount future cash flows. Applying a price-to–cash flow approach therefore makes good sense. Unfortunately price-to–cash flow ratios are not readily available in databases or on most financial Internet sites. Even when these ratios are available, they are often not based on “true” cash flow measures. Instead, they often use crude approximations, such as earnings per share plus deprecation per share. We ([Location 3711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3711))
- prefer to compute a price-to–cash flow ratio using operating cash flow from the firm’s cash flow statement: The P/CF ratio can then be computed as follows: We should note that we could use a measure of free cash flow (usually free cash flow to equity) rather than operating cash flow (a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio). This is also very useful and is sensible, as free cash flow is available to shareholders. However, free cash flow can fluctuate substantially year-over-year due to increased borrowing, higher than normal capital expenditures, and the like. Operating cash flow is typically much more stable. We can also invert this ratio to create a ratio called cash flow yield (we can do the same thing for a P/E ratio to ([Location 3716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3716))
- compute earnings yield). A yield measure avoids problems of ranking stocks when one has negative cash flow (or earnings) and in the case of cash flow can be thought of as the return an investor is getting on a cash basis by buying the stock at its current price. For example, if cash flow yield is 15 percent (a price-to–cash flow ratio of 6.7), then the company is generating a cash flow return of 15 percent on the current price. Cash flow yield computed as: A price-to–cash flow or cash flow yield relative valuation is performed using the same approach outlined above with P/E. From a value investing perspective, you are looking for companies selling for a lower P/CF ratio (higher cash flow yield) than peers with similar risk, ([Location 3723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3723))

- Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition: For industrial companies, the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) should be at least two. In addition, long-term debt should not exceed net current assets (current assets minus current liabilities). For public utilities, the debt should not exceed twice the stockholder’s equity. 3. Earnings Stability: Positive earnings for the common stock in each of the past 10 years. 4. Dividend Record: Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years. 5. Earnings Growth: A minimum increase of at least one-third in per share earnings in the past 10 years using three-year averages at the beginning and end. ([Location 3846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3846))
- 6. Moderate Ratio of Price to Earnings: Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years. 7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets: Current price should not be more than 1 ½ times the book value last reported. Graham did qualify this by stating that a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a higher multiplier of assets. He suggested a rule of thumb that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book should not exceed 22.5.

- Klarman’s style is distinguished from the other value investors profiled in this chapter largely on two counts. First, he often has a large percentage of his portfolio in cash. Secondly, he looks for value investments throughout the investment landscape and does not focus merely on traditional stocks and bonds. ([Location 3933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3933))
- In July of 2012, Klarman’s portfolio had 30 percent in cash, and he has been known to have in excess of 50 percent of his portfolio in cash. In the hedge fund world, holding copious amounts of cash is highly unusual. In fact, most hedge funds use a high degree of leverage in order to magnify returns. Klarman cites two reasons for his propensity to hold cash: his risk averse nature and the ability to buy when others are forced to sell. ([Location 3935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3935))
- He believes that that avoiding loss should be the primary goal of every investor. In Margin of Safety, Klarman wrote: A loss-avoidance strategy does not mean that investors should hold all or even half of their portfolios in U.S. Treasury bills or own sizable caches of gold bullion.

- Ruane’s philosophy involved looking for high-quality investments; that is, companies that dominate their sectors and have strong revenue growth and improving margins.25 He also focused on larger capitalization firms. Ruane didn’t look for the cigar butts that Graham focused on. He felt that even if a company trades at a steep premium to the overall market, Sequoia will still consider buying it as long as its management is excellent and the prospects for its business are strong. In essence, Ruane focused on quality at the right price. ([Location 3985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3985))
- Neff was a notorious contrarian and value investor, following a consistent investment style over his years in the industry. Like Graham, Neff cited seven principal elements of his strategy. Fortunately, he clearly spelled these out in his book Neff on Investing, written following his retirement:28   1. Low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. A low P/E ratio was the cornerstone of Neff’s strategy. In fact, when asked about his investment style, Neff said he preferred to be referred to as a “low ([Location 3999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=3999))
    - Note: Buy this book
- price-earnings investor. It describes succinctly and accurately the investment style that guided Windsor while I was in charge.” Neff looked for out-of-favor stocks with good prospects and avoided the popular growth stocks. The P/E ratio is critical because it is all about expectations. A stock typically sells at a high P/E ratio because the consensus of the market is that firm will grow at a very high rate. On the other hand, if a stock has a low P/E ratio, investors aren’t expecting much growth from it. If expectations are already low, there is less risk of a downside earnings surprise from a low P/E stock. However, the risk of a negative earnings surprise from a high P/E stock is both significant and the consequences are dramatic. This ([Location 4004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4004))
- line of thinking is consistent with what many investors have witnessed in the market. You often see a high P/E stock get pummeled after a quarterly earnings shortfall of a couple of pennies. The typical Windsor stock had P/E ratios that were 40 to 60 percent below the market. Neff believed that these P/E ratios represent the best of both worlds as they provide upside potential (when the market recognizes their merits) and downside protection (because expectations are so low). 2. Fundamental growth in excess of 7 percent. Coupled… ([Location 4009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4009))

Firms with growth rates above 20 percent were too risky for Neff. Those firms had the potential to disappoint. The relevant term for earnings growth projections at Windsor was five years. 3. Yield protection (and enhancement, in most cases). A low P/E strategy often results in firms with high dividend yields (annual dividend/price). Return on any common stock investment consists… ([Location 4015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4015))
- with the assessment by Graham and Dodd that the dividend yield was the more assured part of growth and thus favored stocks with higher yields. However, by his own admission, Neff did not insist on yield. He would invest in less-recognized growth firms with 12 to 15 percent growth rates and little or no yield. This was, however, the exception rather than the rule. Neff believes that many investors value stocks strictly on the basis of their price appreciation potential and neglect dividend payouts when valuing securities. He estimated that about… ([Location 4021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4021))
- return to P/E paid. Neff developed a simple, yet elegant metric he called “total return ratio” to measure the attractiveness of a potential investment. Total return is defined as the sum of the dividend yield and the expected earnings growth rate. Total return is then divided by the P/E ratio, which represents the “richness” of the price. Thus, total return ratio is: Total Return Ratio = (Earnings Growth + Dividend Yield) ÷ (P/E Ratio) He looked for total return ratios that exceeded market or industry averages by 2 to 1. This is simply a measure of how cheaply he could acquire… ([Location 4027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4027))
- overvalued. 5. No cyclical exposure without compensating P/E multiple. Neff did not shy away from cyclical firms (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of cyclical firms). In fact, cyclical stocks normally constituted about one-third of the holdings of the Windsor Fund. However, Neff did recognize that his total return ratio could be misleading for cyclical firms and that some adjustments were necessary. The issue is that growth stocks are expected to increase earnings steadily, while earnings growth rates for cyclical stocks will vary according to where we are in the business… ([Location 4033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4033))
- a best estimate of earnings at more fortuitous points in the business cycle. The key to cyclical firms was not to overpay for peak earnings. In fact, in contrast to the buy-and-hold philosophy advocated by many value investors, including Buffett, Neff believed that timing was everything with respect to cyclical stocks. The strategy was to purchase them when prospective P/E ratios were very low and to sell them when the market was overly optimistic on the prospects of the firm. Such a philosophy led Neff to buy the same companies over and over. For instance, in 1994… ([Location 4039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4039))
- Richfield in the three decades that he managed the Windsor Fund.30 6. Solid companies in growing fields. The previous five criteria were all very quantitatively oriented. While one can have differing opinions on expected future earnings growth rates or normalized earnings, one cannot quibble about P/E ratios or dividend yields. The sixth criterion is all qualitative and involves identifying solid companies in growing fields. Neff typically didn’t invest heavily in the great, recognizable companies, the industry leaders.31 He preferred to fly a little under the radar and believed that good,… ([Location 4044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4044))
- good companies when the markets were most pessimistic about them. That certainly doesn’t mean that he wouldn’t purchase the industry leaders if the prices came down to levels where he was comfortable. The strategy of identifying solid companies in growing fields led Neff to have holdings of vastly different sized firms. In essence, he applied his low P/E style across the entire capitalization spectrum. 7. Strong fundamental case. John Neff is a CFA charter holder and is a strong advocate of fundamental analysis.

- The idea is to develop credible estimates of earnings growth rates. Thus, a strong fundamental case must be made to justify estimates used in valuation models. Neff tries to identify firms that produce excess cash flow and believes that retained earnings plus depreciation is a sufficient proxy for cash flow. Excess cash flow can provide capital for dividend increases, stock repurchases, acquisitions, or reinvestment. Like Buffett, Neff believes that return on equity (ROE) is a critically important metric by which managements should be measured.

- Before discussing the reasons for the dramatic turn in performance, we briefly describe Miller’s investment philosophy. Janet Lowe summarized Miller’s investment style in six bullet points. They are a composite of many of the elements of the styles from investors we described earlier in this chapter. In brief, Miller: doesn’t attempt to predict the direction of the market. looks for franchise value. is willing to provide forecasts when determining value, but doesn’t believe that the numbers tell him everything. looks for investment ideas everywhere. looks for a margin of safety. doesn’t trade frequently.62 ([Location 4173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4173))
- So, given his investment philosophy, why was there such a disparity between his performance from 1991 to 2005 compared to his performance from 2006 to 2011? We believe this is directly attributable to four factors: willingness to invest in the technology sector, his philosophy on probability, taking concentrated positions in specific industries, and overconfidence. Unlike most value investors, Miller embraced investing in the technology sector. His holdings were dramatically different from the typical value investor’s and included large positions in firms such as America Online, Google, Dell, and Amazon. In fact, he purchased Google ([Location 4182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4182))

Jim Cramer wrote in a column on theStreet.com that investing in these types of firms and claiming a value style was “a masquerade.”64 Suffice it to say, most value investors did not have positions in these types of firms, and the strong performance of technology firms relative to the market prior to the bursting of the Internet bubble definitely accounted for some of Miller’s outperformance. His timing in the technology sector was impeccable, as Miller exited many of these positions just prior to the crash of the sector… ([Location 4186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4186))
- you have made ten times your money),66 Miller believed in big winners driving his portfolio performance. Janet Lowe describes this philosophy as “Miller fully expects to be wrong a certain number of times, but he expects to be so spectacularly right enough times that he will achieve a high level of performance.”67 In fact, Miller was wrong more often than most money managers on picking winners, but his winners were, on average, bigger winners and drove his outperformance for a large portion of his tenure at Legg Mason Value Trust. For example, Miller had a 3,500 percent gain in Dell by 1999.68 Such a spectacular return on one stock can certainly… ([Location 4193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4193))
- at least not highly correlated with each other. The fact that Miller made concentrated bets in out-of-favor industries that continued to suffer was a critical element in his substantial underperformance over the past few years of his tenure. As noted above, Miller successfully took concentrated positions in technology stocks and rode them higher before the technology crash of 1999. But, in the midst of the financial crisis, Miller not only retained his positions in financial stocks but also increased positions in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, and other stocks in the sector. In early September 2008, while Fannie and Freddie were dropping precipitously, Miller disclosed that Legg Mason had purchased 30 million… ([Location 4200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4200))

An honest assessment of your own personality is critical in developing a style that is both intellectually and psychologically consistent with your makeup. You don’t want to try to adopt a style that is inconsistent with your personality, as you will be in constant conflict with yourself.

- Even the world’s greatest investor has been, at times, criticized for adhering to his value investing principles. A Barron’s cover story entitled “What’s Wrong, Warren?” appeared at year-end 1999. The article contains quotes deriding Buffett and states, “[He] hasn’t been able to make the next leap forward and adapt to the current technology-driven bull market. The reason: Technology isn’t in Buffett’s ‘circle of competence,’ and thus he doesn’t feel comfortable seeking long-term winners in the sector.”2 ([Location 4261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4261))
- One of the wonderful aspects about managing your own portfolio is that you don’t have to answer to anyone but yourself. If the market hasn’t recognized that you are correct yet, you aren’t forced to change strategies because you aren’t competing with other money managers for assets and aren’t being judged on your performance from quarter to quarter. In this way, amateur investors have a big “staying power” advantage over many professional investors. Professional investors, unfortunately, need to be concerned with short-term performance and performance relative to their peers in order to attract cash inflows and discourage cash outflows from those increasingly fickle investors who chase performance and the latest investing fad.3 ([Location 4272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4272))
- Closely aligned with patience is regret aversion. Regret aversion is a behavioral finance principle that leads investors to make poor decisions. It is also a psychological theory that posits that some people have regrets when they see that their decisions turn out to be wrong even if they appeared correct with the information available to them at the time they made the decision. In the context of investing, ([Location 4287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4287))
- regret aversion is based on the desire of investors to avoid experiencing painful regret as a result of bad investment decisions. Regret aversion can have dimensions related to actions that people have taken, as well as actions that they could have taken.4 Regret from an action taken is an error of commission, and regret from an action not taken is an error of omission. The iconic value investors certainly don’t beat themselves up over errors of omission, or they would have a strong propensity to invest cash sooner rather than later. As in Buffett’s baseball analogy, Buffett doesn’t regret not swinging at a pitch that is in his strike zone and is willing to wait for an even better pitch to hit.

- Regret aversion also manifests itself in errors of commission—again, from actions taken. Many investors avoid selling stocks in which they have unrealized losses because they rationalize that until they close the position they haven’t really incurred the loss. Investors are much more willing to sell stocks that have gained in value because they get to savor the realization of the gain. This propensity is buttressed by the old investment adage, “You can’t go broke by taking a profit.” Taken to the extreme, such a strategy of selling winners and riding losers would result in an investor holding a portfolio of only losers.7 From a tax perspective, just the opposite strategy makes sense.

- But the outperformance of both value stocks over growth stocks and small stocks over large stocks comes at a price, and that price is risk.

It means that the value investor must be willing to endure—that’s where patience and intestinal fortitude come into play—more variability over time in returns to reap the rewards of a value investing strategy. It also means that some value investing strategies are more volatile than others. For instance, if you focus your energies on smaller capitalization value stocks and concentrate your holdings there, your returns (both annual and monthly) are likely to exhibit more variability than other investors who may adopt a growth strategy or a blended (growth and value) strategy. When determining what style to adopt, both your ability and willingness to bear risk must be considered. Ability to bear risk is a quality that lends itself more to a rational, quantitative analysis.

- goals relative to his resources and the time frame in which the goals must be met. If the investor has very modest goals relative to the size of the investment portfolio, he has greater ability to bear risk: that is, the ability to withstand short-term volatility and incur negative short-term returns. Simply put, a young professional with a high-paying job who is saving for a retirement that is decades in the future has a greater ability to bear risk than someone with an underfunded retirement plan who is quickly approaching retirement age and is underemployed. A crude rule of thumb used by many financial planners (and shown in Box 13-1) attempts to capture the ability to bear risk via the “100 minus your age rule.” ([Location 4343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4343))
- Although we don’t advocate that investors adhere to the “100 minus your age rule,” the rule illustrates that, in general, the ability to bear risk is related to investment horizon, in addition to your accumulated asset base. Specifically, the longer your investment horizon, the more ability you have to bear risk. Realize that investment horizon is not solely related to age. For instance, if you are funding your child’s college fund, the investment horizon is much longer if the child is in nursery school rather than in high school. Ability to bear risk is certainly related to the magnitude of your asset base. If you have accumulated a large nest egg, you have more ability to bear risk than someone who has not accumulated an adequate financial base.

- bear risk. A person’s ability to bear risk is a function of age and station in life and can be quantitatively determined. A person’s willingness to bear risk is more subjective, and, while you can rationally determine that you should be more willing to bear risk, it may simply be that you are not psychologically wired to do so. Realize that that’s OK. Being unwilling to bear risk is not a weakness. Choose an investment style that is consistent with your unique psychological profile.

- How many separate holdings does it take to be diversified? A classic study from the early 1970s showed that dramatic diversification benefits were achieved by increasing the number of holdings to 10.10 Figure 13-3 shows that the risk of portfolios of a given number of stocks declines as more stocks are added. Beyond 10 stocks, the diversification gains were shown to be minimal. Every introductory investments textbook, it seems, provides a graph showing that the lion’s share of the diversification benefit (as measured by standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns), or approximately 90 percent, is achieved by holding 10 securities and that nearly full diversification can be realized with as few as 30 holdings.11 Be aware, however, that in order to be diversified a 10- or 20-stock portfolio needs to be diversified across industries.

- At that point, the investor would be wise to simply adopt an indexing strategy and accept the return on the market instead of attempting to tailor a portfolio to his or her own unique circumstances.

- Once investors determine which value investing style they want to follow, they need to choose an investment model (or models) to use. Chapters 7 through 11 presented the five primary valuation models: dividend discount, free cash flow, asset based, residual income, and a variety of relative methods. As we described in the individual chapters, some models are more applicable for specific firm and industry types. The following represents a discussion of the broad classes of stocks and industries that each model is best suited. ([Location 4508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4508))
- While intellectually appealing, the dividend discount model is limited to valuing firms that actually pay cash dividends. ([Location 4518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4518))
- Thus, investors pursuing a large capitalization value investing strategy are likely to find the dividend discount model to be a good fit for their investment style. Still, relying on the dividend discount model will bias the investor’s universe for some stock sectors and against other sectors. Table 13-1 is excerpted from Ashwath Damodaran’s website. It lists sectors with the highest dividend yields from the Value Line universe of 6,177 stocks. ([Location 4530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4530))
- Another consideration is whether the company’s dividend is appropriate given its profitability. If a company continues to pay a high dividend but profitability is declining, then you should consider another valuation model. The dividend discount model is appropriate when the company’s dividend policy is linked with its profitability—in other words, when the company’s dividend is supported by earnings. ([Location 4540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4540))
- Investors pursuing a large capitalization value investing style who rely on the dividend discount model as their preferred valuation model will find that their universe of potential investments will emphasize some sectors and exclude others. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Such investors need only to understand this ([Location 4543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4543))
- situation. Excluding some industries from consideration—for instance, Internet and e-commerce firms—may be a good thing, given the frothy valuations and volatile nature of those sectors. ([Location 4545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4545))
- As indicated in Chapter 8, the free cash flow models—free cash flow to equity ([Location 4550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4550))
- (FCFE) and free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)—are applicable to a wide variety of firms and can be employed whether the firm pays a dividend or not. The free cash flow models are most appropriate where dividends are not available or in cases where investors are attempting to value an initial public offering or a private company. These models are also appropriate for dividend-paying firms in which the free cash flow to equity is substantially different than dividends paid, as in the case of Apple. Remember, Apple pays a dividend, but the dividend is substantially less than what it could pay given the enormous free cash flow it is generating. The same could be said for a firm that is temporarily paying out significantly higher dividends than free cash flow to equity would justify in the long run. ([Location 4551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4551))
- Free cash flow models are much more demanding of the user than the dividend discount models. Since the free cash flow models do not rely on readily available data, the analyst needs to compute these quantities based on various assumptions and forecasts. These models demand that the investor understand the firm’s financial statements, operations, industry, and financing in much more detail than in the dividend discount model. Professional analysts consider these models much more useful than the dividend discount models. ([Location 4559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4559))
- Asset-based approaches are often appropriate in identifying potential takeover or spin-off targets. Asset-based approaches are also often appropriate for valuing firms with large holdings in natural resources. For instance, if timber prices are depressed, ([Location 4567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4567))
- a timber company may decide to reduce harvesting in a recessionary period or in a period in which commodity prices are depressed. Employing a dividend or free cash flow approach might dramatically understate the value of the underlying assets and also understate the firm’s future earning potential. ([Location 4569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4569))
- The residual income model can be used when cash flows are unpredictable but earnings are relatively stable. The residual income model should not be used when you have concerns about the quality of the company’s earnings (you suspect they are playing accounting games). ([Location 4582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4582))
- From its very name, you realize that relative valuation models are not absolute valuation models because you are valuing a firm on metrics relative to another, hopefully comparable, firm or set of firms. As such, we suggest using this set of models as a first pass and then employing one or more of the other valuation models to determine whether an investment truly represents a value investing opportunity. In other words, if you simply purchase a stock because it is the most attractively priced relative to some group, you may be making a mistake for a couple of reasons. First, the stock may be the most attractively priced for good reason—that is, its future prospects might be poor. Secondly, the entire group might be overvalued and not worthy of consideration. Bill Miller made the latter mistake when he took large positions in the financial industry during the initial stages of the financial crises. These firms may have been inexpensive on a relative value basis, but the entire industry was poised for a downfall.

- corporate road kill. As the opening quote suggests, distressed investing requires the ability to discern the beauty at the heart of darkness. OK, perhaps that’s a bit melodramatic! The point remains that, even more than the discipline of value investing itself, distressed investing requires one to go against the grain and to buck conventional wisdom about a company or security. We outlined barriers to successful value investing in Chapter 4 and the titanium spine it requires. This is even more the case with distressed investing. ([Location 4618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4618))
- Many people associate financial distress or distressed securities with bankruptcy. That is entirely understandable because the firms that enter bankruptcy are indeed financially distressed and the securities that finance those firms are therefore distressed, as ([Location 4623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4623))

- Distressed investing is contrarian to the extreme. You must be willing to buy when literally everyone else is selling and saying, “There is no way out of this!” This is often on the heels of a dramatic upswing when everyone is saying, “This time it’s ([Location 4715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4715))

- If we are able to develop a meaningful definition of success, are we able to determine which firms entering the bankruptcy process are more likely to emerge successfully?

- bankruptcy.8 It seems that the old saying “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me” applies here. ([Location 4744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4744))
- Interestingly, unlike most securities, such as debt, a warrant’s value increases as the risk of the underlying asset increases because the investor’s downside risk is limited. Volatility does not hurt on the downside because the worst that can happen is that warrants expire worthless, but volatility really helps on the upside. ([Location 4778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4778))
- Why would a firm give away the upside? If they are in a distressed situation, they may not have much choice. But there is another reason. Suppose a distressed firm is able to pull themselves from the brink and their prospects improve. They will likely need additional financing down the road as their prospects improve. Convertible bonds ([Location 4780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4780))
- have a built-in mechanism to accommodate this good fortune. As the stock price increases, convertible bond holders will gladly trade their bonds for the more valuable equity, thereby removing the debt from the firm’s balance sheet without having to repay it. Moreover, the additional equity shores up the firm’s balance sheet and positions it well for further financing. So, if you are investing in distressed situations, do not discount the valuable role that warrants and convertible bonds can play in helping an otherwise well-run firm recover from financial exigency. ([Location 4783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4783))
- In distressed investing situations, an appropriate relative valuation measure is an enterprise value approach because the equity by itself is likely to have little or no value. Enterprise value (EV) equals the value of a company’s debt plus the value of its equity. A commonly used earnings proxy is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The EV-to-EBITDA ([Location 4866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4866))
- EBITDA ratio equals: A shortcoming of EBITDA is that it ignores the capital expenditures required to maintain the value of the assets going forward. It therefore overestimates the free cash flow that would be available to security holders over the long term. Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) can be a better measure of the net sustainable cash flow to the firm. To estimate FCFF, it is necessary to deduct capital expenditures required to maintain the capital stock.10 In many cases, the depreciation recorded by a firm over, say, five years or more approximately equals the capital expenditures over the same period ([Location 4869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4869))
- of time. If we can credibly make that assumption, then depreciation and capital expenditures should cancel each other out, and we can use a more simple measure of enterprise value–to-EBIT. EBIT is earnings before interest and tax, otherwise known as operating income. No matter which measure of cash flow or income we choose for the denominator, we want to be sure to make adjustments for nonrecurring noncash charges, such as restructuring charges. ([Location 4876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4876))
- In Chapter 9, we introduced the concept of deep value investing. Deep value investors look for situations with a profound undervaluation, which often represent distressed situations. In these types of circumstances in which fear overwhelms greed, the share price may sometimes be less than the company’s net working capital alone, after deducting all debt. Benjamin Graham discussed this in his seminal book, The Intelligent Investor.11 These firms are selling at a price that enables the investor to pay essentially nothing for the fixed assets (any buildings, machinery, land, etc.) and any goodwill items that appear on the balance sheet. The metric sometimes used is the price-to-net working capital, or: A firm is trading at a deep value if this ratio is less than one. An even deeper value situation occurs when the net cash ratio is less than one. Price-to–net cash ratio equals: ([Location 4896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4896))
- Having a large margin of safety is critical for the average investor, who must make investments without the benefit of having control. Through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett is a control investor who can afford to buy good companies at a good price. You, on the other hand, do not have the benefit of control and must manage your risk by demanding large margins of safety. Even with the luxury of control, Buffett strikes himself some pretty good deals. ([Location 4917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=4917))

- There are tens of thousands of potential stock investments available to investors. No investor has time to evaluate all of them, so you need to have methods of identifying small numbers of potentially good value stocks for which you can perform the necessary due diligence and valuation. Recall from Chapter 4 that there are both top-down and bottom-up approaches to analysis. In the top-down approach, you first forecast the economy, and then select industries which will likely perform well, and ([Location 5017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=5017))
- finally select the best value companies in the industry. In a bottom-up approach, you first identify the individual securities of interest, and then evaluate how they are expected to perform in the future economy.

You can choose to peruse financial publications for stocks that appear to be good companies trading at good prices, for example, reviewing publications like Barron’s each week. The April 20, 2013 edition of Barron’s featured an article titled “Chiquita Brands Has Appeal,” documenting that Chiquita Brands’ stock is down 40 percent yet is forecasted to produce $30 million in free cash flow going forward.

([Location 5178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EHIEATI&location=5178))
- In selecting value managers you should seek those that have a long history of strong performance and who charge reasonable expense ratios. You can find such managers by screening databases such as Morningstar. Learn as much as you can about the manager and, if possible, interview a manager to learn his or her value investing philosophy and processes using the techniques described in this book to make sure this style reflects your own beliefs and that his or her processes are sound. Investigate the manager’s experience, education, and professional certifications, such as the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation.
