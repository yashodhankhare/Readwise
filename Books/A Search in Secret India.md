## Highlights
- This may seem quite an insignificant and personal thing to do, but as a child of this modern generation, which relies on hard facts and cold reason, and which lacks enthusiasm for things religious, I regard it as quite an achievement. This faith was restored in the only way a sceptic could have it restored, not by argument, but by the witness of an overwhelming experience.

- I have borne witness in the book to other things also, things marvelous and weird. They seem incredible now, as I sit and type my narrative through the inked ribbon amid the matter-of-fact surroundings of English country-side; indeed, I wonder at my temerity in writing them down for a skeptical world to read. But I do not believe the present materialistic ideas which dominate the world will remain for all time; already one can perceive prophetic indications of a coming change of thought. Yet quite frankly I do not believe in miracles. Neither do most men of my generation. But I do believe that ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=129))

- The desire to view India never leaves the promoter of that unfortunate expedition. The dawn of manhood, however, brings bonds in the form of other interests and holds his feet with enchaining duties. That desire has to be put regretfully in the background. Time turns page after page of the calendar of years until he meets unexpectedly with a man who gives a temporary but vivid life to the old ambition. For the stranger's face is dusky, his head is turbaned, and he comes from the sun-steeped land of Hindustan. I fling out the fine net of remembrance to sweep the past years for pictures of that day when he steps into my life. The tide of autumn is fast ebbing, for the air is foggy and a bitter cold creeps through my clothing. Clammy fingers of depression strive hard to grip my failing heart. I wander into a brightly-lit cafe and seek the borrowed comfort of its warmth. A cup of hot tea - so potent at other times - fails to restore my serenity. I cannot banish the heavy atmosphere which surrounds me. Melancholy determined to make me serve her dark ends. Black curtains cover the entrance to my heart. This restlessness is difficult to endure and it ends by driving me from the cafe into the open street. I walk without aim and follow old tracks until I find myself in front of a small bookshop which I know well. It is an ancient building and harbours equally ancient books. The proprietor is a quaint man, a human relic surviving from an earlier century. This hustling epoch has little use for him, but he has just as little use for this epoch. He deals only in rare tomes and early editions, while specializing in curious and recondite subjects. He possesses a remarkable knowledge - so far as books can give it - of learning's bypaths and out-of-the-way matters. From time to time, I like to wander into the old shop and discuss them with him. I enter the place and greet him. For a while I finger the yellowed pages of calf-bound volumes or peer closely into faded folios. One ancient book engages my attention; it seems somewhat interesting and I examine it more carefully. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=158))

- The bespectacled bookseller notes my interest and, as is his wont, commences what he imagines to be an argument anent the book's subject - metempsychosis. The old man follows habit and keeps the discussion to his own side. He talks at length, appearing to know the pros and cons of that strange doctrine better than my author, while the classic authorities who have written about it are at his finger-tips. In this way I glean much curious information. Suddenly, I hear a man stirring at the far end of the shop and, turning, I behold a tall figure emerge from the shadows which hide a little inner room where the costlier books are kept. The stranger is an Indian. He walks toward us with an aristocratic bearing and faces the bookseller. "My friend," he says quietly, "pardon me for intruding. I could not help overhearing you, while the subject you discussed is of great interest to me. Now you quote the classical authors who first mention this idea of man's continual rebirth upon this earth. The deeper minds among those philosophic Greeks, wise Africans and early Christian Fathers understood this doctrine well, I agree. But where, do you think, did it really originate?" He pauses for a moment, but gives no time for a reply. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=172))

- "Permit me to tell you," he continues, smiling. "You must look to India for the first acceptance of metempsychosis in the Old World. It was a cardinal tenet among the people of my land, even in remote antiquity." The speaker's face fascinates me. It is unusual; it would be distinguished-looking among a hundred Indians. Power kept in reserve - this is my reading of his character. Piercing eyes, a strong jaw and a lofty forehead make up the catalogue of his features. His skin is darker than that of the average Hindu. He wears a magnificent turban, the front of which is adorned with a sparkling jewel. For the rest, his clothes are European and finely tailored withal. His slightly didactic statement does not appeal to the old gentleman behind the counter; in fact, vigorous opposition is offered to it. "How can that be," comes the skeptical observation, "when the East Mediterranean cities were flourishing centres of culture and civilization… ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=181))

- "Not at all," is his immediate reply. "What really happened was quite the reverse of your assertion." "Indeed! You seriously suggest that the progressive West had to receive its philosophy from the laggard East? No, sir! " expostulates the bookseller. "Why not? Read your Apuleius again, my friend, and learn how Pythagoras came to India, where he was instructed by the Brahmins. Then notice how he began to teach the doctrine of metempsychosis after his return to Europe. This is but a single instance. I can find others. Your reference to the laggard East makes me smile. Thousands of years ago our sages were pondering over the deepest problems while your own countrymen were not even aware that such problems existed." He stops curtly, looks intently at us, and waits for his words to sink into our minds. I fancy the old bookseller is a little perplexed. Never before have I seen him so struck into silence or so obviously… ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=190))

- room, only to emerge a couple of minutes later with a costly folio which he has selected from the shelves. He pays for the book and prepares to leave the shop. He reaches the door, whilst I stare wonderingly at his departing figure. Suddenly, he turns again and approaches me. He draws a wallet out of his pocket and selects a visiting card. "Would you care to pursue this conversation with me ?" he asks, half… ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=198))

- Suddenly my host raises his head and looks at me. "Did I tell you that two or three still remain?" he asks queerly. "Ah, yes! I said that. Once I knew a great sage. It was a privilege about which I rarely speak to others now. He was my father, guide, master and friend. He possessed the wisdom of a god. I loved him as if I were really his own son. Whenever I stayed with him at fortunate intervals, I knew then that life at its heart is good. Such was the effect of his wonderful atmosphere. I, who have made art my hobby and beauty my ideal, learnt from him to see the divine beauty in men who were leprous, destitute or deformed; men from whom I formerly shrank in horror. He lived in a forest hermitage far from the towns. I stumbled upon his retreat seemingly by accident. From that day I paid him several visits, staying with him as long as I could. He taught me much. Yes - such a man could give greatness to any country." "Then why did he not enter public life and serve India?" I question frankly. The Indian shakes his head. "It is difficult enough for us to understand the motives of such an unusual man. It would be doubly difficult for you, a Westerner, to understand him. His answer might probably be that service can be rendered in secret through the telepathic power of the mind; that influence can be exerted from a distance in an unseen yet no less potent manner. He might INDIA also say that a degenerate society must suffer its destiny until the fated hour of relief strikes." I confess to being puzzled by this answer. "Quite so, my friend, I expected that," observes the other. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=240))

- One evening our conversation takes a turn which is destined to have important results for me. He describes on occasions the queer customs and peculiar traditions of his countrymen; sometimes he portrays in words a few of the types who people his amazing land. He drops a remark this evening anent a strange type, the Yogi. I possess but a vague and incoherent idea of what the term really means. It has come to my notice a few times during the course of my reading, but on each occasion the terms of reference differ so much from the others that confusion is the natural result. So, when I hear my friend use the word I stop him short and beg for further information. "That I shall do with pleasure," he answers, "but I can hardly tell you, in a single definition, what constitutes a Yogi. No doubt, a dozen of my countrymen will define the word in a dozen different ways. For instance, there are thousands of wandering beggars who pass by this name. They swarm through the villages and attend the periodic religious fairs in droves. Many are only lazy tramps and others vicious ones, while most are totally illiterate men, unaware of the history and doctrines of the science of Yoga, under whose shelter they masquerade." He pauses to flick the ash off his cigarette. "Go, however, to some place like Rishikesh, over which the mighty Himalayas keep eternal guard. There you will find a totally different class of men. They live in humble huts or caves, eat little food and constantly pray to God. Religion is their breath; it occupies their minds day and night. They are mostly good men studying our sacred books and chanting prayers. Yet they, too, are called Yogis. But what have they in common with the beggars who prey on the ignorant masses? You see how elastic the term is! Between these two classes there are others who partake of the nature of both." "And yet there seems to be much made of the mysterious powers possessed by Yogis," I remark. "Ah! now you must listen to a further definition," he laughs back at me. " There are strange individuals in solitary retreats far from the big cities, in the seclusion of lonely jungles or mountain caves, men who devote their entire existence to practices which they believe will bring marvelous powers. Some of these men will eschew all mention of religion and scorn it; others, however, are highly religious; but all of them unite in the struggle to wrest from Nature a mastery over forces invisible and intangible. You see, India has never been without her traditions of the mysterious, the occult, and many are the stories told of those adepts who could perform miraculous feats. Now these men, too, are called Yogis." "Have you met such men? Do you believe these traditions?" I ask innocently. The other man is silent. He seems to be ruminating over the form in which to couch his reply. My eyes turn to the shrine which stands upon the lacquered table. I fancy, in the soft light which fills our room, that the Buddha is smiling benignantly… ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=255))

- "Higher than the Yogis stand the Rishees," he answers. "Transfer the Darwinian theory to the realm of human character; accept the Brahmin teaching that there is a spiritual evolution running parallel with the physical one; look upon the Rishees as men who have attained the crest of this upward climb; then you may form some rough conception of their greatness." "Does a Rishee also perform those wonders of which we hear?" "Yes,… ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=286))

- "How do you know that? " I ask, somewhat startled. "I knew it that day we first met," is the astonishing answer. "It came to me as an intuition - does it matter what you call it? - as a message deeply felt but inexplicable by outward evidences. My master taught me how to train this feeling, to develop it. Now, I have learnt to trust it implicitly." "A modern Socrates guided by his daemon!" I remark half-jocosely. "But tell me, when do you think your prophecy will come true?" He shrugs his shoulders. "I am not a prophet. So I regret that I cannot date the event for you." I do not press him, though I suspect he could say more if he would. I meditate upon the matter and then offer a suggestion. "I suppose you will return to your own country eventually. If I am ready at the time, could we not travel together? Would you not help me locate some of these men we have been discussing?" "No, my friend. Go alone. It will be better that you do your own finding." "It will be so difficult for a stranger," I complain. "Yes - very difficult. But go alone; one day you will see that I am right."  From that time I feel strongly that a momentous day will dawn which will find me at anchor in the sunny East. I reflect that if India has harboured such great men as the Rishees in the past, and if, as my friend believes, there may be a few of them still in existence, then the trouble of locating them might be balanced by the reward of learning something of their wisdom. Peradventure, I might then gain an understanding and content which life has so far denied me. Even if I fail in such a quest, the journey will not be a vain one. For those queer men, the Yogis, with their magic, their mysterious practices and their strange mode of living, excite my curiosity and arouse my interest. The journalistic grindstone has sharpened to an abnormal keenness my concern with the unusual. I am fascinated by the prospect of exploring such little-known trails. I decide to carry out my fancy to its full proportions and, when opportunity allows, take the first boat to India.

- Professional work throws me for several months into frequent contact with a man for whom I entertain a high respect and friendly regard. He is exceedingly astute and knows human nature through every letter of its alphabet. Many years earlier he held the post of Professor of Psychology at one of our universities, but an academic life was not to his taste. He deserted it for pastures where he could put his amazing range of knowledge to more practical use. For a time he acted as adviser to magnates of the business world. How often has he boasted of drawing several retaining fees from the chiefs of large firms! He is born with the remarkable gift of inspiring others to their best endeavours. Every person he meets - from office boy to millionaire magnate - finds practical help and new enthusiasm from the contact; sometimes they receive golden advice. I make it a practice to take careful note of any counsel he gives me, for his foresight and insight usually receive startling verification in both business and personal matters. I enjoy his company because he has succeeded in fusing the elements of introspection and extrospection in his own nature, with the result that he can talk profound philosophy one minute and deal with a commercial report the next. Withal he is never dull, always witty and radiating good-humour. He admits me into the circle of intimate friendship and, sometimes, we spend several hours at a time in mingled work and pleasure. I never tire of listening to his talk, for its latitude of subject enthrals me. I wonder often that one small head can carry all he knows! One night we go out to dine together in a little Bohemian restaurant where pleasantly shaded lights and nicely cooked food accompany each other. After the meal we find a full moon resplendent in the heavens, and tempted by the witchery of its poetic light, decide to walk homewards. The conversation has been somewhat light and frivolous for most of the evening, but as we walk on through the city's quieter streets, it drifts into philosophical depths. The close of our nocturnal peregrination finds us discussing subjects so abstruse that some of my companion's clients would take fright at the mere sound of the names. Outside his door, he turns and proffers a hand in farewell. As he grips mine, he suddenly addresses me in grave tones and says slowly: "You ought never to have entered this profession. You are really a philosopher caught up in the ink-slinging business of writing. Why did you not become a university don and spend your life in secluded research? For you like to put on those carpet slippers of yours and walk around inside your brain. You are trying to reach the very source of the mind. One day you will go out to the Yogis of India, to the Lamas of Tibet and the Zen monks of Japan. Then you will write some strange records. Good night!" "What do you think of these Yogis?" The other man bends his head towards mine and halfwhispers in my ear: "My friend, they know, they… ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=327))

- "I am more than satisfied! But I am at a loss to understand in what way you can do it." " it is forbidden me to explain. The restraint of breath is a practice which is part of advanced Yoga. To a white man it may seem a foolish thing to strive for, yet to us it is of much importance." "But we have always been taught that man cannot live without breathing. Surely that is not a foolish idea?" "It is not foolish; nevertheless it is not true. I can hold my breath for two hours, if I wish. Many times I have done that, but I am not yet dead, you see!" Brama smiles. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1263))

- "I am puzzled. If you are not permitted to explain, perhaps you can throw a little light upon the theory behind your practices?" "Very well. There is a lesson we can draw from watching certain animals, which is a favoured method of instruction with my master. An elephant breathes much more slowly than a monkey, yet it lives much longer. Some of the large serpents breathe far more slowly than a dog, yet they live far longer. Thus, creatures exist which show that slowness of breathing may possibly prolong age. If you can follow me so far, the next step will be easier for you to grasp. Now, in the Himalayas, there are bats which go into winter sleep. They hang suspended in the mountain caverns for weeks, yet they do not draw a single breath until they again awaken. The Himalayan bears, too, will sometimes sink into trance throughout the winter, their bodies apparently without life. In deep burrows of the Himalayas, when food cannot be found during the winter, there are hedgehogs which pass into sleep for some months, a sleep in which breathing is suspended. If these animals cease to breathe for a time, and yet live, why should not human beings be able to do the same?'' His statement of curious facts is interesting, but it is not so convincing as his demonstration. The common notion that breathing is an essential function in every condition of life is not to be thrown aside at a few minutes' notice. "We Westerners will always find it difficult to understand how life can continue in a body unless breathing continues also." "Life always continues," he answers cryptically. "Death is but a habit of the body." "But surely you cannot mean that it may be possible to conquer death?" I enquire incredulously. Brama looks at me in a strange manner. "Why not? " There is a tense pause. His eyes search me, but they do it in a kindly way. "Because there are possibilities in you, I shall tell you one of our old secrets. But I must first demand your agreement to one condition." "And that ?" "You shall not attempt to practise any breathing exercise as an experiment, except those which I may teach you later" "I agree." "Keep your word, then. Now you have hitherto believed that the complete stoppage of breathing brings death?" "Yes." " I s it not reasonable to believe, also, that the complete holding of the breath within one's body keeps life within us for so long as the breath is held, at least?" "Well------?"

- "We claim no more than that. We say that an adept in breath control, who can completely retain his breath at will, thereby retains his life current. Do you grasp t h a t ?" "I think so." "Imagine, now, an adept in Yoga who can keep the locked breath, not merely for a few minutes as a curiosity, but for weeks, for months and even for years. Since you admit that where there is breath there must be life, do you not see how the prospect of prolonged life opens up for man?" I am dumb. How can I dismiss this assertion as preposterous? Yet how can I accept it? Does it not recall to memory the idle dreams of our European alchemists of medieval times, dreamers who sought an elixir of life, but who succumbed… ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1284))

I do not understand how or why it can influence me or others in any mental or spiritual manner. The belief savours of superstition.

- "You have thought yourself into your present ignorance; now think yourself back into wisdom, which is the same as self-understanding. Thought is like a bullock cart which carries a man into the darkness of a mountain tunnel. Turn it backwards and you will be carried back to the light again." I ruminate over his words, which still puzzle me a little. Seeing this, the Sage beckons for the pad, poises the pencil in the air for a few moments, and explains: "This backward-turning of thought is the highest Yoga.

- Now do you understand?" A very dim light begins to dawn on me. I feel that, given sufficient time in which to meditate on the matter, we shall be able to understand each other; therefore, I resolve not to press the point too much. I am so intent on watching him that I have not noticed the arrival of a fresh visitor, who has taken advantage of the opened gate to enter and join us. I become aware of his presence only when he breathes a strange remark into my ear, for he is sitting immediately behind me. Whilst I am puzzling over a reply of the Sage, feeling slightly disappointed at the cryptic character of his words, a mysterious murmur reaches me, its words phrased in excellent English: "My master can give you the answer for which you are waiting." I turn my head and look at the intruder. He is a man not older than forty, dressed in the ochrecoloured robe of a wandering Yogi. The skin of his face shines like polished brass. He is well built and broad shouldered - a powerful looking figure. His nose is thin, prominent and beaked like a parrot's. His eyes are small and seem to be wrinkled in perpetual laughter. He squats upon his haunches and grins broadly at me when our eyes meet. But I cannot perpetrate the rude action of entering into desultory conversation with the stranger, so I turn back and fix my attention again upon the Sage. Another question comes to the forefront of my mind. It is possibly too daring or too impertinent. "Master, the world needs help. Is it right for the wise ones, such as yourself, to be lost to it in solitary retirement?" A quizzical expression crosses the calm face of the hermit. "My son," he replies, "when you do not know yourself, how can you dream of understanding me? It is of little avail to discuss the things of the spirit. Strive to enter into your inner self through the practice of Yoga. You must work hard upon this path. Then your problems will solve themselves of their own accord." I make a last attempt to draw him. "The world needs a deeper light than it possesses. I would like to find it and share it. What shall I d o ?" "When you know the Truth you will know exactly what to do to serve mankind best, nor will you lack the power to do so.

- If a flower possesses the honey, the bee will find it out of its own accord. If a man possesses spiritual wisdom and strength, he need not go in search of people; they will come unasked to him. Cultivate your inner self until you know it fully. No other instruction is necessary. This is the only thing to do." He then informs us that he wishes to close the interview, so as to resume his trance. I ask for a final message. The silent Sage gazes over my head into seeming space. A minute later he pencils a reply and pushes the pad towards me. We read: "I am very pleased because you came here. Take this as my initiation." I hardly finish taking in the purport of his answer when I suddenly feel a strange force entering my body. It pours through my spinal column and stiffens the neck and draws up the head. The power of will seems raised to a superlative degree. I become conscious of a dynamic urge to conquer myself and make the body obey the will to realize one's deepest ideals. And I feel intuitively that those ideals are but voices of my best self, which alone can promise me lasting happiness. A queer thought comes to me that some current is being projected to me from the Sage, some invisible telepathic current. Can it be that he is thus vouchsafing to me an inkling of his own attainment? The eyes of the recluse become fixed and the far-off look again enters them. His body becomes taut as he settles down more firmly into his familiar posture. I plainly perceive that he is withdrawing his attention into depths which may possibly be deeper than thought, that he is plunging his consciousness into inner recesses which he loves better than this world. Is he then a true Yogi? Is he engaged on… ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1618))

That is true of both the East and West. Society must be brought into tune with a higher note. Materialism must be balanced by idealism; there is no other real cure for the world's difficulties. The troubles into which countries are everywhere being plunged are really the agonies which will force this change, just as failure is frequently a sign-post pointing to another road."

- The world is calmer at those times and will disturb your meditations less." He gazes benevolently at me. I begin to envy the saintly peace which dwells on his bearded face. Surely, his heart has never known the devastating upheavals which have scarred mine? I am stirred to ask him impulsively: "If I fail, may I then turn to you for assistance?" Shri Shankara gently shakes his head. "I am at the head of a public institution, a man whose time no longer belongs to himself. My activities demand almost all my time. For years I have spent only three hours in sleep each night. How can I take personal pupils? You must find a master who devotes his time to them." "But I am told that real masters are rare, and that a European is unlikely to find them." He nods his assent to my statement, but adds: "Truth exists. It can be found." "Can you not direct me to such a master, one who you know is competent to give me proofs of the reality of higher Yoga?" His Holiness does not reply till after an interval of protracted silence. "Yes. I know of only two masters in India who could give you what you wish. One of them lives in Benares, hidden away in a large house, which is itself hidden among spacious grounds. Few people are permitted to obtain access to him; certainly, no European has yet been able to intrude upon his seclusion. I could send you to him, but I fear that he may refuse to admit a European." "And the other ?" My interest is strangely stirred. "The other man lives in the interior, farther south. I visited him once and know him to be a high master. I recommend that you go to him." "Who is h e ?" "He is called the Maharishee. I have not met him, but know him to be a high master. Shall I provide you with full instructions, so that you may discover him?" A picture flashes suddenly before my mind's eye. I see the yellow-robed friar, who has vainly persuaded me to accompany him to his teacher. I hear him murmuring the name of a hill. It is: "The Hill of the Holy Beacon." "Many thanks, Your Holiness," I rejoin, "but I have a guide who comes from the place." "Then you will go there?" I hesitate. "All arrangements have been made for my departure from the South to-morrow," I mutter uncertainly. " I n that case I have a request to make." "With pleasure." "Promise me that you will not leave South India before you have met the Maharishee." I read in his eyes a sincere desire to help me. The promise is given. A benignant smile crosses his face. "Do not be anxious. You shall discover that which you seek." A murmur from the crowd which is in the street penetrates the house. "I have taken up too much of your valuable time," I apologize. " I am indeed sorry." Shri Shankara's grave mouth relaxes. He follows me into the ante-room and whispers something into the ear of my companion. I catch my name in the sentence. At the door I turn to bow in farewell salutation.

- who need them. His beautiful and gentle personality will surely linger in my memory. I wander about Chingleput till evening, exploring its artistic, old-world beauty, and then seek a final glimpse of His Holiness before returning home. I find him in the largest temple of the city. The slim, modest, yellow-robed figure is addressing a huge concourse of men, women and children. Utter silence prevails among the large audience. I cannot understand his vernacular words, but I can understand that he is holding the deep attention of all present, from the intellectual Brahmin to the illiterate peasant. I do not know, but I hazard the guess that he speaks on the profoundest topics in the simplest manner, for such is the character I read in him. And yet, though I appreciate his beautiful soul, I envy the simple faith of his vast audience. Life, apparently, never brings them deep moods of doubt. God is; and there the matter ends. They do not appear to know what it means to go through dark nights of the soul, when the world seems like the grim scene of a jungle-like struggle; when God recedes into shadowy nothingness; and when man's own existence seems nothing more than a fitful ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1907))

- passage across this small, transient fragment of the universe which we call Earth. We drive out of Chingleput under an indigo sky gemmed with stars. I listen to palms majestically waving their branches over the water's edge in an unexpected breeze. My companion suddenly breaks the silence between us. "You are indeed lucky!" "Why?" "Because this is the first interview which His Holiness has granted to a European writer." "Well ?" "That brings his blessing upon you!"  It is nearly midnight when I return home. I take a last glimpse overhead. The stars stud the vast dome of the sky in countless myriads. Nowhere in Europe can one see them in such overwhelming numbers. I run up the steps leading to the veranda, flashing my pocket torch. Out of the darkness, a crouching figure rises and… ([Location 1915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1915))

Where could you have learnt this?" "Never mind. To-morrow we both start for his place. I shall change my plans." "This is joyful news, sir." "But I shall not stay there long, though. A few days, maybe." I fling a few more questions at him during the next half-hour, and then, thoroughly tired, go to bed. Subramanya is quite content to sleep on a piece of palm matting which lies on the floor. He wraps himself up in a thin cotton cloth, which serves at once as a mattress, sheet and blanket, and disdains my offer of more comfortable bedding. The next thing of which I am aware is suddenly awakening. The room is totally dark.… ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1923))

My astounded gaze meets the face and form of His Holiness Shri Shankara. It is clearly and unmistakably visible. He does not appear to be some ethereal ghost, but rather a solid human being. There is a mysterious luminosity around the figure which separates it from the surrounding darkness. Surely the vision is an impossible one? Have I not left him at Chingleput? I close my eyes tightly in an effort to test the matter. There is no difference and I still see him quite plainly! Let it suffice that I receive the sense of a benign and friendly presence. I open my eyes and regard the kindly figure in the loose yellow robe. The face alters, for the lips smile and seem to say: "Be humble and then you shall find what you seek!" Why do I feel that a living human being is thus addressing me? Why do I not regard it as a ghost, at least? The vision disappears as mysteriously as it has come. It leaves me feeling exalted, happy and unperturbed by its supernormal… ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=1930))

- For my plans have changed their face; a concatenation of unexpected circumstances has arisen to drive me farther South, instead of going farther East as I have intended. Is it possible, I ask myself, that these golden claws hold a stone which really possesses the mysterious power which the Yogi has claimed for it? Although I endeavour to keep an open mind, it is difficult for any Westerner of scientifically trained mind to credit the idea. I dismiss the speculation from my mind, but do not succeed in driving away the uncertainty which lurks at the back of my thoughts. Why is it that my footsteps have been so strangely guided to the mountain hermitage whither I am travelling? Why is it that two men, who both wear the yellow robe, have been coupled as destiny's agents to the extent of directing my reluctant eyes towards the Marishee? I use this word destiny, not in its common sense, but because I am at a loss for a better one. Past experience has taught me full well that seemingly unimportant happenings sometimes play an unexpected part in composing the picture of one's life.

- "Arunachala! The sacred red mountain!" exclaims my companion, noticing the direction of my gaze. A fervent expression of adoration passes across his face. He is momentarily rapt in ecstasy, like some medieval saint. I ask him, "Does the name mean anything?" "I have just given you the meaning," he replies with a smile. "The name is composed of two words,' Aruna' and 'Achala,' which mean red mountain, and since it is also the name of the presiding deity of the temple, its full translation should be 'sacred red mountain.'" "Then where does the holy beacon come in?" "Ah! Once a year the temple priests celebrate their central festival. Immediately that occurs within the temple, a huge fire blazes out on top of the mountain, its flame being fed with vast quantities of butter and camphor. It burns for many days and can be seen for many miles around. Whoever sees it, at once prostrates himself before it. It symbolizes the fact that this mountain is sacred ground, overshadowed by a great deity." The hill now towers over our heads. It is not without its rugged grandeur, this lonely peak patterned with red, brown and grey boulders, thrusting its flat head thousands of feet into the pearly sky.

- Maharishee and I can take in every detail of his profile, for he is seated gazing rigidly through the window in the precise direction whence we have come this morning. His head does not move, so, thinking to catch his eye and greet him as I offer the fruits, I move quietly over to the window, place the gift before him, and retreat a pace or two. A small brass brazier stands before his couch. It is filled with burning charcoal, and a pleasant odour tells me that some aromatic powder has been thrown on the glowing embers. Close by is an incense burner filled with joss sticks. Threads of bluish grey smoke arise and float in the air, but the pungent perfume is quite different. I fold a thin cotton blanket upon the floor and sit down, gazing expectantly at the silent figure in such a rigid attitude upon the couch. The Maharishee's body is almost nude, except for a thin, narrow loin-cloth, but that is common enough in these parts. His skin is slightly copper-coloured, yet quite fair in comparison with that of the average South Indian. I judge him to be a tall man; his age somewhere in the early fifties. His head, which is covered with closely cropped grey hair, is well formed. ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=2036))

- The high and broad expanse of forehead gives intellectual distinction to his personality. His features are more European than Indian. Such is my first impression. The couch is covered with white cushions and the Maharishee's feet rest upon a magnificently marked tiger skin. Pin-drop silence prevails throughout the long hall. The sage remains perfectly still, motionless, quite undisturbed at our arrival. A swarthy disciple sits on the floor at the other side of the divan. He breaks into the quietude by beginning to pull at a rope which works a punkah-fan made of bamboo matting. The fan is fixed to a wooden beam and suspended immediately above the sage's head. I listen to its rhythmic purring, the while I look full into the eyes of the seated figure in the hope of catching his notice. They are dark brown, medium-sized and wide open.

Yet no one in the hall seems to stir; certainly no one dares to speak.

It has come upon me abruptly, this strange reception characterized by complete indifference. The first thought which would come into the mind of any European, " I s this man merely posing for the benefit of his devotees?" crosses my mind once or twice but I soon rule it out. He is certainly in a trance condition, though my guide has not informed me that his master indulges in trances. The next thought which occupies my mind, " I s this state of mystical contemplation nothing more than meaningless vacancy?" has a longer sway but I let it go for the simple reason that I cannot answer it. There is something in this man which holds my attention as steel filings are held by a magnet. I cannot turn my gaze away from him. My initial bewilderment, my perplexity at being totally ignored, slowly fade away as this strange fascination begins to grip me more firmly.

I perceive with sudden clarity that the intellect creates its own problems and then makes itself miserable trying to solve them. This is indeed a novel concept to enter the mind of one who has hitherto placed such high value upon intellect. I surrender myself to the steadily deepening sense of restfulness until two hours have passed. The passage of time now provokes no irritation, because I feel that the chains of mindmade problems are being broken and thrown away.

This dawning suspicion that the mysterious peace which has arisen within me must be attributed to the geographical situation in which I am now placed, is my reaction to the personality of the Maharishee. I begin to wonder whether, by some radioactivity of the soul, some unknown telepathic process, the stillness which invades the troubled waters of my own soul really comes from him. Yet he remains completely impassive, completely unaware of my very existence, it seems. Comes the first ripple. Someone approaches me and whispers in my ear, "Did you not wish to question the Maharishee?" He may have lost patience, this quondam guide of mine.

Then the head turns, the face moves slowly, very slowly, and bends downward at an angle. A few more moments, and it has brought me into the ambit of its vision.

The soft burr of the rope and the gentle swish of the fan as it moves through the sultry air sound pleasantly in my ears.

"Master, I have studied our Western philosophies and sciences, lived and worked among the people of our crowded cities, tasted their pleasures and allowed myself to be caught up into their ambitions. Yet I have also gone into solitary places and wandered there amid the loneliness of deep thought. I have questioned the sages of the West; now I have turned my face towards the East.

The three or four devotees who are gathered around us stare in surprise. Have I offended the subtle etiquette of the hermitage by speaking so brusquely and boldly to their master? I do not know; perhaps I do not care. The accumulated weight of many years' desire has unexpectedly escaped my control and passed beyond my lips. If the Maharishee is the right kind of man, surely he will understand and brush aside mere lapses from convention. He makes no verbal reply but appears to have dropped into some train of thought. Because there is nothing else to do and because my tongue has now been loosened, I address him for the third time: "The wise men of the West, our scientists, are greatly honoured for their cleverness. Yet they have confessed that they can throw but little light upon the hidden truth behind life.

"Through deep reflection on the nature of one's self, and through constant meditation, the light can be found." "I have frequently given myself up to meditation upon the truth, but I see no signs of progress." "How do you know that no progress has been made?

But I do not yield so easily on this occasion, for I come from a world where the tragedies of life press far more heavily on people than they do in this peaceful jungle retreat. "Will the world soon enter a new era of friendliness and mutual help, or will it go down into chaos and war? " I persist.

First, find out the truth behind yourself; then you will be in a better position to understand the truth behind the world, of which yourself is a part." There is an abrupt pause. An attendant approaches and lights another incense stick. The Maharishee watches the blue smoke curl its way upwards and then picks up his manuscript book. He unfolds its pages and begins to work on it again, thus dismissing me from the field of his attention. This renewed indifference of his plays like cold water upon my self-esteem.

When this peace will flow into you, then you shall have to forget your own self, for you will have turned your life over to THAT! And the Maharishee places one end of a thread of silver light in my hand. I awaken from that extraordinarily vivid dream with the sense of its penetrating sublimity yet upon me. Immediately the Maharishee's eyes meet mine. His face is now turned in my direction, and he is looking fixedly into my eyes. What lies behind that dream? For the desires and bitternesses of personal life fade for a while into oblivion. That condition of lofty indifference to self and profound pity for my fellows which I have dreamt into being, does not take its departure even though I am now awake. 'Tis a strange experience. But if the dream has any verity in it, then the thing will not last; it is not yet for me. How long have I been sunk in dream? For everyone in the hall now begins to rise and to prepare for sleep.

The second cause is certainly a strange one, but nevertheless it exists. Since the evening of that peculiar dream, I feel a great awe whenever I enter his presence. The questions which would otherwise have come chatteringly from my lips are hushed, because it seems almost sacrilege to regard him as a person with whom one can talk and argue on an equal plane, so far as common humanity is concerned. The third cause of my failure is simple enough. Almost always there are several other persons present in the hall, and I feel disinclined to bring out my private thoughts in their presence. After all, I am a stranger to them and a foreigner in this district. That I voice a different language to some of them is a fact of little import, but that I possess a cynical, skeptical outlook unstirred by religious emotion is a fact of much import when I attempt to give utterance to that outlook.

My proposed week-end quickly passes and I extend it to a week. The first conversation which I have had with the Maharishee worthy of the name is likewise the last.

There is a mysterious property in this man which differentiates him from all others I have met. I feel, somehow, that he does not belong to us, the human race, so much as he belongs to Nature, to the solitary peak which rises abruptly behind the hermitage, to the rough tract of jungle which stretches away into distant forests, and to the impenetrable sky which fills all space. Something of the stony, motionless quality of lonely Arunachala seems to have entered into the Maharishee. I have learnt that he has lived on the hill for thirty years and refuses to leave it, even for a single short journey. Such a close association must inevitably have its effects on a man's character. I know that he loves this hill, for someone has translated a few lines of a charming but pathetic poem which… ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=2290))

Just as Arunachala, Hill of the Sacred Beacon, stands aloof, apart from the irregular chain of hills which girdles the entire landscape, so does the Maharishee remain mysteriously aloof even when surrounded by his own devotees, men who have loved him and lived near him for years. The impersonal, impenetrable quality of all Nature - so peculiarly exemplified in this sacred mountain - has somehow entered into him. It has segregated him from his weaker fellows, perhaps for ever. Sometimes I catch myself wishing that he would be a little more human, a little more susceptible to what seems so normal to us, but so like feeble failings when exhibited in his impersonal presence. And yet, if he has really attained to some sublime realization beyond the common, how can one expect him to do so without passing beyond man, without leaving his laggard race behind for ever? Why is it that under his strange glance I invariably experience a peculiar expectancy, as though some stupendous revelation will soon be made to me? Yet beyond the moods of palpable serenity and the dream which stars itself in the sky of memory, no verbal or other revelation has been communicated to me. I feel somewhat desperate at the pressure of time. Almost a fortnight gone and only a single talk that means anything! Even the abruptness in the sage's voice has helped, metaphorically, to keep me off. This unwonted reception is also unexpected, for I have not forgotten the glowing inducements to come here with which the yellow-robed holy man plied me. The tantalizing thing is that I want the sage, above all other men, to loosen his tongue for me, because a single thought has somehow aken possession of my mind. I do not obtain it by any process of ratiocination; it comes unbidden, entirely of its own accord.

I hasten back to the hall and sit down conveniently near the divan. The Maharishee turns his face immediately, his mouth relaxing into a pleasant greeting. Straightway, I feel at ease and begin to question him. "The Yogis say that one must renounce this world and go off into secluded jungles or mountains, if one wishes to find truth. Such things can hardly be done in the West; our lives are so different. Do you agree with the Yogis?" The Maharishee turns to a Brahmin disciple of courtly countenance. The latter translates his answer to me. "The life of action need not be renounced. If you will meditate for an hour or two every day, you can then carry on with your duties. If you meditate in the right manner, then the current of mind induced will continue to flow even in the midst of your work. It is as though there were two ways of… ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=2314))

- change. Your actions will tend to follow your meditations of their own accord." "Then you do not agree with the Yogis?" I try to pin him down. But the Maharishee eludes a direct answer. "A man should surrender the personal selfishness which binds him to this world. Giving up the false self is the true renunciation." "How is it possible to become selfless while leading a life of worldly activity?" "There is no conflict between work and wisdom." "Do you mean that one can continue all the old activities in one's profession, for instance, and at the same time get enlightenment?" "Why not? But in that case one will not think that it is the old personality which is doing the work, because one's consciousness will gradually become transferred until it is centred in That which is beyond the little self." " I f a person is engaged in work, there will be little time left for him to meditate."

"The Yogi tries to drive his mind to the goal, as a cowherd drives a bull with a stick, but on this path the seeker coaxes the bull by holding out a handful of grass!" "How is that done?" "You have to ask yourself the question, Who am I? This investigation will lead in the end to the discovery of something within you which is behind the mind. Solve that great problem, and you will solve all other problems thereby." There is a pause as I try to digest his answer. From the square-framed and barred hole in the wall which does duty as a window, as it does in so many Indian buildings, I obtain a fine view of the lower slopes of the sacred hill. Its strange outline is bathed in the early morning sunlight. The Maharishee addresses me again: "Will it be clearer if it is put in this way? All human beings are ever wanting happiness, untainted with sorrow. They want to grasp a happiness which will… ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=2331))

- through drink or through religion, and you are provided with a clue to the real nature of man." " I fail to see ." The tone of his voice becomes higher. "Man's real nature is happiness. Happiness is inborn in the true self. His search for happiness is an unconscious search for his true self. The true self is imperishable; therefore, when a man finds it, he finds a happiness which does not come to an end." "But the world is so unhappy? " "Yes, but that is because the world is ignorant of its true self. All men, without exception, are consciously or unconsciously seeking for it." "Even the wicked, the brutal and the criminal? " I ask. "Even they sin because they are trying to find the self's happiness in every sin which they commit. This striving is instinctive in man, but they do not know that they are really seeking their true selves, and so they try these wicked ways first as a means to happiness. Of course, they are wrong ways, for a man's acts are reflected back to him." "So we shall feel lasting happiness when we know this true self?" The other nods his head. A slanting ray of sunshine falls through the unglazed window upon the Maharishee's face. There is serenity in that unruffled brow, there is contentment around that firm mouth, there is a shrine-like peace in those lustrous eyes. His unlined countenance does not belie his revelatory words. What does the Maharishee mean by these apparently simple sentences? The interpreter has conveyed their outward meaning to me in English, yes, but there is a deeper purport which he cannot convey. I know that I must discover that for myself. The sage seems to speak, not as a philosopher, not as a pundit trying to explain his own doctrine, but rather out of the depth of his own heart. Are these words the marks of his own fortunate experience? "What exactly is this self of which you speak? If what you say is true, then there must be another self in man." His lips curve in a smile for a moment. "Can a man be possessed of two identities, two selves?" he makes answer. "To understand this matter it is first necessary for a man to analyse himself. Because it has long been his habit to think as others think, he has never faced his ' I ' in the true manner. He has not a correct picture of himself; he has too long identified himself with the body and the brain. Therefore, I tell you to pursue this enquiry, Who am I ?

- so is it the last to disappear. This is a matter which can be experienced." "You mean that it is perfectly possible to conduct such a mental investigation into oneself?" "Assuredly! It is possible to go inwards until the last thought ' I ' gradually vanishes." "What is left?" I query. "Will a man then become quite unconscious, or will he become an idiot?" "Not so! On the contrary, he will attain that consciousness which is immortal, and he will become truly wise, when he has awakened to his true self, which is the real nature of man." "But surely the sense of ' I' must also pertain to that?" I persist. "The sense of ' I' pertains to the person, the body and brain," replies the Maharishee calmly. " When a man knows his true self for the first time, something else arises from the depths of his being and takes possession of him. That something is behind the mind; it is infinite, divine, eternal. Some people call it the kingdom of heaven, others call it the soul, still others name it Nirvana, and we Hindus call it Liberation; you may give it what name you wish.

- it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. How strangely similar are the two sentences! Yet the Indian sage has arrived at the thought in his own non-Christian way, through a psychological path which seems exceedingly difficult and appears unfamiliar. The Maharishee speaks again, his words breaking into my thoughts. "Unless and until a man embarks upon this quest of the true self, doubt and uncertainty will follow his footsteps throughout life. The greatest kings and statesmen try to rule others, when in their heart of hearts they know that they cannot rule themselves. Yet the greatest power is at the command of the man who has penetrated to his inmost depth. There are men of giant intellects who spend their lives gathering knowledge about many things. Ask these men if they have solved the mystery of man, if they have conquered themselves, and they will hang their heads in shame.

- "The question of its possibility is a matter of one's own experience. The difficulty is less real than you think." "For us, who are active, practical Westerners, such introspections ?" I begin doubtfully and leave my sentence trailing in mid-air. The Maharishee bends down to light a fresh joss stick, which will replace one whose red spark is dying out. "The realization of truth is the same for both Indians and Europeans. Admittedly the way to it may be harder for those who are engrossed in worldly life, but even then one can and must conquer. The current induced during meditation can be kept up by habit, by practising to do so. Then one can perform his work and activities in that very current itself; there will be no break. Thus, too, there will be no difference between meditation and external activities.

- He holds my hand for a few moments. I deem it expedient to introduce myself and explain the object of my visit. When I have concluded speaking, he presses my hand again in a kindly manner and says: " it is a higher power which has stirred you to come to India, and which is bringing you in contact with the holy men of our land. There is a real purpose behind that, and the future will surely reveal it. Await it patiently." "Will you tell me something about your master Ramakrishna?" "Ah, now you raise a subject about which I love best to talk. It is nearly half a century since he left us, but his blessed memory can never leave me; always it remains fresh and fragrant in my heart. I was twenty-seven when I met him and was constantly in his society for the last five years of his life. The result was that I became a changed man; my whole attitude towards life was reversed. Such was the strange influence of this god-man Ramakrishna. He threw a spiritual spell upon all who visited him. He literally charmed them, fascinated them. Even materialistic persons who came to scoff became dumb in his presence." "But how can such persons feel reverence for spirituality - a quality in which they do not believe?" I interpose, slightly puzzled. The corners of Mahasaya's mouth pull up in a half smile. He answers: "Two persons taste red pepper. One does not know its name; perhaps he has never even seen it before. The other is ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=2726))

In the same way, ignorance of Ramakrishna's spiritual greatness did not debar materialistic persons from 'tasting' the radiant influence of spirituality which emanated from him." "Then he really was a spiritual superman?" "Yes, and in my belief even more than that. Ramakrishna was a simple man, illiterate and uneducated - he was so illiterate that he could not even sign his name, let alone write a letter.

- "I wonder what Ramakrishna would say to a man who cannot live by faith alone, who must satisfy reason and intellect?" I murmur questioningly. "He would tell the man to pray. Prayer is a tremendous force. Ramakrishna himself prayed to God to send him spiritually inclined people, and soon after that those who later became his disciples or devotees began to appear." "But if one has never prayed - what then?" "Prayer is the last resort. It is the ultimate resource left to man. Prayer will help a man where the intellect may fail." "But if someone came to you and said that prayer did not appeal to his temperament. What counsel would you give him?" I persist gently. "Then let him associate frequently with truly holy men who have had real spiritual experience. Constant contact with them will assist him to bring out his latent spirituality. Higher men turn our minds and wills towards divine objects. Above all, they stimulate an intense longing for the spiritual life. Therefore, the society of such men is very important as the first step, and often it is also the last, as Ramakrishna himself used to say."

"A man must first make himself ready; then, no matter where he is, he will eventually find a teacher. And if the master does not come in the flesh, he will appear to the inward eye of the seeker." "How shall one begin, then?" "Mark off a part of your time every day to sit in the simple posture which I shall show you. That will help to prepare you. Take care also to curb anger and control passion." Vishudhananda proceeds to show me the Lotus posture, with which I am already familiar.

I continue to gaze fixedly at the twinkling points of light. . . . When I look around again at my fellow creatures and at the amorphous mass of houses, I begin to feel deeply the recondite mystery of this world. Tangible things and ordinary objects recede quickly into unreality, and the blend of shadowy, moving figures, slowly gliding boats and a few bright lamps, turn both night and environment into some enchanted land of the dream world. The old Indian philosophical doctrine that the universe is but phantom-like in its real nature drifts into my mind and begins to abet this destruction of my sense of reality.

- " it is better that you regard the planets as being only symbols which stand in the sky; it is not they which really influence us, but our own past," he replies. "You will never understand the reasonable nature of astrology unless you accept the doctrine that man is born again and again, and that his fate follows him with every birth. If he escapes the results of his evil actions in one birth, they will punish him in his next; and if he does not receive a due reward for his good actions in one lifetime, he will surely receive it in the next. Without this doctrine of the continued return of man's soul to this earth until such time as it becomes perfect, the changing fortunes of different persons would seem the result of mere chance or blind luck. How can that be allowed by a just Deity? No - it is our belief that when a man dies, his character, desires, thoughts and will continue to exist until they enter a body of flesh once more and come among us in the form of a new-born baby. The good or evil actions committed in the former birth will be suitably rewarded or punished in the present or even future births. This is how we explain fate. When I said that you would be shipwrecked one day and in grave danger of drowning, that is the fit destiny which God, in His hidden justice, has portioned out to you because of something wrong which you did in a former birth.

- not the planets which force you into shipwreck, but the inescapable results of your former actions. The planets and their positions only act as a record of this destiny; why they should do so I cannot say. No man's brain could ever have invented astrology; it came to us from long ago, when it was revealed for man's benefit by the great seers of ancient times." As I listen to this plausible pronouncement, I hardly know what comment to make. He would bind one's soul and fortune to the stake of fate, but no healthy Westerner will let himself be despoiled of the prized possession of free will. What inhabitant of the energetic Occident can wax enthusiastic over this belief that it is destiny, and not choice, which directs him to take his steps?

- "The explanation is this. I live in the world and serve it through my work, which happens to be astrology. Secondly, I refuse to be looked upon as a teacher of Yoga, because in our Brahma Chinta the only teacher acknowledged is God. He is the only preceptor we acknowledge. He, as the universal soul, is in us, and will teach us. Look on me as a brother, if you wish, but do not look on me as a spiritual preceptor. Those who have a teacher are too apt to lean on him and to depend on him instead of their own soul." "And yet you depend on astrology for guidance," I retort quickly, "instead of your own soul." "You are not right. I never look at my own horoscope now - in fact, I tore it up many years ago." I express astonishment at this statement. He replies: "I have found the light and do not need astrology to guide me, but those who still walk in darkness find it helpful. I have placed my life entirely in the Lord's hands. I carry that act to its proper conclusion by giving up all care about future or past. Whatever the Lord sends, that I accept as His will. I have given my whole self - body, mind, actions and feelings - to the will of the Almighty." "Suppose you are threatened with death by a murderous ruffian, would you do nothing and accept that as God's will?" "When any danger arises I know that I have only to pray and instantly to receive His protection. Prayer is necessary but fear is not. I pray frequently and the Lord has marvelously protected me.

He looks at me fixedly, his peculiar black and white eyes searching my soul. "The chart of your horoscope cannot be wrongly drawn or I might keep back my knowledge from an unready mind. But the stars move without fault; what you are unable to grasp to-day will linger in your thoughts for a time and then return with double force. I tell you again that I am ready to impart the way of Brahma Chinta to you." "And I am ready to learn it."  Evening after evening I visit the old stone house of the astrologer and receive my lessons in Brahma Chinta. The pale lamplight throws flickering patterns upon his narrow face as he initiates me into the arcana of this primitive Tibetan Yoga system. At no time does he adopt the attitude of spiritual superiority or egoistic tutorship. He is humility personified and usually prefaces his instruction with the phrase, " I n this… ([Location 3280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3280))

- is that he frees his mind from his surroundings; objects fade away and the outside world seems to disappear. He discovers the soul as a living, real being within himself; its bliss, peace and power overwhelm him. All he needs is a single experience of this kind to obtain the proof that there is a divine and undying life in himself; never again can he forget it." A shred of doubt prompts my enquiry: "Are you sure that all this is not a deep form of autosuggestion?" A ghost of a smile curls around his lips. "When a mother gives birth to a child, is it possible that she can doubt, even for a single moment, what is happening And when she comes to look back on that experience, could she ever think that it was only an auto-suggestion? And when she watches her child grow up beside her year after year, can she hesitate at any time and disbelieve in its existence? In the same way, the labour of spiritual rebirth comes as such a tremendous event in one's life that it cannot be forgotten; it changes everything for one.

Then, very quietly, very humbly, this strange tutor says: "Once, during the sacred trance, I saw Jesus." "You mystify me! " I exclaim. But he does not hasten to explain. Instead, he suddenly rolls the whites of his eyes upwards in a most alarming manner. There is another minute of intense silence, and only when he brings his eyes back to their normal appearance am I reassured. When he addresses me again a faintly enigmatical smile hovers once more around his lips. "Such is the greatness of this sacred trance that death cannot catch a man while he is in it. There are some Yogis on the Tibetan side of the Himalayas who have practised to perfection this path of Brahma Chinta.

"I was always a fatalist. What is written in the heavens is written. . . . My star grew dim; I felt the reins slip from my hands and yet I could do nothing." The man who held such paradoxical, contradictory beliefs could not have solved the mystery and one doubts whether anyone has ever completely solved it.

Our greeting over, I wait till he has settled down in his chair and then venture to compliment him on the artistic decorations of the room. A row of brilliant teeth gleams across his mouth as he smiles his reply: "God is not only love but beauty. As man begins to express the Spirit within him, he should express more beauty - not only in self but in surroundings and environments." His English is noticeably well spoken. The voice is quick and confident. There is a little period of silence and then he speaks again: "But there is another decoration, upon a room's walls and furnishings, which is invisible. Yet it is very important. Do you know that these things carry the influence of people's thoughts and feelings? Every room, every chair even, gives out the unseen influence of the person who has constantly used it.

Thoughts are real things on their own plane and they attach themselves, for shorter or longer periods, to whatever we consistently use." "That is an interesting theory." " it is more than a theory; it is a fact! Man possesses a subtler body than the physical, and in this subtle body there exist centres of activity which correspond to the physical organs of sense-activity. Through these centres he can discern invisible forces for, when they are energized, they bestow psychic and spiritual sight." A brief pause follows and then he asks my impressions of India's condition. I frankly criticize his country's neglect of modern ways of living, its slowness in picking up all those pleasant comforts, handy conveniences and mechanical inventions which improve man's brief sojourn in this world, its inattention to the demands of sensible hygiene and proper sanitation, and its excessive devotion to stupid social customs and cruel practices, which are supposedly based on religious practices. I tell him freely that priestly preoccupations seem to have kept India's energies in a cul-de-sac with deplorable results. I instance some of the irrational things which I have seen done in the name of religion, but which merely succeed in proving how men can neglect or misuse the gift of intelligence which their God has bestowed upon them. My outspoken observations draw a definite assent from the lips of Sahabji Maharaj. "You have hit on the very points which form part of my programme of reform," he remarks, gazing at me reminiscently. "On the whole, it seems that many Indians expect God to do for them what they are perfectly capable of doing for themselves." "Exactly. We Hindus talk glibly of religion in order to cover up a lot of things which have nothing to do with religion. The trouble is that for the first fifty years or so a religion is pure and vital. Later it degenerates into a mere philosophy; its followers become talkers - not religiously-living men. Finally it descends, for its last and longest phase, into the arms of hypocritical priests. In the end, hypocrisy becomes accepted as religion." I gasp at ,such straightforward admissions. "What is the use of wrangling about heaven and hell, about God and so forth? Humanity finds itself on the physical plane and it ought not to neglect the matters which pertain to this plane. Let us try to make our life here more beautiful and happier," he concludes. "That is why I have sought you out. Your disciples seem such fine men, straining to be as practical and up-to-date as any European, making no parade of religion but living good lives, and withal they keep to their Yoga practices with faithful regularity." Sahabji smiles in acknowledgment. "I am glad you have observed that," he replies quickly.

We believe in concentrating on the practical means of regeneration. Although I do not concern myself with Gandhi's political plans, I scout his economic ideas as being visionary and unpractical." "He wants India to throw all machinery into the sea." Sahabji shakes his head. "India cannot go back to the past; she must go forward and develop the best points of a material civilization, if she is to become more prosperous. My countrymen had better take a lesson from America and Japan. The hand spinner and the hand weaver can no longer stand the onslaught of modern rationalized methods."

Nowhere in India, nowhere in the entire world, may I expect to meet his like again. His voice breaks into my thoughts. "You have seen two aspects of our life here in Dayalbagh, but our activities are threefold. Man's own nature is threefold - spirit, mind and body. Therefore we have the workshops and farms for physical work, the colleges for mental growth, and lastly there are the group meetings for spiritual activities. Thus we aim at harmonious and all-round growth for each individual.

- Its theme of surrendering to a master piques my mind until I broach it eventually to Sahabji. We sit on a carpeted piece of ground in the centre of Dayalbagh - it is something like a village green - and develop a friendly discussion. He reiterates his point and adds: "The master is absolutely necessary. There is no such thing as self-reliance in the spiritual sphere." "But did you find one necessary?" I ask boldly. "Without a doubt. I spent fourteen years searching for a true master before I found him." "Fourteen years! A fifth of your life! Was it worth while?" "The time spent in search of a true master is never wasted, even if it is twenty years," he replies, quick as a flash. "Before I became a believer I was as skeptical as you are. And then I grew desperate in trying to discover a teacher who could open the way to spiritual illumination. I was young and simply crazy to find the truth. I asked the trees, the grass, and the sky to enlighten me if truth existed. I sobbed my heart out like a child, with head bent low, begging for light. Finally I could stand the strain no longer. One day I resolved to give up eating and starve to death, unless and until the divine power saw fit to grant me some illumination. I could no longer work even. The next night I had a vivid dream, wherein a master appeared to me and revealed himself as such. I asked for his address. His answer was: 'Allahabad! You will know my full address later.' The next day I spoke to a friend who belonged to that town and told him of my dream. He went away and returned with a group photograph and asked me if I could indentify the master's face in the group. I at once pointed to it. My friend then explained that he belonged to a semi-secret society in Allahabad and that the figure I indicated was the master. I quickly got into touch with him and became a disciple." "How interesting!" "Even if you take up Yoga exercises alone and depend on your own powers, the day your true prayer is heard will be the day when you will be led to meet a master. There is no escape. You must have a guide. A sincere, fully determined seeker will eventually be brought to his real master." "How is one to recognize him?" I murmur questioningly.

"From a material standpoint you understand it correctly, but rather it is that a current of sound was the first activity of the Supreme Being at the beginning of creation. The universe is not the result of blind forces. Now this divine sound is known to our fraternity and can be phonetically transcribed. It is our belief that sounds bear the impress of their source, of the power which created them. Therefore, when one of our members listens internally and expectantly for the divine sound, with controlled body, mind and will, he will become lifted up towards the bliss and wisdom of the Supreme Being as soon as he hears the divine sound." " I s it not possible to imagine that the sound of the blood beating through one's arteries is the divine sound? What other sound can one hear internally?" "Ah, we do not mean any material sound, but a spiritual one. The force which appears as sound on our material plane is only a reflection of that subtler force whose workings evolved the universe. Just as your scientists have reduced matter to electricity, so we may trace the force which we hear on the material plane as sound to a higher vibration that escapes our physical ears because it exists on the spiritual plane. A sound carries the influence of the region whence it emanates and so, if you concentrate your attention inwardly in a certain way, you may one day hear the mystic words which sounded forth at the first upheaval in the primeval chaos and which form the true name of the Creator. The echoes of those words reverberate back into man's spiritual nature; to catch those echoes, by means of our secret Yoga practice, and to trace them up to their origin is literally to be carried up to paradise. The man who faithfully carries out our Radha Soami practices which are intended to enable him to hear the mystic sound, will forget himself in utter ecstasy when at last it impinges itself upon his inner ear."

"Can you not give me some personal experience first, some convincing proof at first hand? What you say may be perfectly true - indeed, my heart wants to believe it." "You must join us first." " I am sorry. That I cannot do. I am built in such a way that it is difficult to give belief before proof." Sahabji spreads out his hands in a helpless gesture. "What can I do then? I am in the hands of the Supreme Father."  Day after day I attend all the group meetings as regularly as the members of the society themselves; I meditate silently in their midst and listen to their master's addresses; I question them freely and study such portions of the Radha Soami teachings concerning the universe and man as are made available to me. Late one afternoon I wander with a disciple about one mile or so away from Dayalbagh to where the jungle begins. Then we turn our feet towards the Jumna and eventually sit down on the banks of that wide river. From the steep and sandy height we watch the slow-moving water wind its placid way through the plain which stretches to Agra. Now and then a great vulture flaps its way over our heads towards its home. ([Location 3743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3743))

- The Jumna! Somewhere along these banks Krishna moved victoriously among the milkmaids, charming them with his wondrous lute and his love-making. To-day he is probably one of the most worshipped gods in the Hindu pantheon. "Up till recent years," murmurs my companion, "this place was the abode of wild animals and at night they roamed over the very site on which Dayalbagh has been built. And now they avoid the place." We sit silently for a couple of minutes and then he says: "You are the first European to sit in our group meetings, though you will certainly not be the last. We appreciate the understanding and sympathy you have shown. Why don't you join our society?" "Because I have no faith in faith. Because I realize that it is fatally easy to believe in what you want to believe." He draws his knees up and rests his chin upon them. "The contact that you are having with our master will benefit you in any case. I shall not press you to join. We do not attempt to make converts and our members are not allowed to preach." "How did you learn of the existence of the society?" "Very simply. My father has been a member for many years. He does not live at Dayalbagh, but visits it from time to time. He brought me with him on some of those visits, but never, on any occasion, did he attempt to induce me to join. About two years ago I began to puzzle over things and went about questioning various friends as to their beliefs. I questioned my father, too, and what he told me drew me to the Radha Soami teachings. I was accepted as a member of the fraternity and time has confirmed my faith. I was fortunate, perhaps, because others have come to us only after a lifetime spent in perplexity." "If I could settle my doubts as easily and as quickly as you settled yours. . . . ? " I respond vacantly. Once again we both revert to silence. The dark blue Jumna water draws my gaze and I slip insensibly into a profound reverie. All the conscious and unconscious thinking of these Indians is coloured by faith, by the necessity of owning allegiance to some sort of a religion, creed or sacred script. Every kind of faith from the most degraded to the most dignified is represented in India. Once I stumbled across a little temple on the Ganges. Its pillars were covered with carved reliefs depicting men and women engaged in sexual embrace, and its walls were frescoed with erotic scenes which might horrify a Western clergyman. There is room for this kind of thing in Indian religion, and it may well be that the religious recognition of sex is a better thing than its relegation to the gutter, ([Location 3752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3752))

- but then - there is also room for faiths embodying the loftiest and purest conceptions possible to man. Such is India! But nowhere in this land have I come across such an amazing cult as the Radha Soamis. It is undeniably unique. What brain other than Sahabji Maharaj's could have conceived this paradoxical combination of Yoga, the oldest learning in the world, with the high-pressure, mechanized civilization of an up-to-date European or American city? Is Dayalbagh likely to loom forth in Indian history out of all proportion to its present apparent unimportance? If India is a crossword puzzle to which no one seems to have yet found the correct solution, that is not to say that the coming years shall not provide an answer. Sahabji had laughed at Gandhi's preaching of medievalism, and the town of Ahmedabad, where Gandhi's own headquarters lie, still echoes back this laughter. From the Sabarmati River one can count half a hundred tall factory chimneys, which smoke defiance at the little cluster of white, wooden bungalows where the gospel of peasant handicrafts finds its inspiration. The forceful impact of Western ways has begun to disintegrate India's traditional methods of carrying on the necessary business of living. The first Europeans who appeared off the sea coast of India brought not only bales of goods, but also ideas. When Vasco da Gama landed his rough-bearded sailors in the quiet harbour of Calicut, there began that process of Westernization which is moving at such a quick rate to-day. The industrialization of India has begun in a tentative and timid fashion, but it has begun. Europe has faced in turn the Renaissance of intellect, the religious reformation and the industrial revolution, and she has left these things behind. India has awakened and finds them lying in her stride. These are now her problems. Will she blindly imitate the Europeans or will she work out her own - and perhaps better - way of solving them? Will Sahabji Maharaj's unique contribution focus her attention one day? If I am certain of anything I am certain of this: India will be thrown into a melting-pot of unparalleled character before long. Thousands of years of a society tied up in worn-out traditions, imprisoned in hide-bound religious conventions, will vanish within two or three decades at most. It will seem a miracle, but it will happen. Sahabji Maharaj has evidently… ([Location 3771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3771))

- Sahabji Maharaj has shrewdly foreseen the inevitable trend of things and has made a striking effort to save the ancient science of Yoga for modern use. This inspiring and strenuous man will certainly leave his mark upon his native land. He has realized that his country has lain in lethargy long enough. He sees clearly why the West, throbbing with manufacture and trade and its agriculture modernized, lives a wealthier life. He sees also that the culture of Yoga remains one of the valuable inheritances which India has received from her ancient sages, but that the few masters who keep this culture alive in lonely places are a fading remnant of their class; when they die, the real secrets of Yoga will die with them. And so he has come down from the rarefied air of those peaks of thought to our own times, to the energetic strivings of the twentieth century, and is endeavouring to relate the two. Is his effort too fantastic On the contrary, it is highly admirable.

- The English have done more than turn sandy deserts into fertile fields; than build canals and dams to assist agriculture and regulate the floods of great rivers; than fling an impenetrable barrier of highly efficient soldiers across the North-West Frontier to keep peace and property secure; than bring in a healthy breeze of sane, rational ideas. Out of the grey North and distant West came the white men. Fate placed India at their feet and the country became theirs with but a few efforts. Why? Perhaps the world, incubating over Asiatic wisdom and Western science, will one day hatch out a civilization that will shame antiquity, deride modernity and amaze posterity. The trail of my meditation comes to an end. I raise my head and address a questioning word to my companion. I do not think he hears me. He continues to stare across the river, which reflects the last red light of sunset. It is the twilight hour. I watch the great orb make its rapid disappearance from the sky. The stillness is indescribable; all nature, dumb at the lovely sight, seems to have come to momentary rest. My heart drinks in the superb peace. Once more I glance at the other man. His figure is now wrapped in the shroud of fastgathering dusk. So we sit in the dead silence for a few more minutes until the sun slips suddenly into black night. My companion rises and quietly leads me through the shadows back to Dayalbagh. Our walk terminates under a canopy of thousands of starry points of light. Sahabji Maharaj decides to leave Dayalbagh and go down to a place in the Central Provinces for a well-earned rest. I take the event as our destined time of farewell and plan a move in the same direction. We shall travel together as far as Timarni and then our ways will diverge. About one hour after midnight we descend on Agra Station. A score of close disciples accompany their master and so the size of our party is quite noticeable. Someone procures a chair for Sahabji, and while he sits in the midst of his devoted followers I pace the half-lit platform. During the day I have reviewed my stay at Dayalbagh and realize with regret that no memorable inner experience has occurred, no soul-upheaving vision of life's secret meaning has been vouchsafed to me. I had hoped that some illuminating Yogic expansion of consciousness might pierce my mental gloom for an hour or two, so that I could then follow up… ([Location 3807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3807))

- In India I find that there are men who want the exalted consciousness which Yoga promises its votaries, but are unwilling to pay the price in training and discipline which it demands. So they take drugs, such as opium and hasheesh, and thus obtain a colourable imitation of that transcendental consciousness. I have watched the behaviour of these drug addicts and discovered that one quality (or vice) is common to all of them. They exaggerate tremendously the small or great phenomena of their lives, and will tell you outright lies in the firm belief that they are telling you the truth! Hence the development of paranoia, which is an exaggeration of selfconsciousness to the point of complete delusion. The drug addict may notice a woman glance carelessly at him. At once he weaves a whole romance with her in his mind. His world revolves entirely around his own glorified self. He will make such fantastic assertions about his own wonderful powers that one wonders whether he is in full possession of his faculties. And his actions spring out of sudden, inexplicable impulses. Some of the unbalanced qualities which mark the characters and lives of such unfortunate persons, also mark the character and life of Meher Baba, but with this qualification - he never descends into the evil depths it is possible for them to fall into, because the origin of his abnormality is not drugs, but a spiritual and benign experience. To borrow a phrase from Nietzsche, the Parsee messiah is " human, all-too-human." ([Location 3965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3965))

- What of his ardent followers? Will Time come with cold hands and undeceive them? That is unlikely. The story of Meher Baba is a typical story of Indian credulity and provides a handy illustration of the strength of this defect in Indian character. India suffers from the defects of an illiterate and over-religious race, untrained in those scientific modes of thought which demand the divorce of emotion from reason, history from hearsay, and fact from imagination. It is easy enough to gather a flock of enthusiastic followers, whether from sincere aspirants,… ([Location 3981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=3981))

- I have neither the space nor the patience to point them out, but it is a fact that Meher Baba has committed blunders at every step of his career. So have I. But he claims to be a divinely inspired messiah, whereas I am only too painfully aware of my limitations as an ordinary mortal. My point is that his followers will never admit that Meher Baba can commit blunders. Always they naively assume that some mysterious esoteric purpose lies behind everything he says or does. They are content to follow blindly, as indeed they must, for reason soon rebels at what they have to swallow. My own experience with him only tended to confirm and deepen that cynicism which has taken the allegiance of so much of my life, and to strengthen that radical scepticism which hid the inner sensitivity that guided my wanderings around this subcontinent. All over the East there have been recurring hints of a coming event which is to prove the greatest thing history has given us for many hundred years. The prophecy of a Coming rears its head among the brown faces of India, the stocky people of Tibet, the almond-eyed masses of China, and the old greybeards of Africa. To the vivid and devout Oriental imagination, the hour is ripe and our restless time bears outward portent of the near approach of this event. What more natural than for Meher Baba to regard his sudden psychological change as an indication of his own messianic destiny? What more natural than his fondly cherished belief that one day he will announce himself to an awe stricken world? What more natural than for his own obedient flock to take it upon themselves to spread the news of their messiah's advent? Nevertheless one is compelled to condemn the theatrical methods which he has used. No great religious teacher worthy the name has ever used them, or is ever likely to break the spiritual etiquette of thousands of centuries. I have a shrewd suspicion as to what form the future vagaries of this spectacular " saint " will take.

I gaze at him for a while in bewilderment and then recall myself to his question. "He is a man who has won my heart," I reply. "But why do you ask?" He ignores my counter-question. There is an embarrassing silence. I try to keep up the conversation by saying: "I am looking forward to seeing him again when I revisit Calcutta. Does he know you? Shall I carry your greetings?

And then I tell him: " I a m interested in the lives and thoughts of Yogis. Will you not tell me how you came to be one and what wisdom you have gained?"

- "Grave problems vex my mind. In the hope of finding some light upon them I have come to your land. Perhaps in what you can tell me there may be guidance for my feet, or perhaps I shall know whether I have come on a fruitless errand." The Yogi turns his shining black eyes upon me. In the silence which ensues I am impressed once more by the grave dignity of this man. He seems so profound, so pontifically wise as he sits there with folded legs and interlocked feet, as to transcend his mean surroundings in this poor hut of a remote jungle village. I notice, for the first time, a lizard watching us from the upper part of a wall. Its bead-like eyes never leave us, and its grotesquely wide mouth is so fantastic that I almost believe it is grinning wickedly at me. At last Chandi Das finds his voice. "I am not adorned with the polished jewels of learning, but if you will listen to what I have to say, then your journey will not be fruitless. Go back to the same place where you started your Indian journey and, before a new moon will have risen, you shall have your desire satisfied." "Do you mean that I should return to Bombay?" "You speak rightly." I am puzzled. What can that hybrid half-Western city hold for me? "But I have never found anything there to help me on my quest," I protest. Chandi Das looks at me coolly. "There is your path. Follow it as quickly as your heels can carry you. Lose no time, but hasten back to Bombay to-morrow." "Is that all you can tell me? " "There is more, but I have not troubled to perceive it." He reverts to silence. His eyes become as expressionless as still water. A while later he speaks: "You will leave India and return to the Western lands before the next equinox. A grievous illness will fall upon your body almost as soon as you leave our soil. The spirit will struggle in the wracked body, but not yet is its hour of escape. And then the hidden work of destiny will come to light, for it will send you back to Aryavarta (India) so that in all you visit us thrice. A sage awaits you even now and for his sake, since you are tied to him by ancient threads, you will come back to dwell among us." His voice stops and a faint tremor passes across his eyelids.

But once, when I propound some fresh problem, he makes no answer. Instead, he gazes out towards the jungle-covered hills which stretch to the horizon and remains motionless. Many minutes pass, but still his eyes are fixed, his presence remote. I am quite unable to discern whether his attention is being given to some invisible psychic being in the distance or whether it is being turned on some inward preoccupation. At first I wonder whether he has heard me, but in the tense silence which ensues, and which I feel unable or unwilling to break, a force greater than my rationalistic mind commences to awe me until it ends by overwhelming me. The realization forces itself through my wonderment that all my questions are moves in an endless game, the play of thoughts which possess no limit to their extent; that somewhere within me there is a well of certitude which can provide me with all the waters of truth I require; and that it will be better to cease my questioning and attempt to realize the tremendous potencies of my own spiritual nature. So I remain silent and wait. ([Location 4275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=4275))

- For almost half an hour the Maharishee's eyes continue to stare straight in front of him in a fixed, unmoving gaze. He appears to have forgotten me, but I am perfectly aware that the sublime realization which has suddenly fallen upon me is nothing else than a spreading ripple of telepathic radiation from this mysterious and imperturbable man. On another visit he finds me in a pessimistic mood. He tells me of the glorious goal which waits for the man who takes to the way he has shown. "But, Maharishee, this path is full of difficulties and I am so conscious of my own weaknesses," I plead. "That is the surest way to handicap oneself," he answers unmoved, "this burdening of one's mind with the fear of failure and the thought of one's failings." "Yet if it is true?" I persist. "It is not true. The greatest error of a man is to think that he is weak by nature, evil by nature. Every man is divine and strong in his real nature. What are weak and evil are his habits, his desires and thoughts, but not himself." His words come as an invigorating tonic. They refresh and inspire me. From another man's lips, from some lesser and feebler soul, I would refuse to accept them at such worth and would persist in refuting them. But an inward monitor assures me that the sage speaks out of the depths of a great and authentic spiritual experience, and not as some theorizing philosopher mounted on the thin stilts of speculation.

- Another time, when we are discussing the West, I make the retort: "It is easy for you to attain and keep spiritual serenity in this jungle retreat, where there is nothing to disturb or distract you." "When the goal is reached, when you know the Knower, there is no difference between living in a house in London and living in the solitude of a jungle," comes the calm rejoinder. And once I criticize the Indians for their neglect of material development. To my surprise the Maharishee frankly admits the accusation. "It is true. We are a backward race. But we are a people with few wants. Our society needs improving, but we are contented with much fewer things than your people. So to be backward is not to mean that we are less happy."  How has the Maharishee arrived… ([Location 4295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X2CB25Y&location=4295))
