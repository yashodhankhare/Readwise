## Highlights
- The point we want to emphasize here is that this book is about the art of reading for the sake of increased understanding. Fortunately, if you learn to do that, reading for information will usually take care of itself. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=283))

- There are four levels of reading. They are here called ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=369))
- levels rather than kinds because kinds, strictly speaking, are distinct from one another, whereas it is characteristic of levels that higher ones include lower ones. So it is with the levels of reading, which are cumulative. The first level is not lost in the second, the second in the third, the third in the fourth. In fact, the fourth and highest level of reading includes all the others. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=370))
- The first level of reading we will call Elementary Reading. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=373))
- The second level of reading we will call Inspectional Reading. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=390))
- It is characterized by its special emphasis on time. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=390))
- Still another name for this level might be skimming or pre-reading. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=394))
- The third level of reading we will call Analytical Reading. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=405))
- If inspectional reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given a limited time, then analytical reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given unlimited time. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=408))
- Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=413))
- Analytical reading is preeminently for the sake of understanding. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=414))
- Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=736))
