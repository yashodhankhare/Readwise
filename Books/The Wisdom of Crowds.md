## Highlights
- Galton was a man obsessed with two things: the measurement of physical and mental qualities, and breeding. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=41))

- What Francis Galton stumbled on that day in Plymouth was the simple, but powerful, truth that is at the heart of this book: under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them. Groups do not need to be dominated by exceptionally intelligent people in order to be smart. Even if most of the people within a group are not especially well-informed or rational, it can still reach a collectively wise decision. This is a good thing, since human beings are not perfectly designed decision makers. Instead, we are what the economist Herbert Simon called “boundedly rational.” We generally have less information than we’d like. We have limited foresight into the future. Most of us lack the ability—and the desire—to make sophisticated cost-benefit calculations. Instead of insisting on finding the best possible decision, we will often accept one that seems good enough. And we often let emotion affect our judgment. Yet despite all these limitations, when our imperfect judgments are aggregated in the right way, our collective intelligence is often excellent.

- One of the striking things about the wisdom of crowds is that even though its effects are all around us, it’s easy to miss, and, even when it’s seen, it can be hard to accept. Most of us, whether as voters or investors or consumers or managers, believe that valuable knowledge is concentrated in a very few hands (or, rather, in a very few heads). We assume that the key to solving problems or making good decisions is finding that one right person who will have the answer. Even when we see a large crowd of people, many of them not especially well-informed, do something amazing like, say, predict the outcomes of horse races, we are more likely to attribute that success to a few smart people in the crowd than to the crowd itself. As sociologists Jack B. Soll and Richard Larrick put it, we feel the need to “chase the expert.” The argument of this book is that chasing the expert is a mistake, and a costly one at that. We should stop hunting and ask the crowd (which, of course, includes the geniuses as well as everyone else) instead. Chances are, it knows.

- Charles Mackay would have scoffed at the idea that a crowd of people could know anything at all. Mackay was the Scottish journalist who, in 1841, published Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, an endlessly entertaining chronicle of mass manias and collective follies, to which the title of my book pays homage. For Mackay, crowds were never wise. They were never even reasonable. Collective judgments were doomed to be extreme. “Men, it has been well said, think in herds,” he wrote. “It will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” Mackay’s take on collective madness is not an unusual one. In the popular imagination, groups tend to make people either dumb or crazy, or both. The speculator Bernard Baruch, for instance, famously said: “Anyone taken as an individual is tolerably sensible and reasonable—as a member of a crowd, he at once becomes a blockhead.” Henry David Thoreau lamented: “The mass never comes up to the standard of its best member, but on the contrary degrades itself to a level with the lowest.” Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, “Madness is the exception in individuals but the rule in groups,” while the English historian Thomas Carlyle put it succinctly: “I do not believe in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.” ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=97))

- In that sense, Gustave Le Bon had things exactly backward. If you put together a big enough and diverse enough group of people and ask them to “make decisions affecting matters of general interest,” that group’s decisions will, over time, be “intellectually [superior] to the isolated individual,” no matter how smart or well-informed he is.

- In this book, I concentrate on three kinds of problems. The first are what I’ll call cognition problems. These are problems that have or will have definitive solutions. For example, “Who will win the Super Bowl this year?” and “How many copies ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=130))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The second kind of problem is what’s usually called a coordination problem. Coordination problems require members of a group (market, subway riders, college students looking for a party) to figure out how to coordinate their behavior with each other, knowing that everyone else is trying to do the same. How do buyers and sellers find each other and trade at a fair price? ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=135))

- A word about structure. The first half of this book is, you might say, theory, although leavened by practical examples. There’s a chapter for each of the three problems (cognition, coordination, and cooperation), and there are chapters covering the conditions that are necessary for the crowd to be wise: diversity, independence, and a particular kind of decentralization. The first half begins with the wisdom of crowds, and then explores the three conditions that make it possible, before moving on to deal with coordination and cooperation.

- Finally, Mackay was right about the extremes of collective behavior: there are times—think of a riot, or a stock-market bubble—when aggregating individual decisions produces a collective decision that is utterly irrational. The stories of these kinds of mistakes are negative proofs of this book’s argument, underscoring the importance to good decision making of diversity and independence by demonstrating what happens when they’re missing.

- Diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=161))

- Paradoxically, the best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=165))

- The market was smart that day because it satisfied the four conditions that characterize wise crowds: diversity of opinion (each person should have some private information, even if it’s just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts), independence (people’s opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them), decentralization (people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge), and aggregation (some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision). If a group satisfies those conditions, its judgment is likely to be accurate. Why? At heart, the answer rests on a mathematical truism. If you ask a large enough group of diverse, independent people to make a prediction or estimate a probability, and then average those estimates, the errors each of them makes in coming up with an answer will cancel themselves out. Each person’s guess, you might say, has two components: information and error. Subtract the error, and you’re left with the information.

- After all, think about what happens if you ask a hundred people to run a 100-meter race, and then average their times. The average time will not be better than the time of the fastest runners. It will be worse. It will be a mediocre time. But ask a hundred people to answer a question or solve a problem, and the average answer will often be at least as good as the answer of the smartest member. With most things, the average is mediocrity. With decision making, it’s often excellence. You could say it’s as if we’ve been programmed to be collectively smart.

- Google keeps the details of its technology to itself, but the core of the Google system is the PageRank algorithm, which was first defined by the company’s founders, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, in a now-legendary 1998 paper called “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine.” PageRank is an algorithm—a calculating method—that attempts to let all the Web pages on the Internet decide which pages are most relevant to a particular search. Here’s how Google puts it: PageRank capitalizes on the uniquely democratic characteristic of the web by using its vast link structure as an organizational tool. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. Google assesses a page’s importance by the votes it receives. But Google looks at more than sheer volume of votes, or links; it also analyzes the page that casts ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=394))

- We’ll look more closely at people’s discomfort with the idea of the wisdom of crowds, but the problem is simple enough: just because collective intelligence is real doesn’t mean that it will be put to good use.

- The victory of the gasoline-powered engine was not a foregone conclusion. Thomas Edison, for instance, had designed a battery-powered vehicle, and in 1899 one sage had offered the prediction that “the whole of the United States will be sprinkled with electric changing stations.” At one point, a third of all the cars on U.S. roads were electric-powered. Similarly, steam-powered ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=519))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- powered engines were seen by many as the most logical way to propel a vehicle, since steam obviously worked so well in propelling trains and boats. In the early part of the decade, there were more than a hundred makers of steam-powered cars, and the most successful of these, the Stanley Steamer, became legendary for its speed—in 1905, it went 127 miles per hour—and the comfort of its ride. As the decade wore on, though, the contenders began to fade. Electric-powered cars couldn’t go far enough without a recharge. Steam-powered cars took a long time to heat up. More important, though, the makers of gasoline-powered cars were the first to invest heavily in mass-production techniques and to figure out a way to reach the mass market.

- What’s important, though, is the way the colony gets to that collectively intelligent solution. It does not get there by first rationally considering all the alternatives and then determining an ideal foraging pattern. It can’t do this, because it doesn’t have any idea what the possible alternatives—that is, where the different flower patches—are. So instead, it sends out scouts in many different directions and trusts that at least one of them will find the best patch, return, and do a good dance so that the hive will know where the food source is. This is, it’s important to see, different from the kind of problem solving that we looked at earlier. In the case of the ox-weighing experiment, or the location of the Scorpion, or the betting markets, or the IEM, the group’s job was to decide among already defined choices or to solve a well-defined problem. In those cases, different members of the group could bring different pieces of information to bear on a problem, but the set of possible solutions was already, in a sense, determined. (Bush or Gore would become president; the Yankees or the Marlins would win the World Series.) In the case of problems like finding the most nectar-rich flower patches, though, the task is more complicated. It becomes a twofold process. First, uncover the possible alternatives. Then decide among them. In the first stage of this process, the list of possible solutions is so long that the smart thing to do is to send out as many scout bees as possible.

- The point of Page’s experiment is that diversity is, on its own, valuable, so that the simple fact of making a group diverse makes it better at problem solving. That doesn’t mean that intelligence is irrelevant—none of the agents in the experiment were ignorant, and all the successful groups had some high-performing agents in them. But it does mean that, on the group level, intelligence alone is not enough, because intelligence alone cannot guarantee you different perspectives on a problem. In fact, Page speculates, grouping only smart people together doesn’t work that well because the smart people (whatever that means) tend to resemble each other in what they can do.

- Experts, in some cases, were a little better at forecasting than laypeople (although a number of studies have concluded that nonpsychologists, for instance, are actually better at predicting people’s behavior than psychologists are), but above a low level, Armstrong concluded, “expertise and accuracy are unrelated.” ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=648))

- In other words, it wasn’t just that they were wrong; they also didn’t have any idea how wrong they were. And that seems to be the rule among experts. The only forecasters whose judgments are routinely well calibrated are expert bridge players and weathermen. It rains on 30 percent of the days when weathermen have predicted a 30 percent chance of rain. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=661))

- Again, this doesn’t mean that well-informed, sophisticated analysts are of no use in making good decisions. (And it certainly doesn’t mean that you want crowds of amateurs trying to collectively perform surgery or fly planes.) It does mean that however well-informed and sophisticated an expert is, his advice and predictions should be pooled with those of others to get the most out of him. (The larger the group, the more reliable its judgment will be.) And it means that attempting to “chase the expert,” looking for the one man who will have the answers to an organization’s problem, is a waste of time. We know that the group’s decision will consistently be better than most of the people in the group, and that it will be better decision after decision, while the performance of human experts will vary dramatically depending on the problem they’re asked to solve. So it is unlikely that one person, over time, will do better than the group. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=669))

- One obvious cost of homogeneity is also that it fosters the palpable pressures toward conformity that groups often bring to bear on their members. This seems similar to the problem of groupthink, but it’s actually distinct. When the pressure to conform is at work, a person changes his opinion not because he actually believes something different but because it’s easier to change his opinion than to challenge the group. The classic and still definitive illustration of the power of conformity is Solomon Asch’s experiment in which he asked groups of people to judge which of three lines was the same size as a line on a white card. Asch assembled groups of seven to nine people, one of them the subject and the rest (unbeknownst to the subject) confederates of the experimenter. He then put the subject at the end of the row of people, and asked each person to give his choice out loud. There were twelve cards in the experiment, and with the first two cards, everyone in the group identified the same lines. Beginning with the third card, though, Asch had his confederates begin to pick lines that were clearly not the same size as the line on the white card. The subject, in other words, sat there as everyone else in the room announced that the truth was something that he could plainly see was not true. Not surprisingly, this occasioned some bewilderment. The unwitting subjects changed the position of their heads to look at the lines from a different angle. They stood up to scrutinize the lines more closely. And they joked nervously about whether they were seeing things. Most important, a significant number of the subjects simply went along with the group, saying that lines that were clearly shorter or longer than the line on the card were actually the same size. Most subjects said what they really thought most of the time, but 70 percent of the subjects changed their real opinion at least once, and a third of the subjects went along with the group at least half the time. When Asch talked to the subjects afterward, most of them stressed their desire to go along with the crowd. It wasn’t that they really believed the lines were the same size. They were only willing to say they were in order not to stand out. Asch went on, though, to show something just as important: while people are willing to conform even against their own better judgment, it does not take much to get them to stop. In one variant on his experiment, for instance, Asch planted a confederate who, instead of going along with the group, picked the lines that matched the line on the card, effectively giving the unwitting subject an ally. And that was enough to make a huge difference. Having even one other person in the group who felt as they did made the subjects happy to announce their thoughts, and the rate of conformity plummeted.

- Independence is important to intelligent decision making for two reasons. First, it keeps the mistakes that people make from becoming correlated. Errors in individual judgment won’t wreck the group’s collective judgment as long as those errors aren’t systematically pointing in the same direction. One of the quickest ways to make people’s judgments systematically biased is to make them dependent on each other for information. Second, independent individuals are more likely to have new information rather than the same old data everyone is already familiar with. The smartest groups, then, are made up of people with diverse perspectives who are able to stay independent of each other. Independence doesn’t imply rationality or impartiality, though. You can be biased and irrational, but as long you’re independent, you won’t make the group any dumber. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=766))

- But what I want to argue here is that the more influence a group’s members exert on each other, and the more personal contact they have with each other, the less likely it is that the group’s decisions will be wise ones. The more influence we exert on each other, the more likely it is that we will believe the same things and make the same mistakes. That means it’s possible that we could become individually smarter but collectively dumber. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=784))

- One classic study of herding, by David S. Scharfstein and Jeremy C. Stein, looked at the tendency of mutual-fund managers to follow the same strategies and herd into the same stocks. This is thoroughly perplexing. Money managers have jobs, after all, only because they’ve convinced investors that they can outperform the market. Most of them can’t. And surely herding only makes a difficult task even harder, since it means the managers are mimicking the behavior of their competitors. What Scharfstein and Stein recognized, though, was that mutual-fund managers actually have to do two things: they have to invest wisely, and they have to convince people that they’re investing wisely, too. The problem is that it’s hard for mutual-fund investors to know if their money manager is, in fact, investing their money wisely. After all, if you knew what investing wisely was, you’d do it yourself. Obviously you can look at performance, but we know that short-term performance is an imperfect indicator of skill at best. In any one quarter, a manager’s performance may be significantly better or worse depending on factors that have absolutely nothing to do with his stock-picking or asset-allocation skills. So investors need more evidence that a mutual-fund manager’s decisions are reasonable. The answer? Look at how a manager’s style compares to that of his peers. If he’s following the same strategy—investing in the same kinds of stocks, allocating money to the same kinds of assets—then at least ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=885))

- investors know he’s not irrational. The problem, of course, is that this means that, all other things being equal, someone who bucks the crowd—by, say, following a contrarian strategy—is likely to be considered crazy. This would not matter if investors had unlimited patience, because the difference between good and bad strategies would eventually show up in the numbers. But investors do not have unlimited patience, and even the smartest money manager will fail a significant percentage of the time. It’s much safer for a manager to follow the strategy that seems rational rather than the strategy that is rational. As a result, managers anxious to protect their jobs come to mimic each other. In doing so, they destroy whatever information advantage they might have had, since the mimicking managers are not really trading on their own information but are relying on the information of others. That shrinks not only the range of possible investments but also the overall intelligence of the market, since imitating managers aren’t bringing any new information to the table.

The only thing that made the early adopters of a product more influential was the fact that they were early, and so their actions were the ones that everyone who came after them observed. In Gladwell’s world, some people are far more influential than others, and cascades (he writes of them as epidemics) move via social ties, rather than being a simple matter of anonymous strangers observing each other’s behavior. People are still looking for information, but they believe that the ones who have it are the mavens, connectors, and salesmen (each of whom has a different kind of information).

- Similarly, in a fascinating study of how farmers in India decided whether or not to adopt new high-yielding-variety crop strains during the Green Revolution of the late 1960s, Kaivan Munshi shows that rice farmers and wheat farmers made their decisions about new crops in very different ways. In the wheat-growing regions Munshi looked at, land conditions were relatively uniform, and the performance of a crop did not vary much from farm to farm. So if you were a wheat farmer and you saw that the new seeds substantially improved your neighbor’s crop, then you could be confident that it would improve your crop as well. As a result, wheat farmers paid a great deal of attention to their neighbors, and made decisions based on their performance. In rice-growing regions, on the other hand, land conditions varied considerably, and there were substantial differences in how crops did from farm to farm. So if you were a rice farmer, the fact that your neighbor was doing well (or poorly) with the new crop didn’t tell you much about what would happen on your land. As a result, rice farmers’ decisions were not that influenced by their neighbors. Instead, rice farmers experimented far more with the new crop on their own land before deciding to adopt it. What’s telling, too, is that even the wheat farmers did not use the new strains of wheat until after they could see how the early adopters’ new crops did. For farmers, choosing the right variety of corn or wheat is the most important decision they can make, so it’s perhaps not surprising that they would make those decisions on their own, rather than simply mimicking those who came before them. And that suggests that certain products or problems are more susceptible to cascades than others. For instance, fashion and style are obviously driven by cascades, which we call fads, because when it comes to fashion, what you like and what everyone else likes are clearly wrapped up with each other. I like to dress a certain way, but it’s hard to imagine that the way I like to dress is disconnected from the kind of impression I want to make, which in turn must have something to do with what other people like. The same might also be said, though less definitively, about cultural products (like TV shows) where part of why we watch the show is to talk about it with our friends, or even restaurants, ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1073))

- since no one likes to eat in an empty restaurant. No one buys an iPod because other people have them—the way they might, in fact, go to a movie because other people are going—but many technology companies insist that information cascades (of the good kind, they would say) are crucial to their success, as early adopters spread the word of a new product’s quality to those who come after. The banal but key point I’m trying to make is that the more important the decision, the less likely a cascade is to take hold. And that’s obviously a good thing, since it means that the more important the decision, the more likely it is that the group’s collective verdict will be right.

- In 1991, Finnish hacker Linus Torvalds created his own version of the Unix operating system, dubbing it Linux. He then released the source code he had written to the public, so everyone out there—well, everyone who understood computer code—could see what he had done. More important, he attached a note that read, “If your efforts are freely distributable, I’d like to hear from you, so I can add them to the system.” It was a propitious decision. As one history of Linux points out: “Of the first ten people to download Linux, five sent back bug fixes, code improvements, and new features.” Over time, this improvement process became institutionalized, as thousands of programmers, working for free, contributed thousands of minor and major fixes to the operating system, making Linux ever-more reliable and robust. Unlike Windows, which is owned by Microsoft and worked on only by Microsoft employees, Linux is owned by no one. When a problem arises with the way Linux works, it only gets fixed if someone, on his own, offers a good solution. There are no bosses ordering people around, no organizational charts dictating people’s responsibilities. Instead, people work on what they’re ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1222))

- interested in and ignore the rest. This seems like—in fact, it is—a rather haphazard way to solve problems. But so far, at least, it has been remarkably effective, making Linux the single most important challenger to Microsoft. Linux is clearly a decentralized system, since it has no formal organization and its contributors come from all over the world. What decentralization offers Linux is diversity. In the traditional corporate model, top management hires the best employees it can, pays them to work full-time, generally gives them some direction about what problems to work on, and hopes for the best. That is not a bad model. It has the great virtue of making it easy to mobilize people to work on a particular problem, and it also allows companies to get very good at doing the things they know how to do. But it also necessarily limits the number of possible solutions that a corporation can come up with, both because of mathematical reality (a company has only so many workers, and they have only so much time) and because of the reality of organizational and bureaucratic politics. Linux, practically speaking, doesn’t worry much about either. Surprisingly, there seems to be a huge supply of programmers willing to contribute their efforts to make the system better. That guarantees that the field of possible solutions will be immense. There’s enough variety among programmers, and there are enough programmers, that no matter what the bug is, someone is going to come up with a ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1231))

- fix for it. And there’s enough diversity that someone will recognize bugs when they appear. In the words of open-source guru Eric Raymond, “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” In the way it operates, in fact, Linux is not all that different from a market, as we saw in Chapter 2 on diversity. Like a bee colony, it sends out lots of foragers and assumes that one of them will find the best route to the flower fields. This is, without a doubt, less efficient than simply trying to define the best route to the field or even picking the smartest forager and letting him go. After all, if hundreds or thousands of programmers are spending their time trying to come up with a solution that only a few of them are going to find, that’s many hours wasted that could be spent doing something else. And yet, just as the free market’s ability to generate lots of alternatives and then winnow them down is central to its continued growth, Linux’s seeming wastefulness is a kind of strength (a kind of strength that for-profit companies cannot, fortunately or unfortunately, rely on). You can let a thousand flowers bloom and then pick the one that smells the sweetest. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1241))

- No one has ever paid more attention to the streets and sidewalks of New York City than William H. Whyte. In 1969, Whyte—the author of the sociological classic The Organization Man—got a grant to run what came to be known as the Street Life Project, and spent much of the next sixteen years simply watching what New Yorkers did as they moved through the city. Using time-lapse cameras and notebooks, Whyte and his group of young research assistants compiled a remarkable archive of material that helped explain how people used parks, how they walked on busy sidewalks, and how they handled heavy traffic. Whyte’s work, which was eventually published in his book City, was full of fascinating ideas about architecture, urban design, and the importance to a city of keeping street life vibrant. It was also a paean to the urban pedestrian. “The pedestrian is a social being,” Whyte wrote. “He is also a transportation unit, and a marvelously complex and efficient one.” Pedestrians, Whyte showed, were able, even on crowded sidewalks, to move surprisingly fast without colliding with their neighbors. In fact, they were often at their best when the crowds were at their biggest. “The good pedestrian,” Whyte wrote, “usually walks slightly to one side, so that he is looking over the shoulder of the person ahead. In this position he has the maximum choice and the person ahead is in a sense running interference for him.” ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1391))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What Whyte saw—and made us see—was the beauty of a well-coordinated crowd, in which lots of small, subtle adjustments in pace and stride and direction add up to a relatively smooth and efficient flow. Pedestrians are constantly anticipating each other’s behavior. No one tells them where or when or how to walk. Instead, they all decide for themselves what they’ll do based on their best guess of what everyone else will do. And somehow it usually works out well. There is a kind of collective genius at play here. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1406))

- One obvious way of coordinating people’s actions is via authority or coercion. An army goose-stepping in a parade is, after all, very well-coordinated. So, too, are the movements of workers on an old-fashioned assembly line. But in a liberal society, authority (which includes laws or formal rules) has only limited reach over the dealings of private citizens, and that seems to be how most Americans like it. As a result many coordination problems require bottom-up, not top-down, solutions.

And those answers also often involve institutions, norms, and history, factors that both shape a crowd’s behavior and are also shaped by it.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The problem with the bar is that when it’s crowded, no one has a good time. You’re planning on going to the bar Friday night. But you don’t want to go if it’s going to be too crowded. What do you do? To answer the question, you need to assume, if only for the sake of argument, that everyone feels the way you do. In other words, the bar is fun when it’s not crowded, but miserable when it is. As a result, if everyone thinks the bar will be crowded on Friday night, then few people will go. The bar, therefore, will be empty, and anyone who goes will have a good time. On the other hand, if everyone thinks the bar won’t be crowded, everyone will go. Then the bar will be packed, and no one will have a good time. (This problem was captured perfectly, of course, by Yogi Berra, when he said of Toots Shor’s nightclub: “No one goes there anymore. It’s too crowded.”) The trick, of course, is striking the right balance, so that every week enough—but not too many—people go. There is, of course, an easy solution to this problem: just invent an all-powerful central planner—a kind of über-doorman—who tells people when they can go to the bar. Every week the central planner would issue his dictate, banning some, allowing others in, thereby ensuring that the bar was full but never crowded. Although this solution makes sense in theory, it would be intolerable in practice. Even if central planning of this sort were possible, it would represent too great an interference with freedom of choice. We want people to be able to go to a bar if they want, even if it means that they’ll have a bad time. Any solution worth talking about has to respect people’s right to choose their own course of action, which means that it has to emerge out of the collective mix of all the potential bargoers’ individual choices. In the early 1990s, the economist Brian Arthur tried to figure out whether there really was a satisfying solution to this problem. He called the problem the “El Farol problem,” after a local bar in Santa Fe that sometimes got too crowded on nights when it featured Irish music. Arthur set up the problem this way: If El Farol is less than 60 percent full on any night, everyone there will have fun. If it’s more than 60 percent full, no one will have fun. Therefore, people will go only if they think the bar will be less than 60 percent full; otherwise, they stay home.

The fluctuations in attendance meant that on some Friday nights El Farol was too crowded for anyone to have fun, while on other Fridays people stayed home who, had they gone to the bar, would have had a good time. What was remarkable about the experiment, though, was this: during those one hundred weeks, the bar was—on average—exactly 60 percent full, which is precisely what the group as a whole wanted it to be. (When the bar is 60 percent full, the maximum number of people possible are having a good time, and no one is having a bad… ([Location 1459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1459))

- In 1958, the social scientist Thomas C. Schelling ran an experiment with a group of law students from New Haven, Connecticut. He asked the students to imagine this scenario: You have to meet someone in New York City. You don’t know where you’re supposed to meet, and there’s no way to talk to the other person ahead of time. Where would you go? This seems like an impossible question to answer well. New York is a very big city, with lots of places to meet. And yet a majority of the students chose the very same meeting place: the information booth at Grand Central Station. Then Schelling complicated the problem a bit. You know the date you’re supposed to meet the other person, he said. But you don’t know what time you’re supposed to meet. When will you show up at the information booth? Here the results were even more striking. Just about all the students said they would show up at the stroke of noon. In other words, if you dropped two law students at either end of the biggest city in the world and told them to find each other, there was a very good chance that they’d end up having lunch together. Schelling replicated this outcome in a series of experiments in which an individual’s success depended on how well he coordinated his response with those of others. For instance, Schelling paired people up and asked them to name either “heads” or “tails,” with the goal being to match what their partners said. Thirty-six of forty-two people named “heads.” He set up a box of sixteen squares, and asked people to check one box (you got paid if everyone in the group checked the same box). Sixty percent checked the top left box. Even when the choices were seemingly infinite, people did a pretty good job of coordinating themselves. For instance, when asked the question: “Name a positive number,” 40 percent of the students chose “one.” How were the students able to do this? Schelling suggested that in many situations, there were salient landmarks or “focal points” upon which people’s expectations would converge. (Today these are known as “Schelling points.”) Schelling points are important for a couple of reasons. First, they show that people can find their way to collectively beneficial results not only without centralized direction but also without even talking to each other. As Schelling wrote, “People can often concert their intentions and expectations with others if each knows that the other is trying to do the same.” This is a good thing because conversation isn’t always possible, and with large groups of people in particular it can be difficult or inefficient. (Howard Rheingold’s book Smart Mobs, though, makes a convincing case that new mobile technologies—from cell phones to mobile computing—make it much easier for large collections of people to communicate with each other and so coordinate their activities.) Second, the existence of Schelling points suggests that people’s experiences of the world are often surprisingly similar, which makes successful… ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=1491))

- Coordination happens almost without anyone thinking about it. And the convention allows people to concentrate on other, presumably more important things.

- At its core, after all, what is the free market? It’s a mechanism designed to solve a coordination problem, arguably the most important coordination problem: getting resources to the right places at the right cost. If the market is working well, products and services go from the people who can produce them most cheaply to the people who want them most fervently. What’s mysterious is that this is supposed to happen without any one person seeing the whole picture of what the market is doing, and without anyone knowing in advance what a good answer will look like. (Even the presence of big corporations in the market doesn’t change the fact that everyone in a market has only a partial picture of what’s going on.) So can this work? Can people with only partial knowledge and limited calculating abilities actually get resources to the right place at the right price, just by buying and selling?

- Smith was doing this experiment for a simple reason.

- In August of 1997, a group of researchers from California’s PATH program took over a seven-and-a-half-mile stretch of I-15 near San Diego to try to answer that question. The researchers brought with them eight Buick LeSabres, which they had automated by equipping them with a couple of hundred thousand dollars of equipment, including steering and gas-pedal controls, motion sensors, radar, and a radio communication system that could transmit information about the car’s speed and acceleration fifty times a second. The point of the automation was twofold: first, to allow the cars to drive themselves, and second, to allow a platoon of vehicles to travel together down the road, synchronizing their speeds via radio communication. And it worked. The LeSabres went off in a convoy, separated from each other by a mere twenty-one feet. The cars’ movements were perfectly synchronized, because the delay caused by driver reaction was absent. As soon as one car changed speed, all the others immediately adjusted. Over the course of four days, the cars traveled at sixty-five miles an hour for hundreds of miles, carrying real passengers, with nary an accident. It was an ideal vision of a perfectly organized highway. How would it work in the real world? Essentially, you’d create dedicated highways, by burying magnetic markers four feet apart along the road. (The cars use the markers to read the road and ensure that they’re in the right lane.) Once you ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2399))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- were on the highway, your car would be lined up in a platoon with others, and you’d travel down the road together until your exit. (Presumably each platoon could be pegged to a particular off-ramp.) Equipping the highways wouldn’t be cheap. It would cost at least $10,000 a mile, and you’d have to pay to equip cars, too. But a smoothly running automatic highway could double or even triple capacity, while also eliminating traffic jams. That would mean that fewer new highways would be built, and that people would spend less time in gridlock. So it’s possible that automatic highways would actually save us money. Although the plan makes a kind of intuitive sense—if drivers are the problem, then take the steering wheel out of their hands—it’s hard to imagine it being implemented anytime soon. Part of that is simply because drivers are uncomfortable giving up control, and even more uncomfortable handing their lives over to a computer. Of course, planes are now flown on autopilot all the time, but few of us have ever flown planes. Just about all of us have driven. And part of what makes the plan dead on arrival is that it seems like a top-down solution at a time when people are much more fond of bottom-up answers. Are we really ready to let the government orchestrate our movement down the highway? Maybe it’s better to take our chances with traffic jams.

- Newton pointed to something like this when he spoke of “standing on the shoulders of giants.” But Newton, who did most of his theoretical work alone and who was obsessed with being sui generis, was suggesting only that his insights depended on the work of those who had come before him. He was making the point that scientific knowledge is, in some sense, cumulative. (Of course, Newton used the phrase in a letter to his rival Robert Hooke, who happened to be a dwarf, so it’s possible that the phrase was intended only as a cruel joke.) But that knowledge is more than cumulative. It’s collective. Scientists depend not just on the work of their predecessors, but also on the work of their contemporaries, who are in turn dependent on them. Even scientists whose hypotheses fail are helping their peers, by letting them know where they do not need to go. Although the effect of the work of individual scientists is to accumulate scientific knowledge for the community as a whole, that’s not really the point of scientific endeavor. Scientists want to solve particular problems. And they want to be recognized, to earn the attention of their contemporaries, to transform the way other scientists think. The coin of the realm, for most scientists, is not cash but rather recognition. Even so, scientists are undoubtedly as self-seeking and as self-interested as the rest of us. The genius of the way science is organized, though, makes their self-interested behavior redound to the benefit of all of us. In the process of winning notoriety for themselves, they make the group—that is, the scientific community and then, indirectly, the rest of us—smarter.

- Pursuing their own self-interest is more complicated for scientists than it might sound.

- Of course, experiments can be, and are, replicated. And scientific fraud is revealed. So the point is not that all truths are relative. Instead, the fact that what scientists know depends on the communications of others has two important consequences. First, good science requires a degree of trust among scientists that even as they compete, they will also cooperate by playing fair with their data. Second, and more important, science depends not only on an ever-replenishing pool of common knowledge, but also on an implicit faith in the collective wisdom of the scientific community to distinguish between those hypotheses that are trustworthy and those that are not.

- UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS SOMETHING of a flaw in this idealized picture of the way the scientific community discovers truth. And the flaw is that most scientific work never gets noticed. Study after study has shown that most scientific papers are read by almost no one, while a small number of papers are read by many people. Famous scientists find their work cited vastly more often than scientists who are less well known. When famous scientists collaborate with others they’re given a disproportionate share of the credit for the work. And when two scientists—or two teams of scientists—independently make the same discovery, it’s the famous scientists who end up getting the credit for that, as well. Merton dubbed this “the Matthew effect,” after the Gospel lines “From unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

- What we’ll see is that this has two consequences. On the one hand, it means small groups can make very bad decisions, because influence is more direct and immediate and small-group judgments tend to be more volatile and extreme. On the other hand, it also means that small groups have the opportunity to be more than just the sum of their parts. A successful face-to-face group is more than just collectively intelligent. It makes everyone work harder, think smarter, and reach better conclusions than they would have on their own. In his 1985 book about Olympic rowing, The Amateurs, David Halberstam writes: “When most oarsmen talked about their perfect moments in a boat, they referred not so much to winning a race ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2715))

- but to the feel of the boat, all eight oars in the water together, the synchronization almost perfect. In moments like that, the boat seemed to lift right out of the water. Oarsmen called that the moment of swing.” When a boat has swing, its motion seems almost effortless. Although there are eight oarsmen in the boat, it’s as if there’s only one person—with perfect timing and perfect strength—rowing. So you might say that a small group which works well has intellectual swing. Swing, though, is hard to come by. In fact, few organizations have figured out how to make groups work consistently well. For all the lip service paid, particularly in corporate America, to the importance of teams and the need to make meetings more productive, it’s still unusual for a small group to be more than just the sum of its parts. Much of the time, far from adding value to their members, groups seem to subtract it. Too often, it’s easy to agree with Ralph Cordiner, the former chairman of General Electric, who once said, “If you can name for me one great discovery or decision that was made by a committee, I will find you the one man in that committee who had the lonely insight—while he was shaving or on his way to work, or maybe while the rest of the committee was chattering away—the lonely insight that solved the problem and was the basis for the decision.” On this account, groups are nothing but obstacles, cluttering the way of people whose time would be better spent alone.

- What was missing most from the MMT, of course, was diversity, by which I mean not sociological diversity but rather cognitive diversity. James Oberg, a former Mission Control operator and now NBC News correspondent, has made the counterintuitive point that the NASA teams that presided over the Apollo missions were actually more diverse than the MMT. This seems hard to believe, since every engineer at Mission Control in the late 1960s had the same crew cut and wore the same short-sleeved white shirt. But as Oberg points out, most of those men had worked outside of NASA in many different industries before coming to the agency. NASA employees today are far more likely to have come to the agency directly out of graduate school, which means they are also far less likely to have divergent opinions.

- small groups, diversity of opinion is the single best guarantee that the group will reap benefits from face-to-face discussion. Berkeley political scientist Chandra Nemeth has shown in a host of studies of mock juries that the presence of a minority viewpoint, all by itself, makes a group’s decisions more nuanced and its decision-making process more rigorous. This is true even when the minority viewpoint turns out to be ill conceived. The confrontation with a dissenting view, logically enough, forces the majority to interrogate its own positions more seriously. This doesn’t mean that the ideal jury will follow the plot of Twelve Angry Men, where a single holdout convinces eleven men who are ready to convict that they’re all wrong. But it does mean that having even a single different opinion can make a group wiser. One suspects that, had there been a single devil’s advocate pushing the idea that the foam strike might have seriously damaged the wing, the MMT’s conclusion would have been very different. Without the devil’s advocate, though, it’s likely that the group’s meetings actually made its judgment about the possible problem worse. That’s because of a phenomenon called “group polarization.” Usually, when we think of deliberation, we imagine that it’s a kind of recipe for rationality and moderation, and assume that the more people talk about an issue, the less likely they will be to adopt extreme positions. But evidence from juries and three decades of experimental studies suggests that much of the time, the opposite is true.

- Group polarization is still a phenomenon that is not well understood, and there are clearly cases where it has little or no effect. But since the 1960s, sociologists have documented how, under certain circumstances, deliberation does not moderate but rather radicalizes people’s point of view. The first studies of the phenomenon tried to elicit people’s attitudes toward risk, by asking them what they would do in specific situations. For instance, they were asked, “If a man with a severe heart illness is told that he must either change his way of life completely or have an operation that will either cure him or kill him, what should he do?” Or, “If an electrical engineer who has a safe job at a small salary is given the chance to take a new job that pays much better but is also less secure, should he move?” Individuals answered these questions privately at first, then gathered into groups to reach collective decisions. At first, researchers thought that group discussions made people more likely to advocate risky positions, and they termed this the “risky shift.” But as time went on, it became clear that the shift could be in either direction. If a group was made up of people who were generally risk… ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2838))

More recently, University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein has devoted a great deal of attention to polarization, and in his book Why Societies Need Dissent, he shows both that the phenomenon is more ubiquitous than was once thought and that it can have major consequences. As a general rule, discussions tend to move both the group as a whole and the individuals within it toward more extreme positions than the ones they entered the discussion with. Why does polarization occur? One reason is because of people’s reliance on “social comparison.” This means more than that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else (which, of course, they are). It means that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else with an eye toward maintaining their relative position within the group. In other words, if you start out in the middle of the group and you believe the group has moved, as it were, to the right, you’re inclined to shift your position to the right as well, so that relative to everyone else you’re standing still. Of course, by moving to the right you’re moving the group to the right, making… ([Location 2848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2848))

- right answer is. As we saw in our discussion of social proof—remember the passersby who ended up staring into an empty sky—people who are uncertain about what they believe will look to other members of the group for help. That’s the point of deliberating, after all. But if a majority of the group already supports one position, then most of the arguments that will be made will be in support of that position. So the uncertain people are likely to be swayed in that direction, in part simply because that’s more of what they’ll hear. Similarly, people who have more extreme positions are more likely to have strong, coherent arguments in favor of their positions and are also more likely to voice them. This matters because all the evidence suggests that the order in which people speak has a profound effect on the course of a discussion. Earlier comments are more influential, and they tend to provide a framework within which the discussion occurs. As in an information cascade, once that framework is in place, it’s difficult for a dissenter to break it down. This wouldn’t be a problem if the people who spoke earliest were also more likely to know what they were talking about. But the truth is… ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2860))

- far more than women do, even though no one has ever suggested that men as a gender have better insight into questions of guilt and innocence. In groups where the members know each other, status tends to shape speaking patterns, with higher-status people talking more and more often than lower-status people. Again, this wouldn’t matter as much if the authority of higher-status people was derived from their greater knowledge. But oftentimes it doesn’t. Even when higher-status people don’t really know what they’re talking about, they’re more likely to speak. A series of experiments with military fliers who were asked to solve a logic problem, for instance, found that pilots were far more likely to speak convincingly in defense of their solution than navigators were, even when the pilots were wrong and the navigators were right. The navigators deferred to the pilots—even when they had never met the pilots before—because they assumed that their rank meant they were more likely to be right. That kind of deference is important, because in small groups ideas often do not succeed simply on their own merits. Even when its virtues may seem self-evident, an idea needs a champion in order to be adopted by the group as… ([Location 2870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2870))

- having a strong advocate for an idea, no matter how good it is, is essential. And when advocates are chosen, as it were, on the basis of status or talkativeness, rather than perceptiveness or keenness of insight, then the group’s chance of making a smart decision shrinks. Talkativeness may seem like a curious thing to worry about, but in fact talkativeness has a major impact on the kinds of decisions small groups reach. If you talk a lot in a group, people will tend to think of you as influential almost by default. Talkative people are not necessarily well liked by other members of the group, but they are listened to. And talkativeness feeds on itself. Studies of group dynamics almost always show that the more someone talks, the more he is talked to by others in the group. So people at the center of the group tend to become more important over the course of a discussion. This might be okay if people only spoke when they had expertise in a particular matter. And in many cases, if someone’s talking a lot, it’s a good sign that they have something valuable to add. But the truth is that there is no clear correlation between talkativeness and expertise. In fact, as the military-flier studies suggest, people who imagine… ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=2881))

- Compounding this problem is the fact that managerial pay is often based not on how one performs but rather on how one performs relative to expectations. Many bonus systems, for instance, offer executives disproportionate rewards only when they surpass a given target. Companies do this in order to push executives and encourage them to meet goals that seem unattainable. But the real effect of these kinds of targets is to encourage people to be deceptive.

- no one is. It’s natural for us to look at successful people and assume that their success is due to some innate quality they have, rather than to think that it might be the result of circumstance or chance. This is sometimes a reasonable assumption to make. But in the case of corporate performance, it’s dangerous. As business professor Sydney Finkelstein, author of a fascinating study of corporate failure, wrote: “CEOs should come with the same disclaimer as mutual funds: Past success is no guarantee of future success.” There are a couple of reasons for this. First, as the economist Armen Alchian pointed out in 1950, in an economy like ours, in which there are an enormous number of people and companies striving to get ahead, success is not necessarily an indicator of skill or foresight, but may be, as he says, “the result of fortuitous circumstances.” Or, to put it more bluntly, success may be the result of luck.

- The point isn’t that the task of predicting how a company will do for the next decade and a half is impossible. But it’s damn hard. So when we evaluate how good a job the stock market is doing—how “efficient” it is—we need to remind ourselves what the job entails before deciding what would count as a good answer. The economist Fischer Black once said that he thought the market would count as efficient if companies’ stock prices were between 50 percent and 200 percent of their true value. (So if a company’s true value was $10 billion, Black would say the market was efficient if it never valued the company at less than $5 billion or more than $20 billion.) At first glance, that seems ridiculous. How many jobs are there in which you can miss the mark by 100 percent and still be considered accurate? But what if you’re trying to predict twenty years of an uncertain future? Is being off by 100 percent really inaccurate? The important question about the accuracy of the market’s forecast is, of ([Location 3574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3574))

- course, “Inaccurate compared to what?” Missing the mark by 100 percent—and the truth is that, in general, stock prices are probably not off by that much—is not good, but it’s certainly better than missing it by 300 percent. The idea of the wisdom of crowds is not that a group will always give you the right answer but that on average it will consistently come up with a better answer than any individual could provide. That’s why the fact that only a tiny fraction of investors consistently do better than the market remains the most powerful piece of evidence that the market is efficient. That’s especially true when you consider that most investors are trying to evaluate only a small number of stocks, while the market has to come up with prices for more than five thousand of ([Location 3581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3581))

- them. The fact that the market is, even under those conditions, smarter than almost all investors is telling. Even so, financial markets are decidedly imperfect at tapping into the collective wisdom, especially relative to other methods of doing so. The economist Robert Shiller, for instance, has shown convincingly that stock prices jump around a lot more than is justified by changes in the true values of companies. That’s very different from the NFL betting market or the IEM or even racetrack betting, where the swings in opinion are significantly milder and the crowd only rarely pulls a U-turn. Part of the reason for this is, again, that predicting twenty years of a company’s future is infinitely harder, and far more uncertain, than predicting who’s going to win on Sunday or even who’ll be elected in November. But there’s something else, too. With football games, elections, Millionaire questions, and Google searches, there is a definitive answer, which at some point is settled once and for all. If you bet on a horse race, when the race is over, you know whether you won or lost. There’s no way to pretend that your prediction will be accurate tomorrow.

- The virtue of having this kind of definite outcome is that it keeps the crowd tethered to reality. One problem markets have, as we’ll see, is that they’re fertile ground for speculation. Speculators aren’t trying to figure out whether Pfizer’s future corporate performance will justify its current stock price. They don’t buy stocks because they think their prices are inaccurate. They buy them because they think they’ll be able to sell them to someone else for more. All markets have speculators. But it’s harder to speculate if everyone knows that, within a couple of weeks, the market will be over, and people will be rewarded or not depending on the accuracy of their forecasts. The problem with the stock market is that there never is a point at which you can say that it’s over, never a point at which you will definitively be proved right or wrong. This is one reason why a company’s stock price can easily soar far past any reasonable valuation, because people can always convince themselves that something in the future will happen to make the company worth it. And it’s the same reason why you can make money in the stock market even when you’re wrong: even if the market does eventually get the… ([Location 3597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3597))

- Bubbles are really characteristic of what we think of as financial markets. Why? Well, think about what you’re buying when you buy a share of stock. What you’re buying, literally, is a fraction of that company’s future earnings. (If I own one share of a company, and that company earns $2 a share, I pocket $2.) But you’re also buying something else. You’re buying the right to resell that share of stock to someone else—ideally someone who has a more optimistic view of the company’s future than you do, and will therefore pay you more for the stock than you originally spent. It’s true, of course, that any time you buy any physical product you’re also buying the right to resell it. But in the real economy, when you buy a product—even a car—you’re generally not too ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3731))

- worried about reselling it. The value of a personal computer, for instance, depends not on what you’ll be able to sell it for somewhere down the road, but rather on the use you’ll get out of it while you own it. In part, that’s because physical products, with very few exceptions, lose value over time. If you do resell them, it’s for less than you paid initially. In financial markets, though, things often become more valuable over time. Prices rise. (The same is true of the antiques market or the art market.) That makes the ability to resell my share of stock or my piece of real estate very important. And—this is the key part—it makes the market’s opinion of the value of my share of stock important, too. In theory, if I’m buying a share of stock, what should I care about? I should care about how much that company is going to earn in the future. If the company’s going to earn $60 a share (in discounted free cash flow) over the next twenty years, I should be willing to pay $60 for a share. In practice, though, I’m likely to be worried about not just what the company’s going to earn. I’m also worried about what everyone else thinks the company’s going to earn, because that will determine whether or not I’ll be able to sell my stock for more than I bought it. To see how different this is from the everyday economy, imagine yourself walking into your local grocery to buy an apple. As you do so, you probably have in your head some idea of what a fair price for an apple would be. That doesn’t mean if it costs 90 cents and ([Location 3737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3737))

- you think 75 cents would be reasonable, you’ll storm out in disgust. But it does mean that you know when you’re being ripped off and when you’re getting a bargain—because you have some sense (even if it’s not explicit) of how much that apple is worth to you, which is to say how much value you’ll get from it. What’s interesting about that fair price in your head is that you came up with it without worrying too much about what other people think about apples. To be sure, you know what the grocer thinks apples should cost—the price he’s charging. And you have a history, presumably, of shopping for apples, which you rely on to figure out what’s a reasonable price. But essentially your decision boils down to a pretty simple calculus: How much do you like apples, and how good is this particular apple you’re considering buying? Your decision to buy the apple or not is, relatively speaking, independent. At any moment, in fact, would-be apple buyers are figuring out, on their own, how much apples are worth to them, while on the other side apple producers are calculating how much it costs to grow and ship apples. And the price of apples at any moment therefore reflects all the… ([Location 3748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKC3I&location=3748))

- worth. The economist John Maynard Keynes famously described this process as the beauty contest model: “Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view.” That passage is a bit dense. But what’s most important about it is the last line. What Keynes recognized is that what makes the stock market especially strange is that often investors are concerned not just with what the average investor thinks but with what the average investor thinks the average investor thinks. And the truth is: Why stop there? Maybe what you need to think about is what the average person thinks the average person thinks the average person’s view should be.

- The problem of putting too much weight on a single piece of information is compounded when everyone in the market is getting that information. Consider an experiment that the financial analyst Jack Treynor did. First Treynor had the students in his finance class guess the number of jelly beans in a jar. Not surprisingly, the average guess was within 3 percent of the number of beans in the jar (there were 850 beans in the jar, and the mean guess was 871), and only one person in the class did better than the group as a whole. Up to this point, Treynor was demonstrating what Francis Galton’s experiment with the ox had also shown. Then Treynor had the students guess at the number of jelly beans again. This time, though, they were cautioned to think about the fact that there was air space at the top of the jar and that the jar was made of plastic, not glass, meaning that it could hold more beans than might have been expected. The group’s average guess was off by 15 percent, and was considerably worse than the guesses of a number of the people in the class. The point is that the information skewed the perspectives of the students in a shared way. What the students were told was true. But because it was a truth that seemed to point in one direction—there were probably more beans in the jar than they believed—it destroyed their collective wisdom. And the way the information was disclosed mattered. In a sense, instead of saying here are some jelly beans in a plastic jar, Treynor went out of his way to explain why he thought the plastic was important. In doing so, he subtracted information from the students. The more they were told, the less they actually knew about how many beans were in the jar.

- The point is not that self-interest is irrelevant to voters. To state only the obvious, even if someone is trying to choose the candidate that he thinks will be best for the country as a whole, self-interest obviously is going to have an influence on the factors he thinks make a candidate strong or weak. The goal of attaining a perspectiveless, completely disinterested view of politics is obviously a futile one. But that doesn’t mean that self-interest determines voters’ decisions. The simple fact that someone has bothered to vote shows that he is not being guided purely by self-interest. Lamentations about low voter turnout may be de rigueur in American political circles. But from an economist’s point of view, the perplexing thing is that anyone bothers to vote. After all, your vote has effectively zero chance of changing the outcome of an election, and for most people, the impact any one politician—even the president—will have on their everyday lives is relatively small. If your vote doesn’t matter and the choice of the winner doesn’t make much of a difference either, why vote? Public-choice theorists have done their best to explain away people’s propensity to vote. William Riker, for instance, argued that by voting, people were “affirming a partisan preference” and “affirming [their] efficacy in the political system,” rather than trying to affect the outcome of an election. But the more parsimonious explanation seems more likely to be true. People vote because they think they should—Riker’s own data on elections from the 1950s suggested that people’s “sense of duty” was the single best predictor of whether they voted or not—and because they want to have a say, however minuscule, in how their government is run. And in any case, if voters’ votes are “expressive,” as some would have it—expressing their views publicly instead of actually trying to affect the course of an election—it seems possible that this would produce better results for society than having people vote their self-interest.
