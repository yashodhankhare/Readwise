## Highlights
- Traction is the best way to improve your chances of startup success. Traction is a sign that something is working. If you charge for your product, it means customers are buying. If your product is free, it’s a growing user base. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=79))

- In other words, traction trumps everything ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=82))

- A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=134))

- Traction is growth. The pursuit of traction is what defines a startup. After interviewing more than forty successful founders and researching countless more, we discovered that startups get traction through nineteen different channels. Many ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=137))

- successful startups experimented with multiple channels until they found one that worked. We call these customer acquisition channels traction channels. These are marketing and distribution channels through which your startup can get traction: real customer growth. We uncovered two broad themes through our research. First, most founders consider using only traction channels with which they’re already ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=139))

- familiar, or those they think they should be using because of their type of product or company. This means that far too many startups focus on the same channels and ignore other promising ways to get traction. In fact, often the most underutilized channels in an industry are the most promising ones. Second, it’s hard to predict the traction channel that will work best. You can make educated guesses, but until you start running tests, it’s difficult to tell ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=142))

- THE 50 PERCENT RULE If you’re starting a company, chances are you can build a product. Almost every failed startup has a product. What failed startups don’t have is enough customers.

- this common problem: The number one reason that we pass on entrepreneurs we’d otherwise like to back is they’re focusing on product to the exclusion of everything else. Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don’t have a good distribution strategy. Even worse is when they insist that they don’t need one, or call [their] no distribution ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=241))

- MOVING THE NEEDLE Before you can set about getting traction, you have to define what traction means for your company. You need to set a traction goal. At the earliest stages, this traction goal is usually to get enough traction to either raise funding or become profitable. In any case, you should figure out what this goal means in terms of hard numbers. How many customers do you need and at what growth rate? Your traction strategy should always be focused on moving the needle for your traction goal. By moving the needle, we mean focusing on marketing activities that ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=301))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- result in a measurable, significant impact on your traction goal. It should be something that advances your user acquisition goal in a meaningful way, not something that would be just a blip even if it worked. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=306))
- From the perspective of getting traction, you can think about working on a product or service in three phases: Phase I—making something people want Phase II—marketing something people want Phase III—scaling your business ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=309))
- In each phase you will find yourself generally focused on different things because moving the needle means different things as you grow. In phase I, it’s getting those first customers that prove your product can get traction. In phase II, it is getting enough customers that you’re knocking on the door of sustainability. And in phase III, your focus is on increasing your earnings, scaling your marketing channels, and creating a truly sustainable ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=322))
- business. Phase I is very product focused and involves pursuing initial traction while also building your initial product. This often means getting traction in ways that don’t scale—giving talks, writing guest posts, emailing people you have relationships with, attending conferences, and doing whatever you can to get in front of customers. As Paul Graham said in his essay “Do Things That Don’t Scale”: A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don’t. You build something, make it available, ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=325))
- available, and if you’ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don’t, in which case the market must not exist. Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off…. The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can’t wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them. Startup growth happens in spurts. Initially, growth is usually slow. Then it spikes as a useful traction channel strategy is ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=330))
- unlocked. Eventually it flattens out again as this strategy gets saturated and becomes less effective. Then you unlock another strategy and you get another spike. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=335))
- The definition of traction keeps changing as the environment gets competitive. That’s why it is ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=351))
- actually useful to look at AngelList and look at companies who just got funded; that will give you an idea of where the bar is right now. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=351))
- TO PIVOT OR NOT TO PIVOT You may come to a point where you are simply unhappy with your traction. You may not be able to raise funding or you may just feel like things aren’t taking off the way they should. How do you know when to “pivot” from what you’re doing? ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=364))
- We strongly believe that many startups give up way too early. A lot of startup success hinges on choosing a great market at the right time. Consider DuckDuckGo, the search engine startup that Gabriel founded. Other search startups gave up after two years: Gabriel has been at it for more than seven. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=366))
- It’s important to wrap your head around this timescale. If you are just starting out, are you ready to potentially do this for the next decade? In retrospect, a lot of founders feel they picked their company idea too quickly, and they would have picked something they were more passionate about if they had realized it was such a long… ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=370))
- If you are considering a pivot, the first thing to look for is evidence of real product engagement, even if it is only a few dedicated customers. If you have such engagement, you might be giving up too soon. You should examine these bright spots to see how they might be expanded. Why do these customers take to your product so well? Is there some thread that unites them? Are they early adopters in a huge… ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=374))
- evident in your core metrics. Another factor to consider before you pivot: startup founders are usually forward thinking and as a result are often too early to market, which is another reason why it’s important to choose a startup idea you’re willing to stick with for many years. Granted, there is a big difference between being a few years too early and a decade too early. Hardly anyone can stick… ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=377))
- use this time to improve and refine your product. Then, when the market takes off, you have a head start on competitors just entering your space. How can you tell whether you are just a bit early to market and should keep plugging away? Again, the best way to find out is by looking for evidence of product engagement. If you are a little early to a… ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=381))
- Put half your efforts into getting traction. Pursue traction and product development in parallel, and spend equal time on both. Think of your product as a leaky bucket. Your early traction efforts are pointing you toward the holes worth plugging. Set your growth goals. Focus on strategies and tactics that can plausibly move the needle for your company. Get some hard numbers. Learn what growth numbers potential investors respect. How much traction… ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=385))
- Potential investors who understand your business are likely to appreciate your traction and thus invest earlier. Traction trumps everything. Find your bright spots. If you’re not seeing the traction you want, look for bright spots in your customer base, pockets of customers who are truly engaged with your product. See if you can figure out why it works for them and… ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=389))
- With nineteen traction channels to consider, figuring out which one to focus on is tough. That’s why we’ve created a simple framework called Bullseye that will help you… ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=395))
- billionaire PayPal founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel put it: [You] probably won’t have a bunch of equally good distribution strategies. Engineers frequently fall victim to this because they do not understand distribution. Since they don’t know what works, and haven’t thought about it, they try some sales, BD, advertising, and viral marketing—everything but the kitchen sink. That is a really bad idea. It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses… ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=397))
- can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. So it’s worth thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel. We use the name Bullseye for our three-step framework because you’re aiming for the Bullseye—the one… ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=402))
- THE OUTER RING: WHAT’S POSSIBLE The first step in Bullseye is ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=406))
- brainstorming every single traction channel. If you were to advertise offline, where would be the best place to do it? If you were to give a speech, who would be the ideal audience? Imagine what success would look like in each channel, and write it down in your outer ring. Everyone starts off with biases. The outer ring is meant to help you systematically counteract your traction channel biases. It is important that you not dismiss any traction channel in this step. You ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=407))
- should be able to think of at least one idea for every channel. In practice, a lot of founders mess up this step by not brainstorming long and deep enough to get useful ideas for each channel. For each channel, you should identify one decent channel strategy that has a chance of moving the needle. For example, social ads is a traction channel. Specifically running ads on reddit,… ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=410))
- channel strategy you can think of in each of the nineteen traction channels. In terms of research to feed your brainstorm, this book is a good start, but you should get much more specific to your company. You should know what marketing strategies have worked in your industry, as well as the history of companies in your space. It’s especially important to… ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=414))
- their marketing dollars. THE MIDDLE RING: WHAT’S PROBABLE The second step in Bullseye is running cheap traction tests in the channels that seem most promising. Go around your outer ring and promote your best traction channel ideas to your middle ring. It is often the case that there are a few truly exciting and promising channel ideas in your outer ring. Stop… ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=417))
- the third channel. We want you to have more than one channel in your middle ring because we don’t want you to waste valuable time testing channels sequentially when you can do so equally well in parallel. You can run multiple experiments at the same time because tests take some time to run after they’ve been set up. Yet doing too many things in parallel leads to errors from… ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=421))
- middle ring, now construct a cheap traction test you can run to determine if the idea really is good or not. These tests should be designed to roughly answer the following three questions: How much will it cost to acquire customers through this channel? How many customers are available through this channel? Are the customers that you are getting through this channel the kind of customers that you want right… ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=425))
- Some founders mess up this step by prematurely scaling their marketing efforts. Keep in mind that, when testing, you are not trying to get a lot of traction with a channel just yet.… ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=431))
- channel that could move the needle for your startup. Your main consideration at this point is speed—to get data and to prove your assumptions. You want to design smaller-scale tests that don’t require much up-front cost or effort. For example, run four Facebook ads versus forty. You should be able to get a rough idea of a channel’s effectiveness with at most a thousand… ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=433))
- The third and final step in Bullseye is to focus solely on the channel that will move the needle for your startup: your core channel. If all went well, one of the traction channels you tested in your middle ring produced promising results. In that case, you should start directing all your traction efforts and resources toward this most promising channel. You hit the… ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=437))
- dominates in terms of customer acquisition. That is why we suggest focusing on one at a time, but only after you’ve identified a channel that seems like it could actually work. The goal of this focusing step is quite simple: to wring every bit of traction out of your core channel. To do so, you will be continually experimenting to find out exactly how to optimize growth in this… ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=441))
- you can to scale them until they are no longer effective due to saturation or rising costs. The way this step gets most often messed up by founders is by keeping around distracting marketing efforts in other traction channels. For example, suppose you ran tests in three traction channels: search engine marketing, trade shows, and publicity. Search engine marketing was the most promising, and so you decide to focus on it and make it your core channel. However, your trade show and publicity tests were also successful, albeit much less so. There is a natural tendency to do more trade shows and publicity because you know they will somewhat work. This is a mistake. Search engine marketing was significantly better, and so you should spend all your efforts on… ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=444))
- because oftentimes focusing on your core channel involves channel strategies that utilize other traction channels. One channel is still dominant, but others feed into it. For example, you will see that a focus on search engine optimization (SEO) requires getting links to your site, and a good tactic for getting links is getting publicity (another traction channel). Similarly, viral marketing is often… ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=451))
- these situations one channel is dominant in that it is your core traction strategy. You’re using these other channels to support that strategy, as opposed to pursuing multiple traction strategies at once. If, unfortunately, no channel seems promising after testing, the whole process should be repeated. The good news is you now have data from all the tests you just did, which will inform you as to what… ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=455))
- dig deeper to see at what point each channel failed to deliver customers. If you go through the process several times and no traction channel seems promising, then your product may require more tweaking. Your bucket is still too leaky. WHY USE BULLSEYE? Bullseye is designed to be a straightforward way to direct your traction focus and… ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=458))
- more seriously than you would otherwise. These steps systematically uncover strategies for getting traction that you wouldn’t have found using other approaches. When we looked at companies really taking off, they were usually employing underutilized channels and channel strategies. If everyone in your industry uses social ads to grow, you might be better off using… ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=462))
- what everyone is using. Let Bullseye help you break out of your comfort zone and try channels that are unfamiliar because they may be the key to your growth. Bullseye is also meant to help you zoom in on the best ideas as quickly and cheaply as possible, while still casting a wide net. The traction channel that will ultimately succeed is unpredictable, and time is of the… ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=465))
- The biggest mistake startups make when trying to get traction is failing to pursue traction in parallel with product development. Many entrepreneurs think that if you build a killer product, your customers will beat a path to your door. This line of thinking is a fallacy: that the best use of your time is always improving your product. In other words, “if you build it, they will come” is wrong. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=486))
- You are much more likely to develop a good distribution strategy with a good traction development methodology (like Bullseye) the same way you are much more likely to develop a good product with a good product development methodology (like Lean). Both help address major risks that face early-stage companies: market risk (that you can reach customers in a sustainable way) and product risk (that customers want what you’re building). Pursuing both traction and ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=489))
- product in parallel will increase your chances of success by both developing a product for which you can actually get traction and getting traction with that product much sooner. TARGETS Work through Bullseye. Maximize your chances of getting traction: brainstorm, prioritize, test, and then focus. Do not overlook underutilized channels. In fact, ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=492))
- those channels are more likely to be the ones that will work best. Talk to founders a few steps ahead of you. Research how past and present companies in your space and adjacent spaces succeeded or failed at getting traction. The easiest way to do this is to go talk to startup founders who previously failed at what you’re trying to do. Hold on to your other channel ideas. Compile your brainstorming ideas for each traction channel in a spreadsheet with educated guesses that you can confirm through testing.

- With limited resources, it’s almost impossible to optimize multiple channel strategies at once. Running ten social ads and testing everything about them (ad copy, landing pages, etc.) is a full-time endeavor. That is optimization, not testing.

- Andrew Chen, a startup adviser on growth, coined the Law of Shitty Click-Throughs: “Over time, all marketing strategies result in shitty click-through rates.” (“Click-through rate” refers to the response rate of a marketing campaign.) What this means is that over time, all marketing channels become saturated. As more companies discover an effective strategy, it becomes crowded and ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=544))

- expensive or ignored by consumers, thus becoming much less effective. When banner ads first debuted, they were receiving click-through rates of over 75 percent! Once they became commonplace, click-through rates plummeted. This happens with all channel strategies. Tactics that once worked well will become crowded and ineffective. All it takes is one other competitor seriously pursuing traction in the same way to drive up its cost and drive down its efficacy.

- It is likely that your first channel strategy ideas are commonplace and have already succumbed somewhat to the Law of Shitty Click-Throughs. To combat this reality you should consistently brainstorm new channel strategies and conduct small experiments. Constantly running small traction tests will allow you to stay ahead of competitors pursuing the same channels.

- Another place to look for underutilized channel strategies is in using other traction channels to feed into your core traction channel. As we discussed previously, you do not want to focus separately on multiple traction channels. However, you can utilize other channels as part of your core channel strategy. For example, suppose your core channel is content marketing, centered around your ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=563))

You might also buy social ads to amplify your best posts on Twitter and Facebook (in the social and display ads channel). In both these cases, you are not solely focusing on these secondary channels to get growth; you are using them to feed into your content marketing strategy.

- DEFINING YOUR CRITICAL PATH ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=630))
- The path to reaching your traction goal with the fewest number of steps is your Critical Path. You should literally enumerate the intermediate steps (milestones) to get to your traction goal. These milestones need not be traction related, but they should be absolutely necessary to reach your goal. In DuckDuckGo’s case, the traction goal was to get to 100 million searches a month. The team believed the milestones they needed to hit included a faster site, ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=631))
- a more compelling mobile offering, and more broadcast TV coverage (from the publicity traction channel). Even though product features like images and auto-suggest were continually requested, they believed they were not absolutely necessary milestones in their Critical Path to reach that traction goal. However, now that they are on the traction goal to get to 1 percent of the search market, these product features are believed to be necessary milestones on this new ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=634))
- Critical Path. The reasoning for why these particular features weren’t necessary initially was that even at 100 million searches a month, DuckDuckGo’s user base was motivated enough by other features to be forgiving of missing these particular ones. However, to get to the next traction goal the company had to get more mainstream adoption, and this next set of users is much less forgiving. In your company, your milestones will be different, but the point is to ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=638))
- be critical and strategic in deciding what to include. That’s why it is called the Critical Path. For example, you may think that to reach your traction goal you will need to hire three people, add features A, B, and C to your product, and engage in marketing activities X, Y, and Z. These are the milestones you need to do to get where you want to go. Do you really need feature C or marketing activity Y? This is where founders often mess up: by focusing their limited company resources on things off Critical Path. You are ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=641))
- generally competing with companies with significantly more resources than you. You cannot afford to waste what little resources you have. Another issue is that your original enumeration of necessary milestones is often wrong. For example, you thought you had to build features A, B, and C to get to your traction goal, but after building A and getting market feedback on it, you realize you actually need to skip B altogether and just build C. That’s why a hard reassessment ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=645))

In other words, Critical Path is a framework to help you decide what not to do. Everything you decide to do should be assessed against your Critical Path. Every activity is either on path or not. If it is not on the path, don’t do it! ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=648))

- them. There are three reasons why founders ignore potentially profitable traction channels: Out of sight, out of mind. Startups generally don’t think of things like speaking engagements because they are usually out of their field of vision. Some founders refuse to seriously consider channels they view negatively, like sales or affiliate marketing. Just because you hate talking on the phone doesn’t mean your customers do. Bias against schlep—things that ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=667))

- offline ads, makes this point well: I’ll bet you a lot of your competition will refuse to even try these channels. And if that’s true, that’s even more reason to go try those channels! It can almost be a competitive advantage (at least a temporary one) if you can acquire customers in channels that others cannot, or refuse to try. That’s more interesting than duking it out with AdWords competitors in positions one to three. Traction is a tricky thing. Initial traction is unpredictable and can happen in many different ways—nineteen by our count. Because of ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ZE96ZWY&location=675))
- this unpredictability, it makes sense to consider several channels in the pursuit of traction. In fact, every one of the channels listed above has been the channel for both enterprise and consumer startups to get initial traction. At the same time, no one individual is an expert on all channels. However, certain people—namely startup founders who focus on them—end up becoming experts on particular channels.
