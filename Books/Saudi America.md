## Highlights
- This remarkable transformation in the U.S. was brought about by American entrepreneurs who figured out how to literally force open rocks often more than a mile below the surface of the earth, to produce gas, and then oil. Those rocks—called shale, or source rock, or tight rock, and once thought to be impermeable—were opened by combining two technologies: horizontal drilling, in which the drill bit can travel well over two miles horizontally, and hydraulic fracturing, in which fluid is pumped into the earth at a high enough pressure to crack open hydrocarbon bearing rocks, while a so-called proppant, usually sand, holds the rocks open a sliver of an inch so the hydrocarbons can flow. A fracking entrepreneur likens the process to creating hallways in an office building that has none—and then calling a fire drill.

- The oil business goes through unsettling boom and bust cycles, and fracking does nothing to change that fact. It is an unpredictable business. The biggest reason to doubt the most breathless predictions about America’s future as an oil and gas colossus has more to do with Wall Street than with geopolitics or geology. The fracking of oil, in particular, rests on a financial foundation that is far less secure than most people realize. The most vital ingredient in fracking isn’t chemicals, but capital, with companies relying on Wall Street’s willingness to fund them. If it weren’t for historically low interest rates, it’s not clear there would even have been a fracking boom. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=107))

- “You can make an argument that the Federal Reserve is entirely responsible for the fracking boom,” one private equity titan told me. That view is echoed by Amir Azar, a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The real catalyst of the shale revolution was . . . the 2008 financial crisis and the era of unprecedentedly low interest rates it ushered in,” he wrote in a recent report. Another investor puts it this way: “If companies were forced to live within the cash flow they produce, U.S. oil would not be a factor in the rest of the world, and would have grown at a quarter to half the rate that it has.” Worries about the financial fragility of the fracking revolution have simmered for some time. John Hempton, who runs the Australia-based hedge fund Bronte Capital, recalls having debates with his partner as the boom was just getting going. “The oil and gas are real,” his partner would say. “Yes,” Hempton would respond, “but the economics don’t work.” Thus far, the fracking industry, which survived what some saw as a concerted attempt led by Saudi Arabia to destroy it, has been more resilient than anyone would have dreamed. But questions about the sustainability of the boom are no longer limited to a small set of skeptics. Those doubts now extend to the boardrooms of some big ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=114))

- investors as well as to the executive suites of at least a few of the fracking companies themselves. The fracking boom has been fueled mostly by overheated investment capital, not by cash flow. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=124))

- For the U.S., it was a profound role reversal. Until the 1970s, American oil and swaggering Texas oil barons ruled the world. The Texas Railroad Commission controlled the international price of oil by allowing a certain amount of production, and maintaining spare capacity. But in 1972, as U.S. production slowed, Texas had to start producing flat out. “This is a damn historic occasion and a sad occasion,” the Texas Railroad Commission’s chairman declared. The following year OPEC, which had been created by Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela in 1960, began to flex its new muscles. OPEC declared an oil embargo during the Yom Kippur war against all of Israel’s allies, including the United States. Oil prices quadrupled. The disruption of oil sent Americans in search of other energy sources. Yet oil, which is primarily used for transportation (passenger cars today account for about half our daily consumption), has the benefit of being relatively easy to ship around the world. Natural gas, on the other hand, is used primarily for heating and in power plants and manufacturing. It cannot easily be shipped. One must construct liquefaction plants in order to freeze the gas into liquid ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=195))

- form, and then build “regasification” plants to turn the LNG back into gas, all of which costs billions of dollars. And in the 1970s, the scarcity of gas was a major concern too. Congress effectively kept the U.S. from building gas-fired power plants in favor of coal in 1978. The government also launched a partnership between the Energy Department and dozens of companies and universities called Eastern Gas Shales Project, which aimed to figure out how to recover natural gas from shale deposits. And in 1980, Congress passed the Crude Oil Windfall Tax Credit Act, which provided tax credits to “qualified unconventional gas wells.” By “unconventional,” they meant drilling in areas, like the shale rock, that had not been drilled before.

- But McClendon was never one to be deterred. He thought there was opportunity in assembling packages of drilling rights—for gas, not oil—either to be sold to bigger companies or to be drilled. In the mere existence of that opportunity, America is almost unique, because it is one of the few countries where private citizens, rather than governments, own the mineral rights under their properties. In order to drill, you just have to persuade someone to give you a lease. McClendon became what’s known in the oil and gas business as a land man, the person who negotiates the leases that allow for drilling.

- Ward took Chesapeake public. They did so despite the fact that their accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, had issued a “going concern” warning, meaning its bean-counters worried that Chesapeake might go out of business. So McClendon and Ward simply switched accounting firms. “Tom and I were thirty-three-year-old land men at the time, and most people didn’t think we had a clue of what we were doing, and probably in hindsight they were at least partially right,” McClendon told one interviewer in 2006. The IPO reduced their ownership stake to 60 percent, but both men kept for themselves an important perk, one that would play a key role in the Chesapeake story: They got the right to take a personal 2.5 percent stake in every well Chesapeake drilled. In the years following its IPO, Chesapeake was one of the best-performing stock on Wall Street, climbing from $0.47 per share to $34.44 per share.

- As he would do again and again, McClendon survived by borrowing yet more money to acquire more properties. “Simply put, low prices cure low prices as consumers are motivated to consume more and producers are compelled to produce less,” he wrote in Chesapeake’s 1998 annual report. McClendon essentially made a giant bet that gas prices would rise on their own, and he billed the properties he acquired “low risk.” Luckily, he was right. Within a few years, prices were soaring again, and McClendon had gotten out of a jam, for now. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=285))

- By the end of 2004, Chesapeake had spent around $6 billion over the previous decade acquiring properties, companies and leases. Over the next four years, the company spent another $21.5 billion.

- banks to raise all the money it needed to fund itself. From 2001 to 2012, Chesapeake sold $16.4 billion of stock and $15.5 billion of debt, and paid Wall Street more than $1.1 billion in fees, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. McClendon was like no other client. “Aubrey would send an email to six or seven banks saying, ‘Hey, here’s what I need. Come back to me with your best offer,’” one investment banker says. When one particular deal closed, he received a box from McClendon with bottles of Cristal and a nice note, as did everyone else who was involved.

- But if McClendon was right that lower prices cure lower prices, he somehow forgot the flip side of that industry truism—that high prices also cure high prices. Time and again, in commodity markets, high prices encourage more producers to produce, creating a surplus, that then crushes prices—and producers. “He was right that shale changed the world,” says a longtime gas man. “He should have listened to himself.” ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=367))

- In 1999, when McClendon was struggling to recover from the Austin Chalk debacle, a Texas energy powerhouse called Enron, whose CEO Jeff Skilling had become dismissive of any businesses that required hard assets, spun off an oil and gas exploration division called, appropriately enough, Enron Oil and Gas. The company promptly renamed itself EOG ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=375))

- Resources. In those days of the first Internet boom, no one much cared, and the stock languished. Then, EOG began applying horizontal drilling techniques in the Barnett Shale. As others caught on and EOG’s gas production began to soar, the stock began to run up. “That turned around the company, and focused us as a shale company,” says current CEO William “Bill” Thomas. “We were first movers in the shale revolution.” Today, EOG is valued at almost $70 billion, more than Enron was at its peak before its infamous collapse. If EOG was the anti-Enron, it was also the anti-Chesapeake. Instead of a splashy campus, EOG, which prided itself on a decentralized culture, operated out of several floors in a nondescript office tower in Houston. Among investors, EOG became known for technological advances. “Everyone else is lucky,” one old-time oil and gas man says. “EOG is good.” Others call EOG “the Harvard of Shale,” “the Apple of Oil,” or simply, “the Brain Trust.” ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=378))

- EOG—and an independent energy producer named Continental Resources, run by Harold Hamm (rumored to be Trump’s pick for the Secretary of Energy before Rick Perry got the job), took the lead in the Bakken. Over the next five years, oil production in the formation grew by more than tenfold to almost a million barrels a day. In 2000, North Dakota was ranked ninth among U.S. oil-producing states, and forty-third in terms of economic output per person.

- In the spring of 2012, Chesapeake’s board stripped McClendon of his chairmanship, and over the course of the next year, new investors who thought they could clean up Chesapeake, including Carl Icahn, took seats on the Chesapeake board. Icahn, according to someone familiar with events, initially thought he could control McClendon’s most reckless impulses, especially with McClendon no longer serving as both CEO and chairman, but began to realize it was futile. Lou Simpson, who had run Geico’s investment portfolio for Warren Buffett for decades, and who had joined the board in 2011, was also furious at the state of affairs, according to someone close to events.

- What might be surprising, given all the hype around shale, is that the skepticism extended to the entire industry. “Aubrey McClendon did everything the other guys are doing, just on steroids,” says Chanos. “The industry has a very bad history of money going into it and never coming out.” It wasn’t until later that the industrywide skepticism burst into the open.

- Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood, the movie inspired by Upton Sinclair’s novel Oil! Tall and slightly framed, the baby-faced Einhorn spoke with a high, nasal-inflected voice from behind a podium at the 2015 Ira W. Sohn Investment Research Conference, known as the Super Bowl of the hedge fund industry. At the Sohn conference in May 2008, he’d made a now-famous proclamation that the investment bank Lehman Brothers was in far worse shape than it was letting on. When Lehman went under, Einhorn’s firm, Greenlight Capital, made a fortune from its giant short position in the company. People pay thousands of dollars for a seat at the Sohn conference. They come to hear speakers like Einhorn pitch investment ideas, whose impact is often felt on the stock market the very next morning. Wearing a dark suit and tie, he bounded to the podium and proceeded to take aim at his latest target: the shale industry. He proceeded to lambast fracking companies as financial hucksters and made a detailed case for taking a short position in a company called Pioneer Natural Resources, which he dubbed “Mother Fracker.” At the time, Pioneer was run by Scott Sheffield, a former petroleum engineer who hailed from a family of wildcatters. In the late 1970s, ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=560))

- Sheffield’s father-in-law, Joe Parsley, hired him to work at his company, an independent producer called Parker & Parsley, which later merged with T. Boone Pickens’s Mesa Petroleum to form Pioneer. For years, Pioneer languished, but by the late 2000s, the company was also drilling in the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas and saw its production surge. Einhorn’s firm had looked at the financial statements of the sixteen largest publicly traded frackers, which included companies like Pioneer and EOG. Einhorn found that from 2006 to 2014, the fracking firms had spent $80 billion more than they had received from selling oil and gas. Even when oil was at $100 a barrel, none of them generated excess cash flow—in fact, in 2014, when oil was at $100 for part of the year, the group burned through $20 billion. A key reason for the terrible financial results is that fracked oil wells in particular show an incredibly steep decline rate. According to an analysis by the Kansas City Federal Reserve, the average well in the Bakken… ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=570))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- wells, while production in Iraq can do it with fewer than 100. For a fracking operation to show growth requires huge investment each year to offset the decline from the previous years’ wells. To Einhorn, this was clearly a vicious circle. Another skeptical investor named Jonathan Tepper, who founded a firm called Variant Perception that provides research to hedge funds and family offices, put together a presentation in which likened the dynamics of fracking to the Red Queen’s race in Alice in Wonderland: “The Red Queen has to run faster and faster in order to keep still where she is.” Because the Red Queen’s race requires so much money, it wouldn’t have been possible without the ultra-low interest rate policy that the Federal Reserve has had for the last decade. Amir Azar, a fellow at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy, wrote that by 2014, the industry’s net debt exceeded $175 billion, a 250 percent increase from its 2005 level. But interest expense increased at less than half the rate debt did, because interest rates kept falling. Einhorn also pointed out that presentations by frackers like Pioneer can be quite misleading. A typical presentation, like the ones by Pioneer, would claim that their wells generate internal rates of return of 40 to 100 percent, which are spectacular numbers. And yet, Pioneer reported negative earnings every quarter through 2015, as did many other companies. Turns out, the financial results from an individual well don’t include corporate expenses, such as the money that is spent acquiring land or leases. They also exclude the ongoing capital that needs to be spent in order to maintain production. And that capital literally disappears into a hole in the ground. “Once you extract the oil from the ground,” Einhorn said, “That’s it. Poof! It’s gone.” There’s also the Austin Chalk issue. One well might produce stupendous results. But that doesn’t mean a well ten miles away will do the same. Nor are the estimates of how much oil and gas there is in the ground all that meaningful. Companies… ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=580))

- with oil—to the SEC, but 13.4 billion to investors. Pioneer reported 845 million to the SEC and 11 billion to investors. In total, the industry reported 33 billion of barrels of oil equivalent to the SEC and 163.5 billion to investors. Einhorn, though, was less skeptical of natural gas than of oil. That’s in large part because it takes far less effort and expense to get natural gas to flow through fracked rock than it does to get oil to do so, and the decline rates are far less severe. In a 2012 research report, Credit Suisse noted that the average recovery of a gas well is three to five times that of a typical oil well. Einhorn’s views were mostly echoed by the work done by a little-known employee-owned firm called SailingStone Capital Partners. Based in San Francisco, SailingStone specializes in natural resources investments for its clients—mainly endowments and family offices—and does exhaustive research, including hiring engineers to evaluate various plays and digging deeply into the… ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=601))

- After Einhorn’s presentation, SailingStone wrote its own letter to investors. The firm decried the industry’s “myopic obsession with production growth,” and concurred with Einhorn that “shale gas looks like a better business than shale oil” based on historical returns. But the firm did take issue with Einhorn’s blanket dismissals, arguing that not all oil frackers were alike—for instance, EOG, which Einhorn dismissed as “Father-Fracker,” had reported very different results than Pioneer and others over the full cycle. “The industry is not nearly as uniformly value destructive as David Einhorn… ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=611))

- While high oil prices benefit producers in the short run, there’s an argument that they also speed up the transition to renewables. As one longtime analyst puts it, “With oil there is a price that kills supply and a price that kills demand.” And even if OPEC managed to come to an agreement, Saudi Arabia might have difficulty enforcing production cuts among other members. Al-Naimi had once called Saudi’s move to cut production in the 1980s, which ended up benefiting others, “an unfortunate decision.” This time would be no different. Saudi Arabia’s attitude, according to one ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=632))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- person familiar with the debates, was, “We’re not doing this on our own.” Reuters reported that Al-Naimi made special trips to Venezuela and Mexico, and even held a meeting with Alexander Novak, then the head of Russia’s state-owned gas and oil giant, Rosneft, probably to negotiate a joint production cut. But a production cut would play into the hands of U.S. frackers, who would almost certainly gain market share at OPEC’s and Russia’s expense. On the other hand, if prices continued to fall, U.S. frackers would suffer far worse, the OPEC ministers reasoned. It costs a lot more to produce a fracked barrel of oil in the U.S. than it does to get a barrel of oil out of the ground in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. In a rare interview with the Middle East Economic Survey, Al-Naimi said that Saudi production costs are no more than $5 per barrel, and that marginal costs of development are “at most” $10 per barrel. As 2014 drew to a close, estimates were that it cost U.S. frackers as much as five times that to get a barrel out. “Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while the producer of poor efficiency continues to produce?” asked Al-Naimi. “That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, U.S. shale oil producers will take my share.” Al-Naimi and OPEC thus came to the decision to leave production levels where they were. Those who know Saudi Arabia caution that it’s impossible for outsiders to know what the real reason for anything is, and that it’s quite possible there was more than one motive. Some experts argue that Saudi’s painful history with production cuts is a better explanation than any conspiracy theory. But the Thanksgiving Day decision was interpreted as an attempt to put American frackers out of business. “Inside OPEC Room, Naimi Declares Price War on U.S. Shale Oil,” announced a Reuters headline the day after the meeting. “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they are not out to get you,” said economist Erik Norland. “This was definitely an attempt to kill the U.S. frackers.” But, as the longest period of high oil prices in history came to an end, it’s safe to say that absolutely no one expected what would happen next. After OPEC’s Thanksgiving Day decision, oil prices skidded more than $6 a barrel. By the end of the year, the price was less than $60, and by February 2016, a barrel of oil fetched just $26.

- benefit U.S. oil, and that the opposite would quickly expose the weak underbelly of U.S. shale—its high costs and ravenous need for capital. The reckoning arrived soon. Once-booming U.S. production hit the skids. The so-called rig count—the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas at a given time—fell from 1,920 rigs in late 2014 to a low of 480 in early 2016. “We think it likely that to find a lower level of activity would require going back to the 1860s, the early part of the Pennsylvania oil boom,” Paul Hornsell, head of commodities research for Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a research note. By mid 2016, U.S. oil production had declined by a million barrels a day. One after another, debt-laden companies began to declare bankruptcy, with some two hundred of them eventually going bust. Samson Resources declared bankruptcy in the fall of 2015; in a legal filing, the company estimated its value at less than $2 billion, a fraction of the $7 billion KKR had paid.

- listing $2.1 billion in debt. Its assets later sold for just $245 million. In a report released in the fall of 2016, credit rating agency Moody’s called the corporate casualties “catastrophic.” “When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segmentwide bust of historic proportions,” said David Keisman, a Moody’s senior vice president. Some of those who had bought assets from McClendon and others in the heyday also began to write down the value of what they’d purchased. Statoil, the Norwegian energy giant, wrote down the value of its shale and Canadian oil sands assets by $4 billion; Royal Dutch Shell reported a write down of more than $8 billion. Most prominent was Australia’s BHP Billiton, which had spent $5 billion investing with Chesapeake in the Fayetteville shale and plowed another $15 billion into the purchase of Houston-based Petrohawk. BHP put all the assets on the block in the fall of 2014, but found no buyers, and eventually wrote off over $7 billion—which begat the phrase “pulling a BHP.” As one investor put it: “All of the acquisitions of shale assets done by the majors and by international companies have been disasters. The wildcatters made a lot of money, but the companies haven’t.” As shale companies slashed their budgets, fracking equipment was idled—according to research firm IHS Markit, close to 60 percent of the fracking equipment in the U.S. was inactive. Shale companies and oilfield service companies laid off workers. All told, the global oil and gas industry shed almost half a million jobs during the bust, according to consulting firm Graves & Co. The shale boom towns suddenly resembled their California counterparts after the Gold Rush. In the Cline shale east of Midland, Devon decreased its rig activity and let its leases expire, citing “a lot of variability” in the formation; its partner, Japan’s Sumitomo Corp, took a $1.55 billion… ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=666))

But it was built, and by now, according to analysis by J.P. Morgan, six Baltic and Eastern European countries rely entirely on Russia for their gas supplies; Germany gets 40 percent of its gas from Russia. As tensions between Russia and Ukraine began to flare starting in the mid-2000s, Europe’s complacency changed to panic.

- As it turns out, the demise of fracking that seemed so inevitable wasn’t inevitable after all. There are a few reasons why that was the case, but it all begins with the Permian—Permania, some are now calling it. Fly into Midland, and all you see across the flat dry land are windmills and drilling rigs. “Outside of Saudi Arabia, the whole oil story today is West Texas,” one investor tells me.

- By the mid-2000s, the independents were trying horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking on areas like the Spraberry and the Wolfcamp, a layer of rock that runs right below the Permian and was long thought to be impermeable. It turned out to be a bonanza, the likes of which the world has seldom seen: By 2010, people in Midland were using the “B” word—boom—again. What set the Permian apart from other plays is geological luck. Its oil- and gas-bearing rocks are laid down in horizontal bands. As one engineer explains to me, “Instead of just having one carpet, it’s like seven or eight carpets are stacked up.” That means that one lease can give you multiple layers of hydrocarbons, and also that you can drill more efficiently, because you only have to use one expensive rig to access multiple layers. In addition, other celebrated plays like the Bakken and the Marcellus suffered from a lack of infrastructure, most notably pipelines, to process and carry away the oil and gas. It doesn’t matter how much you can produce if ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=940))

- you can’t get it to customers. By contrast, infrastructure from pipelines to facilities that separate oil into its byproducts, were mostly already in place in the Permian. In 2010, the Permian Basin was producing just shy of 1 million barrels of oil a day. In 2017, that had more than doubled to over 2.5 million barrels a day. By August, output from the Permian alone exceeded that of 8 of the 13 members of OPEC, according to Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency predicts that output will hit more than 4 million barrels a day within a few years. Production from the Permian is the primary driver behind skyrocketing estimates of how much oil the U.S. will produce. In its most recent forecast, the EIA predicted that U.S. crude production would average almost 10.6 million barrels a day in 2018, and 17 million barrels a day by 2023. In 2016, Saudi Arabia averaged 10.5 million barrels a day, and Russia averaged almost 11 million. America seemed on its way to once again becoming the world’s biggest energy power. The story, believers say, is technology. “Shale 2.0,” the industry calls it. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=947))

- Until recently, the history of shale drilling was that operators would watch what others did, and if someone’s new technique got more oil or gas out of the ground, then everyone else would start doing that. “The early science was sometimes no more sophisticated than, ‘Look at what Jim over there is doing!’” says Gary Sernovitz, a venture capitalist and the author of The Green and the Black: the Complete Story of the Shale Revolution, the Fight Over Fracking and the Future of Energy. But now, everyone is searching for data-driven, repeatable ways to maximize the amount of oil you can get out of the ground while minimizing the cost. It used to be that a well would travel horizontally for about a mile. By 2015, the Federal Reserve reported that the average was two miles; Chesapeake, Exxon Mobil and Continental have all neared or broken the three-mile mark. In late 2017, Bloomberg reported that one company had drilled a well that stretched almost four miles, longer than the tallest peaks on five of the world’s seven continents. Other measures have gotten grander, too. In 2011, the average well used about four million pounds of sand, says Samir Nangia, the director of energy consulting at IHS Markit. Now, the average is twelve million pounds, and some leading edge wells use over thirty million pounds. There’s a whole new science around the logistics of getting sand from Wisconsin, where most frac sand is mined, to the job site. At the same time, other things are getting more minute and efficient. Drillers are also executing smaller, more complex, and more frequent fractures. These more precise fracks reduce the risk that the wells “communicate”—that one leaks into another, rendering them inoperable—so the wells can be drilled more closely together. Operators are also utilizing so-called “pad drilling,” where a rig drills multiple wells from the same spot, and “walking rigs,” where a rig can move a few feet without having to be demobilized. That reduces cost, as does… ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=957))

- The dramatic rebound made skeptics look spectacularly wrong—no one more so than David Einhorn. From the time that he recommended shorting Pioneer in the spring of 2015 through early 2017, the company’s stock soared some 30 percent to over $175 a share. As it happened, Pioneer, whose new, modern $50 million headquarters stands out in the dusty brown of Midland, got lucky too. All those years ago, when Scott Sheffield came to work at Parker & Parsley, the company’s primary holdings were in the Permian Basin—and he never sold, even through those dreadfully boring decades. When the boom began, Sheffield became the evangelist in chief for the Permian, calling it the “crown jewel of the world’s oil and gas industry.” In Pioneer’s presentations, he told investors that he thought the Permian shales could hold 75 billion barrels of oil, second only to Saudi Arabia’s gigantic Ghawar field. At the end of 2016, Sheffield retired, but the Sheffield name is now its own West Texas dynasty. Sheffield’s son Bryan, who had been living in Europe, came home to West Texas to operate some of his grandfather’s wells as the boom began. “I was living in Spain, trading commodities, married to a beautiful Spanish girl I had met on the beach, and suddenly it just hit me,” Bryan Sheffield told Texas Monthly. “I told her we had to move back to Midland because I just had to see what I could do.” The younger Sheffield’s timing was impeccable. Although he’d had next to no experience of his own in the oil business, in the spring of 2014, at the height of the boom, he took his company, named Parsley Energy after his grandfather, public. That made Bryan Sheffield one of the youngest billionaires ever in the energy business. Optimists argue that the Permian is still in early innings—in large part because they believe that technological improvements will continue to slash the costs of drilling a well while boosting the amount of oil that comes out. “Every time people say it can’t go down further, companies figure out a way of doing it cheaper,” says Nangia. “You are still only extracting about 12 percent of the total hydrocarbons, so there is plenty of room to increase, particularly for oil,” he adds. “They will always underestimate,” a longtime Midlander says about the forecasts. “And we’ll never get the last barrel of oil out of the Permian. It just won’t happen.” And yet, even today, it is unclear if we will look back and see fracking as the beginning of a huge ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=987))

- and lasting shift—or if we will look back wistfully, realizing that what we thought was transformative was merely a moment in time. Because in its current financial form, the industry is still unsustainable, still haunted by McClendon’s twin ghosts of heavy debt and lack of cash flow. “The industry has burned up cash whether the oil price was at $100, as in 2014, or at about $50, as it was during the past three months,” one analyst calculated in mid-2017. According to his analysis, the biggest sixty firms in aggregate had used up an average of $9 billion per quarter from mid-2012 to mid-2017. It wasn’t just American technological prowess that helped restart the oil boom. One unsexy and unheralded factor is so-called service costs—the costs to rent a rig, hire the crew, purchase the sand and other ingredients necessary to frack a well, and so on. Service costs are cyclical, meaning that as the price of oil rises and demand for services increases, the costs rise too. As the price of oil falls and demand dwindles, service companies slash to the bone in an effort to retain what meager business there is. One investor hired a geologist to perform an analysis of how much the reduction in service costs contributed to the reduction in break-evens; according to this analysis, almost half the reduction was due to the plunge in service costs. But a reduction in service costs is a temporary phenomenon; as drilling came back, those improvements began to reverse. In the spring of 2017, the CEO of SLB, a big service provider, told a gathering of investors that “there is an impending cost inflation avalanche coming from the service industry.” By the spring of 2018, there were rumors that truckers were getting $1,000 signing bonuses. “What people still fail to understand is that the most cyclical number we have is the theoretical break-even,” one longtime oil man says. “There will be stories about how the $40 break-even became the $70 break-even, and people will say, ‘Who lied to me?’” And so it is that the most important factor in the comeback of shale is the same thing that started the boom in the first place: The availability of capital. “It came back because Wall Street was there,” says longtime short-seller Jim Chanos. In 2017, U.S. frackers raised $60 billion in debt, up almost 30 percent since 2016, according to Dealogic. Wall Street’s willingness to fund money-losing shale operators is, in turn, a reflection of ultra-low interest rates. That poses a twofold risk to shale companies. In his paper for Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy, Amir Azar noted that if interest rates rose, it would wipe out a significant portion of the improvement in break-even costs. But low interest rates haven’t just meant lower borrowing costs for debt-laden companies. The lack of return elsewhere also led pension funds, which need to be able to pay retirees, to invest massive amounts of money with hedge funds that invest in high yield debt, like that of energy firms, and… ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1007))

- In some cases, private equity firms bought the debt of troubled companies, or provided equity capital for restructurings. They also have acted almost like venture capital firms, providing seed money for entrepreneurs like Campbell and Sellers to assemble land. According to SailingStone, 35 percent of all horizontal drilling today is being done by privately held private equity backed companies. The private equity titans have made fortunes—but not necessarily because the companies they have funded have produced profits. Some of the returns that the private equity firms have generated have come from selling one company to another, like in the case of Double Eagle, or in taking a company they’ve funded public. For a long time, the value the public market was willing to accord a fracker was based not on a multiple of profits, which is a standard way of valuing a company, but rather as a multiple of the acreage a company owns. It was a bit like the old dotcom days, when internet companies were valued on the number of eyeballs. The attitude is invest-and-flip, not buy-and-hold. “I view it as a greater fool business model,” one private equity executive tells me. “But it’s one that has worked for a long time.” In the summer of 2017, finger-pointing began regarding who was to ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1039))

- blame for the red ink in the shale business. True, investors who expect profits are disappointed in shale companies. Or as Doug Terreson, a one-time petroleum engineer turned top-ranked energy analyst, now with Evercore ISI, asks, “If shale is such a great business, why isn’t it creating value for shareholders?” But it turns out shale companies are disappointed in investors too. At a June 2017 investor conference, Al Walker, who is the CEO of Anadarko Resources, the giant Texas based oil and natural gas company, told the assembled crowd, “The biggest problem our industry faces today is you guys.” He went on to explain that the pressure from investors to grow production, regardless of profitability, made it very hard for management teams to do anything but. There are signs that that is changing. Terreson, who has done extensive research showing that executive pay in this industry is based much more on production growth than whether investors make money, is pushing companies to fix that.… ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1049))

But the industry needs to produce free cash flow to keep attracting our capital.” Indeed, an increasingly vocal cadre of investors is arguing that the growth-at-all-costs model doesn’t work. It might make executives and their private equity backers rich in the short term, but it doesn’t benefit anyone else, especially given that it’s not at all clear how limitless the remaining supply of oil actually is. “Our view is that there’s only five years of drilling inventory left in the core,” one prominent investor tells me. “If I’m OPEC, I would be laughing at shale. In five years, who cares? It’s a crazy system, where we’re taking what is a huge gift and what should be real for many years, not five years, and wasting it. The industry didn’t have stuff to drill for a long time. Now we have it and we’re wasting it. We’re flooding the market with a low price resource instead of saving it for a rainy day.” There are some longtime skeptics who argue that the industry is moving in the right direction. “By… ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1059))

- the industry in the long run, they are trending in the right direction.” But so far, it is just a handful of the better operators. Even as oil prices rose, only five fracking companies managed to generate more cash than they spent in the first quarter of 2018, reported the Wall Street Journal. And so, if the focus on profitability continues, and companies can only drill what they can fund with their own cash flow, will the production be as grand as the forecasters are saying? To try to get some clarity as to whether the forecasters or the skeptics might be right, I visited Bill Thomas, the CEO of EOG—the so-called “Harvard of Shale”—in his spartan offices high above Houston. It was just after the havoc unleashed by Hurricane Harvey, and although the sun was shining, the city was unusually subdued. One of the first slides Thomas showed me is one that ranks all the E&P companies by profitability. “EOG One of Few E&Ps Spending Within Cash Flow,” it reads.

- think.” EOG won’t drill unless a well can generate a 30 percent internal rate of return at an oil price of $40 a barrel, because after overhead costs, like land and infrastructure, that return gets cut in half—and that’s at EOG, which prides itself on keeping overheard costs low. At an oil price of $40 a barrel, Thomas says there is a limited amount of land where it makes economic sense to drill. (The numbers obviously change as the price of a barrel of oil increases, but it is EOG’s goal to be profitable throughout price cycles.) Thomas says that even in the much celebrated Permian, the rock is much more variable than optimists seem to believe, and the “core”—the really good rock—is smaller. This is no small deal. “Better rock responds exponentially better,” he says. “It’s not linear.” “The Permian has terrified the world oil market but there are overblown expectations of the Permian,” he says.

- starting stamping them out, your results go down. You’ve got to keep learning.” He adds, “There are a lot of startups doing shale, but there’s a long learning curve, and it’s not that easy. Do not get into manufacturing mode. You can easily mess things up, and if you do, you cannot go back in and fix it.” Perhaps not surprisingly, Mark Papa, whose retirement didn’t last long—he has founded a new company called Centennial—echoes some of these sentiments. He argues that the ability of American shale oil to affect the global price of oil, as the most bullish forecasters predict, is not an ongoing phenomenon, but rather a “one-time event” brought about by the confluence of the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, and the Permian hitting the market at the same time. “What’s overlooked,” he says, “is that shale wells do deplete.” Now, he says, the Bakken “is exhausted as a growth vehicle. The Eagle Ford has some power left, but it’s not nearly as powerful as it was.” Already, he notes,… ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1090))

This is despite the fact that the Saudis and the Russians are on opposite sides of the wars in Syria and Yemen. Putin, of course, was also eager to see oil prices rise so that he could spur Russia’s economy before he faced reelection in March 2018. As for Saudi Arabia, it didn’t want to see Russia even more beholden to Iran. It was OPEC’s first deal with Russia in fifteen years. The Saudis and Russians agreed to cut production heavily, while Iran was allowed to slightly boost output. The price of crude oil immediately rose more than 8 percent. At subsequent meetings, OPEC imposed more cuts, and the price steadily rose to around $50 a barrel by the spring of 2017, and then into the $70s by the spring of 2018.

- U.S. shale has dealt a crushing blow to imports from OPEC’s African members, who produce a light crude that is similar to shale oil, and whose economies are heavily dependent on oil. Exports to the U.S. from three of OPEC’s African members—Nigeria, Algeria, and Angola—have fallen to their lowest levels in decades. In 2013, Nigerian Oil Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke told CNBC that U.S. shale oil was a “grave concern.” And no wonder: Industry publication Hart Energy reported that as a result of the surge of shale oil, several refiners had virtually eliminated their imports of Nigerian oil. And the oil industry accounts for 70 percent of Nigeria’s tax revenue. By the summer of 2017, as Nigeria plunged into its biggest economic crisis in years, Alison-Madueke was begging for limitations on U.S. shale oil.

- Experts do believe that a supply of U.S. oil and a surplus of cheap U.S. natural gas could weaken the country that most aggressively wields its energy supplies as a weapon: Russia. Not only is the U.S. building export facilities, but Europe has invested heavily in LNG import terminals. American LNG is still more expensive than Russian gas due to the cost of liquefaction, and probably always will be. But now there is an option, whereas before, there was none. As a result, “even if countries don’t buy U.S. gas, they can get better terms and more reliable supply” from Rosneft, which is essentially Russia’s state energy company, argues Jamie Webster, BCG energy analyst and fellow at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. The Baker Institute reports that Rosneft has already had to accept lower prices for its gas; as long-term contracts roll off, there’s an argument that Russia will have to make significant concessions on price. “Shale really hurts Russia,” says Stephen Arbogast, a professor of finance and the Director of the Energy Center at the Kenan-Flager Business School in North Carolina. “Combine sanctions with shale, and you can put tremendous pressure on the Russian state.” But if the Kremlin’s global political ambitions may ultimately be stunted by Russia’s faltering finances, there’s little proof yet.

Prices are hovering at less than half of prices in much of the rest of the world. That means that energy intensive manufacturing in the U.S. “enjoys a significant advantage versus Europe, Japan, or China, all of whom depend upon imported oil and LNG for marginal supplies.” John Shaw, the Harry C. Dudley Professor of Structural and Economic Geology at Harvard, said in a 2015 talk, “Nothing has had a more profound impact on the U.S. and global ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FSY6P3X&location=1326))

- energy economy in the past decade than the emergence of shale gas resources.” This newfound competitiveness is especially obvious in the refining and chemical industries, where new U.S. capacity is being built and exports are at record levels. In 2016, the German industrial trade group BDI even warned that America’s cheap natural gas could put European firms at a serious economic disadvantage. “It is [an] enormous advantage for the U.S.,” says EOG’s Bill Thomas. “I think LNG is more of a game changer than oil is, and there is so much natural gas that we can’t use it all.” In early 2018, the EIA reported that the US had become a net exporter of LNG for the first time since at least 1957. The impact on U.S. manufacturing can be seen in plans such as those announced in the spring of 2017 by ExxonMobil and Saudi Basic Industries (a major Saudi Arabian producer of petrochemicals) to invest $10 billion to create a massive plastics and petrochemical plant in Corpus Christi.
