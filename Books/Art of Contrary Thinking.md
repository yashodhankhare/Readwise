- From long study of mass movements and public psychology there is no question in this writer’s mind that if one trains his mind to think opposite to the herd he will be right more often than wrong. In other words, concerning most subjects it is pretty safe to say that “the crowd is usually wrong”—at least, in its timing of events. Please do not misunderstand the saying “the crowd is wrong.” I do not mean that people are wrong in their philosophies concerning their everyday living. What I refer to is this: When masses of people succumb to an idea, they often run off at a tangent because of their emotions. When people stop to think things through, they are very sane in their decisions. It is when some occurrence arises that has wide emotional appeal that you find “the crowd going wrong.” You perceive the significant difference, I’m sure. In one case people act as “a crowd” and in the other as individuals. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=240))

- However, the reader should be reminded that the art of contrary thinking is applicable to almost any subject. It is applicable to arguments in philosophy and frequently applicable to politics. In politics, obviously, those who are running for office are after the popular vote. Candidates who are skilled in the use of crowd psychology will call into play all of the various tricks which arouse people’s emotions and desires. What it comes down to in the final analysis is that a “crowd” thinks with its heart (that is, is influenced by emotions) while an individual thinks with his brain. This is no reflection on any individual because, when any of us are grouped in a crowd, we are likely to lose our balance, you might say we become one of a group rather than remain as an individual. You’ve often heard it said that so-and-so “lost his head”, or that “his heart ran away with his head.” ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=249))

- The art of contrary thinking consists in training your mind to ruminate in directions opposite to general public opinions; but weigh your conclusions in the light of current events and current manifestations of human behavior.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Contrary opinion?” 1) Primarily, it is a method of ruminating over a broad range of public questions; political, economic, and social. The object of contrary thinking is to challenge generally accepted viewpoints on the prevailing trends in politics and socioeconomics. In sum, the purpose is to contest the popular view, because popular opinions are so frequently found to be untimely, misled (by propaganda), or plainly wrong. a) Experience with contrary thinking warrants the use of such sloganized expressions as these: When everyone thinks alike, “everyone” is likely to be wrong…. When writers write alike, readers are prone to think alike…. Too many predictions spoil the forecasts; or, to put it another way, the weight of predictions causes their own downfall. (What happens is that counteracting policies are adopted to offset, or bypass, the “expectancy.”) b.) Caution: The contrary theory is a way of thinking, but let’s not overweigh it. It is more of an antidote to general forecasting than a system for forecasting. In a word, it is a thinking tool, not a crystal ball. It forces one to think through a given subject. As has been said: If you don’t think things through, you’re through thinking. 2) Human traits that make the theory of contrary opinion workable, include: Habit Emotion Irritability Custom Greed Pride-of-Opinion ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=290))

- Imitation Hope Wishful Thinking Contagion Credulity Impulsiveness Fear Susceptibility Conceit 3) The theory is based upon “laws” of sociology and psychology, among which these are logically related: a. A “crowd” yields to instincts which an individual acting alone represses. b. People are gregarious; instinctively they follow the impulses of the herd. c. Contagion and imitation of the minority (follow-the-leader) make people susceptible to suggestion, to commands, to customs, to emotional motivation. d. A crowd never reasons, but follows its emotions; it accepts without proof what is “suggested” or “asserted.” ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=304))

- In all public questions which engage people’s minds the contrarian tries to see in behind the surface opinions (as above, that people fail to recognize the kinship between the two isms) 2) Consider the contrary questioning of propaganda which is so prevalent today. It is the reasons behind; not the mere words in speeches, pronouncements, and articles which we have to seek. Why is the message circulated?—not simply what is in the message. Quite frankly, the contrarian needs to be cynical in this propaganda analysis, but so long as “opinion-makers” are out to sway and mold public opinion the only defense is “to doubt all before you believe anything”—and to look behind the words for meanings. 3) Manias and waves of mass sentiment—and crowd beliefs sweep across nations when least expected. And they change just as swiftly. History is full of stories of tulip manias, South Sea bubbles, Florida land booms, and Ponzi schemes. More concretely, these examples might be mentioned, when a contrary view would have been the correct one to hold: That (in 1929) we reached a New Era and a new plateau of permanent prosperity…That (in the 1930’s) we had reached economic maturity…That (in the 1920’s) radio would put the record player and records out of business for all time…. That (currently) television will kill off the movies. (The contrary view here is that people are gregarious—like to go out and mingle with the crowd. Public entertainment is as old as history and it is a safe contrary opinion that human nature has not changed. Solitary entertainment will never satisfy the masses. In the long run television will enlarge the audiences, will create greater entertainment demands). We might add one more example—that of 1945, when it was widely predicted that an immediate postwar slump would find eight million out of work.

- Goethe, the great poet-philosopher, once wrote: “I find more and more that it is well to be on the side of the minority, since it is always the more intelligent.” ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=357))

- As my interest in the human side of speculation developed I also found that studies of crowd behavior were singularly helpful in interpreting other, far broader, economic forces than merely fluctuations in stock prices. Not to bore you further with personal reminiscences, let me sum up my experiences: First, as mentioned, I learned that individual opinions (my own as well as the next man’s) are of little value—because so frequently wrong. Second, that human traits (of fear, hope, greed, pride-of-opinion, wishful thinking) are so strong in the human breast that they prevent one from being objective. Objective analysis of economic trends is imperative, I believe, as subjective reasoning leads to opinionated conclusions. Third, that if one relies stubbornly on his own opinion he is likely to “stand on his opinion,” right or wrong. No trait is stronger, perhaps, than that of defending one’s opinion and of being unwilling to admit error in judgment.

- Moreover, even with contrary opinions as a guide we still have to fight against personal viewpoints. For example, if you feel strongly about a certain economic situation it is difficult oftentimes to submerge your feelings and coldly gauge public opinion. So, occasionally you will misjudge public opinion because of your preconceived opinions. You will jump to the conclusion that the public opinion is as you wish it were, and thus, unconsciously, you become a member of the “public” and in reality think as the public does.

    - Note: READ THIS BOOK, THE AUTHOR IS GUSTAVE LE BON
- Le Bon very clearly and explicitly explains the actions of crowds—what a crowd is and how a crowd reacts to various influences. The basic distinction, of course, between a crowd and an individual is this: whereas an individual may act after reasoning and analysis, a crowd acts on feelings and emotion. Crowds follow “leaders” or follow what they assume to be the actions of leaders. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=570))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A crowd is susceptible to what Le Bon calls “contagion.” ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=573))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Because a crowd does not think, but acts on impulses, public opinions are frequently wrong. By the same token, because a crowd is carried away by feeling, or sentiment, you will find the public participating enthusiastically in various manias after the mania has got well under momentum. This is illustrated in the stock market. The crowd—the public—will remain indifferent when prices are low and fluctuating but little. The public is attracted by activity and by the movement of prices. It is especially attracted by rising prices. Thus, in former days a “crowd” could be tempted into the market when a manipulator made a stock active and pushed its price higher. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=578))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Le Bon also tells us that a primary characteristic of a crowd is its susceptibility to “suggestion.” Suggestions, in turn, are “contagious.” Furthermore, Le Bon points out that “however indifferent it may supposed to be, a crowd, as a rule, is in a state of expectant attention, which renders suggestion easy.” ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=583))
    - Tags: [[affect]] 
- Le Bon says, further, that a crowd thinks “in images, and the image itself immediately calls up a series of other images….” When, for example, two or three years ago, there were rumors of a coffee shortage, women at once visited stores in numbers and began hoarding coffee. This was a perfect example of crowd behaviorism. They did not stop to think that the coffee would spoil if kept too long, or that probably the stories of coffee shortages were exaggerated. Crowds do not stop to think, as we have noted. The power of suggestion is what motivates their action. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=589))

- Inflation reflects crowd behaviorism in all its forms of greed, fear, and cupidity. History is replete with inflation manias. In the 1920’s the German and French inflations were characteristic—as was the Chinese inflation of the 1940’s (and our own, but to a lesser degree because, fortunately, it did not “run away”).

- “Early in the year 1789,” writes Andrew D. White in his classic monograph,10 “the French nation found itself in deep financial embarrassment: there was a heavy debt and a serious deficit. “Statesmanlike measures, careful watching and wise management would, doubtless, have ere long led to a return of confidence…but these involved patience and self-denial, and, thus far in human history, these are the rarest products of political wisdom…” We seemingly can take Mr. White’s remarks to heart as they appear to apply also to the mid-twentieth century. In France the hard way had no appeal. There was a general search for some short road to prosperity, White tells us, and “ere long the idea was set afloat that the great want of the country was for more of the circulating medium [today, throughout the world, it is for more dollars] and this was followed by calls for an issue of paper.” The great Mirabeau, you remember, tried by the strength of his oratory to stop the fiendish schemes of Marat, who wished to issue paper money backed by the lands of the Church. Mirabeau lifted his voice in the National Assembly against the wicked idea of issuing four hundred million assignats unsupported by specie—but to no avail. The immediate result of the paper-money stimulant was, of course, successful. For a brief time, business picked up and people were happy. France rejoiced at the brilliant plan. Bootstrap economics never works for long, however. Within a short five months the money was gone and “the government was in distress again.” You know the sequel. After lengthy debates wise counsel went for naught. On the twenty-ninth of September 1790, the Assembly voted by a large majority to issue more assignats—this time doubling the amount to eight hundred million. The false illusion that inflation is prosperity swept through France. There was no stopping the orgy. Issue followed issue as the paper money quickly lost its value. Soon, drastic laws were instituted to save the day. Landed estates were confiscated. Price control was tried—the “Law of the Maximum.” “New issues only increased the evil,” White explains…“but… ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=625))

- There is no doubt that shifts in monetary policies in 1949, for example, influenced the early ending of the mild downturn in business activity. It was this marked change in policy which supported this writer’s contrary opinion expressed during the first half of 1949 that the slump would again be postponed. Just as a reminder let us record the clear-cut policy announced by the Federal Reserve Board in June, 1949: “It will be the policy of the Committee [Open Market Committee] to direct purchases, sales, and exchanges of Government securities by the Federal Reserve Banks with primary regard to the general business and credit situation.” [Emphasis added by this writer.] ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=654))

- As the Treasury demanded easy money—low-interest rates—and the Federal Reserve Board intended to control money rates, we witnessed some “interesting disagreements” in the months following. (You remember -what happened: Money rates stiffened, and government bonds fell in price, following the Federal Reserve Board’s later policy of withdrawing its supports from the bond market. In 1953 interest rates hardened still further and a long-term bond carried an interest rate well above 3 percent.) During 1955 the tussle between credit expansion and monetary restraint made news. The Federal Reserve Board was determined to curb the overextension of consumer borrowing. The public and businessmen as a whole do not pay attention to, or comprehend, monetary strategy. It behooves contrary thinkers to bone up on the rudiments of the money market and the government bond market in order to try to measure the influences that our banking and governmental authorities may have on economic trends. Since the world (and the United States) “went off gold,” the money supply has been regulated by men in place of the metal. Money supply, therefore, has become a master key of economic forecasting.

- Is the public always wrong? This is probably the most frequently asked question about the Theory of Contrary Opinion. For a correct answer we need to change the words in the question. Let me put it this way: Is the public wrong all the time? The answer is, decidedly, “No.” The public is perhaps right more of the time than not. In stock market parlance, the public is right during the trends but wrong at both ends! One can assert that the public is usually wrong at junctures of events and at terminals of trends. So, to be cynical, you might say, “Yes, the public is always wrong when it pays to be right—but is far from wrong in the meantime.” I am often asked: “How about 1928 and 1929? Wasn’t the public right in the market, and wouldn’t a contrary opinion have been wrong?” The public was right in 1928, if by right you mean it was right to ride a wild whirlwind of speculation—but dead wrong in the sense that it was a foregone conclusion the public would be wrong when the final blow struck. By the same token, a contrary opinion would have been wrong in the sense that it would have been many months previous. In great mass speculative periods, such as 1928 and 1929, the Theory of Contrary Opinion would be right in keeping people out of the storm, but decidedly wrong from a measurement of interim paper profits. Many very smart people deserted the stock market in 1928, realizing it was running far out of bounds yet many were dragged back in again by the magnetism of the gushing prices that kept on rushing up. “Everyone” was so engrossed with the rising prices that few if any gave heed to Secretary Mellon’s cryptic remark in July, 1929, that “now is a good time to buy bonds.” Indeed, few people had any idea what he meant—or cared! It is to be noted that the use of contrary opinions will frequently result in one’s being rather too far ahead of events. A contrary opinion will seldom “time” one’s conclusions accurately. The “time element” is the most elusive factor in economics. We need to get that fixed firmly in our minds. (Insofar as I am aware, there is no known method of timing events or trends.) Therefore, when we adopt a contrary opinion, as a guide, we must recognize that we may be too far ahead of the crowd. This is because economic trends often are very slow in turning, or reversing. Frequently, opinions on a given situation will be so one sided that a contrary opinion is obvious. However, it may be some weeks, or months, before the trend of the situation alters sufficiently to make the contrary conclusion the correct one. It is probably safe to say, however, that it is wiser to be early than to be late—in most economic decisions. This does not apply only to the stock market. Not by any means. It applies as well to business policies and to other economic problems. In sum, the public is not wrong all the time—and a contrary opinion is usually ahead of time.

- In concluding this brief report on the Theory of Contrary Opinion we should tackle one more question: Is it difficult to use the contrary theory? ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=700))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Admittedly, the theory is perplexing and often perverse. In the first place, it is contrary to one’s natural reactions to be contrary to general opinions! Moreover, others with whom you discuss your contrary opinions will almost always violently disagree—will find numberless reasons and arguments to show you you’re wrong in your adverse viewpoints. It will be difficult to stick to your contrary viewpoints because it will seem so obvious that you should be thinking as others are. Furthermore, it often takes a long time to prove out your point. This weakens your faith, because you begin to fear your contrary ideas are the wrong ones! To be contrary means you have to be opposed to the obvious—and that is frequently quite baffling. Perhaps it will help this confused explanation if we listen to Sir Francis Bacon who, nearly three hundred years ago, admonished his students to “Doubt all before you believe anything! Watch your idols!” In Novum Organum, this keen thinker and iconoclast established first his doubt of all things, before proceeding to his consideration of knowledge: “In general, let every student…take this as a rule—that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction, is to be held in suspicion; and that so much the more care is to be taken, in dealing with such questions, to keep the understanding even and clear….” This much may be said—and demonstrated conclusively, I believe—that if we fail to take crowd opinions into consideration, when arriving at conclusions concerning economic and political events, we shall most certainly make many errors in forecasting. Contrary thinking unquestionably helps one to avoid many common errors in forecasting—errors arising from miscalculating what the public will do.

- I was tossed into the discussion that followed (in “Letters to the Editor”). Mr. B. K. Thurlow, of Winslow, Cohil & Stetson, Inc., members of the New York Stock Exchange, while agreeing with Mr. May’s buying policy, inquired what policies Mr. May advocated in selling. Among Mr. Thurlow’s queries was this one: “Do you consider that such general psychological approaches as Neill’s Theory of Contrary Opinion have their place in the strategy?…” This offers an excuse to blow our contrary horn, and to mention an off-beat note. Let us stress one psychological factor—a basic truism—that underlies the whole problem, because in the final analysis investment is a human problem.

- Thus, I dare to predict that contrary opinions will remain valid as a guide until public psychology changes—and it has not changed in centuries. So long as the investing public (and many of its advisers) acts as a “crowd,” it’ll pay to be contrary. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=804))

- Further, if you adopt Mr. May’s sound concept, you will have all the more reason to be contrary. A probing mind is a contrary mind. Values are seldom unearthed except by looking in the less likely spots for the unexploited medium. Contrarywise, the overvalued medium is easily overlooked when markets are ebullient and “everyone” is buying. Obviously, there are fewer “values” when the market is “high”—yet there always are some for the deep diggers, as Mr. May points out.

- The word “habit” will appear frequently in these essays on the art of contrary thinking, so we might introduce the subject. Habit, of course, is one of the chief studies in psychology. Habits are of various types: fixed and changeable; likewise, physical, mental, and emotional. William Henry Mikesell14 tells us that “every division of the mind is habitualized.” And further, that “Everyone has thought-habits as well as habits of skill. One person can predict the general kind of judgment another person will pass ten years from now, because ways of thinking become stereotyped. Every- one has feelings-habits. Very few feelings are new and fresh; we have experienced most of them before. Attitudes are mostly feelings-habits…. Everyone has emotional habits and habits of perception….” ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=816))

- Habits push our minds into ruts—and it takes a considerable amount of force and time to get out of the ruts. So, in contemplating crowd action (to which we may wish to be contrary) we have to consider not only the thought- habits of the crowd but our own thought-habits! This “rut-thinking” is regularly reflected in economics, in politics, and in the stock market. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=837))

- THE PSYCHOLOGY OF INFLATION In a little book by the late Frank Parker Stockbridge (long out of print) , the author refers to the “first” inflation he encountered in his research as having been recorded twenty-five centuries ago. Countless inflations have occurred since. It would be amusing, if results had not usually been tragic, to note that each time the government or the dictator (and there have been more dictators than free governments in history, as you doubtless are aware) attacked the inflation from the manipulative or easy money angle rather than from the sound course of curing the cause. “In the first inflation, Solon, who assumed supreme powers in Athens in 594 B.C., “promulgated a plan for the relief of debtors and the redistribution of national wealth which set the pattern other governments have followed, more or less closely for over 2,500 years.” As Mr. Stockbridge further wrote, the Greeks had a name for the cure of inflation. Solon called his plan “Seisachtheia,” literally, “shaking off of burdens,” which sounds curiously like some much more recent political slogans. And the means he adopted for putting Seisachtheia into effect have likewise a familiar sound. He reduced the value of the currency and cancelled agrarian debts.

- In the early 1930’s when former President Roosevelt took us off the free gold standard and commenced to experiment with a different price for gold each morning, printing presses commenced to hum with books and pamphlets pertaining to inflation. Any modern bibliography on inflation contains numerous articles and pamphlets dated in the 1930’s. We were all warned time and again that inflation would soon overtake us and ruin us. Yet a contrary psychology prevailed. The public went serenely on its way, paying little heed to the dreaded fears and maintaining confidence in the dollar. The fact the dollar had been clipped in gold value meant nothing to the average person. The paper dollar in his pocket was still good. That was all he cared about. Result: no ruinous inflation. Indeed, dollars remained dormant. Turnover of money remained quiet. Inflation did not “take.” A decade and a half later signs of uneasiness and “doubt of the dollar” developed in the public mind. At the same time, the source of the inflation—monetary policy—was grudgingly being attacked. In consequence, the race between economic forces and psychology was on. A… ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=853))

- holds no opinion and in which people generally have scant interest. This sounds odd, perhaps, because how can one “go opposite” to no opinions? The point is this: We are trying, in the use of contrary opinions, to calculate trends, and not merely indulging in academic appraisals of opinions. Thus, if certain economic factors influence trends and yet do not have public interest, we still need to consider them—because the public will react to the results. The subjects with the greatest influence, but holding the smallest public interest, are money and banking. (Money, of course, includes “credit.”) There have been fifty-foot shelves of books written on money, credit, and banking, yet it remains a complex and little understood subject. From Ricardo to Keynes, from John Law to Irving Fisher and Sumner Slichter, from the coin clippers of old to the money rate peggers of the recent past, the money jugglers have continued to toss their theories into the air. Those of us not schooled in the intricacies of monetary economics have to be guided by simple rules that we can understand, although they are… ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=867))

- THE THEORY OF CONTRARY OPINION IS A “WAY OF THINKING” But let’s not overweigh it! This question bobs up constantly: What is this theory of contrary opinion? The reply may be stated in a word: It is a “way” of thinking, But, let me add, let’s not overweigh it! Let us give it its proper weight. It certainly is not a system to beat the horse races, or the stock market. Nor is it a crystal ball. It is plainly nothing more than developing the habit of doing what every textbook on learning advises, namely, to look at both sides of all questions. Or, as Sir Francis Bacon put it: “Doubt all before you believe….” Inasmuch as very, very few people ever take the trouble to look at both sides of questions—indeed, ever take the trouble to think very much even on one side—it is obviously of great advantage to be among the tiny minority that does exercise its brain… ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=959))

This makes Homo sapiens (may be translated as “wise guy,” perhaps) “an easy mark,” as Nock says, “for whatever deleterious nonsense may be presented to him under the appearance of authority.” So, let us employ contrary opinions in order to avoid the… ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=975))

- Conversely, there are frequently ideas that grasp people’s minds and become embedded there about which they cannot have any sound long-term opinion because of unknowable factors that will arise. One such thought comes to mind. It was not many years ago that it was generally accepted as an economic fact that the United States had reached a point of economic maturity. Do you remember when we heard little else except that our economy was mature, that under consumption was to be permanent, and unemployment constant? You heard the same fixed ideas a short two years ago about the certainty of inflation, a prolonged period of prosperity, and no recession while the government poured money into defense. By 1953 “everyone” was talking slump again. Another way contrary thinking helps us is in avoiding the costly habit of judging the future by the present. That is, the inclination to assume that if it is sunny and warm today it will be sunny and warm tomorrow.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Have you noticed the tendency we all have of immediately asking “What’s wrong?” when some economic or political question comes up for discussion? You can think of any number of examples: If arguing about the general business situation, someone is sure to ask: “What’s wrong with business today, anyway?” Or, about the stock market: Brokers are asked over and over, every day—“What’s wrong with the market?” Did you ever hear anyone inquire, “What’s right with the market?” Yet I’ll venture to assert that if you ask what’s right about economic trends, when you’re thinking about them, you will get an entirely fresh slant on things. Your mind will travel in different channels. Try it sometime—indeed, make it a habit. It is a contrary habit much to be recommended. The negative approach to socio-economic questions has become a fixation. People have developed what psychologists and doctors refer to as “the depression psychosis” or the looking-for-trouble habit. Bring up almost any question about domestic or foreign affairs and you will hear voices at once chime in that “it won’t work,” “it can’t be done,” and so on. It reminds one of the horse-and-buggy days when Henry Ford and the other horseless-carriage inventors were scoffed at. This reminds me of an interesting example of thinking right which is related in the book, Watch Your Margin. A smart investor was riding in one of the early two lungers, and after a speedy fifteen-miles-an-hour spin inquired what made the contraption run. When told it was gasoline, he at once bought himself a bundle of Mr. Rockefeller’s certificates. He knew that Standard Oil would sell its product and stay in business, and he also figured a lot of the early-bird manufacturers of autos would drop by the wayside. So, by asking himself what was right about the gas buggies—and not worrying about what was wrong—he made a future killing.” It seems to me that if we are to ride through the next decade without losing our sense of balance and are to enjoy any sort of contentment in life we need to dwarf our troubles and magnify our blessings. If we start asking “What’s right?” about this or that question we shall find we are actually changing our whole method of thinking. Heaven knows we don’t enjoy figuring the fiendish taxes of today, but it wasn’t so long ago that you and I both probably were thinking that anything, even killing taxes, would be better than a runaway inflation. Obviously, I’ll agree that taxes can be too ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1130))

- One could write a book on crowd psychology and use the 1952 Republican campaigns for the nomination for the illustrations. It would include every rule in the game for leading and misleading the crowd. One contender swung the sledge hammer to gain and hold attention. The other gained ground through the emotional appeals via suggestion, imagination, contagion. Students of crowd psychology know that the average voter pays scant attention to the fundamental facts concerning either the candidate or the platform. He accepts “what he feels.” The forces of suggestibility and contagion form the image in his mind. Mystery is an all-powerful tool. “Tell ‘em nothing and promise ‘em anything,” counsels the politician; “and, above all, never reason with voters; affirm but never explain; repeat what you’ll do for ‘em, but never argue.” The principles of winning the crowd gave General Eisenhower the breaks early in 1952. Far off in Paris, it was a simple matter to build him up as a great idol. Being aloof from the rough and tough campaigning he retained glamour and fascination. His supporters here at home worked on the emotions of the people by constantly strumming their theme of “leadership,” “popularity,” and “only Ike can win.” Avoiding arguments, they played on the heart strings, forcing the late Senator Taft into the tough spot of winning the minds. The silly slogan, “I Like Ike,” shows how the propaganda was brought down to the level of a school child. “I like Ike and that’s enough; what more do you want?” It was brutally simple, difficult to defeat, and highly contagious. In the meantime, Taft had to exert constant pressure just to keep before the public. He could not let up for an instant. Lacking full press support (indeed most of it was for the General), he had to press his own support. The opposition’s claim that “Taft can’t win” was a devastating slogan that he had to combat.

- The aim of this writer’s contrary comments is to proffer interpretations in the field of economic psychology, still largely unexplored. One does not find, for example, the title “Economic Psychologist” used as yet. The few writers who are paying serious attention to the study of human behaviorism and its influence upon economic trends refer to themselves as sociologists, economists, or psychologists. However, it is evident from studies and papers presented in recent years—and from the surveys of consumer intentions and attitudes which have been conducted for the Federal Reserve Board—that the field of economic psychology is one in which serious concentration will be focused in coming years. In Psychological Analysis of Economic Behavior,22 Professor George Katona asserts that “economic developments without regard to people’s perceptions of them and reactions to them do not suffice for a full understanding of cyclical fluctuations.” This, of course, is the running theme of our discussions. It is not enough for us to know the statistical setup of the moment—or even the probable statistical outlook. We need more importantly (1) to know how consumers and businessmen look upon (react to) these statistical reports and probabilities, and (2) we then need to consider a contrary opinion on trends thus commonly accepted. Perhaps one of the significant facts one learns as he studies this new “science” of economic psychology is that factors which influence people at one time may have little effect upon them at another. Also, it may be said that people tend to remember the most recent similar experience, and are prone to forget causes with a different result of a prior time. Because of the pronounced postwar depression during 1920-21, there was general expectancy for a similar severe slump after World War II. Yet, looking back, one notes it was entirely overlooked that a wild boom and inflation took place (1919) before the postwar depression and deflation occurred. Moreover, it is informative to recall that the inflation-boom of 1919 was universally unanticipated, an immediate slump then being predicted as it was in 1945-46. Today, we are beginning to be fed economic nostrums that are… ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1201))

- AN HISTORIC RETURN TO GOLD ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1242))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Because of the growing interest in sound money versus the skidding dollar of recent years, it is informative to turn back to another era when the United States left the gold standard—and to note the contrary occurrence when we returned to gold in 1879. In February, 1862, the first issue of “greenbacks” was released. We deserted the gold standard “to finance the war” and did not return for seventeen years. (It is now about twenty years since F.D.R. took us off gold for the second time.) Greenbacks fluctuated wildly, sinking at one time to thirty-three cents in terms of gold. Parity with gold was not reached until December 17, 1878—a fortnight before “resumption” of the gold standard was to be effected. There were widespread fears as the resumption date of January 2, 1879, drew near. Many expected to see a “run” on gold, with greenbacks piled counter-high in banks as people demanded gold for their paper dollars. All fears were groundless. Contrary to the expectations of many groups the government actually gained gold on the first day of resumption. When folks found they could get the gold, they didn’t want it! Paper was easier to carry in their pockets. This report from the New York Tribune, of Friday, January 3, 1879, gives us a “feel” of the times: Resumption of specie payments was formally accomplished yesterday. The United States Sub-Treasury could not get rid of gold, and its receipts exceeded payments by $268,000… The event was celebrated by a National salute and the display of flags from Government and financial buildings. On Saturday, January 4, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle commented that the nation had “quietly passed into a new commercial condition.” Thus closes the history of war finances [added the Chronicle]. It is useless to say at this time that these issues [the green- backs] were unnecessary, that the nation might have conducted the war without paying so dearly for it. All we are interested in knowing today is that, having been issued, and having passed through the various stages of depreciation with constant fluctuation for 17 years, we are at length once again safely anchored upon a fixed standard and subject in all respects to the universal law of value… Next worry was the fear that an outflow of gold to Europe would exhaust the reserves to a point where free convertibility might be in doubt. The recovery in security prices in the first half year of 1879 invited selling of American securities by foreign holders. This took gold across the ocean. However, fortuitous circumstances saved the situation for the United States. While our grain crops were the largest on record, those of England, France, Austria, Germany, and Russia were the poorest in years. Our huge supplies of grains saved Europe from famine—and, at the same time, reversed the flow of gold. This assured the success of resumption. With rising prices and renewed confidence, general activity set in which carried forward with a welcome burst of prosperity.… ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1243))

Our huge supplies of grains saved Europe from famine—and, at the same time, reversed the flow of gold. This assured the success of resumption. With rising prices and renewed confidence, general activity set in which carried forward with a welcome burst of prosperity. Revival from the long depression of 1873-78 was thus abetted by “gold.” ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1250))

- MUCH TO LEARN As we go along with the study of the Theory of Contrary Opinion we find that we have much to learn about its application. When to be contrary? What intensity of general opinions should we look for? How to measure opinions? These are a few of the questions always confronting us. However, we need not be too discouraged, it seems to me, because the whole field of economics remains a “guessy” one. Little, if any, progress has been made over the years in attaining profitable accuracy in economic forecasting. And, mind you, this condition still exists, notwithstanding the extraordinary volume of statistics that are now available to students and which were not known to former forecasters. It seems to me that the long history of economic forecasting clearly demonstrates that “psychology” is the missing key. You may have all the statistics in the world at your fingertips, but still you do not know how or when people are going to act. Accordingly, the statistics frequently lead you astray. Long years ago John Stuart Mill said that “crisis is not a matter of the purse, but of the mind.” ([Location 1311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1311))

- ON PREDICTING THE UNPREDICTABLE A basic usefulness of contrary opinions is to guard against predicting the unpredictable; or, to put it another way, to avoid being ensnared by faulty general predictions. Having concentrated for many years on the study of the Theory of Contrary Opinion (and having put my thoughts on paper) , I believe it is correct to say that the theory is more valuable in avoiding errors in forecasting than in employing it for definitive forecasting.

- Forecasting the economic future means forecasting decisions on investment and consumption that are as uncertain as the whole future… What leads to the maldistribution of demand—called the business cycle—is that the majority of entrepreneurs are at times too optimistic or too pessimistic; that they either invest too much and too soon, or too little and too late….

- THEORY OF CONTRARY OPINION HINGES ON LAWS OF IMITATION AND CONTAGION The writer wishes again to mention Gabriel Tarde’s The Laws of Imitation. It is too bad this important book is so difficult to turn up in secondhand bookshops, but a few libraries have it, of course. Professor Giddings’ introduction to Tarde tells us that Tarde’s philosophical theories and creativeness came not only from keen observation but from too much solitude and patient reflection.” Most of us can’t stand being alone more than half an hour, and our idea of reflection is merely to reflect and repeat what someone has told us! (We’re imitators, that is.) Described as a born student of human nature, Tarde was persistently interested in “the oldest of philosophical problems—the explanation of motive.” He perceived not only that motive may be resolved in terms of belief and desire, but also that it can be measured. Imitation is, indeed, a powerful motive (as Tarde demonstrates). Closely allied with it is “contagion,” so comprehensively discussed by Gustave Le Bon in his several books, The Theory of Contrary Opinion hinges on these “laws” of imitation and contagion. It is therefore suggested that we keep these two “social ideas”constantly in mind, and occasionally to reflect on their potency as motivators of crowd behavior. Tarde contends that there is no logical “separation” between the voluntary and involuntary, between the conscious and unconscious, imitation of ideas or acts. If one unconsciously and involuntarily reflects the opinions of others, or allows an action of others to be suggested to him, he imitates the idea or act—just the same as if he deliberately or knowingly borrowed the ideas or copied the acts. Tarde also reminds us that “there are two ways of imitating, as a matter of fact; namely, to act exactly like one’s model, or to do exactly the contrary…. Nothing can be affirmed without suggesting, no matter how simple the social environment, not only the idea that is affirmed, but the negative of this idea as well.” How quickly come to mind the numerous social controversies of the present and the past twenty years, in this two-way respect. So we have to consider both imitating and counter-imitating when considering our significant social and economic questions. However, it is important to bring out that counter-imitating arises from direct imitating in that “leadership” is present in the contrary action. As an example, a labor group may take an exactly contrary course to a trend in industry although the trend is being imitated by business generally. Yet, the “counter imitation” within labor circles is initiated by the leaders. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1463))

- Business organizations have become too large for individual management. We have entered the era of group management. Mass conformity has, naturally, gone along. However, one of the connective problems, for us contrarians, is to ponder this thought: May it not be that cyclical movements will be of greater (rather than lesser) intensity in the future, because of this development of mass conformity?

- One objective in the Theory of Contrary Opinion is to anticipate by being contrary. I use the word “anticipate” here in the dictionary sense of “consider or mention before the proper time.” Please note there is an important distinction between “anticipate” and “predict.” I look upon the theory of contrary opinion as an antidote to general predictions—through contrary anticipations—rather than as a method of definitive forecasting.

- In this connection I am asked, during a boom, this question: “Why, if you think the recovery, or boom, has further to go, do you start talking ahead of time about the slump to follow?” An excellent and pointed query. The reply hinges upon two considerations: (1) The “time element,” and (2) what we’ll term the “psychological factor.” ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1539))

- It has been my observation over a long period that it takes us average humans a considerable interval to shift our viewpoints, once we have established a given mental outlook. That is, if we have (mentally) accepted a trend as moving in one direction, we are not inclined to change our outlook until well after the trend turns. You have witnessed this phenomenon time and again, I know. However, if we adopt a contrary course and try to anticipate a change in the current, we’re more likely to recognize the signs of an approaching whirlpool or precipitous drop than if we merely assume that if the river is smooth here it must be smooth all the way. It is difficult to cope with sudden changes, especially when unexpected. You’ve heard the Wall Street expression—”He stayed too bearish (or too bullish) too long.” The other consideration—the time element—we’ve discussed so often we need not refer to it again, except to reiterate that it is practically impossible to time economic trends and events accurately. Accordingly, the contrary theory makes no bones or apologies about being “early” in anticipations. We leave the pin-point guessing to others. Indeed, I might add that if you’re not early, you’ll probably be late. ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1542))

- guessability, because-2) Government intervention in any number of economic factors—at unknown and unexpected times—completely alters the length of the measuring rod. Government may intervene in monetary and credit matters; in stockpiling of commodities; in reduced or expanded war orders; in actions or statements which affect sentiment; and in other ways. Such sudden shifts are unpredictable, obviously, as they depend upon world events, upon decisions arrived at secretly in security sessions, or upon sudden developments brought about by mass psychology. Notwithstanding these complexities, economic predictions continue to be voluminous and persistent. Likewise, they frequently continue to be something less than accurate! Because of the significant role played by government in our modern economics, it becomes increasingly necessary (in this writer’s view) to pay particular attention to business and public psychology.

- The reason the contrarian needs to be aware of history, in this regard, is because changes in trend occur before the masses are consciously observant of the fact.

- views originate. Opinions vary in accordance with the degree of thought or emotion involved. An off-hand reply to a question may be directly opposite to an opinion that might arise in an emotionally excited group, or crowd. A thoughtful opinion may be quite different from either of the others. An example of the off-hand type was noted on an interview program I listened to recently. German students were being asked various questions about living in West Berlin, how they felt about the eastern zone, and so on. The interviewer then put a pointed question to the group: “Would you fight to protect West Berlin from the Communists?” The reply of three or four of the group was unhesitating: “No,” they said in substance, “we wouldn’t go to war over Berlin.” This subjective reply—and an off-hand one—merely reflected their feelings, fears and hatred of war; emotions that have been built up in their consciousnesses since the devastation of World War II, and from their hatred of Red Russia. A war spirit is an aroused emotion. That is the distinction in this particular illustration. A government doesn’t go around quietly asking people if they wish to go to war. A series of charges against the “enemy state” is trumped up; cries against the aggressor pour forth, as the propaganda machine gets in motion. An image is fashioned in the peoples’ minds of this dangerous, armed “imperialist” who is about to take their homes and ruin their existence. In other words, foul propaganda is employed to stir up hatred against the “enemy” (who before may have been a friendly trading partner in world goods). When the emotions are kindled to a high heat the masses will actually want war, and the government can take the position that war was forced upon it, the people demanded it. Not much is needed for a discussion of the “thoughtful opinion” but I’m confident you are aware of how different a well-thought-out opinion is from one that is caught on the fly, so to speak, or one that is merely a reflection of a crowd’s fears or hopes. An individual may think out his opinions, whereas a crowd is swayed by emotional viewpoints rather than by reasoning or reason-why arguments. Emotional and thoughtless opinions spread widely from imitation and contagion. ([Location 1749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1749))

- None of us can estimate the vast amount of opinion- forming that is attempted in our reading matter. Newspapers and magazines (and privately printed “letters”) are loaded with viewpoints and impressions—some true-to-facts, a lot of it misleading, and a good deal of it misinformed or false. Propagandists of all stripes run their mimeograph machines night and day to create ideas and opinions in our minds. One editor in a large news-syndicating office told me that 90 percent of the news we read is “manufactured” by publicists, public-relations experts, and by specialists in influencing the Mind of the Crowd. The figure is no doubt exaggerated, but the condition exists to a far greater degree than readers realize. When speaking of manufactured news, don’t overlook the government agencies. Opinion-building is constantly at work in Washington, London, Paris, and in Moscow. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005DTS03W&location=1776))

- The value of the contrary approach is the opposite. It prevents one from being a dogmatist; one avoids being positive about conjectural matters; as one reads, he mentally needles the writer or commentator; finally, he is forced to make up his own mind instead of accepting the opinions of others (which likely as not are fallacious). I am confident that the chief reason the “investment advisory business” has had a poor record over the years is that writers of advisory bulletins feel compelled by client demands to be specific, dogmatic, and bold—at all times. Turn to the October, 1959, issue of Fortune if you’re interested in checking this assertion.
