## Highlights
- A postulate of a new science, psychoneuroimmunology, is that your immune system responds to your thoughts. Candace Pert, Ph.D., one of the founders of this new science, states in Emotions of Molecules that positive thoughts enhance, while negative ones hinder your immune system. Thus, you can boost your immune system by the way you think. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=144))

- The moral is that we are blessed with an efficient immune system that keeps us healthy—as long as we do not suppress it with negative thoughts. Fear, anxiety, jealousy, grudges, greed, prejudice, and hatred impede our immune system. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=158))

- Cleanse yourself of negative thoughts; bless those that have offended you. Saturate your mind with positive thoughts and stay healthy. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=160))

- Mental practice works because your subconscious mind does not know the difference between real and imagined. It doesn’t care whether you imagine something or experience it—it’s the same.  In both cases, it’s brain cells firing in a certain pattern and sequence. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=178))

- “What fires together, wires together.”  The more you practice in your mind, the more you wire the patterns for a perfect performance. So if you want to improve your golf game, increase sales, perform perfectly in front of an audience without nervousness, or design a better widget, take five or ten minutes a day to practice mentally.

- Imagination and Alpha   Last month I talked about imagination as a tool for achieving goals. Imagination has been pioneered in athletics but it can be used for almost anything. However, there is a requirement when using imagination to achieve a goal—you must be in the alpha state.  Alpha is a normal state that you go in and out of all the time but you are unaware of it. If you were to stare at the wall and daydream, you would be in alpha. You could call it your daydreamy state.   Basically, there are four states of mind: beta, alpha, theta, and delta.  Beta is the awake state where your mind is active and aware of what’s going on around you. Vigilance, thousands of years ago, and today, was imperative for survival. The brain wave frequency in the beta state is 14 cps (cycles per second) and higher.   Next in line is the alpha state where your mind slows, relaxes, and focuses on one thing rather than all that busy stuff going on around you. This is the state where it is possible to control involuntary functions, such as heart rate, body temperature, and metabolism.  We cannot control our involuntary functions consciously, but we can control them indirectly  in alpha using imagination. Brain wave frequency in alpha is 13 to 8 cps. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=197))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Slower yet is the brain wave frequency in the theta state, 7 to 4 cps. This narrow range occurs just before dropping off to sleep. It is important because it is the range where problems are solved and inspirations occur. Many discoveries have been made science, songs written, and artistic inspirations obtained in theta. Reputedly, Salvador Dali learned how to go into theta where he got those bizarre visions for his surreal paintings. Learning to go into theta is imperative for revving up your creative skills.  This will be the subject of another newsletter.   Lastly, when your brain wave function drops to a frequency of 3 and lower, you are asleep. That’s the delta state.   Back to alpha. When you are in alpha, a door to your subconscious opens. When this door is open, you can program your subconscious. If you “try” to program your subconscious in the beta state, that door is closed so you will be talking to your conscious mind. Your conscious mind is critical and analytical. When you give yourself a goal in the awake state to your conscious mind, it will come up with a dozen logical reasons why you can’t achieve it.   In sum, when you use imagination to attain your goals, be sure you are relaxed and in your daydreamy state of mind.

- Imagine improving your golf game without swinging a club, or increasing your bowling average by practicing at home in a chair.   How is this imaginable?  The key word is “imagine.”   Your subconscious mind does not know the difference between imagination and reality.  Both create ingrained neurological pathways in your brain.  When activated, the nerves stimulate blood flow and what ever is needed to achieve the goal.  These pathways are identical whether produced by physical movement or by imagined movement.

- But here is a caveat.  When you use imagery, you must be in an altered state of mind, the alpha state (as explained in the previous essay.) ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=238))

- Attitude is the key to living longer. First, as pointed out in a previous article in this newsletter, attitude affects the immune system: happy, gracious thoughts enhance, whereas negative thoughts impede your immune system. You need a healthy immune system to live a long and healthy life. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=245))

- 2. NEAT (Non Exercise AcTivies) - NEAT can be described as putting zest into every-day activities. In other words, don’t sit when you can stand; don’t mosey, walk briskly; don’t take the elevator, walk up the stairs; don’t drive around looking for a place to park next to the store, park any place and walk. NEAT improves health and results in weight loss by burning extra calories. Even if it is only a few hundred more calories a day, it adds up over time. NEAT is something most of us can do without sacrifice. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=271))

- A shocking warning was made by the professor in charge of the NEAT program: he said, “Chairs are killers.” Prolonged sitting causes bad stuff to coagulate in your blood.  Get up from your chair every hour, or sooner, and move around.

- 5.  BRAIN SIGNALS - Do you find those rare newspaper stories about a mother lifting a car off her son hard to believe? Well, this might surprise you: we are capable of strength feats way beyond what we think possible.  Our brain signals that our muscles are tired long before they really are. It does this to protect to protect us from injury by over straining. In a life-threatening situation, a distressed mother doesn’t think about injury, she just reacts.

- When you do something that makes you happy, associate it with a Happy Face image. Then paste Happy Faces in places you see every day. After a while, your conscious mind will not notice the Happy Face images, but your subconscious mind will be nudged with happy thoughts (emotions) every time a Happy Face comes in view.   Positive thoughts enhance your immune system. What have you to lose? Condition your subconscious to happy emotions. Think happy; be healthy! ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=328))

- Shaun White packed more wisdom in two sentences than can be found in some self-help books. His quote appeared in Time magazine, July 29, 2013, p 64. The quote has an important message for everyone, especially athletes at all levels.  Shaun White is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the snowboard contest.  One of his moves on a snowboard, called the Double McTwist 1260, consists of two flips with 3½ spins (Don’t try this at home—don’t even think of it!)   When asked what he is thinking at the top of a half pike waiting to do the Double McTwist 1260, Shaun replied, “At that point you’re not really thinking, you’re just letting it happen. It’s a mixture of being completely focused, then slightly not caring.”   “At that point you’re not really thinking.” He is not using his conscious mind. No one can do a complex maneuver while consciously thinking through the process. The maneuver has to be ingrained in the subconscious so it has become a habit. Habits are preformed without thinking. If Shaun had to think through of each part of the maneuver, it would be awkward and he would still be looking for a gold medal, for any medal. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=366))

- . , you’re just letting it happen.” Letting his subconscious take over and perform by habit. You cannot force your subconscious; you have to let it do what it has been trained to do.    “. . . of being completely focused, . .” Shaun is in the zone. When in the zone, a person is in the now, in the present moment. There are no thoughts of the past or future; this moment is all that exists.  It is a mental state between the awake and sleep states; a state where his mind is totally focused on one purpose. He is in the alpha state.   “. . . then slightly not caring.” Caring is a conscious mind activity. So, to let go of his conscious mind and to let his subconscious do a complex maneuver, he has to not care about the outcome. Maybe there is a trace of caring but he has developed a detached acceptance of the outcome.   I could write a book about the concepts condensed in Shaun’s quote. Come to think of it, I did.

- After winning the gold medal in the men’s Snowboarding Slope Style Event at Sochi in the 2014 Olympics, Sage Kotsenburg said, “I had this idea in my mind all day. . . . I thought about it before the run. But once you’re going into it, if you’re thinking it, you’re going to fall on your face.”   I had the idea in my mind all day.  This was a stunt he had never done so he practiced the stunt mentally. Visualization is just as effective as practicing for real because the subconscious does not know the difference between real and imagined (visualized.)  In this case, it was even better. Had he practiced for real on the mountain, he would have had to correct initial mistakes by trial and error, and it would have taken much longer to perfect the maneuver. By practicing mentally, he made perfect moves every time.   But once you’re going into it, if you’re thinking it, you’re going to fall on your face. Your conscious… ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=392))

- With all those rewards, why not meditate? I will tell you how to do TM in the next essay so you can get started. Don’t put it off—your genes are aging. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=422))

- The benefits of meditating were pointed out in the last essay. It was also evident in that I am biased because I think the Transcendental Meditation method is best choice for the average person. Its benefits have been confirmed in 350 peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals, it is simple (I’ll tell you how to do it), results are not dependent on the teacher, and beginners get benefits as soon as a week or two. Other methods, such as, staring at a candle flame, chanting in Sanskrit, or concentrating on a lotus flower, may be as effective as TM— but we don’t know if they are. I am not aware of scientific studies on other methods, nor do I know how long it takes to become proficient, or how much help you need from an adept.   Studies show that mediation helps to make a person happier, healthier, more emotionally stable, and sleep better. One reason for these benefits is that researchers found meditation reduces blood and electrical stimuli to the amygdala, an almond-shaped cluster of nerve cells in the middle of the brain. The amygdala is involved with strong primal emotions, such as aggression.  And, on the flip side, results showed that meditation stimulates regions in the brain used for decision-making, planning, and empathy. In total, this makes a convincing case to meditate.   Here’s how to do the TM method. First you need a mantra. There are three ways to get one: 1. Join the TM organization and a teacher will select a personalized Sanskrit mantra for you. 2. Select your Sanskrit mantra from the Internet. (There are several sources. Google “Mantra selection.”) 3. Make up your own mantra (Reference, The Relaxation Response, by Herbert Benson, M.D.) Benson recommends the word “One,” as an example.   Second, find a quiet area, sit in a comfortable chair, relax your body, and relax your mind. It is not always possible to find the perfect spot or time. Learn to overcome distractions so you can meditate anywhere, at any time.   Third, close your eyes and become aware of the line of thoughts moving through your mind. You can’t stop them. Don’t try. Don’t judge them, just become aware of them. Then, in you mind, gently and quietly say your mantra. The subtle interruption will divert your train of thinking momentarily, but the train will continue. As you become aware of your thoughts again, quietly say your mantra to yourself. Do not repeat your mantra in a rhythmic fashion and don’t control your thoughts. Each time you repeat this process, you will go to a slightly deeper state of mind. There are times, after you become a veteran meditator, when you may experience the sensation that you are an observer of someone thinking those thoughts (and that’s a pretty cool ah-ha.)   Twenty minutes, twice a day is recommended but do what you can. One time is better than not doing it, and even five minutes is better than zero minutes.           Self-Image   The “Like” index on my Facebook author page goes up every time the subject is self-image, and… ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=429))

- Sadly, some people are not happy with their uniqueness. They think they are not pretty, their nose is too big, their ears stick out, they are too short or too tall. They believe that if they looked like a fashion model, then they would be happy. Being pretty or handsome like a fashion model does not promise happiness. (That’s a presumption on my part because I’ve never looked like a one.)   True beauty is not physical; it is not even overt; it is something that radiates from within. You have, I’m sure, met people whose appearance did not impress you at first. But after you got to know them, sometimes for only minutes, you would describe that person as a beautiful human being. That kind of beauty is precious and it can be developed without cosmetic surgery.   Don’t waste time wishing you look like a fashion model; be thankful for your uniqueness. Affirm love in your heart until it spills over and fills the Universe, and then you will radiate real beauty. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=459))

- Happy New Year From The Genie Within   How did you do last year? Keep your New Year’s resolutions? Succeed in your goals? Good for you if you did; if you didn't, you weren't alone. This year, make your goals come true using this old, sure-fire method. It's simple, effortless, and it works. In fact, its name is, "It Works."   Write your goal on a 3” x 5” card. Be specific and state your goal in the present tense. For example:          If you want a new home, “I own a three-bedroom house with a        swimming pool.”        If you want a better job, “I am the supervisor of my group.”        If you are in school, “I graduated with an “A” average.”        If you want to learn something new, “I speak… ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=469))

- 1.  Look at the card on waking and before dropping off to sleep. In other words, look at it when you are in the alpha or theta state. The alpha and theta states are the drowsy, dreamy states between awake and sleep.         2.  Don’t look at your card during the day unless you are daydreaming. If you are in the awake state, your conscious mind will interfere.   3.  Keep it a secret. Telling another person what you intend to accomplish puts pressure on you and brings in the fear of failure.   4.  Don’t tell your subconscious mind how to do it. Your subconscious mind knows how to accomplish your goal better than your conscious mind. Your conscious mind thinks linearly and within a box, whereas your subconscious mind thinks globally and is uninhibited in putting together bits of information from a variety of unrelated fields.      5.  Don’t use any effort; effort is a conscious action. Just “let” it happen. It will. And, when it does, you… ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=480))

- I learned a lesson from this regrettable experience that, after fifty-five years, I still recall: Do not deprive a person the pleasure of giving you something. The officer was proud of giving me his gift of hospitality—treating me to dinner with his family—and in his view, I denied him that.   It is said that there is more pleasure in giving than receiving. That is true, but there can be no giving of something without someone receiving it. When someone gives you a gift, say, “Thank you,” and accept it.   Please accept my gift of this essay.

- Habit Loops   Because your conscious mind can only do one thing at a time, doing every day chores would take up most of its capacity. Nature has taken care of this by creating habits. When you do the same routine many times, the routine becomes a habit. Habits are created in your subconscious mind so they are unconscious. Then, your conscious mind is free to do something else.   Most habits are useful, like brushing your teeth and getting dressed. On the other hand, some habits, like eating too many cookies, are harmful and should be changed. That’s where new research comes in handy.   Charles Duhigg describes this research in, The Power of Habit. Researchers found that habits are composed of three parts, and these parts form a loop, aptly called Habit Loops. The three parts are: Cue, Reward, and Routine. Using the Habit Loop to break a bad habit can be described by using an example given by the author. His bad habit was going to the cafeteria every afternoon to buy a cookie, which was adding unwanted girth to his midsection.   1) His first step was to find the cue. Duhigg kept a diary of what he did in the afternoon. His diary showed that he ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=511))

- bought the cookie around 3:30 PM and by that time in the afternoon, he was bored.   2) Next, he determined what his reward was by substituting other rewards in place of a cookie. He found his real reward was not a cookie, it was the ten-minute break he took to buy the cookie.   3) Once he knew the cue and reward, he made up a new routine. At 3:30 PM, instead of buying a cookie, he took a break and socialized for ten minutes. After that, he went back to… ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=525))

- Note: The next four articles are from my book on Pickleball: The Mental Side. The subject is pickleball, a game you probably never heard of, but it doesn’t make any difference. These essays apply to any sport or physical activity.   First, One Thing At a Time   I had my first pickleball “Oops” the first time I swung a paddle; I missed the ball completely. I’m not the only person to whiff his first shot. Learning a new sport takes some time.   The first time you execute a complex motion, you talk yourself through it with your conscious mind. And, you do it one step at a time because your conscious mind can only do one thing at a time.   Recall tying your first bow. The process was unnatural and took several attempts. After you tied a bow properly a few times, the process was delegated to your subconscious mind where it became a habit.  Once it became a habit, you could tie a bow without thinking about it.   Take something more complex, like a golf swing. I was taught there are 31 elements to a good golf swing. The first… ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=534))

- When a complex task is performed by the subconscious, it is:            Easy because your subconscious can handle an unlimited number of tasks at one time,            Effortless because it’s unconscious,            Graceful because it is a unified, coordinated motion, and            Natural because you don’t have to think about it.   It’s same in pickleball, each shot has a myriad of things to think about, things like, short back swing, stiff wrist, paddle face angle, move feet, bend knees, weight on toes, push the paddle, follow through toward target, keep ball low but over the net, don’t step in the kitchen (the no-man’s land around the net) you idiot, etc.   That’s too much to think about.

- Watch Consciously; Hit Unconsciously   Your conscious mind can only do, or think of, one thing at a time, whereas your subconscious mind can literally do trillions of things at a time. It follows that smooth, coordinated (good-looking) strokes, are executed with your subconscious mind.   You have practiced your pickleball strokes until they are ingrained in your subconscious and they have become habits. Since your stokes are now habits, you don’t have to consciously think about them. All you have to do is get your conscious mind out of the way and “let” your subconscious play the ball.   Getting your conscious mind out of the way and “letting” your subconscious play the ball is not always easy. Your conscious mind has an ego that thinks it knows better, so it wants to be in control. Two “bads” happen when your conscious mind takes charge of your pickleball play.   One, you can’t play well when you are thinking, “I gotta hit a winner; Should I hit a dink or smash it? Why did I hit that last shot into the net? That was dumb; What’s the matter with me? Look at all those people watching me.”   Two, and even worse, you start thinking about winning or losing. These thoughts introduce some degree of fear—the fear of losing or the fear of being embarrassed. Any aspect of fear undermines confidence and sends your game down the tubes.   Here’s how to get your conscious mind out of the way: use your conscious mind’s limitation (i.e., that it can only think of one thing at a time) to your advantage. Keep your conscious mind preoccupied with… ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=563))

- Try Harder? Play Worse! Part 1   Ever had a night when you couldn’t get to sleep? You got frustrated and tried harder. The harder you tried to sleep, the more awake you became. Or, you were winning a pickleball match and you just missed a couple of easy shots and started losing. You vehemently urged yourself to play better. But the harder you tried to play better, the worse you played.   These examples demonstrate that the harder you try to do something or, the more you will yourself to play better:                 a) The harder it becomes to do it, and                 b) The worse you do at it.   Willing yourself to do something is a conscious process. Your conscious mind can only do one thing at a time, and it can’t directly control your involuntary muscles. Thus, you don’t play your best pickleball when your conscious mind dominates.   Your subconscious mind, on the other hand, can do trillions of things at a time without… ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=582))

- Thus, you play your best pickleball by suppressing your conscious mind, and allowing your subconscious to dominate. Pushing yourself to play better pumps up your conscious mind, thus minimizing your subconscious mind. Hence, urging yourself to play better achieves the opposite—you play worse.   Another factor, although subtle, is that when you will yourself to play better, you subconsciously introduce a fear of losing. Fear, a strong emotion, erodes confidence, and confidence is an important aspect of playing well.   Okay, suppose you’re playing in a tournament and because of the pressure, or for… ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=597))
- Try Harder? Play Worse! Part 2   You’re in a tournament and you’re playing badly. You’re ticked off at yourself. What are you going to do? Tell yourself to quit making mistakes? Will yourself to play better? Don’t bother; it won’t help; you’ll probably play worse. Instead, do the following:   1. Play in the Now. Your conscious mind thinks in the past, present, and future, whereas your subconscious only operates in the present. Since you want your subconscious to be dominant, keep your mind in the present. Don’t think about that snide remark your opponent made, or the shot you missed—that‘s the past. Don’t think about the consequences of hitting the ball long, or about winning or losing—that’s the future. Focus on the ball—that’s the now.   2. Observe. Your conscious mind is the critic; it judges, discriminates, and analyzes. Whereas, your subconscious mind accepts things literally. When you critique your strokes during a game, you bring your conscious mind to the forefront. To keep your conscious mind from taking over, don’t analyze your strokes, just observe them. If any adjustments are needed, your subconscious will make them—unconsciously.   3. Watch the ball. Think about, and keep your eyes on, the ball. You can only focus on one thing at a time with your conscious mind. Focusing on the ball blocks negative thoughts, keeps your mind in the present, and keeps your conscious mind from interfering with your subconscious mind.   4. Relax. Tension impedes court movement and thwarts good stroking. Top athletes don’t tense all their muscles while they jump, throw, catch, or stroke; only the ones needed to do the job. Any additional flexing hinders performance. So loosen up.… ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=605))

- Ten Powerful Horses   The year is 1000 BC, you live in Egypt, and you just bought a chariot pulled by ten powerful horses.  You can’t wait to show your new chariot to the townspeople.  You hop in the chariot and away you go—off the road, across planted fields, everywhere but through the town.   You realize there is only one rein and it goes to only one horse.  The other nine horses are out of control.  Your chariot is taking you places you don’t want to go, wasting time and horsepower.   The ten horses represent your subconscious mind, which is often in control of as much as 90 percent of your behavior.  You are not aware of it because that 90 percent is unconscious.    Like the nine horses without reins, your subconscious often takes you in wrong directions.  For one thing, many of the controlling programs in your subconscious were acquired in childhood.  Thus, some of them are immature and counterproductive in adulthood.     When your conscious mind and subconscious mind are at odds, your stronger subconscious mind, in the end, always wins.   For example, you decide to diet (a conscious decision) but there is a strong program in your subconscious to eat for gratification (which you are unaware of.)  You may lose weight at first but, in the end, you’ll gain it back.    Your subconscious is ten times larger than your conscious mind and, in many ways, more powerful and useful than ten horses.  A horse can’t write a poem, invent a mousetrap, help you succeed, and keep you in good health.     Your subconscious mind doesn’t sleep; it works 24 hours a day, every day.  It has a million times the computational power than your conscious mind.  It thinks globally and comes up with concepts that would be unthinkable in your rational conscious mind.    You can take control of those other nine horses; you can harness this power.  Your conscious mind is smarter and can learn to put your subconscious mind to work for you.  Learn to use this phenomenal power to achieve success in whatever you choose, be healthy, and attain peace of mind.    What are you waiting for?  There are a number of good instructional books in print.  The best book to start with is The Genie Within: Your subconscious Mind—How It Works and How to Use It.  According to 5-star reviews on Amazon.com, it is the easiest to read, to use, and most comprehensive.

- How Your Subconscious Mind Works: Is that Important?    “Hey, Alice.  Wan’na have a beer with us after work?”  Taken by surprise that her boss would invite her, Alice replied, “Not this time, I’ve got things to do.”   “What an opportunity I just missed,” Alice thought.  “A chance to know my boss better, and it wouldn’t have hurt me on the job, either.”  “Why am I so timid?”   Alice reasoned she turned down invitations and didn’t have many friends because she was too shy.  So she got some self-help books.   The Method  - The authors suggested indoctrinating her subconscious mind with her goal by writing it down and reading it as often as possible.    She wrote a good affirmation and she thoughtfully looked at it breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  After three months, she got discouraged and gave up.   Alice used a valid method to become more outgoing and friendly but her subconscious didn’t cooperate.   Have you ever failed to achieve a goal even after you thought you did everything right?   Using one of many proven methods for programming your subconscious mind is only part of the process.  The methods, by themselves, are easy.  Complex methods don’t work and you would  give up on them anyway.   The Secret-  To succeed, you must know a thing or two about how your subconscious mind works.  There is so much to know I could write a book about it.  (Oh, I did.)  Here is just a smattering of why “how it works” is critical.   No. 1  The most important how-to for planting your goal in your subconscious is getting your conscious mind out of the way by going into an altered state of mind.  No, that’s not quirky; it’s natural. You go in and out of altered states all the time.   One way to do this is to daydream.  It’s also called being in “alpha.” When you are in alpha, the door to your subconscious mind is open. Slip back to the awake state and that door closes.   Moreover, your awake mind contains your critical faculty, and it can come up with all kinds of reasons why you will fail.  Thus, you thwart your affirmation with constant critiquing.   No. 2   Another key is “double mindedness.” A strong concept in your subconscious mind always overpowers your will, which is in your conscious mind.  Your subconscious mind trumps your conscious mind because it is ten times larger and has millions times more computational power.

- How About You? -  What over-powering concepts are in your subconscious mind?  Are they in conflict with your conscious wishes?  You really don’t know.  Don’t forget, your subconscious is unconscious; it’s hidden from you!     If you have a concept in your subconscious mind that believes you are shy, and therefore, not popular, that’s the… ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=710))

- Do You Have a Clue What’s in Your Subconscious Mind?       Go ahead, tell me, “What’s in your subconscious mind? What concepts does your subconscious mind hold to be true? What programs, acquired at a very early age, dictate your behavior? Why is your personality the way it is?” Stumped? Never thought about it? Why should you? The stuff in your subconscious mind is out of your conscious awareness, right? Thus, it is not important. You can’t do anything about it anyway, right?   If you believe this, you are among the majority. Most people don’t think about their subconscious mind: they don’t care. After all, what a person doesn’t know about her or his subconscious mind won’t hurt, right? As long as they are sane, what’s in their subconscious mind is not important. Their, sane, rational, conscious mind is in control!   Wrong! Your conscious mind is NOT in control most of the time. Scientists who study the mind tell us that as much as 95 percent of our behavior and the decisions we make stem from the subconscious mind, not the conscious mind.   Yeah, I know what you are (consciously) thinking. I thought the same thing until I learned better. You’re thinking, “But I am consciously aware of what I decide and my behavior is what I consciously want it to be. I am conscious of these processes.”   You are thinking that thought with your conscious mind, but that’s the 5 percent. The truth is that the other 95 percent is in control most of the time and you are unaware of it. The strong emotional mind, which comprises around 90 percent of your total brain, not the puny 10 percent that you are conscious of, is in control.   Your subconscious mind is a goal-seeking computer. (For an explanation, see pp. 62-72, The Genie Within: Your Subconscious Mind.) Your subconscious mind constantly works to achieve the goals that it is given.   Are you in control of these goals? Did you consciously make up all of your goals and concepts? Are you making sure that your subconscious mind is seeking new goals that are your choice? Goals that are beneficial to you? Or, is your subconscious mind seeking goals that were picked up from others, and are still being picked from others–parents (living or deceased), teachers, relatives, friends, strangers and, yes, especially, TV (see pp. 138-145, The Genie Within: Your Subconscious Mind.)   To quote someone who knew a thing or two about… ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OYR0BEU&location=716))
