## Highlights
- Oil prices are prone to wild boom and bust swings because demand and supply are notoriously insensitive to prices. Gasoline and diesel are must-have commodities that are essential for modern life and for which there are few scalable substitutes. And on the supply side, oil has high upfront capital costs, long lead times, and relatively low operating expenses. Equilibrating supply and demand for inelastic commodities like oil requires very large price swings. And when wars, pandemics, natural disasters, and economic turbulence trigger big supply-demand imbalances, the resulting oil price swings are larger and more jarring.

- As early oil historian Norman Nordhauser wrote, the history of oil can be viewed as a “quest for stability.”1 The only practical solution, as noted above, is supply management. That entails a group of oil producers continually pouring over supply, demand, inventory, and price data, attentive to any signs of excessive and destabilizing imbalances. When supply-demand imbalances threaten to emerge, they must proactively—and usually collectively—adjust supply up or down to nip big price swings in the bud. Oil companies have tried to tame prices by collectively managing supply since the inception of the modern oil era in 1859. Most attempts quickly failed due to internal mistrust and external competition. In over 150 years, only three supply managers achieved durable success: (1) John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil; (2) the Texas Railroad Commission, in conjunction with other oil states, the federal government, and major international oil companies; and (3) OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia. As history has shown, and AlMuhanna’s book ably explains, the burden on supply managers is heavy. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=91))

- They must grapple with flawed and incomplete data and reconcile varying views about inherently uncertain future oil supply and demand. They must establish and enforce rules and norms to prevent free-riding and minimize distrust. Because oil is very political, the views of national leaders often influence supply decisions. Supply managers must push back, urging leaders to sacrifice autonomy and market share by reducing oil output for the sake of price stability. And they must invest in expensive but unused spare production capacity in case it is needed to address unexpected tightness. When they succeed at stabilizing oil prices, supply managers are largely taken for granted and ignored. But when booming or busting oil prices roil economies and markets, they become the villains of a startled and annoyed public.

- Before I joined the Saudi Ministry of Energy in 1989, I had no interest in oil. I thought it was dull and static. After I got involved, my thinking gradually changed, and I discovered two things. First, the oil market is very dynamic. It keeps changing and changing, not only by the year and by the month but even by the day. It is also subject to political, economic, and even weather-related surprises. Second, the oil market is a multidimensional subject in which market fundamentals, the environment, other sources of energy, politics, the media, rumors, companies, oil experts and analysts, official statements, and the psychology and beliefs of decision makers are all important. But what is critical is the way that these factors interact with each other, with no clear-cut beginning or end. It is an ongoing circular process. Within this context, information, personality, and psychology are all important. This includes elements such as perception, misperception, and negative or positive sentiments at any given moment in time. Decision makers, with the intricacies of personality, information, and background, are significant players in these situations, and they are the subject of this book.

- Oil has a critical role to play as a source of energy in the future of global economy. Two directions seem possible in the next twenty or thirty years. In one direction, oil remains an important part of our economic base; demand for oil continues to rise, driven by economic growth, population growth, and the need for a better life, especially in developing and emerging economies. The second possibility is an energy transition based on political desires in which oil, gas, and coal use are gradually reduced and exchanged for an increased use of renewables such as solar, wind, and even nuclear. This transition is not going to be easy, and it is likely to lead to significant changes in industries, businesses, and investment directions, and to changes in the global economy, politics, and the national interests of all countries. Some unprepared countries, especially poorer ones and small oil exporters, are likely to suffer more than others. We should be prepared for a lot of energy uncertainty in the coming decades, and the role of decision makers, regardless of the direction the world might go, will be more important than ever.

I was continually amazed at how individual decision makers can and do shape events and trends, a subject that has not been properly studied and has not received enough attention. I hope that sharing these insights will further our collective ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=345))

- Oil is the most versatile source of energy ever discovered. It is easy to transport, easy to store, and has a variety of uses. Reserves are huge and keep growing despite fears, now discounted, that production is peaking. In addition to its use in power generation and manufacturing, oil has paved the way for an unparalleled expansion in the last hundred years in modes of transportation, especially road and air travel. Its uses include fertilizers and petrochemicals, which are an essential part of modern life. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=355))

- Individual adventurers, entrepreneurs, and all-powerful heads of oil companies dominated the oil industry for more than one hundred years, but their influence has declined in recent times. Today oil companies work in a more structured environment, and company boards, shareholders, accountants, engineers, finance directors, and lawyers all work together to make the company successful. So we turn to the next figures in the evolution of oil management: political leaders who, more than any other group, have dominated or influenced the oil market for the last fifty years.

- It is interesting to note that OPEC was created in part as a reaction to the decision of one individual within the major oil-consuming countries: Standard Oil of New Jersey’s chairman Monroe Rathbone, who unilaterally cut oil prices in 1959 and 1960.

- Decision-making processes for individuals acting alone or with a small number of people are complex. Rational models and game theory, as well as psychological models (expectation, perception, misperception, and emotion), have been studied in an effort to explain and understand the behavior of decision makers at national and international levels in a political or economic context.5 In addition to rational or psychological aspects of behavior, decision makers are influenced by six factors that stand out at different times and with different individuals and political leaders who have influenced the oil sector.

- The story of the General Organization of Petroleum and Minerals (Petromin) provides an interesting case study of the role of key decision makers in national industrial development. Petromin was an important government-owned petroleum and minerals organization for more than twenty-five years, the second most important company in Saudi Arabia (after Saudi Aramco) not just in the petroleum and mineral industries but also in the economy. It was brought down ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1148))

- by a combination of mismanagement and perceived corruption. Created in November 1962 in an effort to lessen the control of foreign companies over the petroleum industry, Petromin was a homegrown Saudi national oil company responsible for refining, distributing, and marketing oil products in the kingdom and abroad. It also awarded exploration blocks outside the Aramco concession areas, such as in the Red Sea. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1151))

- When Nazer became oil minister in 1986, he was fully familiar with the scale of the problems at Petromin. Nazer formed a special team within the Ministry of Petroleum to work on restructuring the company and hired U.S. management consultants Arthur D. Little to prepare a major study and offer suggestions. As a result, Petromin was split into six core areas of business, down from eighteen, and two new gold mining companies and two oil service companies were created. An international subsidiary, Saudi Petroleum Overseas Ltd., was also established in London. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1161))

- When Ali Al-Naimi became minister in 1995, he decided to shut down Petromin, and I was a member of the committee that implemented the dissolution. By 2003, forty-one years after its birth, Petromin was dead. Although Petromin had a mixed record of accomplishment, it is one of the most important stories of the Saudi oil industry and provides insights into the kingdom’s industrial development.7 ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1177))

- On May 3, 1990, a day after an OPEC Ministerial Committee meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah and I had a private talk in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel. “The price of oil in London opened down this morning. It is strange, isn’t it?” I asked. “No, it was expected,” the minister said. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1347))

- “But you signed an agreement last night accepting a quota of 1.5 million barrels daily for Kuwait. This means that your production will go down by about three to four hundred barrels daily.” “Who said I will reduce our production? I will not.” “Then why did you sign the agreement?” I asked him. “To be nice. Out of respect for Saudi Arabia,” he replied. “If you do not honor OPEC agreements, why do you continue as a member?” “The decision is not mine; otherwise I would have left OPEC.” “But you know the geopolitics in the region are very intense,” I reminded him. “Iraq is accusing you of harming their economic interests by not adhering to your quota.” “I am not worried,” the minister quietly told me.

- The following month, the oil and energy ministers of the three countries met, but they did not agree to cuts in production. OPEC members convened in May, and ministers reached an agreement to curb production but did not make a strong commitment to adhere to quotas. Toward the end of May 1990, Saddam ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1371))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- delivered a speech at the Arab heads of state summit in Baghdad condemning Kuwait’s oil policy. In hindsight, this speech carried a strong hint that an armed conflict was about to begin. “Since 1986, we have been going through a difficult time related to the chaos in the oil market because of our brethren that are not adhering to the OPEC agreement,” he said. “Sometimes wars are fought using soldiers, and other times using economic tools. I am talking to our friends; this is a type of war against Iraq. If our skin can bear it, we will. But we have reached the point that we cannot bear it any more. We will all benefit from adhering to the OPEC agreement of production and prices.” He even quoted an Arab proverb to support his argument, saying: “Cutting incomes is much harsher than cutting throats.”1 Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and this speech highlights how politics, oil markets, and personalities are inextricably linked. The conflict is also a prime example of how ineffective communication, misunderstandings, and the misinterpretation of intentions can result in severe consequences, even between neighboring or allied countries. A number of people were involved in the events leading up to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, but Saddam Hussein and Ali al-Sabah, ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1373))

- Saddam wore a military uniform at many public appearances and considered himself a military leader although he had never served in the armed forces nor had any formal military training. He also ordered all senior government and party officials to wear military uniforms to show Iraqis that a war was on and that they should take it seriously. This is how he commanded fear and loyalty from his subjects. With this combination of personality traits, decision-making style, and mentality coupled with a total lack of checks and balances and transparency, it is hardly surprising that Saddam got himself into major conflicts without considering a way out.

- In 1980, Sheikh Ali played an important role in establishing an international oil company, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), which rapidly expanded via a number of global acquisitions across the energy value chain, including upstream, midstream, and downstream assets and oilfield services. Kuwait was the first OPEC country to create a fully integrated national and international oil company through overseas investments, and it did so eight years before Saudi Arabia and fifteen years before Venezuela.

- Sheikh Ali began as a man who cared about OPEC’s success, but he became mistrustful of the organization over time and indifferent to its fate. He also shifted his focus from defending oil prices to maintaining market share, a policy that other officials including Saudi Arabia’s Ali Al-Naimi and Venezuela’s Luis Giusti came to adopt later in their careers (chapter 4). Overall, Sheikh Ali was widely considered to be a global authority on oil and financial matters. However, he could not sense (or care about) the changing geopolitical environment in the region or Iraq’s unhappiness with Kuwait’s policies. He also did not recognize the intense frustration of other countries ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1525))

- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait yielded important lessons about the oil market. First is the fact that even though the conflict cost the international markets over four million barrels of crude oil and another half a million of refined products per day (which added up to 7–8 percent of the world’s total supply), there were no real shortages in the market and the price increases ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1723))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- were limited in terms of length in time and dollar value. Oil prices peaked in late October 1990 at over $40 and steadily declined after the start of the war in February 1991. This was partly because the invasion had already been factored into the oil price by forward-looking assessments and aggressive statements by officials of major producers, especially Saudi Arabia. When the war to liberate Kuwait began a few days later, oil traders anticipated correctly that it would not disrupt the market, and as a result, the oil price collapsed to a level that was much lower than before the invasion. The global oil markets remained stable following the invasion and the international military buildup in response to it for two fundamental reasons. First, other oil producers increased production. Saudi Arabia alone boosted output from 5.4 MBD to 8.5 MBD. The United Arab Emirates and Venezuela also increased their production. Saudi Arabia had large oil processing facilities equipped to handle even greater production increases. There was a pipeline project in place, gas separation plants, storage units, and export facilities that together could handle up to 14 MBD of oil exports from the Arabian Gulf region alone. Within three months and against all expectations, Aramco mobilized teams that were able to ramp up production to more than 8.5 MBD.29 ([Location 1726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1726))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The second reason for the relative stability of the oil market was the close coordination between the officials of the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and the U.S. Department of Energy. Other agencies in both countries also worked together under the auspices of the Energy Technical Committee, which was created in 1989 between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The committee built personal relationships between officials of the two allies and facilitated communications between both upper- and midlevel government officials immediately after the invasion and the outbreak of war. These personal relationships proved to be very useful. Within a week or two of the invasion, the two governments were exchanging information and ideas daily about energy-related matters, including oil markets and prices. They also issued coordinated statements aimed at bringing down prices and preventing panic in the market and dismissed rumors, speculation, misinterpretations, and other forms of information that could lead to uncontrollably high oil prices. The oil market, too, was in shock over the sudden loss of 4 MBD of production, a gap… ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1736))

- by a single dollar because the country’s oil exports were immediately blocked. Saudi Arabia generated a large increase in oil export revenues because of the combination of higher prices and increased production, but this was more than offset by the cost of the war, payments to the United States for its military involvement, and other ancillary costs. Other countries, especially Iran, benefited greatly from the war in every way, including the ability to increase oil production and generate record revenues. Modern history shows that major military conflicts or revolutions—particularly wars that involve nations in major oil-producing regions such as the Middle East—have led to structural changes in the oil market. Notable examples include the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the Iranian revolution, the war between Iran and Iraq, and the Venezuelan oil strike of 2002. These conflicts directly affect oil facilities in some countries and lead to changes in the general petroleum status quo. They also influence the roles of key decision makers such as heads of… ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1746))

- Saddam’s goal was to have had Iraqi production similar to that of Saudi Arabia (about 5 MBD at that time). 2. Kuwait lost production of nearly 1.5 MBD of oil, and its overall 2.0 MBD capacity was damaged when oil wells were torched by the retreating Iraqi troops. It took Kuwait about a decade to recover its oil-production capacity. 3. Saddam’s decision to invade Kuwait contributed, directly or indirectly, to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which ended the Iraqi president’s hold on power. This created a power vacuum that led to the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and bolstered Iranian influence over Iraq (and later Syria). 4. Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah lost his job, and his achievements were quickly forgotten. He was placed under investigation following accusations of corruption and was not able to recover his previous stature despite repeated attempts to regain prominence through his own Kuwaiti newspaper and TV channel. The six months leading to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait provide a salutary lesson in diplomacy.

- Al-Naimi saw that some ministers did not adhere to their quotas nor cut their production to the agreed levels, and Al-Naimi believed Saudi Arabia should do the same, without necessarily making it known. The behavior of Venezuela and others in 1997–1998 exemplified this behavior. Venezuela was not only overproducing but was making this known publicly. Nigeria, Algeria, and Qatar were also overproducing and followed Venezuela’s example. At the time, Venezuela was producing 1 MBD above its quota, a violation of around 30 percent. Saudi Arabia was also producing around 400,000 barrels per day over its 8 MBD quota, ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=1909))

- Three interrelated events affected the oil market in the last two months of 1997 and in the following year: a slowdown in some Asian economies, overproduction by some OPEC members, and the decisions that had been taken by OPEC in Jakarta. The economic and financial problems came to be known as the Asian financial crisis and began in the second quarter of 1997 in Thailand. By the middle of that year, the country’s currency (the baht) had shed about half of its value, and the stock market had lost about 75 percent of its value. The International Monetary Fund, with a bailout package of more than $20 billion, was hoping to contain the problem and stop it from spreading to other countries. However, that did not work. Within a few months, the downturn spread to other Asian countries, first Indonesia, then the Philippines, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Japan.

The U.S. economy saw some slowdown, and on October 27, two weeks before the OPEC Jakarta meeting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 554 points (7.2 percent), the largest one-day drop in the history of this index.

- fundamental and psychological levels. In early 1997, the IEA had estimated global oil demand growth for the year to be more than 2 MBD. In early November, three weeks before the OPEC meeting, the IEA revised its estimate down to around 1 MBD. Added to that was a shift in market psychology amid growing fears about the health of the global economy. Fear and uncertainty about the future continued into 1998, and that uncertainty negatively affected the price of many commodities, especially oil, in the futures markets. Analysts also believed that bad decisions were made in Jakarta, and the ensuing debate in the aftermath of Jakarta added to this negative sentiment.

- participants such as traders, hedge fund managers, and oil analysts. Market sentiment is very important, and even though it is not measurable, you know it when you see it. The Saudi Ministry of Petroleum had good information about oil market fundamentals and understood the importance of market psychology, sometimes using it to Saudi Arabia’s advantage by creating uncertainty and then managing it. In Jakarta, the decision was taken without consideration of these factors. The goal was simple and straightforward: challenge Venezuela, legitimize what OPEC was producing, and divide the total increase pro rata. Walid Khadduri, the editor of MEES and a highly respected writer and oil analyst said of the decision, “We were sitting in the lobby as journalists and we were all shocked by the decision. I mean really shocked. I remember the face of the oil company people turned when they heard the news.”14 ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=2001))

- two factors: personality traits and information. Venezuela’s Giusti was determined not to allow OPEC or any other party to constrain his country’s increasing production, and Al-Naimi was unhappy that Giusti and Venezuela were running the show. The other important factor was the role of information. Conflicting views were circulating, and the available information was at times vague and confusing. Twenty years later, I asked el Badri why he went along with Al-Naimi’s proposal even as the Asian economic slowdown was looming He replied: “At that time we did not have good information.”19 Leonardo Maugeri, the scholar and strategist for Eni, had a good explanation regarding the information issue: “The actual levels of major producers’ output capacity were more a matter of careful speculation than empirical certainty. In this situation, the risk of ‘missing barrels’—i.e., of underestimating or overestimating demand or supply—was always present. In 1997–1998 the risk materialized.”20 One year after the Jakarta meeting, the recently appointed Kuwaiti oil minister, Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, called the decision a “disaster.” He added that “the conference legitimized the race among the countries to increase production and to exceed their quotas. . . . What happened in Jakarta was the worst-ever in the history of the Organization.”21 The experience of the Jakarta meeting illustrates clearly how two hard-headed men, Giusti and Al-Naimi, ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=2077))

- Naimi, were able to create a new direction in the international oil market. After Jakarta, the oil price began a steady decline that continued for about eighteen months. Equally important were the political and economic consequences of that decision, which persist to this day in some countries. On his way home after the Jakarta meeting, Al-Naimi was asked about the conference. He said, “We consider this conference to be the paradigm shift in the history of OPEC.”22 He was right, but not in the way he had expected.

- That was the beginning of higher oil prices, a trend that would continue for about nine years.

Chavez also had a direct impact on the Venezuelan oil industry, the international oil market, and on OPEC policy for about five years. Chavez is a good example of my thesis that the personality of the leader matters in bringing about policy changes, and this applies to the oil sector as much as any other. The policy changes began immediately after the election of Chavez and will most likely be felt for some years to come. The damage to Venezuela’s oil industry since 2002 can be seen in the numbers: oil-production capacity declined from 3.5 MBD in 2000 to less than ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=2445))

- Saudi Arabia’s policy was to make sure oil prices did not get out of control, and the kingdom was committed to doing what it could to bring prices down. This policy serves Saudi Arabia’s long-term interests as well as its relationships with customers and political allies such as the United States. OPEC had a similar policy and monitored oil prices to avoid harm to the global economy. Bush was focused on oil prices and U.S. politics during an election year. The following weeks saw a further increase in the price of oil despite higher Saudi production and the many positive statements coming from Riyadh and other oil-producing countries.

- The second interesting meeting was with Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the IEA. Saudi oil officials disagreed with the IEA’s estimate of Saudi’s production capacity. The IEA claimed it was only 10 MBD, but the Saudis insisted it was 11.3 MBD. The Saudis believed that reports casting doubt on its production capacity were partially to blame for the higher oil prices, and their argument was very simple: “We have no reason to lie.” The Saudis argued that their estimate was done by highly respected petroleum engineers, mostly educated in the United States and trained by Saudi Aramco, and that their work had been tested in 1990 in more difficult times when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Energy analysts and organizations in Paris, Vienna, New York, and London could not have better estimates because they were not directly involved in the assessment of Saudi production capacity. The Saudis also asked why the IEA continued to publish numbers it was not 100 percent sure were accurate that were not good for market stability and contributed to higher oil prices. The IEA stated that its analysts had good sources and that they had a different definition of production capacity.

- Sometimes market sentiment plays a larger role than policy makers, speculators, and analysts because the oil market has its own logic. At other times, the market moves in response to an unexpected development unrelated to current policy conflicts. For example, as the Jeddah meeting was reassuring the market and Saudi Arabia agreed to increase production and production capacity, an attack on Nigerian oil facilities led to a 300,000 B/D fall in production. Within three weeks of the Jeddah meeting, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil shot up, hitting a record high of $147 on July 11, 2008, and a well-known financial institution predicted that the price could rise to $200 or even higher, which stoked market fears.

- Instead, however, the rise above $140 was the beginning of a free fall. The global economy faced one of the most significant financial and economic crises in eighty years, and this affected both the fundamentals and the psychology of the oil market. The subprime mortgage crisis began in the United States in 2007, but nobody took any notice at first. The collapse of Lehman Brothers, a major U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, created shock waves in the financial system including in the oil market. Some banks, the U.S. auto industry, and other major industries came very close to collapse, and the U.S. government had to intervene to save banks and industries either through bailouts or asset purchases. The contagion spread to the rest of the U.S. economy and then to the global economy, which began shrinking in a big way. The recession was unprecedented. The U.S. government, other Western countries, and some international financial institutions admitted that speculation and weak financial regulations were responsible for many of the problems in the economy, including the price of commodities such as oil. One of the most important international developments that resulted from the 2008 financial crisis was the call for heads of state of the G20 nations, comprised of nineteen countries and the European Union, to take action. It was an indirect admission that the ([Location 2913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=2913))

- IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, along with the G7, were not capable of managing major international economic problems. The first G20 heads of state meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in mid-November 2008. As a major oil producer, Saudi Arabia was invited to be part of the group. It was a clear admission of the importance of Saudi Arabia’s role in stabilizing the oil market and the global economy. The oil market was facing major problems simultaneously. Sentiment was negative, fundamentals were clearly bad, and the future looked bleak. After Bush’s visit and the Jeddah meeting, total OPEC production increased by one million barrels daily in the first half of 2008. Commercial inventories were building gradually, but demand was falling. For the first time since 1982, global demand for oil fell in 2008 and 2009. The decrease was more than 1.5 MBD from the 2007 level. Equally bad was the release of mistaken information about the oil market from important sources such as the IEA. One report stated that the increase in Chinese… ([Location 2923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=2923))

- Certainly, oil prices were also driven up throughout July 2008 by psychology; what professor Robert Shiller of Yale describes as “Contagious excitement about investment prospects.” It was almost like bets in a poker game, with a $200 prediction being raised by a $250 prediction, which would in turn be raised by a $500 prediction. It was all self-reinforcing, creating its own reality.7 The same psychological factors again affected falling prices at the end of July.

- $30 by year’s end. It is important that we learn from these experiences so similar crises do not arise in the future. First, global leadership is important to correct mistakes and to change course, and creative ideas and new initiatives may be needed, including new institutions. In the oil market, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Gordon Brown of Great Britain came up with the idea of calling for the Jeddah meeting and a follow-up meeting in London to calm the market and find a solution to the high oil price. In the global economy at large, the U.S. president George W. Bush called for a G20 summit in 2008 to establish a new framework of international cooperation to deal with economic issues, including oil. Second, information and the way it is interpreted is crucial. Knowledge of facts can help decision makers and can influence market direction. Although the role of information had been clear for many decades, its importance was never as obvious as it was in 2008. Information about the oil markets came from more than fifty sources: major banks, oil companies, think tanks, consultants, and energy and nonenergy international organizations. The governments of some oil-producing and oil-consuming nations had their own data. In the United States, more than five federal government departments collected their own information but did not necessarily coordinate with each other.

- the oil market, the most quoted information comes from the IEA, OPEC, and the EIA, but major banks such as J. P. Morgan, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs sometimes have an impact on market direction.10 How good are they? That is anybody’s guess. Certainly, they borrow from each other and compare notes. They may have an economic/statistics model of supply and demand, including their base of prediction, but they rarely have new original information. For example, for a couple of months in 2010, Saudi’s actual production was higher by about one million barrels daily than what the secondary sources had noted.11 Nobody, including OPEC, the IEA, and the EIA, seemed to notice this or change the supply balance. Equally as important is the interpretation of data, which is not a purely mathematical exercise; an element of personal bias or political and economic interests are often inserted. Before the financial crises and the collapse of oil prices, many U.S. and British officials, and even some oil analysts and journalists, were blaming fundamentals for the higher oil price and dismissing the role of speculators and hedge funds. Within a few months, their opinions had shifted. The market moves based on both fundamentals and sentiment. At times of crises and uncertainty, sentiment overshadows fundamentals and influences the behavior of financial investors in the oil market. Information and the way it is interpreted is responsible to a great degree for creating positive or negative sentiment. These facts were clear in 2008. At the beginning of the crisis, for example, all the talk was about production capacity and declining Saudi and global production and reserves. Also, international banks are buyers and sellers of oil futures contracts for themselves or for their clients, and they have commercial interests in the oil market unrelated to the fundamentals. Third, the role of governments and international governmental cooperation are crucial in times of economic and oil market crises. When the oil price went above $120, the governments of major oil-consuming and oil-producing countries worked together to stop the market from spinning out of control. When the oil price collapsed, the oil-producing countries,… ([Location 3026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3026))

- factors pushed up the oil price in 2007 and the first half of 2008, but a major factor was strong global economic growth and the expectation that it would continue. Economic growth brings with it a strong demand for oil and creates positive economic sentiment. When the global economy faced major financial and economic crises in 2008 and 2009 and some economies were shrinking, the oil market collapsed. Part of this collapse was the direct result of economic problems, but part of it was due to expectations of continued positive global economic growth. There is also a linkage between the price of oil and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Oil is priced in dollars, and the weak dollar was one of the reasons oil prices increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008. The shadow of 2008 lingered for many years, and it affected the oil market for two years. In 2009, demand was still on the downward trend that had started in 2008. Nearly all countries experienced negative economic growth, with the exception of some OPEC producing states, China, and a few Asian countries.

- with him to achieve the desired results. They also had good working relationships with the OPEC secretary-general Abdalla el Badri of Libya. Some OPEC ministers stayed on the margins during that period. They included the Venezuelans, the Iranians, and the Iraqis. Their standing in OPEC was weakened because of their extreme policies and their lack of excess production capacity. In addition, Iran and Iraq did not fully adhere to their quotas, which did not help the effort to balance the market. The president of Iran at that time was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was the most radical and extreme nationalist leader since the Iranian revolution of 1979. The prime minister of Iraq was Nouri al-Maliki, who was part of the Shiite Dawa Party, which has close ties to the Iranian religious and political establishment. Both presidents had poor working relationships with other OPEC countries, except Venezuela. Venezuela’s quota at the time was much higher than its actual production because of its declining production capacity. For 2009, OPEC was able to reduce its actual production from 2008. The successive cuts agreed on by OPEC that year totaled 4.2 MBD. According to OPEC secondary sources, the percentage of reduction varied from one country to another. Iraq was the only member to increase its production. Reductions from Iran were 3.3 percent. The cuts were around 10 percent for Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The highest cuts were 12 percent for Algeria and Libya. Production declines also occurred in some non-OPEC countries for a variety of reasons. By the middle of 2009, the oil price began a gradual recovery. In November 2009, I was with Minister Al-Naimi on an official visit to China, a major buyer of Saudi Arabian crude oil. During that visit, it became clear that the IEA’s data and other sources on China had been incorrect.13 With the growth in China’s consumption and demand for energy, and with oil prices recovering, Al-Naimi asked Aramco to increase its production quietly and gradually. By mid-2010, Saudi production reached 9 MBD, although some secondary estimates were around 8.2–8.3 MBD. Saudi Arabia’s policy has been to make sure that there was no shortage in the global market and to meet its customers’ demand provided it did not have a negative… ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3059))

- The market was generally well supplied and well balanced, but geopolitical factors, especially Israel’s threat to take action against Iran over its nuclear program, were affecting the oil market. Some experts were talking about limited or nonexistent production capacity, but it was not fundamentals that were driving prices higher. The second part of the plan was related to market psychology or sentiment. An international campaign was needed to convince the market that the oil price was very high (a policy referred to as talking the market down). This suggestion was based on the belief that perception and the psychology of the market are important factors, and occasionally are more important than the fundamentals. The market was in a negative mood about almost everything, which was pushing prices higher, and changing the mood to a positive one could lead to lower oil prices. In my opinion, six important players are able to influence market direction, one way or another: 1. International business media, particularly specialized energy publications. It is not only what is reported but also the way events are reported, such as the people who are quoted, the news headlines, and news alerts.2 2. Oil experts and analysts, whether independent or part of a large organization. IHS Markit and PIRA Energy Group, for example, interpret events and information and predict the direction of the oil market and oil prices, which influences the futures market. 3. International energy organizations, especially the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC. These information warehouses publish monthly reports about the international oil market that are widely quoted, and their estimates on supply and demand and commercial stocks influence the oil market and its behavior. 4. Hedge funds and commercial banks. These players take positions in the oil futures market (long and short), expecting high or low oil prices. Their positions are based on their own in-house information and analysis as well as information from public and private oil officials and experts. 5. Government officials from major oil-producing and oil-consuming countries. Whether speaking publicly or privately, what they say can, and does, have a strong influence on the direction of oil prices, especially when inside information or new policy trends are discussed.

- 6. Major oil companies (national or international), including oil trading companies. Most of these companies have extensive internal analyses but do not like to discuss the oil market publicly. They don’t want to be quoted, nor do they typically reveal their information, expectations, and position in the market. Nevertheless, when their information is leaked or given to a limited number of people in a confidential way, they can influence the market and its direction. All six of these players influence each other by exchanging information, interpretation, and opinion, directly or indirectly. Therefore, if a large number of these players can be convinced, the market at large will move. That was our thinking in the Ministry of Petroleum. We formed a small team of highly qualified people who understood the market and had good relationships with various players in the international oil market. They were respected, and their information and analysis was trusted by large segments of the market (including the six players mentioned previously). Al-Naimi explained that their mission was to help stabilize the oil market and to bring oil prices down. They accepted their mission because they believed that high and uncontrolled oil prices were not good for Saudi Arabia, especially in the long term.

- (Saudi Arabia’s reserves could continue to produce oil for at least another eighty years at current production levels.) Production could be disrupted either because of very high prices or because customers decided to adopt measures to reduce their oil consumption, as they did in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is one of the pillars of the first Saudi Energy Strategy, which was written by the ministry and approved by the leadership in 2000. The international campaign kicked off in London and New York, true capitals of the oil market, with two dominant oil futures exchanges (ICE and NYMEX) and home to major hedge funds and banks that trade in oil on a global scale. Major financial and energy media outlets as well as influential oil research centers (commercial and noncommercial) also reside in these two cities. Price formation and movements are largely concentrated in these two cities even though some think the market takes its daily direction from morning trade in Asia or that OPEC is the major mover of markets. The message from the Saudi team was clear: (1) The market is well balanced; (2) commercial stocks are high and going even higher; (3) Saudi Arabia has increased production and might increase it further; and (4) Saudi Arabia has the ability to increase production capacity if there is a shortage or a strong growth in demand. The goal was clear: Saudi Arabia is committed to bringing oil prices down, which is in the interest of the oil industry and the global economy. Several meetings with highly influential people were also held in Riyadh, London, and New York. The Saudi team was well-prepared, and these meetings were held quietly, either individually or with small groups of experts or media, sometimes over lunch or dinner. Representatives from the media, analysts, hedge funds, banks, and oil companies were carefully selected to ensure quality, credibility, and respect within the market. The majority began to understand that oil prices were artificially high and not supported by the fundamentals, and beliefs between the Saudi team and the international groups began to converge. Analysts and journalists who tended to publish exaggerated reports or mix… ([Location 3140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3140))

- and bad for the world’s poorest nations. A period of prolonged high prices is bad for all oil producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, and they are bad news for the energy industry more widely.” Al-Naimi went on to say the following: The bottom line is that Saudi Arabia would like to see a lower price. It would like to see a fair and reasonable price that will not hurt the global economic recovery, especially in emerging and developing countries, that will generate a good return for producing nations, and that will attract greater investment in the oil industry. It is clear that geopolitical tensions in the region, and concerns over supply, are helping to keep prices high. It is the perceived potential shortage of oil keeping prices high—not the reality on the ground. There is no lack of supply. There is no demand that cannot be met. [Oil] has transformed our lives and will continue to power the global economy for many decades to come. It will only do so if prices reach a more reasonable level—so it is in all our interests to do what we can to achieve this aim.4 The article was widely quoted all over the world.

It also explained that high oil prices were not supported by fundamentals and should be around $100 per barrel, the preferred price for Saudi Arabia, the Arab Gulf states, and many other producers. The United States and other industrialized countries indicated unofficially that $100 was acceptable. GOR also included some news items about Gulf countries. The last page had carefully selected data. The campaign was successful and helped bring oil prices down. Abdulrahman H. Al-Saeed, a former adviser in the royal court, told me he felt that King Abdullah was very pleased with the campaign and its outcome.5 Another factor that helped stabilize the markets in mid-2012 was the growth of shale oil production in the United States, which was beating expectations. After remaining steady near 5.5 MBD during each of the first three quarters of 2011, the EIA reported that U.S. crude oil production had surpassed 6 MBD during the first quarter of 2012.

They achieved all of this despite the political, military, and petroleum tension in the region, especially with Iran. We can draw four major lessons from these events. First, Saudi Arabia is the most important oil country, not only in terms of its production/export level but also because it has credibility and is respected and trusted by others (energy experts, the media, and government officials). Second, sentiment plays an important role in the direction of the oil market.

The report was widely quoted by international media, and as a result, the price of oil rose the following day by about $7. The Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Petroleum, and Saudi Aramco officials all denied the report, but the oil price did not drop by much once the facts became known and it became clear that the Iranian reports were false. This is an interesting case of the relationship between the oil market, the media, and sentiment. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3225))

- The United States is a petroleum country par excellence. Since commercialization of oil in the mid-nineteenth century, the United States has been the largest oil producer and, at times, exporter and has been the center of the international oil industry for more than 150 years. Oil has made a significant contribution to U.S. economic growth and to its status as an international power. The United States is the center of innovation in oil and energy and home to the largest international petroleum companies, energy sector services firms, investment banks, and other financial institutions that are leaders in global oil and energy investment and trading. The oil futures market was created in the United States.

- world’s largest. U.S. hedge funds and banks are major players in this market. Furthermore, oil is traded in U.S. dollars and that is unlikely to be challenged in the near future, despite many attempts to do so. When the oil price goes up, the majority of oil-producing states, such as the Arab Gulf states, invest a large part of their income in the U.S. markets. The amounts deposited are often much higher than their earnings from oil sales to the United States and normally involve both financial and physical assets: the purchase of U.S. government bonds, military hardware, and other commercial and noncommercial activities. Conflicting priorities can be found at each level of government in the United States: the federal government, oil-producing states, non-oil-producing states, and consumers of energy products. The federal government looks at the overall impact of oil prices on economic growth, the balance of payments, inflation, and the environment. The oil states—Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, New Mexico, and North Dakota—benefit from higher production and higher prices, and they lobby for lower government regulation and lower taxes on oil production. States that do not produce oil, such as Maine, New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont, tend to be unhappy about higher crude prices. And the American public does not like higher gasoline or heating oil prices, especially in states where gasoline taxes are very high.

- Through different types of taxes, local counties, the states, and the federal government benefit greatly from the oil industry, oil trading, and oil consumption. This extends to the activities of U.S. companies around the world that have global operations and related manufacturers and service and trading companies, among many other businesses. In the tenth century, the Islamic Abbasid Empire covered a large part of the world from India in the East to West Africa. Caliph Harun al-Rashid was the fifth caliph of the empire and ruled from his capital in Baghdad. It is said that he looked up at the clouds in the sky and stated that “you can rain wherever you desire, but in the end the taxes from the income you generate will end in my treasury.” This is true today to some degree of Washington and the oil industry, even though government officials and intellectuals do not like to admit it. Petroleum and American politics are tightly intertwined. On a public level, the oil industry is largely seen in negative terms, which differs from the attitude in many countries, including those that must import 100 percent of their oil needs, such as Japan… ([Location 3254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3254))

- During the five decades following World War II, many people in the U.S. oil business had a strong influence on the political establishment, at both national and state levels, especially in the oil-producing states. This kind of power is natural in a free democratic country, but the public viewed their influence in a negative way; it was generally believed that the industry was corrupt and was able to manipulate political power. The 1980s television series Dallas, about a fictional Texas oil dynasty, served to reinforce this image of the oil business as corrupt and greedy. Dallas was one of the most widely watched series in the history of U.S. television. On the international political level, the turning point for the American public, politicians, and the media took place in 1973 with the Arab-Israeli war and the Arab oil embargo. These events were blamed for the long lines at gas stations (regardless of the true reason) and increases in the price of gasoline and heating oil. Crude oil prices increased more than fivefold in a short time period, from $3.00 in 1972 to $17 in 1976.

- Arab officials were publicly threatening the West with the possibility of a further cut in Saudi production and exports. The 1973 Arab oil embargo created a lasting impression among many Americans of a worrisome dependence on Middle Eastern oil. President Richard Nixon launched Project Independence, and subsequent U.S. presidents have made reducing dependence on imported oil a top priority, especially oil from the Middle East. Equally important to the American image of oil was the Iranian revolution of 1978–1979, which reduced Iran’s production from almost 6 MBD in 1976 to about 3 MBD in 1979 and to less than 1.3 MBD in 1981. The price of oil more than doubled from 1977, reaching more than $35/BBL by 1979, and taking U.S. diplomats hostage inside the American embassy in Tehran was a major political issue for the U.S. political establishment and the public at large. Another development during the 1970s and after was the steady decline in U.S. crude oil production, from its peak of nearly 10 MBD in 1970 to 5 MBD in 2008.

When there is a shortage of international oil supply and higher prices, poor importing countries are affected more significantly than are rich countries like the U.S. When oil prices go up in free economies without price controls, everyone feels the pain equally, even if the country is an oil exporter such as the United States (currently), Norway, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In addition, during the 1970s the assumption in the United States and worldwide was that the world was running out of oil and other natural resources. A report by the Club of Rome titled “Limits to Growth” was widely circulated, and it pointed in that direction as did other reports and studies (some of which were from U.S. government agencies). No wonder every movement of crude oil and gasoline prices became a domestic political issue during election years. American politicians, as well as some activists and writers, developed slogans based more on political rhetoric… ([Location 3285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3285))

- “Reduce dependence on imported oil,” without explaining how, or what the consequences would be. 4. “Reduce dependence on oil imports from the Middle East or from unstable nations,” as if these countries were forcing American oil companies to buy oil from them absent economic or business considerations. Imagine what the reaction would be if these countries actually decided to stop or reduce their exports to the United States. George W. Bush came up with a new slogan for public consumption during the 2006 midterm election: “Some of the nations we rely on for oil have unstable governments or fundamental differences with the United States. . . . It creates a national security issue when we’re held hostage for energy by foreign nations that may not like us.”7 It is interesting to note that Iraq was under United States occupation at that time and the other Arab Gulf states were very stable and were close allies of the United States. President Donald J. Trump sent conflicting signals on oil matters to OPEC and the Arab Gulf states during the midterm elections in 2018.

It is important to differentiate between political rhetoric, conspiracies, and facts when discussing oil and U.S. politics. Beliefs in conspiracy are commonplace in the United States, in the Arab world, and beyond. There is a general belief in the Arab world, at the public level and even among some intellectuals and policy makers, that the United States dictates oil prices and production levels to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. Officials in Iran and in some other countries believe in these conspiracies and consider them to be facts.8 Furthermore, some high-ranking U.S.… ([Location 3307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3307))

- administration credit for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Weinberger claimed that Reagan and King Fahd engineered the oil price collapse in the mid-1980s to weaken the Soviet Union, which earned its hard currency from oil sales at that time. Weinberger was not alone, many Americans, and indeed even Russians, claimed this as a fact.9 This simple conspiracy idea lacks any truth or understanding of the oil market or Saudi oil policy and behavior during that period. To keep oil prices from falling, Saudi Arabia reduced oil production from about 10 MBD in 1980 to 2.5 MBD some time in 1985. When Saudi Arabia tried to regain part of its market share, it adopted a system of netback pricing, increasing production to about 5 MBD some months into 1985 without causing the oil price to collapse. In fact, the price collapsed because other OPEC producers adopted the same marking system and increased their production. King Fahd fired Minister Yamani because this policy led to the collapse in oil prices; he might not… ([Location 3317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3317))

- George H. W. Bush to Saudi Arabia to discuss bringing the price up. Before he left the United States, Bush spoke of the importance of oil “price stability.” This was interpreted as the United States wanting higher oil prices and that Bush would pressure the Saudis to take action. Some linked the visit to the newly suggested price of $18/BBL, which would help American oil companies and petroleum-producing states (such as Texas, Bush’s home state). Hisham Nazer, the minister of planning at the time, told me more than once that he accompanied Bush during his visit from the day of his arrival to the day of his departure. He also attended all the meetings with Bush and wrote a report to King Fahd about the visit and the meetings. Nazer made it clear many times that Bush never discussed the oil price with King Fahd or with any other Saudi official.10 Conspiracies aside, an important aspect of the relationship between U.S. politics and oil is linked to domestic prices of heating oil and gasoline.

Bush, and Bush was critical of the idea of using energy prices and the market for political purposes.11 However, Bush used oil prices during his second term presidential campaign as discussed previously. During the midterm election in 2018, President Trump pushed for lower oil prices—meaning gasoline—and he succeeded, but he used completely different methods. In the middle of June 2018, the oil price was about $75 and the gasoline price in the United States was more than $3.50 in some states. Trump was worried that the Republican Party might lose the majority in both houses of Congress. To deliver his messages to OPEC, Trump used Twitter many times instead of direct and confidential communications (as other presidents had).

More important, however, was Trump’s intention to force Iranian oil exports down “to zero.” The OPEC+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided in June 2018 to increase their production by 1.2 MBD. Saudi Arabian production in November rose to more than 11.3 MBD, its highest ever. OPEC+ later found out that oil supply was larger than demand, commercial stocks were growing, and oil prices almost collapsed (going below $50, the lowest in two years). The information decision makers based their decision on had been inaccurate or misleading, and misinterpreting this information led to making bad judgments.

On November 12, 2018, Trump said, “Hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” In another tweet, Trump said, “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flow as is, not restricted.” Later in his presidency Trump stopped tweeting and spoke discreetly with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the oil market. Since the early 1970s, almost all U.S. presidents have used oil as an election card for their own benefit or the benefit of their party.

- middle management level, most U.S. officials are logical and understand the oil market very well, and their decisions go beyond politics. Therefore, the question is: Do American decision makers want or have in mind a price target for oil? The answer is simultaneously yes and no. During election years the price of heating oil or gasoline becomes a public issue, and the oil price becomes very important. After an election, oil prices become less important. At times, American officials may express concern about the impact of high oil prices on global economic growth, including growth of the U.S. economy. If prices are very low, officials may speak of the need to protect the U.S. domestic industry and “stabilize the oil market.” In both cases, their comments are very general. U.S. officials do not normally speak publicly about a specific oil price. Even in closed meetings, they may speak about a range but not a specific number.

When oil prices rose, except in an election year, they would express their concern about the possible negative impact on economic growth. Most of the time the U.S. position and policy about the oil market has been in line with many oil-producing countries, such as the Arab Gulf countries and Mexico, and with oil-consuming countries.

When oil prices were above $40 per barrel in 2004, the United States expressed displeasure for fear it might go higher, and they asked why OPEC was not defending its price target. 4. When the price reached $100 in 2007, the United States wanted to see it go lower and began speaking with their close allies, asking them to do something about it because of the concern that these high prices might harm economic growth and contribute to higher inflation. 5. In 2012, when the oil price was again above $100, the United States lobbied Saudi Arabia and others to help bring it down. Washington’s acceptable price was “around $100 per barrel.” This new preferred price continued until the collapse of 2014–2016.

- Oil and U.S. Decision Makers For U.S. decision makers, oil is not just a commodity that operates along economic rules and logic and by common international trade practices. It is an extension of power and influence with a clear geopolitical dimension. Oil has been used to advance U.S. power and influence as well as to punish its enemies. It is part of “vital national security” and “national interest” issues. Only in the United States does the White House National Security Council, the State Department, the CIA, and even the Defense Department share involvement in international energy policy and relations. For decades, American oil companies have worked hand in hand with Washington, taking advantage of and serving U.S. power in many parts of the world, including in the Middle East and South America. Since World War II, the only time oil has been used against the United States by oil producers to attain political goals was during the Arab-Israeli war of 1973. The so-called Arab Embargo was imposed to change the U.S. government’s strong support for Israel. However, the United States has used oil for political ends a number of times against Iran, Libya, Iraq, Venezuela, and Russia.

- Despite the testing of such relations during the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and the generally negative U.S attitude towards OPEC, the two countries have maintained close cooperation and consultations in oil matters for the past 75 years.”17 Yet, at the public level, mirror images about each other and oil policies largely reflect negative opinions that are being fed to the public by some politicians, interest groups, and some in the media. The American public expresses little concern about the U.S. petroleum relationship with Saudi Arabia until the price of gasoline rises. However, many of the elite, or the political establishment, generally tend to have a negative view of Saudi Arabia and its oil policy. They accuse Saudi Arabia, together with the rest of OPEC, of market manipulation, greed, and causing harm to U.S. and Western economic interests. OPEC is described as a “cartel” even though this description is not correct, or is at least debatable. The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC) has been introduced (without success) in the U.S. Congress eight times between 2000 and 2021, with the purpose of punishing OPEC and its member countries for deciding the production level of its members.

- The emergence of the United States as the world’s largest oil producer provides leverage both in its bilateral relations with trading partners and in the international arena. Oil price movements will have an impact on U.S. oil producers, oil consumers, and the economy at large, and the United States will have to become more integrated and more sensitive to developments in the oil market. If there is a shortage or an oversupply of oil, or if prices move too high, the U.S. economy and consumers will be affected unless the government decides to halt oil exports or fix domestic oil prices (as it did in the 1970s). This outcome is unlikely, although some members of Congress have been talking about it since early 2020. Managing this important shift in the status of the United States as a global petroleum power and adapting its policy accordingly calls for enlightened leadership. Empty rhetoric and political posturing are counterproductive when assuming a leading role in the international oil market. Top U.S. decision makers, especially the president and the secretary of state, have usually not been involved in international petroleum issues unless there was a major energy crisis or it was an election year. When they did get involved, they did so at the bilateral level rather than through international collective efforts. Occasionally, when pressured by friends and allies, they sometimes became involved in collective work through the IEF, the IEA, and at the G20. Each president’s involvement reflected his personality and beliefs, and the political, economic, and petroleum circumstances of the time. Now the United States must change its stance because it is one of the most important players in the oil market. This period is different from any time in the past in almost every dimension, and Americans need to shed their old method and engage in international collective actions, including the possibility of continuous direct management and participation to stabilize the market. This became clear when the industry faced its biggest crisis in many decades in 2020. Some signs of a change of approach have been noted, but they are only visible to those who follow these matters closely. In the second half of 2019, for the first time the U.S. government proposed a candidate for the position of secretary-general of the IEF. Joseph McMonigle worked with the U.S. Department of Energy when Spencer Abraham was the secretary of energy (2001–2005), and he has worked in the private sector as well.

- 2020, and he has been active, participating in a clear and positive way in the debates on energy issues.21 Another sign of changing attitudes by U.S. officials toward the international oil market was clear in the answer of Secretary Dan Brouillette in 2020 to a question regarding OPEC and its desire to have a meeting to cut production. He said, “we’re not concerned about the decision that OPEC may make, and whatever decision they make will be good for them and we appreciate what they are doing.”22 However, Washington expressed major concerns a few weeks later. When oil prices started to collapse during the second week of March, President Trump thought it was good for American consumers, but members of Congress from oil-producing states pressured the administration to doing something. Later on Trump concluded that these low prices would harm the U.S. economy and hurt his bid for reelection. During election years, many things become extra sensitive and important. The “I can do it alone” thinking and policies of Trump, including an aversion to international cooperation, began to shift for the first time, and Washington discovered the importance of collective global action. President Trump called King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as Russian president Putin, asking them to work together, alongside others including the United States, to bring stability back to the oil market (i.e., increase prices).

The March/April oil crisis proved that he was right, and the United States played an important role in global management by working directly with other producers. Although the method of participation may change over time, President Trump established a new direction for the United States in international oil management.

Petroleum companies, oil-producing states, and other organizations may lead a political or legal campaign against the Biden administration (some have already begun doing this).

- However, the market was about to change direction. A snowball had been forming, which led to a dramatic fall in oil prices. This was not due to fundamental forces alone but was mixed with negative sentiment, which played the larger role. The main player in these events was one important decision maker. Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi minister of energy (1995–2016), was beginning to change his stance regarding the oil market, OPEC, and Saudi oil policy. This shift in thinking began in 2012–2013, and there were four reasons for it. First, some people within Saudi Arabia, including at the Ministry of Energy, thought Saudi Arabia’s policy was protecting the interest of some high-cost oil producers, such as U.S. shale oil, and Russia, Canada, and Brazil. These oil producers were increasing their production because of high oil prices. Personally, I did not see anything wrong with that increase, as long as it didn’t directly hurt Saudi Arabia, especially in terms of its income, and stable oil production. Second, some reports were claiming that Saudi Arabia had lost its market leadership. For example, in February 2012, Ergo, an oil and gas consultancy, issued a report titled “The Waning Era of Saudi Oil Dominance: ([Location 3605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3605))

- Arabia’s Influence over the Oil Market.”1 I gave it to Al-Naimi, who read it with great interest. Third, Saudi oil consumption (products and crude) was growing at an alarming annual rate of about 6 percent, more than double the world average. This was a concern for Saudi officials as well as many international oil experts. In December 2011, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), a London-based think tank, published a study on this subject. It concluded that Saudi Arabia’s oil exports would decline significantly within a few years because of increasing domestic consumption. Saudi Arabia needed either to increase production to keep its exports steady or slow unsustainable growth in domestic consumption, which was difficult at that time.2 Fourth (and very important), Al-Naimi believed that expensive oil, such as shale oil, could not survive at low oil prices. If the oil prices went to $80 per barrel, not only would investments stop but the production of expensive oil would decline, and the fall in production would be deeper if prices fell to $60 or $50 per barrel. An important oil expert said that shale oil producers could operate even if oil prices fell to $45 per barrel; Al-Naimi was unhappy, but he dismissed that opinion. Al-Naimi was not the only oilman who ([Location 3615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3615))

- believed in the negative impact of low oil prices on shale oil and other high-cost oil production. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported in October 2014 that oil prices below $80/BBL would threaten about 2.6 MBD of global production ([Location 3626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3626))

- Al-Naimi was about eighty years old and had been in the ministry for around twenty years, and he was unwilling to lead an international campaign to manage the market. King Abdullah was also getting old and not in good health (he was over ninety at the time); he had complete trust in Al-Naimi and left oil policy to his minister. In addition, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi minister of foreign affairs who used to have a strong say in Saudi oil policy, was not in good health and had lost interest in oil issues. For the first time in his career as minister of energy, Al-Naimi had a high level of freedom and was able to make decisions as he saw fit. He had more freedom than any other Saudi energy minister had enjoyed. Some time, during the second quarter of 2014, Al-Naimi asked Saudi Aramco’s Department of Planning to prepare a study listing different options for Saudi Arabia’s oil production and its future status in the oil market. They presented four options for the kingdom’s future production and exports: 1. Saudi Arabia could play the role of swing producer to keep oil prices at a certain level by reducing production when needed. But Saudi Arabia might lose market share and even lose control of oil prices. 2. Saudi Arabia could retain market share by increasing production in line with the rise in global demand. 3. Saudi Arabia could fix oil production at the existing level of production at the time, which was 9 MBD. 4. Saudi Arabian oil exports could be fixed at a certain level and not go below it. The number discussed was 7 MBD as an export floor. After a long discussion, Al-Naimi decided to adopt the fourth option (fixing the floor for oil exports) and mix it with the second option (increasing production and exports gradually). This meeting was not attended by the ministry’s regular OPEC and international market team. OPEC was not given any role during the discussion. Neither were the Saudi Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics and Planning consulted nor informed. The minister of finance, a Saudi Aramco board member, learned of the decision one year later during Aramco’s board meeting in Seoul, Korea, on April 20, 2015. The minister of finance was not happy with falling government income, but he trusted Al-Naimi’s judgment. ([Location 3644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3644))

- That decision was made when the price was over $100/BBL. Nobody knew about it, so it had no impact on the market. However, by September 2014 the oil price fell to $90/BBL. Some analysts thought it was the new OPEC floor and that Saudi Arabia would not allow the price to go lower. But that was not the case. On October 9, 2014, PIRA Energy Group had its annual meeting in New York and hosted a private dinner attended by Nasser al-Dossary, an adviser at the Ministry of Energy and the Saudi representative to the OPEC Economic Commission board. If oil prices continued to fall, he was asked whether Saudi Arabia could handle a price of $80/BBL, to which he answered yes. The Saudis did not prefer this level, but al-Dossary said that they could deal with this price. This response was quickly circulated among oil consultants in the United States. The following week at a meeting in London, the same question was put privately to a high-ranking Aramco official. He gave the same answer as al-Dossary had, that Saudi Arabia could handle a price of $80/BBL. They both did not say or even indicate that these prices were preferred by the Saudi. Some oil analysts interpreted this response by two important Saudi oil officials to mean that Saudi Arabia could not only handle $80/BBL oil but that it might even prefer to see a lower oil price.

- quickly to other analysts and hedge fund managers, and it became public when the specialized petroleum media reported it. Prices began a rapid slide the following month, and the market’s sentiment turned negative. Al-Naimi was vacationing in Romania’s mountains in October 2014. I telephoned him when prices started to fall with the suggestion that he issue a denial that Saudi Arabia wanted to see lower prices. Al-Naimi replied, “No, we should not say anything.” The minister and other Saudi officials remained silent for more than two months. This created a sea of rumors that were reinforced by questions left unanswered by the Saudis, such as why the Saudis wanted the price to go down and what price level would be unacceptable. Those rumors slowly came to be seen as fact and even as part of a hidden agenda. Some reports were written by non-oil-experts or people with no deep understanding or connection to the oil market and Saudi oil policy, but the people were well-known. In October 2014, Saudi Aramco issued its monthly pricing formula, adjusting the price and lowering the price differential. The New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia was getting into a price war in Asia to drive other producers, especially other Gulf producers, out of the market.4 This explanation showed a lack of understanding of the Saudi Aramco pricing system and the marketing procedures of other Gulf countries. Refinery margins are the main parameters used by Saudi Aramco to set monthly prices for their five crude grades. The company has three marketing regions (Asia, Europe, and the Americas), and its sophisticated computer model analyses each of the three regions independently. Aramco also takes into consideration comments and feedback from its regular customers about the differential of the previous month. After Saudi Aramco issues its prices, other Gulf countries—Kuwait, Iraq, and Iran—use the same pricing formula with some adjustments. This has been the procedure since the end of the fixed oil price and netback pricing system and the establishment of Saudi Aramco in 1988.

Its report speculated on the reasons for the collapse in oil prices. Unlike Friedman’s article, there was some truth in this article, but it was exaggerated. In May 2015, the Bloomberg monthly magazine had Minister Al-Naimi on the cover. It showed him wearing eyeglasses covered with the words “Crude, Gambit.” Peter Waldman reported, “Last fall, as oil prices crashed, Ali Al-Naimi . . . went mum. He still popped up, as is his habit, at industry conferences on three continents. Yet, from mid-September to the middle of November, while benchmark crude prices plunged 21 percent to a four-year low, Al-Naimi didn’t utter any word in public.” Why? Waldman’s answer was “Buying time: The Saudis plan to extend the age of oil: The biggest exporter has let prices plummet—delaying the day when climate concerns, efficiency, and fuel switching break the world’s dependence on crude.”6 This conflicting and inaccurate reporting spawned more rumors and conspiracy theories about why the Saudis would allow the price to go down. One theory was that the Saudis were trying to hurt Iran, which was believed to be working to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Another was an attempt to hurt the Syrian government or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ DAESH), which controlled some oil fields in Syria and produced oil and sold it at a discounted rate.7 These false or exaggerated stories swirled around while prices continued to fall, but Al-Naimi kept a low profile and made no attempt to clarify Saudi policy or take action to halt the slide in oil prices. He did not take an international leadership role, as he had done in 1998–1999 and 2008, nor did he allow his associates to speak with the media and the market. Al-Naimi was silent. This brings to mind the words of the great Arab poet, al-Mutanabbi, who said more than one… ([Location 3706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3706))

- What happened in the closed-door ministerial meeting was more interesting. Al-Naimi lectured the other ministers about how OPEC risked losing market share as they did in the 1980’s to U.S. shale oil producers and to Russia, Canada, and Brazil, among others, if it cut production. He added that high-cost producers were benefiting from OPEC’s oil policy. He reminded them of the first half of the 1980s when OPEC cut and cut production to defend targeted oil prices while other producers continued to increase production, which resulted in OPEC losing both the price and the volume. Therefore, OPEC should not cut production, especially because high-cost oil producers would not be able to continue at the same production level in a weak oil price environment. His argument was convincing and supported by sound data. He also had in his favor the outcome of the meeting the previous day when Russia and Mexico indicated that they were not willing to reduce their production. Somehow Al-Naimi’s remarks to the ministers in the closed-door meeting were leaked to the international media, and the story that emerged was spicy. The media reported that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries were against U.S. shale oil, and these stories made headlines and the cover of some magazines.9 In the following month, the market was more or less stable, and prices held at around $60/BBL. If oil ([Location 3772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3772))

- prices reached $60, it was expected that shale oil production would begin to decline, but this did not happen. In a sign of confidence in and support for U.S. producers, the U.S. government lifted a ban that had been in place for some forty years and allowed oil exports, but Al-Naimi still resisted proposals for a production cut by OPEC alone. Saudi Arabia could not reverse the oil price decline with an actual production cut, but Al-Naimi thought Saudi Arabia could stop it from falling further by sending out positive messages. The opportunity to express this positive message came during a conference of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) in Abu Dhabi on December 21–23, 2014. The conference drew a large number of participants from all over the world, and the media was there in force. Al-Naimi’s speech was carefully written to send a positive message to the international oil market. It had four important points. First, Saudi Arabia was optimistic about the oil market and its future. Second, there is a need for cooperation among all oil producers for a meaningful and effective oil cut. Third, and contrary to what was being reported, Saudi Arabia did not use oil for political goals against this or that country. Fourth, the Saudi economy was so strong that it could cope with the existing oil prices without any problems.

- But in his interactions with the media, the script changed. When Al-Naimi walked out of the building after his speech, CNN correspondent John Defterios asked him if Saudi Arabia planned to cut production, and Al-Naimi replied that he would never cut production. Defterios then asked Al-Naimi about working with the Russians, and he said it was too late.10 Subsequently, Al-Naimi spoke with his three favorite journalists in special interviews: Randa Takieddine from Pan Arab Al Hayat, Samira Kawar from Petroleum Argus, and Kate Dourian from the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES). What he told them was a bombshell. Al-Naimi said that Saudi Arabia would not reduce its production even if oil prices were as low as $40 or even $20 and that expensive oils from other countries would not be able to continue production. Al-Naimi’s reasoning to everybody, especially the international media, was that he did not want Saudi Arabia to repeat the mistake of the 1980s—playing the role of swing producer and reducing oil production when others were unlikely to do so as well. Oil prices did not move right away,… ([Location 3793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=3793))

- The Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, and Boris Yeltsin became the first president of the newly formed Russian Federation. He instituted major dramatic changes for the economic and petroleum sectors and spoke of establishing a free market without a clear vision of how to achieve it. He sold off parts of the Russian oil industry at low prices, including the reserves, and corruption was the norm. Some people made billions of dollars owning businesses without doing very much. It was one of the major sell-offs in the history of the petroleum industry. Yeltsin’s government created a system called “loans for shares” in which wealthy individuals would lend money to the government in exchange for shares in some state oil companies. If the government did not repay the loans on time, shares ([Location 4036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4036))

- of these companies would be transferred to those wealthy individuals. This became known as the “sale of the century.” It was from this chaotic situation that the Russian oil “oligarchs” emerged—rich individuals with no experience in the oil industry but who now owned it.3 Moreover, the industry was failing and no longer served the interests of the country. Russia’s production was in a steady decline, reaching its lowest point of less than 6 MBD in 1996.4 Yeltsin also threw Moscow into the arms of Washington, politically and economically. The United States rewarded him in 1997 by inviting Russia to join the Group of Seven (G7), the club of rich nations. Russia joined what became the G8, alongside the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. This was clearly a political decision by the United States because at that time Russia was a waning economic power.

- When Vladimir Putin came to power in 1999, oil and natural gas were among his priorities, and the country adopted a new strategy. Putin reorganized the oil industry under strict state authority, and some of the largest companies became state-owned or ended up with mixed ownership. At the time, more than one hundred international and small local private companies were operating in the Russian upstream oil sector. From 1999 to 2004, Putin’s power grew, eventually extending to almost total control over all aspects of Russian policy. Unlike Gorbachev and Yeltsin, he was a strong believer in the power of the state and wanted to restore the superpower status enjoyed by Moscow under the Soviet Union and the Czars. The petroleum industry is an important contributor to the Russian economy, and it is more exposed to low oil prices than some other producers, such as the United States, Norway, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Oil production and oil prices affect the Russian government’s income, the value of the national currency (the rouble), economic growth, government spending for military needs and for social projects, and the balance of payments. The cost of oil production is higher in Russia than it is in most OPEC countries, but Russia’s oil exports provide income and facilitate relationships that help Russia achieve one ([Location 4055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4055))

- of its important goals—to be a major international power. It serves Russia’s interests to be part of a collective effort to stabilize the oil market and to have an oil price that is good for the oil industry, the economy, and the government. But there are conflicting opinions and interests inside Russia, especially among oil producers and nonpetroleum economic decision makers. One group, including the ministers of energy and finance and the head of the government’s investment fund, prefer relatively higher oil prices that generate more income for the government. They also strongly supported Russian participation in international oil management. The other group, headed by Igor Sechin, chairman of Rosneft Oil Company, is against production restrictions. Sechin is a close ally of President Putin but is also a hardline national conservative who does not trust the West, especially the United States and its allies. His opinions about the oil market are clearly colored by his political beliefs. For example, he might even have an anti-Saudi tone,6 but he follows what the president wants. Other Russian companies, including some international oil companies operating in Russia, backed Moscow’s participation in oil supply management, but they did so privately. It is important to examine the strategic role of oil in the relations between Moscow and Washington.

At the same time, a number of U.S. decision makers and oil experts were unhappy with what they called the dependency on imported oil from the Arab world, the Middle East, or OPEC. They saw an opportunity to replace Middle Eastern oil with more “secure” supplies from Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia. Later when Russia and some Central Asian countries were looking for new oil and gas export outlets through Iran, Washington opposed the proposals and… ([Location 4076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4076))

- Changing Oil Policy Russia changed its oil policy in 2016 and began to take a leading role together with Saudi Arabia in the OPEC+ arrangement. The big question is why—why did Russia change its energy policy? Were these decisions based on the energy sector, or were there political and economic considerations? What part did personalities and personal beliefs and relationships play? Russia’s realization of the strategic role of petroleum in its international relations was growing year by year, and it began to ship more oil and gas to Asia, especially to China, and away from the West. These and other policy decisions involving oil and gas were important factors in the development of Russia’s international strategies, including their relationship with other oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and OPEC.

- It was not only Trump who was unhappy about higher oil prices. The Indian government faced a dual challenge: higher oil prices and a weakening national currency (the rupee). The government imposed new taxes on some oil products, but this was difficult for the general public in India. Some Indian officials attacked OPEC privately and in closed meetings, and in August 2018, one high official described OPEC as a “greedy organization.” This was unusually harsh coming from India, which had always defended the interests of fellow developing countries.14 There was also concern that commercial stocks were lower than normal because of high demand and tighter oil supply. Saudi Arabia normally thinks first about its immediate and long-term interests, but it seriously considers requests and the interests of its major allies, partners, and consumers (the United States, China, Japan, Korea, India, and Europe).

- Many international observers and journalists had an unusual reason for ruling the prince out. It was perceived wisdom that a member of the royal family cannot become the minister of energy and that the position had to be filled by a technocrat. It was not clear why this perception was so widespread even though Prince Abdulaziz is an energy technocrat par excellence; his education, training, experience, responsibilities, and achievements since the early 1980s underline this. Clearly, being a member of the royal family should not prohibit anyone from taking any position in government if that person is qualified. In fact, there was and is no policy, formal or informal, in this regard.

- in the early 1950s, many members of the royal family have been ministers in so-called Technocrat Ministries, including the ministries of finance, education, agriculture, housing, municipalities, and trade. Ministers from the royal family, just like other ministers, come and go. International media coverage also misunderstood the recent evolution of al-Falih’s responsibilities from being minister of health and chairman of Aramco in 2015 to becoming the minister of energy, industry, and mineral resources in 2016. Three years later, in the late summer of 2019, the Ministry of Mining and Industries Policy was removed from al-Falih’s portfolio, and on September 2, the chairmanship of Aramco was transferred to the chairman of the Public Investment Fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan. The international media generally seemed to like al-Falih. He was forthcoming and talked to the media more than what was considered normal for a Saudi energy minister. Some international observers who followed OPEC closely for many years said that al-Falih was very articulate but that talking to the media so much might create misunderstandings. Inside Saudi Arabia, especially within energy circles, the picture was different. The common belief was that al-Falih gradually lost his high stature because some were uneasy with his working style.

Abdallah Jum´ah (president of Saudi Aramco 1995–2008) said that “Khalid is a smart engineer and hard-working manager with excellent knowledge, but his working style does not please some people who work with him.”2 The second difficulty al-Falih faced was related to being overburdened with responsibilities. He was unable to deliver on some promises made at the beginning of his ministerial tenure, including promises related to industrial policy, the development of the minerals sector, and expectations regarding oil prices in 2018 (chapter 10). Some undelivered promises were partially the result of an overreliance on international consultants who have a tendency to say what their clients want to hear and create a rosy picture about the future.

This is largely due to his nature and his long firsthand experience within the government. Prince Abdulaziz relies more on national experts than on international consultants, and when he uses consultants, he rigorously questions their opinions and suggestions. His management style is different from that of the four previous Saudi energy ministers discussed in this book. Prince Abdulaziz knows the working system of government very well and has a wide range of relationships inside Saudi Arabia with links beyond the energy sector. He has taken a leading role in intellectual and economic gatherings and debates and enjoys reading and watching documentary movies on history and geopolitics. He is also the head of various charity programs. Prince Abdulaziz is a modest man who walks to the mosque in his local neighborhood.

- The Sixth Oil Minister and the Sixth Oil Crisis One important measure of an energy minister’s tenure is how the ministry deals with the international oil market during a price collapse or a steep price rise. Each Saudi energy minister has dealt with these challenges in his own way and achieved different results, and Prince Abdulaziz will not be an exception. In January 2020, the oil market began to face major challenges regarding demand and prices as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a challenge to the new global leadership and to the ministers of OPEC+, especially Saudi Arabia and Russia. On Monday, March 8, 2020, the oil price dropped by 25 percent—the second largest one-day drop on record. A number of factors were driving this slide, including the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, a drop in oil consumption, high uncertainty about almost everything, negative sentiment arising from the failure of the OPEC+ meeting, and reduced oil prices by Aramco and others.

- As the crisis intensified, no clear solution was in sight. This crisis was not the result of human misjudgment or economic circumstances, as was the case with previous crises. This time an invisible virus resulted in major disruptions in the international oil market and wreaked more damage than ever before. But the solution to this sixth crisis still depended on human judgment and actions. The first crisis was in late 1985 when Ahmed Zaki Yamani decided to restore market share using the netback pricing mechanism (chapter 1). This led to the collapse of the market. It took a couple of years and a new OPEC policy for the market to recover, supported by strong demand growth. The second crisis occurred during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The oil supply was cut by more than four million barrels per day, and the price doubled. This crisis lasted about six months and led to major changes in the structure of the international oil supply (chapters 2 and 3). The third crisis began with the Jakarta agreement of 1997 and its aftermath. Oil prices collapsed for more than fourteen months, and OPEC and other oil producers had to implement deep cuts (more than four million barrels daily) to bring the market into balance and stabilize oil prices. This was the first such case and perhaps the last of its kind.

- Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates on behalf of Iran facilitated the end of this crisis. The fourth crisis created perhaps the most interesting effects on the international oil market. The global economic crisis of 2008 unhinged the oil market. Within a year, oil prices went up from just under $100/BBL at the beginning of the year to around $145/BBL at midyear and then down to below $35/BBL by year’s end. OPEC alone had to cut production three times in the second half of 2008 by a total of 4.2 MBD (chapters 7 and 10). The fifth crisis was a price crisis. From 2014 to 2016, oil prices dropped from over $100/BBL to almost $26/BBL in less than twenty-four months. The price drop began with a new policy initiated by Saudi oil minister Al-Naimi that spun out of control and failed to meet expectations (chapter 9). With the exception of 2008, these five crises resulted from the judgments or misjudgments of the decision makers. The sixth crisis had a completely different driver—it started with a virus in one city, Wuhan, China, and spread all over the world within three months.

- Prince Abdulaziz was charged with a heavy burden and had two major responsibilities: he is the minister of energy of the most important oil country, and he is the head of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) of OPEC+, where decisions regarding the international oil market begin and end. For OPEC+ to succeed, Prince Abdulaziz believed they needed to act big and get ahead of the curve. He knew this from having lived through the experiences of the previous five crises.13 Prince Abdulaziz emerged as the undisputed OPEC leader following the OPEC meeting in December 2019. When the Joint Technical Committee met in late February, they recommended an additional production cut of 0.6 MBD on top of an existing production cut of 1.7 MBD agreed on in December of 2019. (Saudi Arabia had pledged to make an additional voluntary cut of 400,000 B/D.) It was felt that this would be enough to halt the slide in oil prices. But at the OPEC meeting in early March, this sentiment was changing as new information about the virus, the global economy, and the prospects for a strong decline of oil consumption became… ([Location 4622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4622))

- Early in the morning of March 6, everyone was waiting for Minister Novak to return from his consultations in Moscow with President Putin. The expectation was that he would agree to the new cuts because it was felt to be the minimum that could be done to balance the market in 2020. Within the proposed 1.5 MBD cut, the share allotted to non-OPEC countries was one-third, or 500,000 B/D. OPEC would decide how to divide its share of the one million (pro rata, as usual), and Russia would coordinate the shares of non-OPEC producers. Novak had a meeting with Prince Abdulaziz in which they discussed the developments of the previous day. Then Novak had another meeting with non-OPEC producers (Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Oman, Mexico, Malaysia, and Brunei) and asked each country how much it could contribute to the 500,000 B/D total cut. Novak was able to collect 160,000 or more barrels daily from the other countries. One minister asked how much Russia was willing to contribute, but Novak did not answer.

The joint meeting among all OPEC+ ministers went as planned: the opening statements, the presentation, and the discussion. But it was decided not to have joint press conference or a press release, which was normally done, and decisions about the dates of future meetings were not made. After the failed OPEC+ meeting, all knew that oil prices would collapse in light of negative global demand, high inventory levels, and no possibility in sight of a big cut if needed. In the absence of an agreement, it was clear that every country would work independently to defend its interest using the tools it had to gain market share by selling more oil if it had the capability to do so. It was clear that we were in the midst of a free for all oil market. What triggered it is the subject of much debate.

- That was the start of the price war. Everyone else is just reacting.” Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Nigeria believed that they had spare production capacity and could increase their production in April. Some of them thought raising production would compensate for part of their lost income due to lower oil prices. Saudi Arabia has the highest capacity, with more than 12 MBD. Russia, for example, said it could produce 200,000 to 300,000 more barrels per day, rising to 500,000 B/D within months. After the failure of the meeting, Saudi Arabian officials felt that oil prices would drop, perhaps into freefall. They also believed that there would be additional competition among oil producers. After careful study, assessments, and close coordination within the government, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to act, and to act first, big, and fast. It had to capture market share before other countries did so. It needed to replace some lost income as a result of expected lower oil prices. Crown Prince Mohammed was the decision maker in this regard, and it later proved to be a good move. To set this plan in motion, Saudi Aramco had to get involved. Prince Abdulaziz flew directly from Vienna to Dhahran on March 7 to meet with Aramco’s management and discuss how to increase Saudi production and find customers for the newly produced oil at a time of decreasing demand. The company decided to cut the differential between Saudi crude and benchmarks for Asia, Europe, and the United States, leading to the lowest differential ever. Aramco would also increase production and exports to the maximum. “The goal was to capture market share for Saudi Arabia which reflects its production capacity and oil reserves, just as other countries would in the absence of a cooperative framework,” said Adeeb al-Aama, the Saudi OPEC governor.14 This was not an oil price war, as some international media and oil experts claimed; it was not an action against Russia or any other party. The Russian Factor Why did Russia refuse to be part of the non-OPEC 0.5 MBD production cut or even negotiate a smaller one? By talking to some officials and oil experts, reading interviews and statements from Russian officials, and looking at media and other reports, a number of factors may have been considered.

Saudi Arabia had no choice but to act rapidly and decisively, increasing production and lowering price differentials to find buyers for the new crude. The failure of the OPEC+ meeting and the Saudi oil price differentials precipitated the oil price decline, but the underlining reasons were more complex. The coronavirus pushed the global economy into recession, and the demand for and consumption of oil took a big hit. Oil demand lost more than twenty years’ of growth, returning to levels similar to those at the beginning of the century. Even worse was the news that some oil companies in Texas could not find buyers or places to store their oil, pushing prices into the negative level, something that had never been seen before. The first five oil crises led to big changes in the structure of the international oil market and relationships, and sometimes these relationships went beyond oil. The fifth crisis brought Saudi Arabia and Russia close to each other, but the sixth crisis drove them apart. However, unforeseen and unexpected circumstances emerged a short time later.

- Demand Destruction, a Price Collapse, and Recovery Unprecedented dramatic events shook the international oil market in the spring of 2020. The U.S. oil benchmark (West Texas Intermediate oil) fell from $50 in early March to −$30 on April 20, the first time it had moved into negative territory. Week after week global oil consumption estimates plunged, from about 1.5 MBD in early March to more than 20 MBD by April. Equally important were changes in the decision-making process. After the failed OPEC+ meeting of March 6, media and experts talked about a price war, the end of the Russian-Saudi oil alliance, a free international oil market, and the end of oil management. Talk of an end to the Russian-Saudi oil alliance proved to be premature. Although bilateral discussions about the oil market had stopped, they resumed a week later. The free-for-all oil market, actual or perceived, lasted for only thirty days. On previous occasions, this type of free oil market had survived for a couple of months or even as long as two years. Some oil experts I talked to said that a true free oil market, which some American officials promoted, would be damaging to all.

- For more than one hundred years, the oil market had followed one type of supply management or another, and individual decision makers made significant contributions to this process. In the spring of 2020, a new oil market manager came to town—the U.S. president, Donald Trump. This was a clear sign of the depth of the crisis and signaled a change in the role of the United States in the oil markets (chapter 10). Trump took the initiative, suggesting a reduction in the oil supply by all major oil producers and urging President Putin, King Salman, and Crown Prince Mohammed to work together to restore stability to the market. The result of this process was a major production cut (up to 19 MBD, the largest ever) and introduction of a new type of supply management. Other government officials also influenced the decision-making process. One of them was Kirill Dmitriev, a powerful, smart, and articulate young decision maker within the Russian establishment who had a special relationship with President Putin, including at a personal level.19 Dmitriev was a frequent visitor to… ([Location 4729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4729))

- market needs good cooperation, strong management, and enlightened individuals to steer it. Although people will debate issues such as the oil price war, who blinked first, and who won and who lost, one thing is certain—this shock brought about major structural changes in the thinking and workings of the international oil market. The United States, Western countries, and OPEC+ are no longer adversaries; they have become partners who need to work together for mutual benefit, especially in times of major crises. After the second OPEC+ meeting, I called Prince Abdulaziz to congratulate him on the terrific job he and his team was doing, to which he responded, “Tonight, I hopefully will sleep eight hours, after forty-five sleepless nights,” but then added, “tomorrow will be another day. It might be as difficult as yesterday.” He was right. A couple of weeks later, Prince Abdulaziz faced a new challenge that would test his ability to keep the OPEC+ countries together to achieve the desired results. When the designated secondary source production estimates for the month of May came out, at least five countries failed to adhere to their pledged cuts (Iraq, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Angola, and Gabon). Their total overproduction was more than one million barrels a day, which was a lot of oil during a major crisis like this. Over the years, OPEC and OPEC+ have experienced this problem from various countries. Nonadherence is like a virus that can, and does, spread from country to country and increase month after month, and it has to be contained. Sometimes the market or political circumstances take care of it, but on other occasions that is not the case. This time was different, and Prince Abdulaziz realized this. Saudi Arabia and its major allies (Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates) were making additional cuts over and above the agreement, totaling approximately 1.2 MBD, and the kingdom needed to push others to at least adhere to their official cuts. Prince Abdulaziz demanded full adherence from those who were failing to comply in May, and he required a transparent program to compensate for any overproduced barrels with deeper cut in the coming months. This was done for the first time and by talking to individual countries, one by one. The Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC+ met in early June 2020, and Prince Abdulaziz played a vital role at this meeting. The next day an analysis by Julian Lee was titled “Saudi Arabia Lays Down the Law to the Oil Market.”22 Another article stated that “the deal is a victory for Saudi Arabia and Russia, who spent a week cajoling fellow members to fulfill their obligations. It’s a particular vindication for the Kingdom’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who has consistently pushed fellow members to stop cheating on their quota since his appointment last ([Location 4782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4782))

- year.”23 After reading these two pieces by Bloomberg, I reflected on the ten months that had passed since Prince Abdulaziz had been appointed Saudi Arabia’s energy minister. Ten months is a brief moment in time in the history of oil, but what a roller coaster the past ten months had been. Major challenges came one on top of another, shocking the energy markets and the global economy. The world looked to Saudi Arabia for leadership, and the kingdom provided it, thanks in no small part to Crown Prince Mohammed and Prince Abdulaziz. No other energy minister has faced such difficult multilayered challenges in such a short space of time. It would have been a daunting task for any minister, let alone one newly appointed. The combination of Prince Abdulaziz’s experience, knowledge, personality, diplomatic capabilities, and wide range of contacts meant that he was able to navigate these issues with aplomb. There can be no doubt that Prince Abdulaziz rose to the occasion in his first year in office. In February 2021, the international oil market and energy consultants gave their judgment on Prince Abdulaziz’s performance. Not only has the oil price returned to precrises levels, but it has gone even higher. The majority of analysts credit Prince Abdulaziz with this achievement. After the prince delivered his opening speech to the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) on April 1, 2021, Javier Blas, chief energy correspondent at Bloomberg, tweeted the whole transcript, and Roger Diwan, vice president of IHS Markit,… ([Location 4804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4804))

- Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University, wrote, “When all states are in the same leaky boat without an automatic operating system, one of them should wield the biggest dipper for the security of the boat as a whole. If the leading power does not lead, the other states cannot follow, and the world boat will lose direction.”1 I believe this is true not only for the international system as a whole but also for many of its parts, including the international oil market.

- The global petroleum map keeps growing and changing, and other energy sources, such as solar, will also continue to grow. But contrary to what some believe, the growth or decline of these alternative energy sources will be connected to changing oil prices unless the world has a major technology breakthrough. If oil prices become very low, for example, $10 or lower, many oil producers will be priced out of the market. Moreover, the majority of alternative energy sources cannot compete with oil without strong government support (which is very costly in a competitive and globalized economy). The personalities of our energy decision makers will help shape the world as we work to solve this global dilemma. Some people doubt the continuity of a high demand for oil in the next ten, twenty, or thirty years. They ([Location 4878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4878))

- are referring to “peak oil demand” and the transition away from fossil fuels. This viewpoint is a personal judgment based on selective information. The transition process will not be easy, and some of the people who promote this view are likely to have political agenda or personal interests. We have seen all of this many times within the context of peak oil supply, among other issues. ([Location 4884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4884))

- The international oil market has seen major price collapses during the last forty years. The role of decision makers was critical in causing the collapses and in bringing the market back to stability. There seem to be big ups and downs in prices every decade. The possibility of a major price rise or decrease in this or the coming decade is highly likely. Again, there will be a need for leadership, as has been the case in the past. The demand side of the energy map is interesting. Demand is likely to grow across the world, with the exception of countries with major economic problems or those that are politically unstable. Mature economies facing increasing demands by the populace to control climate issues, such as the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, will witness little or negative growth. Globally, we are likely to see uneven growth. Stronger growth will occur in emerging and developing economies such as India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia. Some large economies, such as Indonesia and Brazil, are likely to become major economic powers with high oil and energy consumption. Yet price fluctuations are expected to continue on the oil market. Contrary to what some believe, many leaders of oil consuming/importing countries worry about low oil prices as much as they worry about high oil prices, ([Location 4895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4895))

- but when prices are low, they express their concerns privately. Perhaps they do not want to be seen by the public as wanting higher prices. They know that low oil prices would lead to a decline in oil and energy investments, which would lead to supply shortages and spikes in oil prices. Oil producers and consumers alike prefer stable and reasonable oil prices. The crucial question is what are reasonable prices? Decision makers have different opinions about reasonableness that are not limited to oil producers but also can be found among oil consumers. The desired price for Saudi Arabia is different from that for Russia and is different again for producers such as Algeria, Venezuela, and Iraq and is likely to change from one year to the next. The same can be said about oil consumers. Apart from election years, U.S. politicians would like to see a $50 or $60 oil price whereas Europe prefers a lower price. Indian leaders would like to see low prices, especially if their currency is going south, as was the case in 2018 and 2020. It should be noted that the desired oil price is a moving target that depends on many factors. It is not necessarily related to market fundamentals. In the early 1980s, different OPEC ministers targeted different oil prices (from $35–$45). After the market collapse of 1986, Saudi Arabia targeted a price of $18, which was soon adopted by other OPEC countries.

- Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries, the new target was $21. The Iranians wanted $35, which was most likely a political price. After the collapse of the market in 1998 and its recovery in 2000, a new price system was adopted with a target of $23 and a range of $22 to $26. Decision makers in major consuming countries accepted this, but when the price went above $40, OPEC ministers felt unable to defend the target prices. When the price went over $100 in early 2008, the preferred price was between $80 and $100. The British prime minister suggested a range of $60 to $80. When prices increased to $127 again in 2012, both Saudi and U.S. officials preferred a price drop to $100. With the collapse of the oil market in 2014–2015, Ali Al-Naimi was hoping for a price of $60. With the price recovery in 2016, the Saudis preferred a range of… ([Location 4915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095FFQHNW&location=4915))

- Major changes in supply and demand often create the need for new arrangements, new management, and new leadership on the international oil scene. The oil crisis of March-April 2020 had international consequences, and the U.S president jumped into the international driver’s seat with the goal of attaining market stability. President Trump was successful, but many U.S. taboos were broken related to price targets, price management, and working with Russia and OPEC+ to attain these goals.

- Looking to the future through the experience of the past, international energy and oil market stability benefits oil producers, oil consumers, and the global economy at large. The emerging circular carbon economy, climate issues, and possible transitions within and between energy sources means that the energy business in general, not only oil, will benefit most from stability and predictability. Achieving stability and predictability requires good management, which is only possible with enlightened leadership and decision makers who are willing to work together collectively to deliver these goals. That is the essence of the lessons learned in the last forty years, and this will remain the case well into the future.
