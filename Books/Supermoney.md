- While the S&P 500 was off just 7 percent in 2000-2005, the total return of the average large technology fund was a staggering minus 58 percent. “History may not repeat itself,” in Mark Twain’s wise formulation, “but it rhymes.” ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=314))

- I hadn’t known him, but I had written some sentences about him in The Money Game. Graham, I had written, was “the dean of our profession, if security analysis can be said to be a profession. The reason that Graham is the undisputed dean is that before him there was no profession and after him they began to call it that.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=332))

- Warren showed me the principles he had written out on a lined, yellow legal pad and framed: a. Our investments will be chosen on the basis of value, not popularity. b. Our investments will attempt to reduce the risk of permanent capital loss (not short-term quotation loss) to a minimum. c. My wife, children and I will have virtually our entire net worth in the partnership. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=382))

- Recently, his chairman’s letter found him in high moral dudgeon. “Charlie and I,” he wrote referring to his vice chairman, Charles Munger, “are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which shareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth . . . to their shame, these business leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners.” ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=453))

- Supermoney is the successor to The Money Game. Both books used some of the techniques of what was then called New Journalism, the first-person narrator, the dramatization of points with the actions of various characters.

- Beneath the anecdotal approach and the names of some of the characters, there are serious themes in these books. For example, The Money Game suggested that people viewed financial matters as rational, because the game was measured in numbers, and numbers are finite and definitive. But, said The Money Game, the ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=483))

- truth was elsewhere. Any intelligent observer could see that behavior—psychology—had a lot to do with the outcome. Further, people did not behave as economists postulated, always assuming that people maximized their actions for rational gain. The Money Game, it said, right off, “is about image and reality and identity and anxiety and money.” Some of the aphorisms in it were “the stock doesn’t know you own it,” “prices have no memory,” and “yesterday has nothing to do with tomorrow.” The founder of Fidelity, Mr. Johnson, tested the thesis, “a crowd of men behaves like a single woman,” and a psychiatrist postulated that some people actually want to lose. Mr. Johnson also said, somewhat prophetically, “The dominant note of our time is unreality.” This idea was startling enough that ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=485))

- Supermoney itself is a term I coined to describe the difference between the green bills in your wallet and the real wealth in the country, which is earnings, or profits, capitalized, when they are run through markets, that is, stocks. You might work very hard on your algorithms in your job at Google, but your weekly paycheck will be dwarfed by your Google options, which have the opinion of the market place applied to multiples of the stock. Cash your paycheck at Google, and you have money; cash your options and you have supermoney. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=502))

- The jury has to be counted as still out on whether the falcons are within earshot. On the bread-and-butter level, the specific doubts concerned liquidity, which can mean a number of things but in this context meant the ability of buyers to buy and sellers to sell. We have that capital market that brings in the people from everywhere. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=551))

You’re lucky to have a broker these days; first your broker has to survive, then he has to keep you, they keep trying to shove you into some mutual fund where you wouldn’t be able to watch the stocks. I have a good relationship with my broker, so I don’t think he would drop me, but when I holler I don’t holler too much, even about a ten percent commission.

- attention to people. The assumption is that price behavior and volume behavior equal people behavior. The Money Game attempted to sketch some of the irrational forms of people behavior, and to suggest that emotions had as much influence as buffalo tracks. I once commissioned a psychologist to write a paper on anxiety as a market force, and until I got together with Dave Campbell, a psychologist from the University of Minnesota, nobody had even made an elementary sketch of professional money managers as people. As in the old maps of Africa, the outlines are all there, but the interiors are all blank. The rivers are marked, but there are big gaps where we might as well have pictures of elephants and the word “unexplored.” Be all that as it may, the New York Stock Exchange says there are 31 million shareholders, and that there will be 40 million in 1975 and 50 million in 1980, plus all those indirect shareholders in pension funds, insurance policies and mutual funds. They must be looking for something. Maybe they realize that the green stuff in their wallets is not the real money.

- The poor innocents among us do not realize the impact of a superior currency around. They still think the green stuff in their wallets is money.

- There are other ways of compounding wealth, usually involving borrowing on the asset—the real property or the oil in the ground—and buying some more.

- But there is a lender of last resort; that is why we have a Federal Reserve system. Congress, by the Constitution, can create money, and Congress gave that money-printing function to the Federal Reserve in 1913, when that agency was created. The Fed reports to Congress once a year; it is an independent agency; its seven governors are appointed by the President for terms of fourteen years apiece. This is not the place for the college-freshman-economics-course explanation for the mechanics of the working of the Fed. Suffice it to say it can turn money on and off. By the way it turns the faucet, the Fed hopes to speed up the economy when it slows down, and slow down the economy when it gets overheated. It used to believe that if the cost of money went up, buyers would drop away. At this point, however, the Fed was working more with monetary aggregates, which one Fed official described as “roller-skating on three wheels—it will work, but you need new body movements.” There is a philosophy that the way to cure inflation is to get everybody to stop reaching out. You want them to curl up in a fetal position and stop breathing for a while; that cures enthusiasm. Then things cool off. The Fed had had the money valve largely off, because inflation was certainly roaring. The Fed itself had been criticized: for cutting off money too abruptly in 1966, for increasing it too fast in 1967 and early 1968. Fed meetings are not public, but the two possible positions were fairly clear. The first position said thus: only we can print money. Once we print it, we can’t control how it is used. Printing money has to be part of an overall plan, involving foreign balances, taxes and so on. Our Official Policy is one of restraint, and if we depart from it, not only are we not able to control where the money goes, but the news of a sudden change might have a reverse effect and scare everybody to death. The second possible position for a Fed governor was to worry about Monday morning, and to treat the weekend as something special in history. The issuers of commercial paper would not be able to sell any more; they would go to their banks; the banks would say, sorry; the issuers would be brought into the courts by the people to whom they owed money; the issuers would start to lay off people and cut back operations; everybody could stake out a corner for an apple stand, if the corner wasn’t already occupied by a fried-chicken stand. The notes of a Fed official to a Fed meeting later that summer uses this language: “inability of the issuers to pay their paper at maturity would have dire consequences for the issuers, the commercial paper market, other financial markets, and the banking system.” Dire consequences is a phrase not used lightly. The Monday morning worriers won. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1017))

- Why was the record-keeping so fouled up? Among other reasons, there is a simple sociological one. In times of prosperity, stockbroking is a prestige profession. You get to talk on the phone, sound important, know what’s going on, and play with expensive electronic gadgets. Underwriting companies is even more prestigious. Being a partner of a firm is best of all. You get to order a splendid new office with books by the yard and a special shower off the men’s room, or, if it is an older firm, an appropriate antique roll-top desk. From there you talk to the giants of capitalism. It is not very prestigious to keep records, match up certificates, or in general do the dreary housekeeping known as “back office.” So nobody wanted to be the partner in charge of dishwashing. And in many cases, nobody was. Once the troubles started, all the business-school-type partners knew exactly what to do. They tell you that at business school. If you have a problem, you call in an outside consultant—Arthur D. Little or McKinsey or Booz, Allen, Hamilton, or one of the computer software people. The consultant says it is lucky you called. Your communication techniques are obsolete, your record-keeping is archaic. How can you expect to conduct a twentieth-century business with eighteenth-century record-keeping? What you need is an IBM 360-20 computer system—at $5,000 a month—and some staff to go with it. You are relieved. You have made the right executive decision. At business school they told you you would have to use a computer. That is when your firm goes busted. The computer fouls up. I refer you to SEC Chairman Casey’s points eight and nine in the transmittal letter referred to above: 8. New and expensive technologies were hastily brought to bear on the paperwork problem without adequate preparation, analysis of cost or mastery of technical requirements; 9. Records were put on computers without maintaining the old records for safety until the computer operation proved itself. Of course you threw the old records away! The computer people told you everything was fine now, didn’t they? ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1240))

- That left du Pont, and the du Ponts of Wilmington, Delaware, were in no mood to help. The candidate on the white horse was clear: it was a Texas billionaire called Ross Perot. Perot was not at all the traditional loud, cigarchomping, super right-wing, cartoon Texas oilman. His money was all in shares of Electronic Data Systems, or EDS, a computer software company. Perot was so straight and H. Alger-like that even stricken Wall Streeters could not believe it. As a boy, he had gotten up at 3:30 A.M. and ridden twenty miles on horseback to deliver the Texarkana Gazette to poor neighborhoods that no one else wanted to service. He was an honors graduate of the Naval Academy. His billion came from the high price at which EDS shares sold, but he said often that the day he became an Eagle Scout was more significant than the day he became a billionaire, and he gave several million to the Boy and ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1350))

- Girl Scouts. He had joined IBM as a salesman and had met his yearly quota by the third week in January. He started EDS with $1,000, and was turned down eighty times before he made his first sale. Perot is five feet six, has a crew cut and wears straight ties. His night life is playing basketball with his wife and five children, or taking everybody out for a hamburger. Perot first came into the news because of his efforts to take Christmas packages to prisoners in North Vietnam; his chartered planes had gotten as far as Laos.

- Everybody knows what happened. Kutuzov survived. Wall Street survived. No other major firms went out of business. Congress, mindful of the 1,500 letters a month the SEC was getting, and of its own mail, passed the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, which created an agency that could borrow up to $1 billion from the U.S. Treasury, if necessary, to protect customers against losses if it became necessary to liquidate the firm in which their securities and cash balances were held. That took the pressure off the industry and off the New York Stock Exchange, and restored some public confidence. Securities in the “fail to deliver” class dropped from $4.1 billion at the end of 1968 to $1 billion at the end of 1971. The narrow-tie computer people were given new prestige, more money, and some partnerships, or the equivalents in corporate form. The piece of paper—the stock certificate—is still at the center of the transaction, and delivery is still made by gentlemen in Salvation Army overcoats. That is ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1392))

- still troubling, but the mechanism of transaction, it is safe to say, has everyone’s attention. And, said the chairman of the SEC, “looking down the road a little” (not the Kaluga road, a metaphoric road), “the time will come when the execution of a trade will be electronically conveyed to a point where securities are transferred by electronic record with paper print-out and payment is made by similar electronic means.” The future of the New York Stock Exchange is not totally clear, but what is clear is that it will not be moving to Dubrovnik. The structure of the securities industry is going to be quite different, but that concerns the people in it more than the multitude of investors. The involvement of Congress in passing the Securities Investor Protection Act means a continuing involvement of Congress; the government rarely leaves any endeavor where it has created an additional staff. So. Bad things happened that need not and should not have happened; but catastrophic things did not happen—at least not catastrophic enough to send the whole business to Dubrovnik. The individual investor, it seems fairly safe to say, slept unaware of the liquidity crunch, and read in the papers about the problems of brokerage firms. All he knew was that his stocks were going down. But what of They, the big boys, the professionals?

That is the point of the very old story about the visitor being taken around the waterfront, and having the yachts pointed out—That is Morgan’s yacht, that is Gould’s yacht, and so on—and the customer says, “But where are the customers’ yachts?” The brokers make as much money selling for customers as buying for customers, the reasoning goes, so it doesn’t matter. That was not always the case this time. The customers could get busted right to zero, but some of the brokers managed to make it well below zero.

There was one job I really wanted, and when I was turned down, it really toppled me. I think the guy who interviewed me was really interested.

- On a trip, I stopped by the office of Irwin the Professor, the master architect of computer-based technical analysis. Irwin’s professing included computer applications, management sciences and some advanced mathematics, but he spent more time with his own companies than he did with his students. Irwin’s companies have names in their titles like “computer,” “decision,” “application,” “technology,” and so on, and he works in a new office building about three blocks from the university. Irwin’s computers monitored stocks: the price, the volume, the percentage move. Then they determined the stock’s Behavior Pattern. Once the computer knew the stock’s Behavior Pattern, it knew when to buy and sell—the ultimate in technical analysis and charting. Irwin’s computer had certain anthropomorphic qualities.

- “When we first put the computer on the air,” he said, “we asked it what it wanted to buy and we couldn’t wait to see what it reached for. It said, ‘Treasury bills. Cash.’ We couldn’t get it to buy anything. So we checked out the program again, and while we were checking it out, the market went down. Then we asked it again. The computer insisted on staying in cash. We begged it to buy something. ‘There must be one stock somewhere that’s a buy,’ we said. You see, even computer people are victims of these old atavistic instincts from the pre-computer days. The computer just folded its arms. It wouldn’t buy anything. Then, just when we were worried that it never would buy anything, right at the bottom it stepped in and started buying. The market started going up, and the computer kept on buying. Then one day it came and asked us for margin. It wanted to keep buying. So we gave it some margin. After the market went up some more, it sold out a bit and came back to being fully invested.” A brokerage firm had signed up Irwin’s computer and was selling the service to customers. On my trip, I asked Irwin how the computer portfolio had done. Irwin said it had gone down 30 percent in the bear market, and that the broker had canceled the service. Another casualty. I asked what had gone wrong with the computer. ([Location 1978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1978))

It’s people that are the problem. The computer couldn’t have lost thirty percent by itself. The computer was fine.” I asked Irwin what he was up to now. He said the computer program was being refined. He was tinkering with it all the time. Meanwhile, his other computer programs for industry were doing all right. Of course, Wall Street was not too flush, so Irwin didn’t know when another brokerage firm would spring for wiring up his computer. “But we’re running it on our own,” he said, “and the computer is doing very, very well. It is outperforming the market. And our… ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NBZB1G&location=1988))
