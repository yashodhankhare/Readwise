## Highlights
- Without using any jargon or complicated formulas, we’ll just focus on making the only decision there is to make when it comes to the markets – buy, sell or hold. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=65))

- We know what we think of a stock. Let’s find out what the market thinks and that's where charts excel. At the end of the day, if our analysis is sound and the charts agree, then we can be confident with our decisions. If the charts disagree, then perhaps we should move on to our second choice or even just stay away from the market altogether. In any case, we will gain a sense of confidence and that is worth a lot.

- It is not the Holy Grail and even if applied exactly as offered there is no guarantee that the reader will be successful. But owning a high quality hammer is no guarantee that the user will build a beautiful house. The hammer is a tool and in most cases the user will still need other tools – and knowledge – to build that house.

- Purveyors of this art have been called tealeaf readers, and many similar names, but that has nothing to do with what technical analysis is attempting to do. If we strip away all the fancy indicators and obtuse jargon, what is left is a time-tested method of finding investment opportunities and assessing their risk. There is no fortune-telling here; only figuring ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=81))

- There are many different types of charts but the simplest to comprehend at the beginner level are those that plot price action over time. For our purposes in this book we will only consider two main types of charts: one summarizes a period’s trading, called bar charts, and one simply connects the close prices together to form a line, not surprisingly called close charts or line charts. A period can be a single day, a week, a year, or a unit of 10 minutes. All of them are made in the same way and the only difference is the time horizon in which each operates. As beginners, let’s keep to daily and weekly charts. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=100))

- As mentioned, bar charts summarize all the trading for any given time period, such as a day or a week (see Chart 1.1). When all those summaries are plotted together, trends emerge and patterns form – all revealing where a stock is right now and how it got there. After all, knowing a stock is trading at a price of 50 is not of much help, but knowing it was at 45 last ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=112))

- Chart watching can trace its roots back more than 200 years to Japanese rice trading. Charles Dow, a forefather of modern technical analysis, and a co-founder of Dow Jones & Co., made his ground-breaking observations in the late nineteenth century. Analysis was done with paper and pencil for decades until personal computers made their appearance, and with these the sophistication of the analysis blossomed. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=122))

- A good rule of thumb is to restrict technical analysis to stocks that trade at least 100,000 shares per day so that there is a liquid market for the stock. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=133))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With the proliferation of online trading, charting has fallen victim of its own success as investors are forced to break the rules of analysis to get the jump on others. Everyone knows about the adage, “Sell in May and go away” so they begin to sell in April to get a beat on the crowd. The so-called “Santa Claus rally” is used to describe the seasonal tendency for stocks to move higher at the end of the year, but this phenomenon has already started to occur a month sooner. The reasons are the same. It’s just that investors are trying to be first in and first out so the whole process is played out earlier. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=136))

- The market – any market – has been personified by both the media and by investors. “What did the market do?” a friend asks. Investors, analysts and journalists treat the market as a living, breathing entity. “The market did not like the latest employment report,” they might say. Or “the market was energized by Company X’s positive reaction”. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=146))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But just who, or what, is the market? The market is simply the sum of the actions of everyone in it. There is no one, central brain controlling things, nor is there any agenda to move one way or the other. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=150))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There is, however, a collective consciousness as people in the market buy and sell in reaction to their own analysis and the actions of others as they, in turn, buy and sell. Many liken the market to a herd of animals, a flock of birds or a school of fish. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=152))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If a fish on the right side of a school sees a shark approaching, its action causes a ripple effect through the whole school; and fish all the way on the left side – despite not seeing the shark themselves – start to veer to the left. Information about the presence of the shark propagates through the school much the same as information about a company propagates through the market. The school and the market somehow start to move as a unit. For the market, that is a trend. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=154))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Patterns and trends have already been mentioned, so let’s quickly talk about them so confusion does not set in. In simplest terms: a trend is the market in motion, and a pattern is the market at rest, deciding if it wants to continue its trend or change course. We’ll talk more about patterns later, after we nail down some of the basic concepts of charting first. A trend is really nothing more than a somewhat uniform change in price levels over time. For a rising, or bull trend, prices start low and through a series of fits and starts, advances and pullbacks, move to a higher level. Some trends are smooth and have small wiggles within. Others are choppy and are characterized by high volatility. Some are flat with little net gain over time, and others are steep with a sharp increase in relatively little time. The basic point about all trends, however, is that they have inertia. Trends in motion tend to stay in motion until an outside force acts upon them. And how do they get inertia? It is from the imperfect flow of information. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=167))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are price levels on the chart that investors consider to be cheap or expensive. In chart lingo, that is support and resistance, respectively. Resistance slows or stops a trend. Support holds the market from falling further, at least temporarily. But in reality, it is supply and demand, respectively. Sellers, for example, become more aggressive when they think prices are high and they sell. That increases supply ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=184))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and prices will ease lower unless demand also increases. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=187))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For example, if a price of 50 for a stock brought out the sellers on one or two occasions in the recent past, this price level is considered to be resistance, where the supply of stock increases relative to the demand. People think it is expensive so they attempt to sell. Simple economic theory suggests that prices will stop going up, if not actually decline. Perhaps the stock declines to 45, where buyers think it is cheap. Prices begin to edge higher and this process repeats until something changes the perception of the stock’s value, either from inside the market (attitudes and outlooks of investors) or outside the market (earnings and politics). At that point, a price of 50 may suddenly look cheap and demand overwhelms supply. The stock then moves higher. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=188))

- Real values do not change 20% in a day, but perceptions of that value sure can. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=197))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When taken in this way, the market does seem to come alive, but it is no more alive than any other social system. It is, however, the sum of the actions of all investors and in that way it does seem to have a mind of its own. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=198))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is the best way to separate market value from market perception and note when the latter is changing. The former does not move prices. Only the latter does. Charts detail the day-to-day, or even minute-to-minute, changes in what people think something is worth. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=205))

- Many individual investors are raised to believe that the stock market will always go up over time and that it is futile to time buys and sells. That is the basis for the random walk theory and a book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel, first published in 1973. His conclusion was that investors couldn’t time the market.

- If you followed a buy and hold strategy in early 2000, before the bear market began, then it took seven years for the stock market to return to break-even. That is a 0% return for seven ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=224))

- Technical analysis is based solely on data generated by the market and by the actions of people in the market. Data are never revised later. Analysts are not making guesses on the value of the data. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=227))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Technical analysis focuses on how stock prices are moving and how powerful those moves are. By analysing these two simple data sets – price and volume – it creates derivative measures, such as momentum, and all of it is used to ultimately measure supply and demand. These are the forces that really move markets and not analyst estimates or government reports. If nobody demands what is being supplied, no matter how great the fundamentals look, then prices are not going to go up. These are not mysterious concepts and certainly not what some paint technical analysis to be. All we want to do is figure out where the ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=228))

- market is going, hop on board for the ride and then hopefully recognize when the market is changing its mind in time for us to hop back off. Supply and demand. These are the forces that really move markets and not analyst estimates or government reports. In recent years, two related fields – behavioural analysis and socionomics – have gained followings. Both analyse market action with quantifiable actions of people and add great insights. Behavioural finance studies how people act when money is at stake. • Socionomics looks at the social mood in society and relates it back to what the stock market is doing. However, this book will focus just on more traditional technical analysis and leave it to the reader to explore the others at a later date.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In order to understand how to invest in any market, it is important to understand what drives the market in the first place. Many cite fundamentals as the force behind moves in the stock market, and that is true to a degree. However, as mentioned earlier, it is not value that determines price, it is perception of value. And when does anything ever trade at fair value? If it did, then fundamental analysts would all be out of work, as the market would always tell us what a stock is worth.

- This was mentioned earlier but it deserves a reprise: No matter what new products a company invents or how much it beat analyst earnings estimates, if nobody wants to buy its stock at the current price then its stock price will not go up. And what determines if an investor wants to buy anything? Perceptions. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=249))

- The focus is on action, not prediction. We cannot control where the market will go tomorrow or next year but we can control what we do to prepare for it – and includes knowing when we have made an incorrect assessment.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As mentioned earlier, technical analysis is based solely on data generated by the market and by the actions of people in the market. It is based on the premise that people will act in similar ways when faced with similar conditions. • Crowd psychology • The herd • Probabillity • Fear and greed • Supply and demand ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=279))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Charts are where perception meets reality. A stock may look cheap according to an analyst’s calculations based on projected future earnings, but if there is no demand for the stock it is simply not going to go up. A stock is only worth what people think it is worth, not what it should be worth on paper. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=286))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And what about those projected earnings? Again, as mentioned earlier, they are really only educated guessed about the future business success used to make educated guesses about price action in the future. That’s two degrees of guesses – educated or not. On the charts, we look at what is happening right now and how it came to be. From there we make educated guesses about the future; but the goal is not to predict where prices will be in a year. The real goal is to determine what we do about it right now. If we decide to buy based on a chart, we will already know what has to happen to prove us wrong and that helps us limit losses. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=289))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Note that all technical analysts did during the bear market was look at one simple portion of the chart – price action. Despite what we think about a stock or a market, what we see is what counts. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=302))

But that does not tell us what the market is thinking and that is where technical analysis shines. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=306))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Some detractors liken technical analysis to voodoo or tealeaf reading, which might be true if the absolute goal is to predict the future. But nobody and no method can do that. What technical analysis tries to do is assess the probability of prices moving one way or the other so we can take action. We may be wrong but, over time, playing probabilities will pan out as a good strategy. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=309))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What does technical analysis do for me? The answer is that the ability to recognize when a stock has reached a support or resistance level, or a shift in perceptions takes place, can help investors know whether to use the: • buy low, sell high approach, or • buy high, sell higher approach, or whether to buy the stock at all. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=316))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We’ve touched upon some of the reasons to use technical analysis, such as the lack of data revisions, estimates and subjectivity in its inputs. But as important as it is to know when to buy a stock it is equally, if not more, important to know when not to buy a stock, or when to sell a stock already held. Technical analysis is the only investment decision-making discipline that lets you know when you are wrong sooner, rather than later, to minimize losses. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=324))

- Since technical analysis is based on crowd psychology and actions of the masses, it works best when there is a crowd to analyse. That means the best analysis occurs on liquid stocks where there are plenty of bulls and bears at work and a critical mass of money value changes hands each day. What constitutes critical mass is subjective, but many investors use a rule of thumb of stock price above $20 and average daily trading volume above 100,000 ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=328))

- shares. Certainly we can tinker with these parameters as we gain experience. Technical analysis also needs relatively normal market conditions. War, terrorism, takeovers, legislation and litigation trump support and resistance, although it does help during these unusual conditions to know where investors found value in the past.

- If the breakout is to the upside, then demand beat supply and we should buy. What was once thought to be expensive is now thought to be cheap.

- in one of three phases: rising, falling or resting. Within the resting phase, the market can either be regrouping before continuing in the direction it was in, or changing in order to move in the opposite direction from which it was in. The shapes on the chart give us clues to which phase the market is in, whether that phase is ending and what might happen when it does end. But no matter how fancy the patterns get, our only job is to figure out what we are to do about it – buy, sell or hold. When we look at it that way, it is not so complicated.

- There are many complex shapes to analyse but let’s just keep with the basics. Each is named for its appearance (what it looks like on the chart) and can lean bullish or bearish depending on where it forms in a trend. This concept will become much clearer later so don’t try to absorb it now. The shapes are: ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=407))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- rectangle (also known as a trading range) 2. triangle (also known as a pennant or wedge) 3. flag (similar to the others but with a bit more directional forecasting ability) 4. saucer (or rounded top/bottom) The differences may be subtle, or they may be extreme, but the bottom line is that the market is pausing and when it decides which way it wants to go from there, we just follow along.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We must take a moment to mention stock splits and that they do not affect chart analysis. For example, if a stock splits two for one, an original investment of 100 shares now becomes 200 shares but at half the price. The value of your holdings is unchanged. Charts will adjust for that split but the entire series of data adjusts. All historical prices are cut in half and all historical volumes are doubled. In that way, the value of shares traded each day, week or month remains exactly the same. The shape of the chart and all of its indicators looks exactly the same, too. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=427))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For the financial and commodity markets, the price of the stock or commodity is the top of the table (see Figure 2.3). Indicators such as momentum, sentiment, volume and anything else we can create, are the legs of the table. Everything is there to support the price and as long as we keep this in mind we will be properly focused on what we are doing. The stronger the “legs” the better the “table” (investment).

- Price is the only thing that matters at the end of the day. It is what we say when someone asks where a stock is today and it is the only way we judge our investing success. Price rules and it is entirely possible to analyse a chart without any of the other supporting indicators. However, the others make our job a lot easier so let’s learn the basics. • Price The stuff you put in the bank. Clearly, this is the most important component as we measure our success in monetary terms. It only matters if we have more money after investing than when we started and that is measured by price. Volume How much money is moving. If price tells us… ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=440))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- more reliable the analysis can be. • Momentum How fast it got there. It is important to know how eager the crowd is to buy and sell because if it gets over enthused it will push prices out of equilibrium. Prices that move too far, too fast are prone to snapbacks. • Structure The structure of the market refers to how it got to where it is now and we understand that by studying trends and patterns. As stocks trade, their ups and downs form patterns on the charts. Analysis of trends and patterns help us sort it all out and give us clear guidelines to know when a trend changes to a pattern or a pattern changes into a trend. • Sentiment How people feel about the… ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=448))

- If price tells the story about what is happening, volume tells the story about how much we can believe it.

But if the same stock rose one point on a volume of ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=492))

- 500,000 shares, we can say that the gain had real significance. Enough people were interested enough to buy the stock that something must have changed. We don’t know what it was but it was important enough to get a lot people to take action. Perhaps it was earnings news or a lawsuit. From the charting point of view, the reason is less important as the actual event – the high volume gain in price.

- Using volume Volume is very useful in determining whether a stock is pulling back in a correction or changing direction. It also helps us determine whether it is forming a pattern or starting to move in earnest. For example, if a stock rallies 10 points and then pulls back (“corrects”) two points, and volume on the pullback falls, it suggests that people were simply taking profits and not selling with any urgency. We can have confidence buying it when the trend resumes higher. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=498))

- Another important use for volume is in the identification of both final panic (capitulation) and initial surges as investor moods change from one extreme to another. The former can be described as exhaustion, capitulation or a climax, when the last holdouts finally join the party en masse. Supply or demand, depending on which way prices are moving, is finally all used up and the trend ends. Volume is very useful in determining whether a stock is pulling back in a correction or changing direction. For the latter, an initial surge, breakout or breakaway occurs when the public suddenly decides that a stock is cheap (or expensive) at the same time. It could be due to positive earnings news or it could be a situation when the time is just right for investors to play “follow the leader” in buying. Whatever the reason, prices move sharply and volume surges. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=502))

- Momentum indicators quantify what the naked eye can tell us about price action. Momentum in the markets is similar to momentum in physics in that a trend in motion tends to stay in motion unless an event occurs to stop it.

- The way price action is used on charts is two-fold. Either the stock in question is moving or it is not. The former creates a trend, either higher or lower.

Resistance is also another name for supply because at that level, investors collectively decide that value has been reached and they sell their shares. Supply increases and demand may also decrease. Depending on how aggressive buyers and sellers are, the price of the stock will either pause or decline. The converse is true at support. At some price level, a falling stock price will stabilize. Enough investors will perceive it to be good value and demand shares while others will perceive the price to be too low for them to want to sell any more of their holdings. If: at resistance: demand for shares increases enough to absorb all the supply being offered for sale then prices stop moving. However, if demand overwhelms supply then prices must rise and the stock breaks free from resistance. Chartists will take that as a buy signal.

- The most common of the continuation patterns is called a flag because it resembles a flag flying on a flagpole. When a market is trending higher, it is more common for it to slowly give back some of those gains as the bulls take some profits.

When this is over, the market generally breaks out in the direction of the original trend as the bulls take over again.

- For example, if prices move higher from the triangle pattern in the chart and then fall back within that pattern, we will know that we were incorrect in our original decision to buy. Either we missed something on the chart or the market simply changed its mind and decided to go down. We sell immediately and book our small loss, leaving our egos at the door. Something chart watchers keep pasted to their computer screens is a sticky note that says: All big losses begin as small losses When the initial reason for buying is gone, we don’t hang around hoping it will go back up. Hope is a four-letter word in the world of investing. If a chart watcher follows breakouts, he or she will inevitably have losing trades. But if he or she is disciplined and responds to breakout failures, the losses will be small and easily overwhelmed by the profits from winning trades. In this regard, charts help manage risk.

In this case, we can see that they are much farther away than before and that means looking for help in other indicators.

Momentum starts to decline yet the ball continues higher, but at some point gravity equals the energy applied to the ball (the throw) and the ball momentarily stops. Finally, gravity takes over and the ball falls back to Earth. In financial and commodity markets, the same concept applies. Investors as a group buy stocks, for example, until the number of new investors starts to decline. This means demand from buyers has slowed a bit but the stock can still advance with less power. But sooner or later, the momentum of the market stalls, allowing the sellers (supply) to take over. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004071Y0E&location=841))
