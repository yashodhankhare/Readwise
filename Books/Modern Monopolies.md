## Highlights
- In September 2010, the company hired former Microsoft executive Stephen Elop as CEO and charged him with turning its business around. Elop faced an important choice right away. Should Nokia stick with trying to develop its next-gen operating system? Or should it abandon this approach in favor of hitching its wagon to an established competitor? In January 2011, Nokia’s management was still leaning toward the former until a critical meeting changed Elop’s mind. Jo Harlow, Nokia’s head of Symbian, told Elop that MeeGo “wasn’t mature enough” and that Symbian couldn’t hold Nokia over until the new operating system was ready. A partnership with Apple’s tightly controlled iOS was out of the question, so Nokia was left deciding whether to pin its hopes on the nascent Windows Phone or Android.1 This shift in strategy, combined with the challenge of overcoming a sclerotic bureaucratic structure, convinced Elop that the company needed to change direction. On February 4, 2011, he issued to the company’s employees what came to be known as the Burning Platform memo.2 The memo, leaked to the public a couple of days later, compared the task Nokia faced to the story of an oilman standing on a burning oil platform. “As the fire approached him, the man had mere seconds to react,” Elop wrote. “He could stand on the platform, and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames. Or, he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters. The man was ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=38))

- standing upon a ‘burning platform,’ and he needed to make a choice.” In Elop’s tale, the man chose to dive into the water and, against the odds, managed to survive. But the experience radically changed his behavior. The metaphor for Nokia’s troubled situation was clear. “We too, [sic] are standing on a ‘burning platform,’” Elop wrote, “and we must decide how we are going to change our behavior.” ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=50))

- These challenges were serious. But they were also all symptoms of Nokia’s single biggest failure, one that Elop implicitly recognized. Nokia had missed the transformative convergence of software and hardware. It was still acting like a product company.

- the smartphone industry wasn’t really about the product; it was about the platform. “We’re not even fighting with the right weapons,” Elop said. “We are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis. The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems [emphasis added].” ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=61))

- Nokia was used to competing on specs or features. But, as Elop said in his memo, “our competitors aren’t taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem.” Elop was right. Apple and Android had taken a platform approach, building unprecedented networks of consumers and developers by connecting the two sides en masse. These other platforms didn’t win because of superior features or technology. (At the time, several Nokia phones were highly reviewed.) They won because of their ability to create whole new markets and tap into new sources of value. Elop saw it coming, but not soon enough.

- By the beginning of 2014, Nokia’s market capitalization had declined to $30 billion. This was a stunning fall from a decade earlier, when the company’s market cap topped $200 billion. Elop had been right that Nokia was on a “burning platform.” But unlike the man in Elop’s story, Nokia couldn’t survive.

- If the pressures Nokia faced don’t sound familiar to you and your company now, they soon will. Entire areas of our economy already are being remade as technology has redefined the boundaries of the modern organization and shifted or even collapsed the traditional separation between industries. From the time of Nokia’s peak to now, something fundamental has changed in the business landscape. We are in a historic period where even the largest companies can rise and fall within just a few years. Sixty years ago, the average life span of a company in the S&P 500 was ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=93))

- over fifty years. Today it’s less than fifteen. This upheaval creates tremendous peril for existing businesses, but it also creates enormous opportunities. To take advantage of this change, you need to understand why it is happening. Then you need to know how to capitalize on it. Equipping you with this knowledge is the main purpose of this book.

- This new business model is the platform: a business that connects two or more mutually dependent groups in a way that benefits all sides. Platforms are a radical departure from traditional business operations, most of which grew out of a twentieth-century mind-set that couldn’t have imagined the level of connectedness we have today. In plain English, platforms allow consumers and producers to connect with each other and exchange goods, services, and information. By doing this, these businesses create new markets. Think of how eBay connected buyers and sellers or how iOS and Android connected consumers and developers. Uber did the same thing for passengers and drivers, and Airbnb did it for travelers and homeowners. All of these platforms created new markets and were able to grow their networks and businesses to a size that was impossible until very recently. The platform business model is now the key to some of the most successful companies on the planet. At the beginning of 2016, the two companies with the highest market capitalization in the United States were platform businesses: Apple and Google (now listed as Alphabet Inc.). Many people think of Apple as a hardware manufacturer and software developer, and it is. But the secret behind Apple’s stratospheric rise in recent years is its transition from a product company to a platform company. Apple no longer just makes hardware and software. Through iOS, iTunes, and the App Store, it also offers platforms that connect buyers and sellers of every kind of digital good you can imagine. As we explain in more detail later in this chapter, this platform was what enabled Apple to replace Nokia at the top of the mobile-phone market. Similarly, if you think of Google as just a software developer, you’ll miss the secret to its success. All of Google’s core services are platforms, including Google Search and Android. As Android showed, Google is singularly adept at using its core search platform to establish new platforms in other, seemingly unrelated markets. And its recent acquisitions suggest that the company’s platform ambitions don’t stop with mobile phones. It has already released platforms for wearable devices and health data as well as for the connected car, and it’s using Nest, a recent acquisition best known for its Internet-connected thermostat, as a beachhead for entering the connected home. There are even rumors that Google will try to create an Uber competitor. At the same time, Google also is experimenting with an online-shopping and local-delivery platform that would go toe-to-toe with Amazon. As the success of the companies mentioned above suggests, platforms have ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=112))

- quickly become a dominant part of our economy—and they are here to stay. In fact, platform businesses will continue to grow in influence in the years and decades ahead. Enabled by the technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution, Henry Ford’s famous assembly line changed the shape of both industry and society. By revolutionizing how we work, how we do business, and how connect with each other, platforms will do the same. This shift in the balance of power was part of what Elop was getting at when he identified the “war of ecosystems” that was under way. Platforms build ecosystems; products don’t. In the late 2000s both Apple and Google were becoming platform businesses, but Nokia was not. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=132))

- In truth, all of these factors contributed to BlackBerry’s decline. But we would propose a different, simpler theory: RIM was thinking like a product company in a platform world. BlackBerry was focused on the keyboard, but that never really mattered. The key to controlling the market was the operating system and a network of third-party app developers.

- Additionally, Android was built for developers, while the BlackBerry was built for businesses. Lazaridis and Balsillie thought their core customer was the head IT guy at a large company who would never allow employees to use devices like the iPhone, which didn’t have the same level of security as the BlackBerry. But Google’s approach, which Apple would soon mimic with the release of its App Store, was all about building a platform that attracted developers and consumers. This platform strategy turned out to be a far more powerful lure in the marketplace, and ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=202))

- it is where RIM went wrong. It never understood that its core customers weren’t businesses. Rather, they were lowly independent software developers who built apps for the new devices and salespeople at Staples who recommended phones to the masses.

- But then Jobs upped the ante by releasing the iPhone 3G and, more important, opening the App Store on July 10, 2008. The impact of the App Store on the iPhone’s success cannot be overstated. But a far less heralded innovation made the App Store possible. Historically, wireless carriers had dominated the mobile-phone industry, but the success of the iPod and iTunes gave Apple considerable leverage when it was negotiating with potential wireless carriers for the iPhone. In the end, AT&T wanted the iPhone badly enough that it was willing to cede some control to Apple in return for the right to be the iPhone’s exclusive carrier. The most significant of these concessions was that Apple—and not AT&T—would sell apps for the iPhone through what would eventually become the App Store. Previously, people bought the applications for their phones through their wireless carriers, and the carriers tightly controlled access to these application stores. Apple’s App Store was far more open by comparison. In addition, Apple took a 30 percent cut on all App Store purchases, a deal that was considerably more generous than what developers were used to getting from wireless carriers. This incentivized app developers to focus on the iPhone over the many other mobile operating ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=220))

- systems. For Apple, the App Store was another instant success, with over 10 million app downloads in the first weekend that it launched.14 RIM thought it knew what its customers wanted from a phone, but the App Store didn’t even try to guess. Instead, it let them decide. The App Store’s success spawned Apple’s now-ubiquitous catch phrase, “There’s an app for that,” along with a series of ads showing off its platform’s seemingly boundless potential. The iPhone offered unprecedented flexibility. No matter what you wanted to do, there truly was an app for it. This was the power of the platform—the iPhone harnessed a massive community of software producers to create more and higher-quality apps than ever before. By the end of 2008, the App Store had seen 500 million downloads. The store featured more than 15,000 third-party applications, a number that has continued to grow at a staggering rate.15 As of the end of 2015, the App Store had more than 1.5 million applications and an even more mind-boggling 100 billion downloads.

- RIM also introduced BlackBerry App World (now BlackBerry World) in April 2009. But by then it was the third option in a crowded development marketplace. To make matter worse, the BlackBerry’s operating system was notoriously difficult to develop for. So the BlackBerry app ecosystem struggled to gain traction. BlackBerry’s failure to develop a successful platform for its products is something that we witnessed firsthand. Using a few credit cards, Alex founded Applico from his college dorm room in 2009 as a BlackBerry app development company. We chose to focus on BlackBerry apps because most developers didn’t want to touch them, so we saw an opportunity to build a business. This approach enabled our company to develop partnerships with existing developers who were focused on competing in the more crowded iOS and Android markets, and it helped us gain a foothold in the software development business. All of this turned out to be good news for Applico, but not so for RIM. The BlackBerry’s unfriendliness to developers doomed RIM’s efforts to overcome the significant leads held by Apple and Google. Meanwhile, to app developers, the choice of whether to develop for BlackBerry came down to simple math. For most, creating BlackBerry apps was just too complex and costly for the size of the market.

- The exec was blunt about where RIM lagged behind. “BlackBerry smartphone apps suck,” he said, while comparing BlackBerry’s SDK and development platform to “a rundown 1990s Ford Explorer.” Driving the point home, he wrote, “technical superiority does not equal desire, and therefore sales.”19 Apple and Google understood this. RIM, like Nokia, did not. Both companies were still bringing a knife to a gunfight—or more accurately, a smartphone to a platform fight.

- In the end, Steve Jobs’s diagnosis of RIM’s challenge was characteristically prophetic. Speaking on a conference call with analysts in October 2010, Jobs had words of advice for his competitor. “They must move beyond their comfort area into the unfamiliar territory in trying to become a software platform company,” Jobs said. “I think it’s going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third platform after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Apple’s App Store, RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb.”20 As Jobs knew, the war of platforms and ecosystems often was winner-take-all. Apple and Google built platforms and won. RIM and Nokia did not, so they lost. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=279))

- After Applico’s early success as a BlackBerry developer, we quickly left BlackBerry apps behind and moved to developing for iOS and Android. Over the next few years, we became one of the most successful app developers in the country. But as the mobile industry changed, Applico evolved along with it. While many of Applico’s competitors were acquired or went out of business, our company thrived by becoming the world’s first Platform Innovation company. Each day, we work with some of the world’s leading businesses and hottest startups to build and grow innovative platforms. Our clients include Fortune 100 companies like Google, HP, Intel, Disney, DirecTV, Philips, and Lockheed Martin, as well as startups backed by Google Ventures, Ray Kurzweil, and top venture capital firms. While we can’t list some of our startup clients due to confidentiality, startups whose platforms we’ve helped create, including Glamsquad and Auctionata, have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and achieved nine-figure exits. And since our entire business is focused around platform business models, we’ve studied them in greater depth than anyone else has. This includes creating in-depth frameworks for how to build and grow platform businesses. That’s why we understand platforms better than anyone else today. We have lived at the heart of the technological changes of the last half decade and have had to put our money where our mouths are to succeed. We will share with you the lessons we have learned from working on the front lines with some of today’s most innovative businesses. We want to impart to you the insights that drove us to transform Applico from an app developer into a company focused entirely around platforms. The first part of this book, chapters 1–4, will explain what a platform business model is and share why platforms are reinventing the economy today. The rest of the book, chapters 5–8, will dig deeply into how platform business models work and share… ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=290))

- Whether you’re building a platform business or not, you can’t succeed in this economic environment without understanding how platforms work. Want to market your business direct to consumers online? Now you can, but you better rank well on Google. Want to get people to read your content? Well, your content better share well on Facebook. Want your app to get lots of downloads? You better rank well in the App Store (or get featured). Want to sell merchandise online? You’re probably going to do some selling through eBay and Amazon. Do you sell handmade goods? Then you’re probably on Etsy. If you’re in China, then you’re almost certainly on Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall, and you probably process payments through Alipay or Tencent’s Tenpay. The list could go on and on. The Internet is allowing an unprecedented democratization of economic freedom. Anyone can start a business and succeed online. But it isn’t perfectly open. Someone has to orchestrate all of this economic activity. As a result, the Internet and our economy are dominated and run by platforms. They organize commerce and information and shape the world as we know it. If you want to understand how the Internet works today and how the economy will work for years to come, you need to start with understanding platforms.

- A Very Short History of Business Models For many, Pets.com is the classic example of dot-com-era excess. Those people are not wrong. The company spent millions on marketing without having a sustainable business model or a proven target market. Since many investors at the time weren’t sure how to price Internet companies, lots of startups received valuations and investments that seem laughable in hindsight. Most of these failed companies made the same mistake. Like Pets.com, they took an old business model and slapped the Internet on top. The promised benefits of network effects and lower costs never materialized. But when the bubble popped and many dot-com darlings crashed and burned, eBay was still profitable and going strong. Over time, eBay grew into a company with a market cap of more than $66 billion. It was one of the few success stories of the dot-com era. And that’s no accident. The difference is the business model. Companies like Pets.com made the mistake of choosing a linear business model in the age of the platform. What is a linear business model? It’s the model that has dominated in various forms since the Industrial Revolution, when new technologies like steam power and railways gave rise to the large, vertically integrated organization. All of the titans of industry from the early twentieth century were linear businesses, including Standard Oil, General Motors (GM), U.S. Steel, General Electric, Walmart, Toyota, ExxonMobil, and on and on. Each of these companies created a product or service and sold it to a customer. In all of these examples, value flowed linearly and in one direction through the company’s supply chain. Hence the term “linear business.” In this supply chain, to the left of the company was cost and to the right was revenue. Linear companies created value in the form of goods or services and then sold them to someone downstream in the supply chain. (See Figure 1.1.) Historically, there were two main types of linear businesses. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=398))

- sells it to group A (the customer). The first is your classic product company. Think Lenovo in consumer electronics. Lenovo makes and sells physical things. It builds physical assets, such as factories and distribution centers, in order to make its products and get them to consumers. Almost all manufacturing has worked in this linear fashion over the last century. So have distributors and resellers, which are companies that build or lease physical assets or technologies in order to distribute and sell physical products. Examples include resellers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. Many of today’s software companies also fit in this group, including most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Even though their products are digital, these companies still function linearly, with value flowing from the companies to their customers. The only difference is that software companies benefit from the low marginal cost of digital distribution. The second type of linear business model is a services company. Examples range from Oracle to JP Morgan to Jiffy Lube. These companies hire employees who provide services to customers. Generally, services companies fall in one of two camps. The first kind makes and sells physical services. Your car mechanic and plumber both fall into this category. The second builds human capital or intangible assets, like intellectual property, and uses those assets to sell specialized services. This type of services company includes everyone from tax attorneys to investment bankers or management consultants. These models dominated the twentieth century for a good reason: They can be very efficient. Premised on top-down planning and hierarchical organizational models, these businesses create value and distribute it efficiently to their target customers. They achieved this efficiency via the supply chain, a highly structured system for organizing activities and resources that moved a product or service from the company to the customer. The supply chain is also linear, consisting of processes that are repeated over and over again to create value. Products move from the manufacturer downstream to distributors and then to customers. For example, a car manufacturer like GM buys parts from its suppliers, which in turn may have bought parts or raw materials from another supplier. GM then takes these parts and creates a finished product, in this… ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=416))

- Platforms now have a symbol to call their own. In Figure 1.3, the interlocked chevrons represent a platform’s network. The connection between the consumers and producers is what creates the shape outlining the platform at the center. Just like a platform, this internal shape is defined by network that surrounds it. Without its consumers and producers, the platform at the center wouldn’t exist. You will see this symbol throughout the book whenever we take an in-depth look at a particular platform business. We will use it to introduce the platform and show you who its consumers and producers are so that you have more context as we discuss the company. As in this example, the left chevron will always represent the platform’s consumers while the right chevron will represent… ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=460))

- Unlike Pets.com, eBay didn’t have any expensive warehouses or high shipping costs to deal with. That’s because eBay didn’t sell products from a centralized source. Omidyar wanted to make a different kind of business. “I wanted to do something different,” he said. “To give the individual the power to be a producer as well as a consumer.”11 Rather than taking possession of goods itself, eBay connected individuals to other individuals so that anyone could buy from or sell to anyone else. Rather than building inventory and resources, eBay provided the digital infrastructure for this marketplace to exist and… ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=475))

- Some old-school sellers struggled, as the arbitrage they’d been enjoying from buying goods in one country and selling them in another dried up. But countless more were able to turn hobbies or side businesses into a living. According to the company, millions of people worldwide make a living selling on eBay.13 As an economist would say, this outcome was socially efficient. eBay became a kind of stock market for everyday goods. By efficiently moving goods from sellers to those who value them most, eBay created enormous value for all of its users. Objects that might have languished in obscurity could now find their way to someone for whom they would be a prized possession. eBay indeed became the “perfect store” that Omiydar set out to make. Most tellingly, eBay was profitable from its first month all the way through to its successful IPO in 1998, and it enjoyed gross profit margins of more than 80 percent.14 Both of these stats were almost unheard of in the spendthrift days of the dot-com era, which is why eBay left e-commerce competitors like Pets.com in the dust. More than almost any other company at the time, eBay fully harnessed the potential of the Internet. eBay was, of course, a platform—the common thread among virtually all of the biggest Internet successes from the dot-com era, including Amazon, Angie’s List, Monster.com, Microsoft, Shutterfly, and Yahoo. As would become even clearer in the years ahead, the platform was the definitive business model of the Internet.

- Platforms have only continued to grow in influence and economic impact since eBay’s meteoric rise. eBay’s success wasn’t a fluke. It was a harbinger of the next wave of economic innovation and change. What exactly is a platform? A platform is a business model that facilitates the exchange of value between two or more user groups, a consumer and a producer (see Figure 1.3). In order to make these exchanges happen, platforms harness and create large, scalable networks of users and resources that can be accessed on demand. Platforms create communities and markets that allow users to interact and transact. The list of platforms has swelled in recent years, as processing power and Internet access have become more widespread. Each of these businesses simply connects producers and consumers to each other and allows them to exchange value. Think about what Uber does for taxis, what Airbnb does for vacation rentals, what Apple does for apps, and what YouTube does for videos. None of these companies is a traditional, linear business. They are all platforms. Like eBay, these businesses don’t directly create and control inventory via a supply chain the way linear businesses do. Platforms don’t, to use a common phrase, own the means of production—instead, they create the means of connection.

- However, not all of these businesses will be around ten years from now. In the wake of the dot-com crash, even some of the mainstays of the modern economy, like Amazon, nearly failed. The size and durability of the opportunity for any one of these businesses depends on many factors, including the state of its industry and how quickly technology evolves in that sector. But when these companies do fail, it will be because they have been replaced by newer and better platforms. This has already been the case for years. When Apple became the most valuable company in the United States, guess who it dethroned? Microsoft, whose Windows platform was supplanted by Apple’s iOS when the mobile Internet outgrew its desktop predecessor. As always, the cast of characters will change as technology evolves. But platforms are here to stay. Why? Because platform business models enable companies to expand at a pace unprecedented in human history. When a linear business gains a new customer, it adds only one new relationship—one buyer of products or services. When a platform adds a new user, that person doesn’t add just a single relationship but rather a potential relationship with all of the platform’s users. In other words, platforms grow exponentially rather than linearly. As a result, platform business models are far more cost-effective and higher scale than the old, linear models they are replacing.

- is what we mean: a holistic description of the way a company creates, delivers, and captures value, not just a piece of technology. But confusingly, in the tech world, “platform” has recently become a buzzword. Just about every startup these days claims that it’s building a platform. As a tactic to get funding or attention, this trick seems to meet with relative success. But very few of these businesses actually understand the model they are trying to emulate.

- Not surprisingly, almost none of these Uber imitators has made it very far. And the ones from the on-demand economy that have—including not just Uber and Airbnb, but also fast risers like Instacart and Handy—are all platforms. In most other cases, businesses that use the term “platform” incorrectly are using it to refer to a piece of technology rather than a business model. Here are a few examples: Computing platform: Underlying computer system ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=554))

- on which application programs can run (e.g., Symbian) Product platforms: Common design, formula, or versatile product, upon which a family or line of products is built (e.g., a car chassis used across many different models) Industry platform: Products, services or technologies that serve as foundations upon which complementary products, services, or technologies can be built (e.g., Intel) Platform as a service: Category of cloud computing services that provides computing platform and solution stack as an online service (e.g., Amazon Web Services) Each of these instances of the word “platform” refers to an underlying product or technology that allows modular components to be built on top of it. Platform business models often use this kind of modular modification, which is why the terms frequently are conflated. Finally, probably the most common misuse of the term “platform” is when it’s used to describe an integrated suite of software products. This is especially common among SaaS companies, which love to claim they have a complete “platform” for X. In such cases, the word “platform” really is just being used as a marketing term. As with all of the preceding examples, these SaaS companies are still linear businesses. They’re products, not networks, and as such, they don’t have the cost structure and underlying economics that make platform business models so successful today. We explore this distinction further in chapter 3, but for now, just remember: platform ≠ technology. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=558))

- Enter GitHub. It’s Facebook for nerds, Wikipedia for programmers, or Twitter for code, depending on whom you ask. In reality, it’s a little bit of all three: It’s a combination of a social networking platform for programmers and a Wiki-like content platform that lets you edit files and track who changes what. Anyone can comment on your code or add to it and improve it. You can follow particular pieces of code, organized in “repositories,” and get notified when any changes are made, in the same way you might follow someone on Twitter and get notified when they tweet.

- Transaction costs fall broadly into three main categories. First is search and information costs, which include the cost of finding a particular good. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=642))

- You can think of transaction costs broadly as pain-in-the-ass costs. All platforms reduce these costs in some way. For example, Google reduces the pain-in-the-ass cost of finding a website. Uber reduces the pain-in-the-ass cost of hailing a cab. Airbnb reduces the pain-in-the-ass cost of finding and booking a short-term rental. Facebook reduces the pain-in-the-ass cost of staying up-to-date and interacting with friends. PayPal reduces the pain-in-the-ass costs of sending digital payments. And so on.

- In fact, if you’re building a platform and trying to figure out what your core value proposition is, here’s a good formula. Figure out what the main activity is you’re trying to change and then put it in to this sentence: “X, no longer a pain the ass.” You should probably tweak the messaging a bit (after all, GitHub didn’t keep its original slogan for long), but this will get you started.

- In addition to reducing transaction costs, another key part of GitHub’s value proposition is that it provides an environment to manage and edit code. The platform is designed to encourage users to create, not just to transact. This is the second key aspect of what platforms do: They provide infrastructure that enables innovation in complementary products or services. On GitHub, these complements are code repositories. The more repositories that users create, the more valuable GitHub will be as a platform. So GitHub provides the basic infrastructure that makes it easy for software developers to host and manage open-source projects, including version tracking, editing, and communication. These tools are designed to help people create and edit code, because ultimately GitHub’s fundamental value lies in how it facilitates the creation and editing of code repositories.

- Apple’s iOS platform is very similar. Just as GitHub needs to attract developers who will create repositories, iOS has to attract developers who will make apps. To encourage this, Apple provides a cheap software development kit and many developer application program interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to tap into the core functionality provided by the device. A big part of the value that iOS provides to developers is that it allows them to easily access and combine the phone’s many capabilities to create new experiences, from Candy Crush to Snapchat to Tinder. The developers of all of these apps used iOS as a platform to create something new. Remember Apple’s old slogan: “There’s an app for that.” Apple knew early on that a large part of the value of the iPhone wasn’t just in the phone itself but rather in the new experiences that it enabled developers to build for users. The GitHub equivalent would be “There’s a repository for that.” If you’re looking for any kind of software project, chances are you’ll find it on GitHub. In a nutshell, all platforms do two things: reduce transaction costs and enable complementary innovation. Combined, these two value propositions can have a profound impact. They can disrupt existing industries, as Uber with taxis, or they can create entirely new ones, as Apple did with mobile apps. Before GitHub, there was no market for paid Git hosting. By building a platform, GitHub created that market. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=666))

- A platform ultimately enables this value creation by facilitating transactions. While a linear business creates value by manufacturing products or services, platforms create value by building connections and “manufacturing” transactions. If you think of General Motors as a manufacturer that produces cars, then in a simplistic sense, Uber is a manufacturer that produces transactions between drivers and riders. Uber doesn’t actually deliver the ride, but it facilitates the connection and exchange of value between drivers and passengers. The transaction that is at the heart of the platform is called the core transaction (see Figure 1.5). The core transaction is the platform’s “factory”—the way it manufactures value for its users. It is the process that turns potential connections into transactions. Getting the core transaction right is the most important piece of platform design, as the platform will need its users to repeat this process over and over to generate and exchange value. Figure 1.5 The core transaction. However, although a platform enables the core transaction, it doesn’t directly control its users’ behaviors. The challenge is a unique one: how to get potentially millions of people to behave the way you want them to. First you must attract users to join, then you aid them by matching them together, providing the technology to facilitate the transaction and establishing the rules that govern the network in order to build trust and maintain quality. These are the four core functions of a platform (see Figure 1.6): Audience building Matchmaking Providing core tools and services Setting rules and standards ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=678))

- Compare a platform like Alibaba to one like iOS, and you’ll notice that their core values are different. Some platforms are more focused on reducing transaction costs, like Alibaba, while others actually provide the underlying infrastructure that enables their users to create. Examples of the latter include development platforms like iOS and Android as well as content platforms like Medium (a platform where anyone can post articles or blog posts) and YouTube. GitHub is another example. Each of these platforms provides the tools and infrastructure for producers to create software, written content, videos, or code, respectively. Contrast these platforms with platforms like Alibaba, Uber, and Airbnb, which are much more focused on facilitating a direct exchange, and you’ll see the difference. The key difference is between platforms that provide value primarily by optimizing exchanges directly between a consumer and a producer and platforms that generate value by enabling producers to create complementary products and broadcast or distribute them to a… ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=699))

- Matching a platform’s design to its type is essential to its success. Platforms that don’t get this right tend to get left behind by the competition. Within services marketplaces, TaskRabbit is a good example. TaskRabbit was one of the first big services marketplaces in the United States. It allows you to hire a “tasker” to do odd jobs, such as cleaning or home repair. However, TaskRabbit acts like a noncommoditized services platform in a commoditized industry. It initially built itself around an auction model, in which users would post tasks to the platform and contractors would seek out and bid on tasks they wanted to complete. If this sounds like an onerous process, you’re right. It was. The company eventually realized it had gotten the core transaction wrong, and in July 2014, it replaced its auction model with more simple and transparent pricing. In the new model, a consumer is offered a choice of three different producers with a listing of their hourly prices and experience levels and is able to order services on demand, rather than having to wait for bids to come in. This change was a step in the right direction for TaskRabbit. But the update didn’t get everything right, as it still lacked control over pricing. Commoditized services marketplaces should be responsible for setting prices to ensure its users receive the optimal price. If you look at other commoditized services platforms, such as Handy, Lyft, and Glamsquad (an Applico client), consistent and transparent pricing is a core part of their ability to deliver seamless matching. Because TaskRabbit did a poor job at facilitating its core transaction, the platform has been surpassed by upstart competitors, such as Handy. Not surprisingly, Handy puts much more structure around pricing and requesting services than TaskRabbit has. The result is a better user experience and a more seamless transaction model that has helped propel the platform to its position as the leading marketplace for in-home services in the United States.

But it’s easy to miss the role that technology plays in this process, partly because technological change is gradual.

- For example, the rise of “showrooming”—the practice of visiting a store to examine a product before buying it online at a lower price—allows consumers to identify better, cheaper products. Consumers can also recommend products to thousands of “friends” and publicly express their dissatisfaction when something goes wrong. As a result, consumers add value to the purchasing process in ways that were impossible before. Consumers are no longer limited to the products and information that local stores put in front of them. Information no longer flows in one direction. This simple change has huge ramifications for how businesses operate. And technology is the primary reason this change has occurred. Whenever a “tool” wields that kind of power, it warrants special attention. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=834))

- The rise of platforms invites us to carefully examine the intricate interaction among technology, the economy, and society, particularly how assumptions about technology underpin some of what are usually thought of as basic laws of economics and business strategy. What we’ve seen over the last half century is that changes in technology—and just as important, changes in how people use technology—can fundamentally alter the basic tenets of economic reality.

- Our story starts with an age-old problem: What’s the best way to organize an economy? Should economies be centrally organized, or decentralized and orchestrated through market activity? In many ways, the twentieth century was a giant war over this question. Governments and businesses alike fought to validate their view of economic and social reality. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s appeared to deliver the decisive blow in the argument, but for a long time the answer was not so clear.

- The core argument in favor of markets was always that they were more efficient than central planning. In the United States, we take that as gospel, but is it actually true? Under the right conditions, markets can be perfectly efficient in organizing economic activity. However, economists also had to make a number of major assumptions for the argument to work. Chief among these assumptions was the idea of “perfect information.” This notion assumed that every participant had complete knowledge of all relevant factors in the market at all times. Producers understood all of the same production techniques as other producers, and both buyers and sellers knew all the prices being charged by other sellers. There could be no “information asymmetries” wherein one individual possessed market information that others did not. If this idea doesn’t sound remotely realistic, that’s because it isn’t. In the real economy, imperfect information is the norm. More surprisingly, it turns out that under the conditions of perfect information, there is no difference between the efficiency of markets and of central planning. In fact, in 1975, Soviet professor Leonid Kantorovich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in part because his work, The Best Use of Resources, proved the functional equivalency of perfect markets and perfect planning.2 In an economy with perfect information, a central planner can allocate resources just as efficiently as a market can. Intuitively, this makes sense: If you know everything about an economy, you can figure out how to allocate resources efficiently. An omniscient central planner would just have to take into account all existing information and determine how to allocate resources in the best way possible—exactly what many economists argued that only markets could do.

- Coase’s theory had important implications for business strategy. It suggested that as an organization grew, it would be able to minimize information and transaction costs by internalizing actions it could handle more efficiently and by externalizing those it could not. This dynamic led to tremendous economies of scale, a concept made famous by Boston Consulting Group founder Bruce Henderson. Henderson took an idea from military strategy—concentrating mass to overwhelm the enemy—and applied it to business. His observation was fairly simple: The more of something you produce, the better you get at it. But Henderson’s idea of economies of scale and the “experience curve” enabled managers to conceptualize the relationship between size and efficiency (see Figure 2.2). ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=939))

- According to Henderson, a company’s efficiency per unit produced increased by as much as 25 percent every time it doubled its production volume.7 Henderson applied this logic as a way for businesses to achieve a competitive advantage. His concept suggests that the company with the largest market share would also have a big cost advantage compared to its competitors. A few years later, Harvard professor Michael Porter added another important idea to Henderson’s observations—the notion of the value chain. Porter basically agreed with Henderson’s ideas, but he qualified them by noting that businesses were not monolithic entities. An organization was made up of multiple components, and it was advantaged in some areas and disadvantaged in others. The combination of these different components created what Porter called the value chain. Introduced in his book Competitive Advantage, the value chain was a tool intended to be used for competitive analysis. The value chain enabled a business to systematically break its organization down into a set of core activities and to understand how they fit together into one coherent system that took inputs and created more valuable outputs (see Figure 2.3). This idea fit nicely into Coase’s theory of how businesses work. The purpose of value chain analysis was to design the optimal combination of links in the value chain so that you got the most value for the least cost. Ultimately, transaction costs were what held together the entire value chain. Businesses combined the different activities in the value chain because the transaction costs of handling them externally meant that it was more efficient to integrate these activities internally. By creating the optimal combination of activities, you would create a coherent system—a value chain—that would allow you to create and sustain a competitive advantage against your industry rivals.

- Porter’s value chain and Henderson’s economies of scale have been the core tenets of business strategy for the last thirty years. Together, they became the strategic foundation of the large, vertically integrated organizations of the late twentieth century. However, even in these large organizations, Hayek’s local knowledge problem reared its head. The coordination problems related to local knowledge that Hayek described are a primary reason why Henderson’s economies-of-scale graph is U-shaped (see Figure 2.4).

- As a result, most large companies facing competitive pressures (i.e., those that were not granted government-sponsored monopolies) cap out at a size well below total control of their respective markets. Beyond a certain point, growth costs more than it’s worth. This fact fits neatly into Hayek’s concept of why markets were effective. On a small scale, you could coordinate economic activity effectively. But if a company grew too big, it wouldn’t be able to collect and react to all the information it needed to make accurate decisions. As a result, costs would rise, and the company would not be able to expand further in a competitive… ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=971))

- Over time, these incremental but constant improvements in processing power had a big impact on computing technology. Exponential growth starts slow, but as it compounds, it starts to increase rapidly. Over a few decades, computer chips became very small and very fast compared to their predecessors in 1965. These chips also got much cheaper to produce. To put this in context, your smartphone today is about 1 million times cheaper, 1,000 times more powerful, and about 100,000 times smaller than the one computer at MIT in 1965.

- Why were these changes so important? Information processing and storage costs are important parts of transaction costs. When these costs decline, the potential size of organizations increases. Intuitively this makes sense. With faster information processing and more information storage, you can manage a larger amount of information. But when processing costs fall, transaction costs also decline. Remember that transaction costs were the glue that held together a company’s value chain and determined what activities an organization internalized. As processing speeds radically increased and transaction costs fell at the end of the twentieth century, some value chains began to break up. With lower transaction costs, there was less need for vertically integrated organizations. Smaller, more agile competitors started to outmaneuver their larger, older rivals. A smaller competitor could attack one piece of an incumbent company’s value chain and disintermediate it or provide the same quality offering at a much lower price (see Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5. As transaction costs fell, value chains broke up, and smaller competitors could attack one component of your business. This is exactly what happened to the encyclopedia industry. In the days of large, leather-bound books, the encyclopedia business was dependent on large sales forces in order to sell its product. A big chunk of the price of an encyclopedia went to paying the salesman’s commission. When personal computers became widespread, new technologies made it much easier and cheaper to hold all of that information in one place. You no longer needed a large sales force to go door-to-door lugging around and selling large sets of books. You could just send your customer a CD in the mail. This meant that Microsoft could sell its Encyclopedia Encarta on CD-ROM for $50, while Britannica’s big set of books cost between $1,500 and $2,000.9 Britannica eventually introduced its own CD-ROM, but its large sales force, once an essential asset and a core part of the company’s value chain, was suddenly a massive liability.

- However, even with all of this processing power, computers alone still couldn’t deliver on Lange’s promise of a more centralized economy. Although computers had the potential to solve one of the problems Hayek posed—storing and processing large amounts of information simultaneously—they still didn’t address the issue of how to gather and transmit all the necessary data in the first place. The Internet started to change all of this. In the 1990s, the Internet and the World Wide Web ushered in a new era of connectivity and networked, decentralized communication. This was a fundamental shift from the informational paradigm of the rest of the twentieth century, which was dominated by centralized, hierarchical, and top-down institutions with similarly centralized, hierarchical, and top-down flows of information. The decentralized Web gave individuals unprecedented access to information and ushered in a new wave of businesses inspired by what seemed like limitless opportunity. However, this new informational paradigm required a new business model, which many entrepreneurs and investors didn’t understand at the time. The business environment after the arrival of the Internet was fundamentally different from anything that came before. Yet many of these new businesses simply used traditional business models and set up a website as the distribution mechanism, with the expectation that the Internet would make business models work at scale because of “network effects”—even though it wasn’t clear what those network effects were or how they would help improve the business’s cost structure. Pets.com, which we talked about in chapter 1, is the most infamous example. But others, including Kozmo.com, Webvan, and Garden.com, eventually went under for similar reasons. The tremendous crash that followed the initial rush of enthusiasm was a testament to this failure of thinking. Timing also was an issue. Although enthusiasm for the Internet was high, Internet use during the dot-com era wasn’t as widespread as the hype suggested. Many took these early, high-profile failures as a sign that the Internet was overhyped and destined to fall short of its world-changing expectations. For example, in 1998 Nobel Prize winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman famously suggested that the Internet would… ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1022))

Together, these four changes have created a Connected Revolution, an economic and social transformation wherein the dynamics that drove the organizations of the twentieth century no longer apply. Let’s take a closer look at why. The Democratization of Processing Power and Computer Storage Advances in technology have made computing a commodity. Computers are now cheap and widely available. Members of previous generations could have counted the number of computing devices they owned on one hand, but by the time today’s kids reach adulthood, they won’t be able to keep track. From factories to toys or food, computers are fast becoming essential to almost everything we do, make, and consume.

The Declining Cost of Communication The cost of transmitting and storing information has tumbled. As a result, barriers to entry in business have fallen, and the one-way broadcast paradigm exhibited by TV and radio companies of the Industrial Revolution has given way to networked communication. Discovering and transmitting information became frictionless and cheap. Activities that typically happened within the bounds of one organization can now take place in a decentralized manner through networks. The Rise of Ubiquitous Connectivity and Sensors With the advent of the smartphone, almost everyone now carries over half a dozen tiny sensors wherever they go. The result has been the ability to collect more and more kinds of data than ever before. Most of that new data is collected by these sensors and transmitted by connected technology. The ease with which this information is collected and distributed would have been unthinkable only a decade ago. And the rate at which we’re producing this new data is only increasing each year.

- Let’s take a second to unpack why all of these changes have been so important. First, thanks to the rapid advances in computer processing, individuals now have access to processing power and technologies that were once available only to large organizations. The result has been widespread access to cheap, easy-to-use professional tools. This change has empowered individuals to become producers of value on a whole new scale. Second, the declining cost of communication has made it much easier to share all of that value with other people. The falling cost and rising speed of data transmission have meant that individuals who have never met before can now cost-effectively communicate with each other well enough to accomplish complex tasks. They also can develop the trust needed to collaborate or facilitate exchanges. Contrary to what Krugman suggested during the dot-com era, it turned out that, given the opportunity, people wanted to talk to each other—a lot.

TIME magazine even named “You” the person of the year in 2006, a reference to all of the people who created content on social networking and content platforms online. Mobile tech accelerated these trends even further by moving the Internet from an isolated activity that happened at home to something you brought with you and engaged with everywhere. Suddenly, there was a big shift in where value was made in our economy. Businesses were no longer the sole source of value creation. Consumers were creating value and sharing it with each other. The quintessential example of this change was Wikipedia. Remember the earlier example of how increases in processing power enabled the shift from the hard-copy Encyclopaedia Britannica to the cheaper, more efficient CD-ROMs? This change happened because as processing power increased and storage prices declined, the costs of distribution greatly decreased. The Internet continued this trend, making distribution even cheaper. However, Wikipedia took this shift one step further.

In effect, individuals became competitors to many large linear businesses rather than just their customers.

- into separate components, as they did during the early computer era. Pieces of the value chain actually started to fragment or fall apart (see Figure 2.7). Individuals acting in decentralized networks could now substitute for entire organizations. Figure 2.7. The value chain becomes fragmented as individuals take over for organizations. In the past, companies were effective because they vastly improved how we organized work. This idea is the crux of Coase’s theory of the firm. Companies could coordinate the usage of employees and materials to create products and services more efficiently than the market could. In certain industries, such as the production of heavy machinery, these assumptions still hold true (though this could change quickly with the consumerization of new technologies, such as three-dimensional, or 3D, printing). But in many industries today, the most important resources often are not the ones that reside within any one organization but rather those that exist outside of it. In this new environment, Henderson’s and Porter’s theories no longer apply. The aggregator and creator of business value is no longer a company’s supply chain or value chain but rather a network’s ecosystem. Value has moved from creating products and services to facilitating connections between external producers and consumers. The firm has collapsed as a center of production and instead has become the center of exchange. The areas where businesses could create and add economic value have shifted away from production and toward the curation and management of networks. That’s where platform businesses come in. As it turns out, these decentralized networks don’t form and grow all by themselves. It usually takes an organization acting as the primary node in that network to grow and coordinate all of that activity on a large scale. These platform businesses don’t operate the way traditional organizations did. Rather than investing in internal resources—such as employees, factories, or warehouses—platforms create value by coordinating these large external networks of consumers and… ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1108))

- That many would think of this as a contradiction is mostly a result of historical ideology rather than present-day fact. For example, consider the product marketplaces created by eBay or a company like Alibaba, or the content networks created by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, or the information and software marketplaces created by Google and Apple. All of these networks enable millions of individuals and companies to interact, but they are built and coordinated by a central entity. The simultaneous rise of big data and ubiquitous connectivity and sensors, our third and fourth changes, come in here. Hayek lived in a world of siloed information. The cost of communication and processing power limited the amount of information that could be collected and distributed over long distances. It simply wasn’t possible to collect enough information to coordinate a large economy effectively, certainly not with any useful speed. In Hayek’s world, his “man on the ground” was an information island unto himself, separated from and unable to relay his local knowledge to any central planner. Besides, even if he could transmit such knowledge, there wasn’t enough processing power available to make sense of it all.… ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1130))

- sensors are what enable you to track your runs, find directions on a map, take photos, or scan your fingerprint. The result has been a proverbial flood of information. The magnitude of this change can’t be overstated. IBM estimated in 2013 that 90 percent of the world’s information was less than two years old.11 Most of this information was created and consumed online. Contrary to how people lived throughout most of human history, today siloed information has become the exception rather than the norm. However, the change is only just beginning. Market research firm IDC estimates that the world’s data will grow by as much as forty times its 2015 level by 2020.12 But now, thanks to so-called big data analysis, businesses can start to make sense of all of this new information. In the past, data was something you had to go out and gather. You had to create distinct processes to measure and collect information on a business. In each case, typically you’d have a population that was well defined and a straightforward question you were trying to answer, and the data you collected would fit nicely into a spreadsheet. Today, data is no longer something you go out and get. “Data is collected… ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1140))

- data analysis allows businesses to make sense of large, chaotic data sets in real time. Businesses also can understand entirely new types of data, including audio files, photos, and videos, as well as unstructured data such as text documents, behavioral patterns, and natural language. This ability to organize and make sense of large amounts of data in real time has dissolved Hayek’s final objections to centralization. In the long run, Oskar Lange was right. Algorithms run on computers and trained on previously unmanageable amounts of data can now coordinate large amounts of economic activity, just as Lange predicted. The ability to coordinate economic activity efficiently has scaled beyond the boundaries of the traditional firm. Remember, price itself was a data point used to coordinate economic activity—it just happened to be the easiest data point to collect. Today, technology enables businesses to collect and track much more granular data about far more kinds of activity than ever before. As a result, platforms can now create and manage networks that facilitate entirely new categories of economic and social activities. For instance, on August 27, 2015, Facebook served an unprecedented 1 billion users in a single day.14 Similarly, between March 2014 and March 2015, Alibaba’s marketplaces facilitated a previously unfathomable amount of economic activity in China by coordinating 350 million consumers and nearly 10 million merchants.15 Only recently did these kinds of businesses become economically and technologically feasible. Lenin Loves Google The Connected Revolution has blown apart the key assumptions underlying Bruce Henderson’s concept economies of scale and Michael Porter’s value chain. Beyond the realm of business strategy, these changes also have fundamentally altered the way our economy works. Taken together, they have invalidated Hayek’s assertion that a central planner can’t organize large-scale economic activity. Today, that’s precisely what’s happening to increasingly large sections of our economy. The only difference is that the central planner is not a government bureaucrat. Rather it’s a set of algorithms and software tools operated by a platform in order to manage and grow a decentralized network. In truth, the core ideas underlying how we thought about business strategy and the economy were based on deeply embedded… ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1152))

- usually measure the hard assets and things that the business can more or less directly control. These factors won’t measure the true value of platforms. With Uber, for example, practically all of the value it creates comes from transactions it facilitates between people who exist outside the company. Its network is what makes the company valuable. The same is true for all platforms. By creating and orchestrating these large networks, platforms are unlocking new, untapped economic and social value. These markets and communities wouldn’t exist or spring into existence in a vacuum—the platform had to build and manage them. In essence, platforms are correcting for market failures. This isn’t a new phenomenon. In the financial sector, economic exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, have served in this capacity for centuries. What’s new is that platforms are now extending into more and more areas of our existence, and at a scale that was previously unthinkable. As a result, today’s most valuable businesses have become what Hayek once deemed impossible: centralized organizations that can understand and react in real time to what’s happening throughout a large, decentralized economy. Local knowledge is local no more. What is Google Search, for instance, but an enormous, centrally planned economy of content and information? In a manner of speaking, Google is now creating the socialist utopia that all the might of Soviet Russia could not. That you don’t think of Google in this way is basically just a matter of marketing and ideology. Google makes you feel empowered, even though it’s telling you what you want. Uber makes you happy, even though its selects your car for you and picks the route your driver should take to your destination. All of this economic activity is being centrally planned and orchestrated by computers running algorithms—and it seems to bother no one. Nor should it. It turns out that people don’t have any problem with central planning in principle—they just don’t like bad central planning. Today’s technology enables platform businesses to step in and create these centrally orchestrated markets where the “free market” failed to do so. As a result, they create entirely new markets or greatly expand old ones. Now, Google isn’t perfect by any means—what it “recommends” isn’t always right—nor does it… ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1176))

- largely a relic of Cold War–era thinking and outdated ideologies. PayPal founder and former CEO Peter Thiel describes the phenomenon in his 2014 book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. “Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist breadlines,” Thiel said. “More than anything else, competition is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking.”16 In reality, he said, “capitalism and competition are opposites.” The companies that are driving our economy today and that will be in the future are the kind of “monopolies” that Thiel described in his book. In fact, most of the companies he described—including Google, Twitter, and PayPal—are platform companies. These monopolies “give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world,” Thiel said. This is precisely what platforms do. Linear businesses can still create value, but today platforms create more. They create entirely new networks of economic and social activity where it wouldn’t exist otherwise. As a result, they centrally orchestrate large amounts of new economic activity. Social networks existed informally before Facebook came along. But Facebook centralized all of these networks into one platform in order to facilitate more connections and interactions between people. In essence, Facebook built a marketplace for social interaction. As a result, billions of people today are connected who wouldn’t be otherwise. Although some people may not like how Facebook handles its users’ data, the company undoubtedly has created an enormous amount of economic and social value beyond what it earns as profit. The impact of platform companies will be felt even more strongly in countries with less established economic infrastructure. For example, Alibaba has helped create a significant amount of China’s growing digital economy. By one estimate, its marketplaces are responsible for as much as 70 percent of the shipping activity within China. Additionally, Alibaba’s payments platform, Alipay, is responsible for half of all online transactions in China. It processes more than $500 billion in transactions annually, which is twenty times more than the amount handled by China UnionPay, the state-owned company with a government-granted monopoly over China’s bank-card authorization system.17 Alibaba… ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1198))

- Fred Wilson, founder of Union Square Ventures (USV), is a renowned investor and venture capitalist. His firm has invested in many platform companies, including Twitter, Etsy, Lending Club, Tumblr, Foursquare, SoundCloud, and Kickstarter. To explain his company’s investment thesis, he has told what he called the “dentist office software story.” The story, “a modern day fable about defensibility in the software business,”1 begins with an entrepreneur who’s tired of having long waits at the dentist’s office. So, in typical entrepreneur fashion, this person decides to build management software for dentists’ offices. He brings it to market and sells it at a price of $25,000 per year for each office. Even though the software is expensive, “dentists realize significant cost savings after deploying the system. The company, Dentasoft, grows quickly into a $10mm annual revenue business, goes public, and trades up to a billion dollar valuation.”2 But the story doesn’t end there. Next, two young entrepreneurs go to startup accelerator Y Combinator and create a low-cost version of Dentasoft. Their product, Dent.io, includes more modern software and a mobile app that allow dentists to manage their offices remotely. Dent.io gets to market quickly at a price point of $5,000 per year. Many dentists switch to the newer, cheaper entrant. Dentasoft misses its quarterly forecast, and its stock crashes. Meanwhile, “Dent.io does a growth round from Sequoia and hires a CEO.” Next, an open-source software project called DentOps springs to life. A hosted version of this project called DentHub becomes popular. Dentasoft files for bankruptcy. Dent.io struggles, and the company fires its CEO. The point of this story, Wilson explained, is that “software alone is a commodity. There is nothing stopping anyone from copying the feature set, making it better, cheaper, and faster.” This is where USV’s investment thesis comes in. USV realized it did not want to invest in commodity software, so Wilson and his partners asked, “What will provide defensibility?” The answer: “Networks of users, transactions, or data,” Wilson explained. “That led us to social media, to Delicious, Tumblr, and Twitter. And marketplaces like Etsy, Lending Club, and Kickstarter.” One of USV’s partners, Albert Wenger, has created an alternative ending for this story. In his version, a dentist named Hoff Reidman “decides that he wants to network with other dentists.” He creates a site called Dentistry.com. He hustles to get initial traction, and the site takes off. USV does a small seed round of $1 million. The founder creates a product roadmap that “allows patients to have profiles on Dentistry.com where they can keep their dental records, book appointments, and keep track of their dental health. It also includes mobile apps for patients to remind them to floss and brush at least twice a day.” The platform is free to use for anyone and monetizes through a combination of advertising and taking a cut of the… ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1230))

- You’re Going to Need a Bigger Moat It seems Wilson was correct that software alone is a commodity. In the language of legendary investor Warren Buffet, pure software companies don’t have an effective “moat” to defend their business; it’s easy for competitors to storm the barricades and overwhelm them. Since most software industries have relatively low barriers to entry—especially today, when startup costs are lower than ever—it’s practically guaranteed that a competitor will come along and offer customers similar software that’s either better or cheaper. That’s where network effects come in. Put very simply, a network effect is present when the behavior of one user has a direct impact on the value that other users will get out of the same service. Network effects make a platform more useful and more valuable as more people use it. We discuss network effects in more detail in chapter 4, but their presence means that when competing with a successful platform, you aren’t competing simply on the strength of your product and its features. You also are competing with the platform’s ability to support an entire community of consumers and producers as well as all the value they exchange. This community is a core part of a platform’s value that isolated products don’t provide. Networks are much harder to duplicate than features are. As we saw when Nokia and BlackBerry lost out to Apple and Google, any features that their phones could offer were far less valuable than the value a consumer received from a large community of app developers. Network effects are “the strongest economic moat of all,” Bill Gurley, of venture capital firm Benchmark, has said.7 Talking heads have been speculating about Facebook’s decline for years, especially with the rise of new social media companies like Twitter and Snapchat and the shift on smartphones from social networks to messaging platforms. Yet as of this writing, Facebook has beaten Wall Street projections in eleven of the last twelve quarters, and its Facebook Messenger platform has taken off, acquiring more than 500 million users within a couple years’ time. Its big acquisitions, WhatsApp and Instagram, have also continued to grow significantly since joining Facebook.8 Apparently having a network with 1.5 billion active users is a hell of a moat. Investors Love Platforms As Fred Wilson’s story suggests, investors love platforms. Successful platforms have strong moats in the form of their networks and operate at a scale that positions them to dominate their industries. It’s no wonder, then, that platforms are worth more than linear businesses. According to our research, investors value platforms more highly than their linear equivalents. Looking at the S&P 500, pure platform businesses or businesses for which a platform is a significant part of their business have an average revenue multiple of 8.9. In contrast, linear businesses are valued between two to four times revenue on average, depending on their business… ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1288))

- Obviously, not all of these unicorn companies will survive. But the trends in both public and private markets show that platform businesses are quickly overtaking linear companies. In particular, the huge shift toward platforms among unicorn startups suggests that the next wave of large public companies worldwide will be mostly platforms. The Zero-Marginal-Cost Company Network effects are only a part of why platform business models are so powerful today. To see the whole picture, we need to take a deeper look at the cost and profit structures that underlie the platform business model. Let’s start with the economics of information goods, such as apps, music, or ebooks. If you create an app, it might cost $250,000 to produce the original version. But creating a copy of that app will cost next to nothing. In the language of economics, the app has close to zero marginal cost. Thanks to the Internet and connected technology, information goods today have a near-zero marginal cost of distribution. The cost to serve one additional customer is basically zero. But as we saw in chapter 2, even with this shift toward zero-marginal-cost information goods, a linear business like the Encyclopaedia Britannica is still constrained in terms of how large it can scale because of the high fixed costs of production. It costs a lot to gather all of that information and have it professionally written and curated into an encyclopedia. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1353))

- Some of the first companies to capitalize on this shift toward the low cost of distribution over the Internet were SaaS companies. Rather than building and maintaining a physical server that the customer would have to pay for in order to host the software system, SaaS companies just distribute their software over the Internet at zero marginal cost. Still, the cost of creating the initial application is high, and if the company wants to expand its business, it needs to create additional modules to sell in order to create more inventory. In other words, it has to incur more large, up-front costs. Platforms take this dynamic one step further. They remove the high fixed cost of creation and extend zero marginal costs to the supply side of the business. To add more entries to Wikipedia or to improve existing ones, the company doesn’t hire another researcher. It just needs a user to create a page or make an edit. Although there still is an up-front cost involved in building the software product, the platform has a much more efficient business model as it grows. In fact, it becomes exponentially more efficient the larger it becomes. The implications of this change are enormous. In the twentieth century, successfully scaling a business depended on finding channels that drastically lowered the cost of creating demand and lowering the cost of supply. The Internet itself alleviated some of the high fixed costs to launch a business as reaching large audiences became much easier and cheaper. But linear business models still face the marginal cost challenge, forcing them to economize on the cost of supply in order to compete. As we discussed in chapter 2, the whole concept of Michael Porter’s value chain is built around the idea of combining activities to create the most value for the smallest cost—in other words, reducing the cost of production. This constraint was the inspiration for many of the most important business innovations of the twentieth century, including the assembly line, which improved the efficiency of production. Also included are less-heralded innovations, such as chain stores, which created economies of scale and reduced costs, and franchising, which externalized much of the up-front cost of creating a new store. The more recently created process of just-in-time production also focused on reducing waste and the dead-weight cost of holding inventory. In short, all of these innovations were focused on reducing the cost of production for linear businesses. Linear businesses generally grow by adding staff or physical assets, or both. Because these tactics create value by controlling production, linear companies have to invest significant resources in expanding their capacity in order to sell more inventory. But physical assets and employees don’t scale well. Networks do. Platforms require much less capital expenditure to be successful at scale. They also require far fewer internal resources than linear businesses do. For example, platform… ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1365))

- Airbnb, and LinkedIn each run their global operations with fewer than 8,000 employees. Similarly, Alibaba had fewer than 35,000 employees at the beginning of 2015. In contrast, Walmart, which has a total sales volume similar to Alibaba, has over 2 million employees. Platforms eliminate the marginal cost of production by just focusing on facilitating connections. The network handles production. Uber doesn’t own and operate a fleet of taxis, Alibaba doesn’t own factories that produce the goods it makes available online, Google doesn’t create the Web pages it indexes, and YouTube doesn’t create the millions of videos it hosts. Platforms are the natural business model of the Internet: They are pure zero-marginal-cost information businesses. They use data to facilitate transactions and enable networked production. The low marginal cost of production means that expenses don’t grow as fast as revenue does. These changes have major implications for linear companies. Platforms can scale cheaply and easily and will increasingly leave behind their linear counterparts. Look at Hyatt, for example. Hyatt can sell room reservations online through its website and online travel sites. However, to create more inventory beyond its current capacity, the company needs to build a new hotel—no small cost. When Airbnb wants to add more rooms, it just needs someone to create a new listing on its website. This costs the platform next to nothing. Because the platform doesn’t own production, it doesn’t need all the resources that go into creating inventory. This networked production radically changes the cost structure of a business and alters the amount of internal resources it needs in order to create value. As a result, the marginal cost of supply drops to zero and its potential market size explodes (see Figure 3.4). Figure 3.4. Platform business models have lower marginal costs. This cost structure means that platforms are capital light and provide high return on investment… ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1387))

- The unit economics make it theoretically possible for a platform company to expand to the total size of the market—unlike linear businesses, which, as we explained in chapter 2, typically capped out well below the total market size. Being able to grow and manage a large network has become more important than having a large capital base to invest in scaling internal resources. So why isn’t everyone building a platform? Well, networked production creates unique challenges. As mentioned, Airbnb doesn’t have direct control over inventory and doesn’t own its most valuable assets: its users. The risks for a platform are substantial, especially when it’s first starting to build its network. In order to be useful to consumers, Airbnb needed to convince external producers to make their inventory available on its platform. This issue was a particularly difficult challenge when the platform had few users. Even though members of each group of users (consumers and hosts) would benefit from being on the platform, they wouldn’t join Airbnb unless enough members of the other group join as well.

- Although linear businesses can start generating revenue right away, platforms usually can’t, owing to the chicken-and-egg problem. When a platform has few users, it doesn’t deliver enough value or facilitate enough transactions to generate a lot of revenue. But as a platform’s network grows, revenue begins to grow much more rapidly than costs. As this happens, the cost of user acquisition declines and the value the platform creates starts to reach the bottom line. This was the experience of OpenTable, a platform for booking restaurant reservations, as it grew its network of restaurants and diners. “The more supply you had, the easier it was to add diners,” OpenTable CEO Matthew Roberts said. “And the more diners you had, the easier it was to add restaurants.” As a result, “All of our cost structure goes down as we get more mature in every market,” Roberts said.15 The ultimate impact of the network effect is that it enables more transactions. With Uber, a larger network allows the company to lower prices and wait times. Drivers can earn a similar amount of money even though prices are lower since demand from consumers is higher. With more drivers, consumers can get picked up faster and are more likely to use the platform. The end result is more transactions and more revenue. Networked Value: How Handy Outlasted the Competition Handy—services marketplace platform Handy is an on-demand home cleaning and services platform that has a presence in thirty-five cities across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada as of the beginning of 2016. The platform connects consumers with screened professionals who provide household services, such as home cleaning, painting, moving, and the like. Handy manages bookings and payments and offers money-back guarantees to the thousands of customers who use its site every week. Early on, Handy set a goal of building network effects to give itself a competitive advantage. “The strategy was to continuously raise the bar for consumer expectations,” according to Handy founder and CEO Oisin Hanrahan. “If your competitors are known for providing services in two days, you stand to earn a competitive advantage by reducing that lag to one day or even same day if possible. You’re creating a new type of value for consumers, which will help growth and retention. But you’re also pressuring the competition.” However, there was a reason… ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1425))

- Because platforms’ margins increase as their networks grow, only one or two platforms will dominate an industry as the market matures. As a result, there often are fierce battles among platforms competing for dominance. “There’s no openness between two competing platforms,” according to Ming Zeng, who has been the chief strategy officer for Alibaba since 2002. He compared interplatform competition to a fight between warring nations.1 Zeng is no stranger to interplatform wars. He has been a core part of Alibaba’s team through the company’s battle with eBay in the early 2000s and its fight with Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine, at the end of the decade. Shortly after Alibaba launched Taobao in 2003, eBay entered the market with “an unstoppable determination to be number one in China,” according to then-eBay CEO Meg Whitman.2 eBay invested hundreds of millions in EachNet, which at the time was China’s leading online auctions site. This acquisition made eBay the dominant e-commerce platform in China. But eBay-EachNet made the mistake of introducing transaction fees for sellers right away. In an effort to generate the increased profits that Wall Street investors were demanding, eBay wanted to replicate in China its fee-based model from the United States. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma decided to go all in on the company’s efforts to defeat eBay. As Ma famously said, “eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I am a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean, we lose—but if we fight in the river, we win.”3 Alibaba promised to keep Taobao free for its first three years of operation. By allowing users to transact for free, Taobao gained a big edge in the price-sensitive Chinese market. Additionally, thanks to its free-to-transact model, Alibaba was able to build much stronger network effects in China than eBay could. Because eBay charged a percentage fee for each completed transaction, it couldn’t allow buyers and sellers on EachNet to communicate before completing a transaction. Otherwise, they might complete their transaction outside of the platform. Alibaba had no such problem. Taobao introduced its hugely successful Wangwang chat service to allow buyers and sellers to communicate before completing a transaction. In fact, on many listings, you could immediately click through to the seller and initiate a live chat.4 This feature was a big hit in China, where users often haggle over price before agreeing to a sale. Additionally, product quality in China is more variable than it is in developed countries, so facilitating that communication between buyer and seller was a key advantage for Alibaba over eBay in China. This disparity was also why Alibaba introduced more nuanced reputation ratings; buyers could rate sellers on many more variables than they could on eBay. The Chinese company clearly understood its market better, a fact that was reflected in Taobao’s superior user satisfaction scores and rapidly growing market share.

- Beating eBay left Taobao as the dominant e-commerce marketplace in China. “When eBay withdrew from the China market, it left only Alibaba Group (and its Taobao marketplace) as the lone e-commerce giant in the market,” Porter Erisman says. Erisman, a former Alibaba VP, is the author of the book Alibaba’s World and creator of the award-winning documentary Crocodile in the Yangtze, which details Alibaba’s early rise in China as well as its battle with eBay. Now Taobao needed to make money. However, given Alibaba’s promise to keep Taobao free, the company needed a different type of business model than eBay had. As Alibaba’s many critics at the time said, “Free is not a business model.” The strategy Alibaba used to defeat eBay backed the Chinese company into a corner—it needed to find a way to monetize without charging transaction fees. Ultimately, Alibaba decided on a revenue model that looks more similar to Google Adwords than it does Amazon’s or eBay’s e-commerce marketplaces. Instead of depending on a percentage fee from each sale, Alibaba makes most of its profit through its advertising model. Because product search is one of the most lucrative segments of search advertising, Alibaba recognized that this model had huge revenue potential.

- In order to build a business model based on product advertising, Alibaba first had to deal with a serious competitive threat. Baidu, often called the Google of China, was the dominant Chinese search platform. Baidu’s Web crawlers would archive Alibaba’s inventory and Web pages and connect its users to Alibaba’s product pages when they searched for products on Baidu. According to our sources, a double-digit percentage of Alibaba’s website traffic came from Baidu at the time. Jack Ma decided that Alibaba needed to become a leading player in China’s search market when he gained operational control of Yahoo China as part of Yahoo’s 2005 investment in a fledging Alibaba. But as a stand-alone search engine, Yahoo/Alibaba wasn’t able to compete with Baidu. Baidu also responded to the potential threat by creating Youa (an eBay-like marketplace) to compete with Alibaba’s Taobao marketplace. Alibaba decided that it needed to be the go-to website for product searches in China, not Baidu. Alibaba initially marketed its decision to block Baidu (and Google) as a way to prevent fraud from merchants who were manipulating paid search results on external sites. The hope was that consumers would find more value going to Alibaba than to Baidu. But the decision was ultimately a strategic one. If Alibaba let Baidu crawl its marketplace websites, Baidu could act as the middleman between consumers and Alibaba. Instead, Ma wanted consumers to go to Alibaba first. To understand the magnitude of this decision, imagine if Amazon had shut out Google ten years ago. Would you still start a search on Google when you wanted to buy something? Would Amazon have been nearly as successful as it is now? It’s hard to say how such a move would have worked out in the U.S. market, but it was indisputably key to Alibaba’s success in China. Alibaba needed to change user behavior for shopping searches so that consumers would start their e-commerce shopping on Alibaba’s site, not Baidu’s. The bet has clearly paid off. After Alibaba blocked external search engines, its marketplace became the dominant destination for shopping in China’s e-commerce market. It became the go-to platform for product search in China, a feat that neither Amazon nor eBay could achieve in the United States, where Google is usually the first go-to destination for shoppers. “One can imagine that, had Alibaba… ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1550))

When eBay lost, it didn’t just settle for the second position; it pulled out of China entirely. And although Baidu has still built a valuable business around its search engine, its failure to dominate product search is a big reason why it’s a much less successful business than either Alibaba or Google, Baidu’s U.S. doppelgänger. Such fierce battles between competing networks have become a hallmark of platform capitalism, and they continue today. In 2013, Alibaba suspended the use of WeChat, a megapopular communications platform owned by rival company Tencent, on all of its marketplaces. In response, Tencent blocked Alibaba’s payments platform, Alipay, from WeChat. More recently, Tencent has banned Uber’s accounts on WeChat as the U.S.-based company goes up against Chinese competitor Didi Kuaidi, which has received significant investment from Tencent. The result of most of these fights is a strong winner-take-all dynamic. One example of this phenomenon is… ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1573))

- in Europe. Despite years of heavy investment, Microsoft’s Bing search engine is still at about 20 percent of U.S. search traffic, and its gains have mostly come at the expense of perennial second-banana Yahoo rather than Google. The winner-take-all nature of platform competition does have some exceptions. When users can participate in more than one platform’s network at the same time, the strength of network effects on any one platform will be weaker. An industry where users can switch easily between networks often can support more platforms, even as the industry matures. However, the best platforms tend to decrease the incentive for users to switch between competing networks by creating additional value through software tools that make transacting easier and through the use of data and personalization. An example is the reputation scores that sellers and hosts accrue on eBay, Taobao, and Airbnb. Building your reputation is an investment in a platform that increases over time with repeated use. Numerous studies have shown that higher reputation scores help producers earn more money in marketplaces, either by selling more or by being able to charge higher prices.

- isn’t exclusive to platforms—linear businesses like Netflix make use of data as well. But combined with the network effects of established platforms, this additional value creates the kind of lock-in that makes competing with a successful platform extremely difficult. The New Titans of Industry As platforms have taken over more of our economic life, they’ve naturally attracted comparisons to the monopolies of old—businesses like U.S. Steel and Standard Oil. Google is the most recent platform company to attract scrutiny related to its market power, especially in the European Union. The association is obviously not a flattering one. However, other than size and market dominance, today’s titans of industry have little in common with the monopolies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The difference between how these old monopolies and today’s platforms established their market position is illustrative. Let’s start with Standard Oil. Like most linear monopolies, it created its dominant market position by acquiring large amounts of assets, effectively buying up large portions of the productive capacity in its industry. For example, at one point Standard Oil… ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1595))

- platforms operate today. Platform businesses grow not by acquiring more factories but by connecting more and more users within their networks. In other words, platforms become dominant not because of what they own but rather because of the value they create by connecting their users. They don’t own the means of production, as industrial monopolies did. Instead, they own the means of connection. This fact helps explain why old monopolies were largely despised while today’s platforms are not. Although every business has some detractors (we all have that one friend who refuses to use Facebook), consumers love Facebook, Alibaba, and Google. Additionally, while these platform companies do have significant market power in their industries, they don’t control their users in the same way that Standard Oil controlled its sources of production. Alibaba can’t just flip a switch and change the output of its sellers. It controls its market, but it does so only indirectly by providing value to its merchants and consumers. Platform monopolies dominate an industry, but they aren’t as entrenched as the industrial-era monopolies were because today’s platforms succeed based on participation, not ownership. “You can’t… ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1607))

- result of widespread participation and usage, not narrowly managed ownership and control. Nowhere has this difference been clearer than in Uber’s battles with lawmakers and regulators. Uber’s users have been its biggest asset in these fights. The most recent example was the company’s fight with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio during the summer of 2015. De Blasio wanted to introduce a temporary cap on the number of Uber drivers on the road, citing traffic complaints from the taxi industry. The goal was to hit pause on Uber’s growth so the city could study the impact that platforms like Uber had on congestion. But Uber, which planned to add 10,000 new drivers during the proposed time period, wasn’t about to give up easily. In response, Uber introduced a “de Blasio mode” for users located within the city. The feature showed riders the lengthy projected wait times that they could expect if de Blasio’s legislation passed. The view also invited users to email the mayor and city council to demand they vote “no” on the bill. The mayor received emails from 40,000 people and Twitter messages from 20,000 as a result, according to the Wall Street Journal.8 Shortly thereafter, the… ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1619))

It’s been part of the company’s DNA from the beginning. One of its earliest regulatory battles was in the nation’s political capital, Washington, D.C. Three years earlier, during the summer of 2012, Uber was readying to launch its UberX service in the D.C. market. But days before the service was supposed to launch, the D.C. city council passed an amendment to a taxi regulation bill designed to keep Uber from operating in the city. (The amendment was literally called the “Uber Amendment.”) As Uber CEO Travis Kalanick tells it, the council crammed the bill through, submitting it at 4 p.m. on a Monday and voting on it the next day at 11 a.m. Uber responded by enlisting its users to fight back. “In 18 hours, 50,000 emails were sent by riders to city council along with 37,000 tweets,” Kalanick said.10 Around noon the next day, the city council pulled the amendment. It’s hard to imagine similar popular support for old-school monopolies like Standard Oil or even for more recent monopolies such as Comcast or… ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=1630))

- can be said of Facebook, Google, Alibaba, and Airbnb. Without the support of their users, these platforms would never be able to sustain their success and take over their respective markets. Net Gain: Platforms Expand Markets Another reason platforms differ from old-school monopolies is that network effects operate differently from the economies of scale that drove previous generations of monopoly businesses. Linear businesses became monopolies largely because they built economies of scale on the supply side. This allowed them to decrease their costs as they grew. Platforms dominate markets because as their networks grow, they deliver more value to their users. Monopolies are typically viewed as a result of market forces breaking down—the forces of supply and demand aren’t able to keep a company’s market power in check, and it finds a way to capture an unusually large share of the market. However, this view doesn’t hold for networks, where greater size brings more value, more efficiency and greater convenience for users. Platform monopolies aren’t the result of market forces breaking down. They’re the result of markets working correctly, a phenomenon that economists call a “natural monopoly.” Because of this fact, the belief that more competition is always better doesn’t hold in platform markets. As the Alibaba story shows, interplatform competition can create mutually exclusive networks until a clear winner emerges. For consumers, this fragmentation is often an inefficient outcome. In fragmented markets, the potential value that could have been created through network effects goes unrealized. A perpetual war among multiple platforms can have the same effect as the lack of trade between warring nations: less economic activity and less value. In fact, having more platform competition actually can be worse for consumers, creating both higher prices and fewer transactions.11 The cost of excess fragmentation in platforms can be much higher than the cost of letting one or two platforms capture the market. Additionally, by building networks and marketplaces that wouldn’t have existed otherwise, platforms have an expansionary effect on economic activity, as opposed to typical monopolies, which often profit by using their dominant positions to squeeze value from an industry without stimulating new economic activity.

- This kind of economic growth is typical of platform industries—platforms succeed by significantly growing their industries. In software development, Apple suggests that the app economy it built around its iOS platform has helped create more than 600,000 developer jobs. Airbnb has had a similarly expansive effect on economic activity. In fact, a recent study has even suggested that Airbnb’s success has had a minimal impact on hotel bookings, even though Airbnb has created a marketplace with more than a million listed properties.13 Airbnb hasn’t grown at the expense of hotels but rather by creating entirely new sources of economic activity. Although Alibaba did not invent the first e-commerce marketplace in China, it succeeded by creating the infrastructure that supported the vast majority of the world’s fastest growing e-commerce market. Today Alibaba’s marketplaces have nearly 10 million active sellers.

- Although monopolies get a bad rap, they’re not always a bad thing. In the short term, modern monopolies are often a boon to consumers. They bring valuable new inventions to market, and, in the case of platforms, they build new communities and markets that would not exist otherwise. The downside comes much later, as the monopolist ages and starts to crowd out potential new competitors without delivering new value. As renowned legal expert and author Tim Wu said, monopolies “tend to be good-to-great in the short term and bad-to-terrible in the long term.”17 However, unlike the monopolies of old, platforms today are highly competitive. This difference results from the different mechanics of platform markets compared to traditional ones. Platforms don’t compete based on their assets but rather based on their networks of users. Users today can migrate much quicker than productive capacity could in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as they are locked in by the value the platform delivers, not the assets it owns. As a result, a platform that dominates one industry is still vulnerable to attack from platforms that have similar user bases. This process of platforms competing across industries is surprisingly common. For example, Amazon effectively created the ebook industry in the United States. Yet after Amazon proved out the market, both Google and Apple have moved from adjacent industries and become competitors. And, as noted earlier, Alibaba used its rapidly growing product marketplace to attack Baidu’s dominance in product search. Additionally, the speed of technological change today means that, absent government enforcement, modern monopolies aren’t likely to last nearly as long as their predecessors. Barriers to entry in most industries are far lower than they were a century ago, while the boundaries between industries also are much more fluid than they have been in the past.

- it should be said, in no small part to the effects of many platform businesses). And new businesses today are able to grow faster than ever before. These changes mean that even if an industry is consolidated around a single dominant platform at any given time, there is always a looming threat of entry by a new firm or displacement by another successful platform. Because of the low cost of entry, this threat is constant and credible in a way it was not a hundred years ago. This competition between established platforms and new entrants is exactly what befell Microsoft. For much of the last two decades, there was even more worry about Microsoft as a monopoly than there is about Google today. In the early 2000s, most industry experts expected a major competition between Microsoft and Nokia over who would own the dominant smartphone operating system. Google’s move to create Android was actually a response to its fear of Microsoft’s dominance in mobile.18 Today Microsoft is still the dominant platform in PC operating systems. However, it turned out that the kingdom it built was much smaller than everyone thought it would be.

- More recently, Google has attracted increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to its dominance in Web search, especially in Europe. But in just a few years’ time, Google’s dominance in search may seem much less important than it does today. There are signs that this shift is already happening. Although Google has long dominated digital advertising, it’s increasingly competing with platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for advertisers’ money. This competitive danger is especially strong on mobile, since the vast majority of Google’s revenue comes from desktop search. Google’s creation of Android as a mobile operating system was designed primarily as a defensive move to protect its search business, but the company still hasn’t figured out a great business model for the mobile Web, where search doesn’t monetize as well as it does on the desktop. Many analysts attribute the slowing growth of Google’s search-advertising revenue to this shift from desktop to mobile. Clicks on smartphones just aren’t as profitable as those on personal computers. Additionally, new entrants from China who are building on top of open-source Android could threaten Google’s dominance of Android in the near future. Meanwhile, Facebook has built an enormous presence on mobile, and Google is in danger of being eclipsed by the next round of dominant platforms. If it isn’t able to expand its revenue engine to mobile—where the potential advertising market ultimately will be much larger than desktop search is—it too could be relegated to secondary status within a decade. Google could always try to buy out new competitors, as Facebook did with Instagram and WhatsApp. But repeated, large acquisitions will only incentivize the creation of even more startups that will become future competitors. Google’s market position may seem insurmountable today, but this very well could change as the mobile Internet expands and mobile ad revenue eclipses that of the desktop Web. How should governments react to the rising dominance of platform monopolies? Historical perspective is important here. Enduring monopolies like Standard Oil and AT&T are what gave the term its negative reputation. However, absent government protection, no business is likely to enjoy such a prolonged period of dominance today.

- Linear businesses create value by manufacturing products or services; platforms create value by creating connections and using them to “manufacture” transactions. The core transaction is how platforms make this happen. It’s how a platform takes the potential energy of its network and converts those connections into the kinetic energy of transactions. Without a core transaction, even a large network won’t be able to create value. That’s why getting the core transaction right is the most essential aspect of platform design. To generate and exchange value, a platform needs its users to repeat this process over and over. What is the core transaction? The core transaction is the set of actions consumers and producers must complete in order to exchange value. Every platform has a core transaction. On Uber, drivers make themselves available and consumers submit requests for rides. On YouTube, producers upload videos and consumers watch, rate, and share them. On Lending Club people or small businesses request loans and others fund them. These examples of the core transaction highlight its purpose: to construct a set of simple, repeatable actions that producers and consumers take to create and consume value through a platform. At a high level, the core transaction on every platform includes the same basic set of four actions. These actions are: Create: A producer creates value or makes it available to be consumed through the platform. Connect: In every transaction, one user takes an action that sparks the exchange by connecting with the other party. Consume: Once consumers find the right match, they can consume the value created by the producer. Compensate: Consumers create value for the producer in exchange for what they consumed.

- According to tech journalist Nick Bilton, whose book Hatching Twitter details the company’s origins and meteoric ascent, Dorsey saw Twitter as “a way to talk about what was happening to him.” But Williams saw it as “a view into what was happening in the world.” It took a long time for Twitter to resolve this conflict, with the platform eventually defining itself around the latter vision. Twitter isn’t a social network like Facebook. It’s a content platform. Bill Gurley, partner at top venture capital firm Benchmark, agreed. “Facebook is a few-to-few communication network designed for sharing information and life events with friends. Twitter, on the other hand, is a one-to-many information broadcast network. The only way magic happens on Facebook is through reciprocity: I friend you and you friend me back—then information flows. But on Twitter, I can get something out of following Shaquille O’Neal, who has no social obligation to follow me back.”18 Additionally, if Twitter is for finding out what’s happening now, you don’t need to tweet to use it. “The power of this discovery platform is much more about the tweets themselves, and not simply about every single user having the ability to tweet,” Gurley said.

- The local nature of network effects helps us understand why network density matters just as much as network size for platforms. The denser a network is, the more overlapping local networks there will be. This means that more of the potential connections in the network will become actual transactions, as these users are more likely to interact with each other. Transactions, not potential connections, are where platforms create real value. As a result, a small but dense and highly active network is usually much more valuable and useful than a larger but more dispersed network. The smaller network will create more transactions and more value. To achieve higher-density network effects, most platforms initially target a smaller niche with a very simple use case before expanding to a broader audience. For example, this is why most services marketplaces, like Uber, start in one city, usually New York or San Francisco. (Uber initially launched in San Francisco.) They focus on building up a dense network in one city before moving to a new one, where they will have to build the network all over again. But this strategy isn’t limited to marketplaces. Yelp started in San Francisco and built up its network of reviewers before expanding to other cities. Similarly, Q&A platform Quora, founded by two former Facebook employees, started with a focus on venture capital, technology, and startups. By limiting its early users (Quora started as invite only) to people who could answer questions on these niche topics, Quora grew the core network cluster that would seed its later expansion into other topics and industries.

- There’s another big problem with the Moore’s Law conception of network effects. Not all network effects are positive. Some users can act in ways that affect others negatively. Or, to put it more bluntly, some users harm others. These “bad” users create network effects that work in reverse—the more of this harmful activity there is, the less value a user can get out of a network. Consider what happened to Chatroulette. Most users came to Chatroulette wanting to experience talking to a random stranger. What most of them didn’t want to find was an intimate, up-close view of a hirsute naked man. The more often you had this unsavory experience, the less likely you were to keep using Chatroulette. Another example is “trolling” on Internet message and comment boards, where one user deliberately tries to anger or offend others. Other instances include the Fakesters who took over Friendster and the spammers and predators who gave Myspace a negative reputation. These are all examples of reverse network effects.32 Rather than benefiting the network by creating value for other users, these bad users harm or impose costs on other users. Left unchecked, these bad users can take over a network and drive away other users. Much like the “lemons” problem in other consumer markets, bad-quality users can chase out the good. As more of these bad users join, they create a reverse network effect that motivates other users to leave. So although every platform spends a lot of resources trying to grow as quickly as possible, sometimes you should be careful what you wish for. This concept of reverse network effects is an important one, as it greatly changes our understanding of how you should go about building a network. The idea of network effects and their articulation through Metcalfe’s Law first became popular in the 1990s, as the Internet’s popularity was growing. Backed by a simplistic notion of how networks created value, the common view of network effects viewed competition between platforms as a simple matter of getting the biggest the fastest. This concept also was known as first-mover advantage. The idea of first-mover advantage was so powerful that, according to technology columnist Kevin Maney at USA Today, “it could instantly win a startup millions of dollars in financing, boatloads of publicity and board members who seemed, for a moment anyway, important.”33 Be the first to take over any new business category on the Web and it was yours, or so the thinking went. The idea of first-mover advantage took a hit after the dot-com bubble burst, but it still lives on today. Steve Blank, a serial entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lean Startup movement, called first-mover advantage “an idea that just won’t die.”34 In the past, part of the problem was that this concept was applied to businesses that didn’t have any real network effects and very little sustainable advantage, even if they were to succeed.

In September 2015, Vanity Fair even put out a feature titled “Tinder and the Dawn of the ‘Dating Apocalypse,’” which profiled the app as a central component of so-called hookup culture.38 Tinder responded on Twitter with the social media equivalent of a public relations meltdown,39 but the company has long protested that its platform isn’t just for short-term hookups. Tinder does so for good reason: If it’s just a hookup app, it has a much smaller addressable market. But its efforts have done little to change public perception. If this reputational issue was just a short-term one, it wouldn’t be such a problem for platforms like Momo and Tinder. But growth in networks isn’t random. It’s path dependent. What does this mean? It means that the types of users your network will attract in the future depends on the ([Location 2890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=2890))

- composition and behavior of your network’s existing users. A network’s future growth depends on the path it has taken to get there. In other words, users aren’t making a decision at random about joining a platform. Potential new users are driven by their attraction to (or distaste for) your existing user base. Once a platform has attracted a critical mass of a certain type of users, more users of the same type will favor it. Dating platforms provide an unusually simple example. Users typically have a strong preference for either short-term or long-term relationships. If the platform attracts many users who are looking for hookups, it inevitably will be viewed as a platform for finding hookups. After a platform develops a reputation as having users of one type, it becomes almost impossible for it to position itself to attract the other type, no matter how it markets itself or what feature set it provides.

- There’s another big problem with the traditional accounting of network effects. Not only does it assume all network effects are global, it also assumes that all of its users are equally valuable to the whole network. However, in practice this doesn’t hold true. Some users are more valuable to a platform than others. This is especially obvious on content platforms like YouTube or Twitter, where celebrity users have many more subscribers or followers than the average user. Not surprisingly, both of these platforms go out of their way to attract these celebrities, creating special features and marketing initiatives that are aimed at retaining their most valuable users.

- Now that we have a more nuanced view of how networks work, it’s time to talk about building network effects. Clearly, creating a network is more complicated than just aggregating many users, but until now, there hasn’t been an alternative framework for understanding how to grow quality systematically as a network expands. Now there is: The network effects ladder (see Figure 7.3). Figure 7.3. The network effects ladder. Five “steps” on the ladder dictate the quality of a platform’s network: Connection, Communication, Collaboration, Curation, and Community.47 The goal for any network should be to increase quality and community involvement as the platform matures by climbing from one step to the next over time.

- What happened to Samsung, as well as to HTC and Motorola before it, is illustrative. The evolution of the smartphone industry is a microcosm of what’s happening to the broader economic landscape. In this new world, platforms sit at the top of the economy. They have the most market power, the highest profits, and the most sustainable competitive advantage. As Samsung showed, it’s still possible to build a valuable linear business, but its competitive advantage often evaporates quickly as products get commoditized and competitors copy features—leaving the originator continually scrambling to replace those strengths. Features are easy to emulate; networks aren’t. Products get commoditized; platforms don’t. Samsung, long a linear business, realized its predicament several years ago and has been trying to transition to being a platform company. For the last couple of years, the consumer electronics manufacturer made a concerted effort to build support for its own development platform, Tizen, especially within newer device categories, such as wearable electronics and smart TVs. However, it hasn’t had much success. Both Android and iOS already are moving into these categories, and Google and Apple aren’t likely to lose their lead with developers to a hardware company. Samsung’s decline is likely to continue. As Market Makers host Erik Schatzker said in a TV discussion with Alex on Samsung’s struggles, “It’s become clear that it’s the platform companies where all the intelligence and power resides.”21 If you’re building a business today, platform businesses offer the biggest and most sustainable economic opportunity. However, you can’t simply copy the business model of successful platforms like Facebook, Uber, or Airbnb and expect it to work. The time to build a broad, desktop-based social network was in the early 2000s, when broadband access was becoming more widespread and the desktop Internet was growing. Similarly, the time to build a transportation marketplace like Uber was several years ago, when smartphones were just starting to spread to mainstream consumers and many of today’s unicorn companies were just taking off. Trying to emulate the success of these businesses today without understanding the competitive landscape is a recipe for failure. In the rest of this chapter, we look at how you can spot potential platform opportunities, and where we expect platforms to have the biggest impact next.

- For Uber, the biggest legal issue is the classification status of its drivers. Uber drivers, which the company calls its “driver partners,” are currently so-called 1099 contract employees, named for Form 1099 that these employees have to file with the IRS. This classification status means that Uber doesn’t have to pay payroll taxes for these contractors and that it doesn’t have to provide long-term benefits such as health insurance and workers’ compensation. It also limits Uber’s legal liability for the actions of its drivers. Most other services marketplaces, including Handy, Lyft, Instacart, and Postmates, classify all or some of their workers as 1099 contractors rather than W-2 workers or contractors. But every one of these companies is currently facing lawsuits alleging that they are misclassifying their workers. The potential legal fallout for each of these platforms is enormous. They could face hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and taxes owed if they lose these cases and have to reclassify their workers as W-2 employees. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most of these companies would then likely be responsible for providing health care for many of their workers. While it’s possible to still operate a platform with W-2 contractors, the overhead involved in dealing with W-2 workers, as well as the additional tax obligations the companies would incur as a result, would severely limit the advantages of the model for services marketplaces. These platforms would lose a lot of flexibility and cost advantages, which are often passed on to consumers in the form of better prices. These pending legal challenges could have a big impact on which of these companies is able to survive long term. As all these examples show, the upside of platform business models often comes with serious regulatory risk. Many platform businesses are effectively a call option on regulation: if the business can survive its regulatory and legal challenges and capture its market, it has enormous economic upside, both for investors as well as its users. However, if the platform can’t overcome the legal status quo, it can very quickly be driven out of business. For example, if the leading services marketplaces lose their worker classification lawsuits, the less favorable unit economics of using W-2 workers may drive many of these marketplaces out of business in the United States. Even dominant platform companies, such ([Location 3516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3516))

- The failure of these B2B marketplaces is a sharp contrast to the one major success story in B2B ecommerce from the dot-com era: Alibaba. Alibaba took a very different approach from these other marketplaces. Rather than going after large, consolidated industries, it went after small businesses. This strategy was the brainchild of Alibaba’s founder and CEO, Jack Ma. Ma’s vision was that “the revolutionary significance of the Internet is that it will enable small enterprises to operate independently.” He wanted to be a savior to China’s countless small and medium-sized enterprises by bringing them into the Internet era. “Asia is the largest supplier base in the world for exports,” Ma said. “Among the great density of small companies here, most do not have channels to the large trading companies. Most have no way to reach a market. Simply by going through our Alibaba network, they can get access to all of America ([Location 3712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3712))

- and Europe.” He compared these businesses to “grains of sand on a beach. The Internet can glue them together. It can make them into an invincible force that is able to up against the big stones.”43 As it turned out, Ma was right. By unifying China’s huge, fragmented small-business market, he was able to build a digital empire and grow the country’s e-commerce sector. Similarly, a key part of Uber’s success was that it went after an industry that had a large fragmented supply. By unifying all of this supply into one network, Uber made it much easier for consumers to get a ride and made it much simpler for drivers to find paying passengers. Passengers get to their destination faster, and drivers get more business. ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3718))

- Remember to look for these three factors when you’re trying to spot platform opportunities: technology that reduces transaction costs and removes gatekeepers; implicit or underserved networks; and large, fragmented sources of supply. One of these factors can be enough to enable the growth of a successful platform business, but the more boxes you can tick off, the better. But remember that although the opportunity to build valuable platform businesses is real, timing matters. So where should you be looking to next? Well, there are a few industries where the three factors are starting to converge The first industry is health care, which we’ve touched on at several points in this book. Here you have platforms connecting doctors and patients in new ways, like Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, and ZocDoc. However, these platforms are just going after the low-hanging ([Location 3735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3735))

- fruit. There’s still a tremendous amount of waste and inefficiency in the healthcare sector, especially in the United States. And wherever there’s waste and inefficiency, there’s a platform opportunity. For instance, although they’re relatively popular with casual consumers, wearable health devices are just starting to make their way into formal health care. These devices offer tremendous potential for improving patient wellness. But in order for them to be useful, a platform will need to build a unified network of doctors and patients. Despite the recent entrance of Silicon Valley heavyweights Apple and Google, this market is still wide open. Additionally, many more platforms focused on the enterprise healthcare market are likely to emerge as connected technology infuses the industry further. One example in this market is Figure 1, which is essentially Instagram but for doctors. It connects doctors with others who may have more expertise about a particular issue. Doctors get access to a large expert network; as a result, patients get better care. Regulations could significantly slow changes in health care, but the sector is clearly ripe for change. Fortunately, at least for now, user-generated content is not governed by HIPAA. As a result, we’ve seen greater innovation with platforms leveraging new data sources such as Apple Health and the aforementioned Figure 1. However, the FDA may be trying to expand HIPAA to also cover user-generated health data, which would severely limit the utility of many platforms in the sector. Still, as technology (and regulations) changes, there will be many more opportunities for platform business models to help improve patient outcomes. The next sector where big changes are happening is the Internet of Things. If you’re not familiar with it, the Internet of Things is an envisioned future where machines communicate directly with other machines rather than people. The idea is that Internet-enabled devices, such as cars, buildings, or electronics (really, any device you can imbed with a sensor), will exchange data directly with other devices. Any object could be connected and communicate with other devices in an intelligent manner. The hope is that devices will become context-aware and be able to respond or adjust dynamically to different users or situations. This idea has been hyped but not really solved. Security and privacy remain big issues. For example, there’s a popular Twitter account whose name is “Internet of Shit.” Its tagline is: “Have all of your best appliances ruined by putting the Internet in them!” One tweet jokes: “Wait endlessly while your toilet does software updates!” However, assuming these issues get ironed out (an admittedly large assumption), the industry has big potential. And wherever the Internet of Things is successful, you’ll find platforms at the center of it. In order for all these devices to communicate, they need to be able to talk with one another and exchange information. This task… ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3742))

- standards, and technologies that these devices use that are incompatible with each other. In other words, there are lots of devices that are all speaking different languages. A development platform is needed that can coordinate all of these fragmented resources and set the rules around machine-to-machine interaction. The challenge is getting most users to agree on one platform, as there are many platform competitors out there currently. (This situation is a classic example of excess fragmentation leading to lost value.) The growth of the Internet of Things will have a big impact that spreads beyond just the platforms themselves. Insurance companies are starting to offer better rates based around users’ ability to drive safely or their ability to monitor users’ homes. Farther down the line, driverless cars will be a big part of the Internet of Things. And they will likely be connected by one or two dominant development platforms. Apple and Google have both made big moves in this space over the last year, so they are currently leading contenders. Uber is another. Travis Kalanick, the company’s founder and CEO, has already said on the record that Uber intends to build on driverless car technology. To that end, in February 2015, Uber effectively bought out the entire robotics department at Carnegie Mellon University. (Yes, really.) The company likely will start by introducing driverless cars into its fleet to help prove out the market and construct a regulatory regime around the new technology. However, once Uber accomplishes this, it’s unlikely that the company will simply own and operate its own armada of vehicles. It’s not clear why a logistics and transportation platform would want to radically alter its business model in favor of owning a fleet of rapidly depreciating physical assets that also come with the downside of serious liability concerns. The potential in the industrial sector of the economy to improve efficiency is enormous. Industry reports on the Internet of Things typically make astronomical predictions. For example, Gartner predicts that we’ll have 25 billion connected “things” in use by 2020, not including PCs, laptops, and smartphones, which it predicts will make up an additional 7 billion devices. This total will be up more than 500 percent from an estimated 4.9 billion things at the end of 2015. Gartner also suggests that the Internet of… ([Location 3765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3765))

- may be a while before a winning development platform emerges. No company will want to use a competitor’s platform for fear of getting “Samsunged” in the future as its products become commoditized and the platform grows in value. Finally, we turn to finance. Finance is an industry that most people associate with large banks or money management firms. However, a host of platform startups have opened the industry to new kinds of consumers who haven’t had access to sophisticated investment products before. In the startup realm are platforms such as AngelList, which enable people to invest in startups on a small scale. Many of these investors now have access to deals they never would have gotten in the past. Peer-to-peer lending is also big. Lending Club was the early success story in this area, but other more industry-specific competitors have emerged over the last couple of years. One example is SoFi (also called Social Finance), which… ([Location 3787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3787))

- Many Bitcoin enthusiasts view the blockchain as the solution to pretty much everything. They also see it as the undoing of today’s dominant platform companies, because the blockchain makes its network’s data open and portable to any other network. However, we think this crowd tends to overstate their case. The blockchain solves a very particular problem: It allows you to trust that the message you’re sending will reach the intended recipient uncompromised. But it doesn’t tell you whether ([Location 3817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017RC8CBC&location=3817))

- you should trust that person in the first place. Or, if you’re dealing with a physical product or service, whether that person will deliver what you’re paying for. Or what to do if you need to resolve a dispute between the transacting parties. The blockchain solves only one small component of trust. As we’ve shown throughout this book, platforms play a very active role in constructing their marketplaces and communities, and in most cases the blockchain addresses only a very small part of what these platforms do. Rather than ending the dominance of platforms, we would suggest that the growth of blockchain technologies will be accompanied by the emergence of many new platform companies. Like HTTP and the Web before it, the blockchain will create a decentralized infrastructure that provides the opportunity for new markets and communities to emerge. But most of these new opportunities won’t take shape without a platform company orchestrating them and capitalizing on their potential. (Think about where the Web would be without a search platform like Google helping you make sense of it.) Some of these new companies may displace existing platform monopolies, but platforms will remain the dominant business model.
