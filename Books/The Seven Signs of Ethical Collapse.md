## Highlights
- Ethical collapse is a state of moral malaise. Ethical collapse happens when organizations are unable to see that bright line between right and wrong. Or perhaps those within the organization see that bright line, but the culture is so fearful, wild, or obsessed with numbers and goals that no one wants to hear about the bright line anymore. Some organizations pull themselves back from ethical collapse. Others continue right on into legal and financial collapse. While most people are enamored of continuous double-digit growth in earnings, I have always seen it as a warning sign. While most people feel terrific when the CEO of the company in which they own stock becomes an iconic media darling, I worry. And while most people see corporate philanthropy as evidence of an ethical commitment, I know different. Not every ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=59))

- philanthropist is headed toward ethical collapse. But not every philanthropist is ethical. They couldn’t see the ethical, and possibly financial, collapse coming because the traditional tools used for evaluating companies and their potential are too rote, mechanical, and numerical. The tests for company viability and financial performance are too facile. A good analysis of where a company is headed demands a look at qualitative factors, those touchy-feely, squishy, from-the-gut factors that are ignored despite the fact that they often determine the company’s fate. In my views on companies and their future, I follow Jeffersonian wisdom: “In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.” There has been too much falling for style and too little substantive analysis. Principle dictates digging a little deeper to find the soul and potential of a company—and too often these days, the lack thereof.

- However, the law was never intended to be the maximum for standards of behavior. The law represents the minimum standard of behavior required. We are permitted to do more than the law requires and less than the law allows. A company can be teetering ethically without crossing legal lines. When an organization collapses ethically, it means that those in the organization have drifted into rationalizations and legalisms, and all for the purpose of getting the results they want and need at almost any cost. This drift into “Everybody does this” and “It’s not a question of ‘Should we do it?’ it’s ‘Can we do it legally?’” mentality occurs because of the combination of the seven factors working together to cloud judgment. False impressions or even concealment seem to offer perfect candor to those ethically collapsed organizations. Indeed, their conduct may be perfectly legal, but that standard is one of the problems in ethically collapsed organizations. They meet legal standards without really considering the long-term implications of technicalities, taking advantage of loopholes, and the resulting impact on the individual and organizational soul. They are concentrating so much on the “Gotcha strategy” of finding the loophole or the easier way around the tough slog of diligent competition that they are no longer managing as effectively, creatively, or successfully as they could.

- What we have with this attention to numbers is evidence of companies taking that difficult and introspective look at their own accounting and financial reporting and making better decisions. To use a Seinfeldism, “Not that there was anything wrong with that,” the companies are taking the accounting high road on many issues to avoid the consequences of flying too close to the treetops.

- What the rest of the world will look at as pushing the envelope makes ethically collapsed organizations issue a type of George Costanza (of Seinfeld) response, “What? You mean there’s something wrong with this?” This Costanza syndrome is a one-sentence summary of ethical collapse. There is a problem, or two or more, but those inside the organizations either do not see it or would prefer to continue along a path that will prove to be damaging, if not destructive. The seven signs are here to head these organizations off at the path to damage and destruction. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=135))

- I am grateful for the wisdom of my parents, whose solid advice of “if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true” led me to this exploration of ethical collapse. The seven signs of ethical collapse represent more details on this notion of “too good to be true,” their general theory on investments and life.

- Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families are unhappy in their own ways. The inverse appears to be true when it comes to ethics in organizations. All unethical organizations are alike; their cultures are identical, and their collapses become predictable. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=188))

- You could substitute Johns-Manville and asbestos, Merck and Vioxx, or any other product-liability case and find a similar pattern. New-product problem arises, employee spots the issue, company hides the problem, press releases equivocate, and officers postpone public disclosure as they try to control the truth about that problem and continue to hope for the best. The strategy never works, but these companies have created a culture destined to follow this failing strategy. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=201))

- What we have seen and continue to witness is ethically “dumb” behavior. There was no discussion of gray areas as these stories unfolded. When WorldCom was forced to reveal that its officers had capitalized $11 billion in ordinary expenses, no one slapped his forehead and said, “Gosh, I never would have seen that ethical issue coming!” When Enron collapsed because it had created more than three thousand off-the-books entities in order to make its debt burden look better and its financial picture seem brighter, no one looked at the Caribbean infrastructure of deceit and muttered, “Wow—that was really a nuanced ethical issue.” ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=226))

There are qualitative characteristics to look for in companies that can provide insight into the organizations that produce the external facade of financial reports, fund-raising, and shuttles launched. There are marking points in that descent from financial reports with integrity to the shredding and forgery. In fact, after performing decades of research and studying three great ethical collapses, I’ve identified seven of them.

- were their minds and what were they thinking when they decided to behave this way?” The simple answer is that they failed to see and heed the seven warning signs of ethical collapse: 1. Pressure to maintain those numbers 2. Fear and silence 3. Young’uns and a bigger-than-life CEO 4. Weak board 5. Conflicts 6. Innovation like no other 7. Goodness in some areas atoning for evil in others These seven signs are easily observable from the outside, and almost always discernible even without one-on-one interviews with employees. But give me a one-on-one with an employee and I can tap a vein. I always offer companies: “After I do my outside research, using the signs listed above as the focus, give me just five minutes alone with a frontline employee and I can tell you the culture of your organization and whether it is at risk.” While it is true that every company has one or more of the seven signs, not every company is at risk of ethical collapse. The difference between a company at risk and one that collapses lies in curbing the culture and controlling the worst of the seven signs.

- does someone sink so low?” Some observers conclude that bad people (think “rogues”) ran the ethically collapsed companies. They assume, with a great sense of calm and comfort, that such a monumental collapse could never happen to them because they are, of course, not rogues. There is a tendency in human nature to take away immunity from any analyses of ethically collapsed companies and conclude, “Well, it was greed,” or “They were just awful people.” We fancy ourselves to be different from these rogues and hence not susceptible to monumental ethical collapse. Perhaps we are nothing like any one individual rogue, but the better analysis and questions are “What do companies with rogues have in common?” and “How do rogues obtain such a grip on a company or organization?” This book will teach us not to dismiss these “bad seeds” so readily as being different from us. Given enough pressure and culturally induced myopia, we are all vulnerable. The checks and balances come from being able to recognize when you are at risk. This book helps us spot the slippery slope, the ethical cliff, and any other physical and philosophical metaphors for doom. We need to be able to recognize the danger signs before we come too close to that slope, edge, cliff, precipice … .

- This book is a how-to: how a business should create and sustain an ethical culture. Most books on ethics in business tell businesspeople to be ethical. This book presumes that we understand that part of the equation and moves on to the next phase: How do we do it? Therein lies the key question; and once we do it, how do we sustain it? There are traits, habits, and cultural factors that actually get in the way of ethical decisions. There are also ethical checks and balances that can serve as stop signs when unethical conduct is proposed. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=389))

- This is not a book for the ethically fainthearted. Too few books have offered moral judgment and, as a result, have fallen short in giving guidance on the difference between right and wrong. For example, a classic dilemma in business ethics books and discussions is whether an executive should launch a questionable product. The ethical dilemma is not whether to launch; the ethical dilemma is why does a debate on launching a questionable product ever gain traction? More relevant, what is in your company’s culture that encourages you to even think about launching a questionable product?

- Bausch & Lomb was on a roll from 1982 to 1994: it had experienced double-digit growth for twelve years in a row. That kind of growth does not come without two things: pressure and accounting chicanery. Employees who would eventually testify at hearings and during litigation indicated that they were given target numbers for sales and operations and that there were never any excuses accepted for not meeting their numbers. One manager noted that he was told to meet the numbers but not to do anything “stupid.” The manager concluded, “I’d walk away saying, ‘I’d be stupid not to make the numbers.’” ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=585))

- WorldCom’s fancy merger accounting also gave its officers flexibility in numbers. Such accounting goes like this: a company acquires another (as WorldCom did sixty-five times) and is permitted to take a restructuring charge against earnings, the infamous “one-time charge.” The restructuring charge is a management determination, and both reasonable and unreasonable minds differ on what the charges for restructuring following a merger should be. The tendency for managers is to overstate the restructuring charges and toss these extra charges, over and above actual charges, into reserves, sometimes referred to as the “cookie jar.” So, if, for example, a company made an acquisition and booked $2 billion for restructuring charges, its earnings picture for that year would look quite awful. However, the actual costs of the restructuring are spread out over the time it takes for the company to restructure, which is actually two to three years, and some of the charges booked may not actually occur. The hit to earnings has ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=639))

- already been taken all at once with this factor by itself opening the door for upwards and rosier earnings growth in subsequent years. By making the restructuring costs high in the year of acquisition, even flat earnings the following year will seem to be a real and substantial uptick because expenses are so diminished with no restructuring costs. Further, when the restructuring costs are lower, that lump sum of excess comes back in from reserves. Then, one mustn’t forget that there is the cookie jar into which management can dip to use reserves should a subsequent year prove to be truly awful, thereby boosting earnings, or at least smoothing them out for investors. Indeed, the reserves can then be used to meet targets so that investors, Wall Street, and everyone else is happy because the company is sailing along as promised. Herein rests the concept of managing earnings, another wonderful numbers term that infiltrates the numbers-pressure culture that leads to ethical collapse. It’s not cooking the books, it is managing earnings. A numbers obsession finds employees and officers not managing strategically but manipulating numbers for results.

- Tyco’s financials were odd in that it seemed to be heavily in debt but was still reporting oodles of cash flow. Therein lies the beauty, flexibility, and numbers-goal savior: goodwill. When one company acquires another, it must include the assets acquired on its balance sheet. The acquirer, who we now know was really interested in making its numbers, is, in an odd conflict-of-interest irony, in charge of establishing the value of the assets acquired. From 1998 to 2001 Tyco spent $30 billion on acquisitions and attributed $30 billion to goodwill. Those of you unschooled in the ways of debit and credit accounting may be thinking, “But the numbers still match; whatever could be the problem?” ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=928))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The problem lies in the fact that the assets acquired are not carried on Tyco’s books with any significant value. Assets, under accounting rules, lose their value over time. Goodwill stays the same in perpetuity. However, if Tyco turns around and sells the assets it has acquired and booked at virtually zero value, the profit is a big chunk of change and is reflected in the income of the company. The only way an investor in Tyco would be able to tell what has really happened would be to have access to the balance sheets of the acquired companies so that he or she could see the value of the assets as they were carried on the books of the acquired company. The bump to earnings from the sale of the assets is lovely, but the bump to profits, with no offsetting costs, is tremendous. By September 2002 Tyco would be forced to announce a $2.5 billion charge to correct past misdeeds on these types of understatements of assets in its acquisitions.

- The third report, issued in late 2003, concluded that pressure to meet budget constraints and complete a launch on time were the contributing causes of the accident that cost the lives of all seven who were aboard the Columbia shuttle that crashed upon reentry in the summer of 2003: “The past decisions of national leaders—the White House, Congress, and NASA Headquarters—set the Columbia accident in motion by creating resource and schedule strains that compromised the principles of a high-risk technology organization … . The measure of NASA’s success became how much costs were reduced and how efficiently the schedule was met. But the space shuttle is not now, nor has it ever been, an operational vehicle. We cannot explore space on a fixed-cost basis.” The report describes a culture that minimized safety because of the pressures related to time and money. The pressures were different, but the impact was the same—employees’ judgment was clouded when they were faced with critical decision points. Interviews with NASA employees showed that they felt the budget and schedule pressures as they made decisions about postponing ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=1044))

- Not every company doing well and seeing its sales numbers increase is headed for ethical collapse. Not every company that has numbers goals and compensation tied to reaching those goals will wind up in the annals of financial history as a “gigantic fraud.” So, what is the difference between an achiever and a manipulator? Where is that fine line between quantitative targets and diabolical obsession? There are checks and balances—antidotes, if you will—to the numbers culture. Putting them into place does not curb employee or company achievement. These antidotes curb only achievement at any cost. These fixes are designed to prevent a “meeting numbers” type of ethical culture in which numbers trump ethics.

- Cultural change and cultural controls are tall orders. These elements in ethical culture are perhaps the most difficult because of deference to CEOs, particularly those iconic ones. Shortly after Jack Welch retired as GE’s CEO, the company had to issue a material earnings restatement. Questions about GE’s accounting had always floated about, but no one in the investment community or among analysts dared raise the issue because Mr. Welch was often touted as the greatest manager of all time. Mr. Welch would perhaps be more accurately described as the greatest earnings manager of all time. GE was possibly just quarters away from ethical collapse when Mr. Welch retired and the company reversed the financials for the years of Welch’s domination of the ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2627))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- numbers. Also, the company had to change its cultural mind-set on meeting those numbers, the pervasive fear factor, and the irrational reverence for Welch. In fact, there was much more anecdotal evidence of Mr. Welch’s domineering, iconic, and Yeehaw nature that emerged following his retirement. Mr. Welch’s somewhat messy divorce (a natural outcome of adultery with the editor of the Harvard Business Review; see the discussions of antidotes later in this chapter for more information) resulted in revelations about his retirement package that had not been properly disclosed to the shareholders. He was given an apartment, access to sporting events, and $86,000 per year for five days of consulting. That all was changed when the light of day was shone upon it, courtesy of Jane Welch in their divorce proceedings. Welch now consults for free and pays for all, from tickets to the apartment. GE settled with the SEC on charges related to the nondisclosure of the retirement benefits. The company was forced to cut the final ties to its era of the bigger-than-life CEO and the resulting concentration of power and assumed infallibility that accompanies these iconic figures. No one dares question them even as the company bears the brunt of an ego run amok. Mr. Welch’s op-ed about these events that appeared on the pages of The Wall Street Journal was just plain embarrassing because it contained no justification, correction, or qualification. Sadly, this is a piece I now use to teach my students about the difference between rationalization of misconduct and real ethical analysis. Welch had nothing but rationalizations for an ethical misstep, excesses, and a huge lapse in judgment. But the self-perceived infallibility revealed in the piece does offer insight into the lack of accountability and distorted perspective that he had enjoyed. The effect of the editorial was to demonstrate that the emperor wore no clothes. This is a tragically flawed human being whose judgment was questionable. No CEO is perfect, and icons are best left to the computer screen, not the CEO slot. Not questioning CEOs, no matter what titles and accolades are theirs, or their decisions, regardless of how well they have done or the power they wield, takes the company on a trot down the road to ethical and other resulting forms of collapse. Ethically healthy organizations do not offer autonomy to any officers or executives. Jim Collins in his latest book, Good to Great, and also in a Fortune analysis of seventy-five good decisions, points out that good decisions come from leaders listening to dissenting views.

- Just before GE announced that it would be issuing financial restatements, the insightful Bill Gross of Pimco sent out some thoughts on his fears about the company that were triggered by an article in The Wall Street Journal that quoted GE Capital’s Marissa Moretti for an explanation on the company’s near-record $11 billion in debt offering. Her explanation was that “absolute yields are at historic lows … so we think now is the right time to be doing an offering like this.” Her thoughts triggered Mr. Gross’s thoughts that “historic lows” was not accurate and his view that Ms. Moretti was hiding something. His thoughts on what GE was hiding? • GE had the benefit of a Aaa rating but its commercial paper totaled three times the amount of the bank credit lines they held to back up that commercial paper • The commercial paper market was sensitive at this time, with funds not as readily available, and, therefore, presented a risk for GE in trying to refinance all this paper • The ordinary standard for credit line backups on commercial papers was that companies had to have at least the amount of all their commercial paper in credit ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2757))

- lines, but GE had $50 billion of commercial paper that was not backed by credit lines • Mr. Gross chided the market for its lack of oversight on such a development • The issuance of the $11 billion was not at an opportune time. Rather, GE was trying to cover itself for the commercial paper and the heat it was beginning to feel from the market about its lack of self-discipline on meeting the usual standards for security on commercial paper. • Mr. Gross also chided Ms. Moretti, former GE CEO Jack Welch, and current CEO Jeff Immelt for not being totally forthcoming about this issue as well as answering the question of how GE was growing earnings at a rate of 15 percent per year. Gross noted that brilliant management were not bringing those earnings. Rather, he reflected, the earnings were coming from acquisitions (a hundred in five years) and that GE was using “near hedge fund leverage of at times, what appears to be (based on its Aaa rating) non-hedge fund risk.” He was completely correct. The response from the market was that Gross had a screw loose. The market was icon-drunk. Mr. Gross was not only correct in his analysis, he was correct to question. Of course, Bill Gross, as the manager of the world’s largest mutual fund, runs the risk of becoming an icon himself. And the ego is not completely in check. In 2003 he issued an annual report/ letter in which he came out against the war in Iraq. The objections raised in response and the outrage offered by investors indicate that his senior management team should have issued a “No, don’t do this!” and the negative attention proved to be problematic for the giant fund. The following are simple questions that should be asked of CEOs and might have flagged problems at the companies discussed earlier: • How is it possible to meet earnings predictions to the penny for so many quarters in a row? • If earnings are this terrific, where’s the cash? • What’s this note in the 10-K on officers’ holding interests in companies we do business with? • Could we walk through the numbers on the acquisition? • Could we have more presentations here at the board meetings from frontline and nonofficer employees?

- • If we look at accounting, regulatory, and product issues in the industry, what are our vulnerabilities? Our problems? Our evolving areas of concern? Of regulators? • How are these double-digit returns continuing? • Why such high officer turnover? (See Antidote #3, too.) When in doubt, ask. Even when not in doubt, ask.

- Adultery is a room silencer. Talk about this issue in a speech about ethics and culture and people in the room avert their eyes or the BlackBerrys come out. No one wants to discuss personal lives. “Invasion of privacy,” they cry. “Moralizing,” they say. But intellectual honesty demands a look at the personal lives of CEOs. At the risk of joining the Larry Summers club for those who endure public ridicule and the follow-up penance for suggesting research in a controversial area, I offer my observation that the conduct of CEOs in their personal lives not only matters but may be a window into the soul of the CEO as a leader and business manager. The companies in which these frauds occurred all had executives with peculiar spending habits. Many of them also had CEOs with peculiar personal lives. In this, the era of nonjudgmentalism, we are loathe to delve into personal lives. However, a harsh reality wants to slap us around as we try to get our arms around failed companies. Neither we nor CEOs function very well when we suffer from moral schizophrenia. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2810))

- And it’s not just marriage, adultery, remarriage, affairs, and more remarriage that we should be wondering about and evaluating. There is an amoral, if not immoral, flavor of hedonism and bizarre behavior by the iconic figures. ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2830))

- The scandals could go on, and they do, even when executives retire. Jack Welch’s affair with the former editor of Harvard Business Review, Suzy Wetlaufer, got her fired for a conflict of interest because at the time the affair began she was doing an interview with Mr. Welch for the Ivy League ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2836))

- B-school’s magazine. It also landed them both in The Wall Street Journal because Jane Welch, wife of Jack Welch for thirteen years, ratted Ms. Wetlaufer out, reporting the conflict to her superiors at Harvard. The result was the bitter divorce battle that brought the mighty wrath of the SEC and GE’s settlement with the agency for the failure to disclose the details of Welch’s compensation package. Hell hath no fury, and Jane Welch bared all of Jack’s personal finances and expenses. Reaction to the Boeing board’s ouster of CEO Harry Stonecipher ranged from “good for Boeing,” to television analyst Bill Maher’s nonchalant irritation reflected in his show’s monologue, “Who cares what a sixty-eight-year-old guy does?” There has also been great murmuring from my colleagues in business ethics about Stonecipher; Boeing; and “private lives,” “police state,” and “moralizing.” The Boeing-Stonecipher issue brought the reemergence of the question of compartmentalization. The compartmentalization theory ran rampant during the Clinton presidency. During l’affair Lewinsky many were outraged at the investigation and intrusion into his private life. Others argued that it was not his private life that was at issue but rather perjury related to his conduct in his ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2838))

- private life. Still others formed a third school of thought with their “Never mind the perjury, what about the adultery?” Can we isolate the private unethical conduct of executives, political leaders, officers, and directors from our evaluations and determinations of whether they are or will behave ethically as fiduciaries, the managers of others’ funds? Perhaps the question has no easy answer, and an exploration of the private lives of those who yielded our greatest corporate scandals nets some inconsistencies in concluding whether private standards and behaviors are important predictors or determinants of ethical conduct in business. The answer to the question of whether private conduct is relevant yields a definite answer only in its indefiniteness. The answer on compartmentalization and relevance of private conduct to behavior in business is “Maybe.” The nature and extent of the private conduct and whether it is part of a pattern may provide a better framework and a more definitive answer than… ([Location 2847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2847))

- or so. Those methods clearly have their flaws. Perhaps what we need is a scale for measuring the moral development or character of those officers to whom the financial reports are entrusted. One measure of moral development is private conduct. How we treat those who are the closest to us and, at least in theory, the most important to us is telling. If they can be treated with disregard and breaches of trust, it is not a leap in logic to conclude that the same character flaw can see its way clear to be dishonest with those who are not even acquaintances. Such a theory of “morality matters” will hardly be embraced for… ([Location 2857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008FPVKVA&location=2857))
