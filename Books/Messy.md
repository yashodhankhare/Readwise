## Highlights
- When we see skilled performers succeeding in difficult circumstances, we habitually describe them as having triumphed over adversity, or despite the odds. But that’s not always the right perspective. Jarrett didn’t produce a good concert in trying times. He produced the performance of a lifetime, but the shortcomings of the piano actually helped him. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=85))

- Keith Jarrett’s instinct was not to play, and it’s an instinct that most of us would share. We don’t want to work with bad tools, especially when the stakes are so high. But in hindsight, Jarrett’s instinct was wrong. What if our own similar instincts are also wrong, and in a much wider range of situations? The argument of this book is that we often succumb to the temptation of a tidy-minded approach when we would be better served by embracing a degree of mess. Keith Jarrett’s desire for a perfect piano was one example of this tidiness temptation. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=96))

- Sometimes, of course, our desire for tidiness—our seemingly innate urge to create a world that is ordered, systematized, quantified, neatly structured into clear categories, planned, predictable—can be helpful. It wouldn’t be such a deeply rooted instinct if it weren’t helpful. But often we are so seduced by the blandishments of tidiness that we fail to appreciate the virtues of the messy—the untidy, unquantified, uncoordinated, improvised, imperfect, incoherent, crude, cluttered, random, ambiguous, vague, difficult, diverse, or even dirty. The scripted speech misreads the energy of the room; the careful commander is disoriented by a more impetuous opponent; the writer is serendipitously inspired by a random distraction; the quantified targets create perverse incentives; the workers in the tidy office feel helpless and demotivated; a disruptive outsider aggravates the team but brings a fresh new insight. The worker with the messy inbox ultimately gets more done; we find a soul mate when we ignore the website questionnaires; the kids running loose in the wasteland not only have more fun and learn more skills, but—counterintuitively—have fewer accidents.

- I hope this book will serve as the Vera Brandes in your life—the nudge, when you are tempted by tidiness, to embrace some mess instead. Each chapter explores a different aspect of messiness, showing how it can spur creativity, nurture resilience, and generally bring out the best in us. That is true whether we are performing with a piano in front of a concert hall audience or a slide deck in front of a boardroom; whether we are running a corporation or manning a call center; whether we are commanding an army, dating, or trying to be a good parent. The success we admire is often built on messy foundations—even if those foundations are often hidden away. I will stand up for messiness not because I think messiness is the answer to all life’s problems, but because I think messiness has too few defenders. I want to convince you that there can sometimes be a certain magic in mess. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=115))

- It’s hard to argue with such results, and Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies now have a cult following in creative circles. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=160))

- The better method is to emulate Brian Eno and introduce a judicious dose of randomness. For example, an algorithm called “simulated annealing” starts with an almost random search, willing to try any change, good or bad. Then it slowly becomes fussier and fussier about what changes it will accept, until eventually it has turned into a rigid search for small step-by-step improvements. There’s no guarantee of finding the very best circuit layout, but this kind of approach will usually find a good one. The combination of gradual improvements and random shocks turns out to be a very effective way to approach a host of difficult problems.

- It’s human nature to want to improve, and this means that we tend to be instinctive hill-climbers. Whether we’re trying to master a hobby, learn a language, write an essay, or build a business, it’s natural to want every change to be a change for the better. But like the problem-solving algorithms, it’s easy to get stuck if we insist that we will never go downhill. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=208))

- Most of us are not virtuoso jazz pianists, silicon chip designers, or elite cyclists. But many of us are commuters, and even the repetitiveness of the daily commute illustrates the power of randomness to unstick us when we don’t even know we’re stuck.

- And then Eno says something that sheds a new light on the way I see the Oblique Strategies cards and the unplayable piano. “The enemy of creative work is boredom, actually,” he says. “And the friend is alertness. Now I think what makes you alert is to be faced with a situation that is beyond your control so you have to be watching it very carefully to see how it unfolds, to be able to stay on top of it. That kind of alertness is exciting.” ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=349))

- What determines whether a scientist keeps publishing important work throughout his or her life? A few highly productive scientists produced breakthrough paper after breakthrough paper. How?26 A striking pattern emerged. The top scientists switched topics frequently. Over the course of their first hundred published papers, the long-lived high-impact researchers switched topics an average of forty-three times. The leaps were less dramatic than the ones Erez Aiden likes to take, but the pattern is the same; the top scientists keep changing the subject if they wish to stay productive. Erez Aiden is less of an outlier than one might think. As Brian Eno says, the friend of creative work is alertness, and nothing focuses your attention like stepping onto unfamiliar ground.

- These days Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing is called 3M, one of the most consistently innovative companies in the world. Given its origins, should we be surprised to discover that 3M has a “flexible attention” policy? In most companies, flexible attention means goofing off on the company dime. In 3M it means playing a game, taking a nap, or going for a walk across an extensive campus to admire the deer. 3M knows that creative ideas don’t always surrender to a frontal assault. Sometimes they sneak up on us while we are paying attention to something else.30 ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=423))

- Two leading creativity researchers, Howard Gruber and Sara Davis, have argued that the tendency to work on multiple projects is so common among the most creative people that it should be regarded as standard practice.31 Gruber had a particular interest in Charles Darwin, who throughout his life alternated between research in geology, zoology, psychology, and botany, always with some projects in the foreground and others in the background, competing for his attention. He undertook his celebrated voyage with the Beagle with “an ample and unprofessional vagueness in his goals.” And then there are the earthworms. Darwin could not get enough of earthworms. This great scientist, who traveled the world, studied the finches of the Galápagos, developed a compelling account of the formation of coral reefs, and—of course—crafted the brilliant, controversial, meticulously argued theory of evolution, studied earthworms from every possible angle for more than forty years. The earthworms were a touchstone, a foundation, almost a security blanket. Whenever Darwin was anxious, puzzled, or at a loss, he could always turn to the study of the humble earthworm.32 Gruber and Davis call this pattern of different projects at different stages of fruition a “network of enterprises.” Such a network of parallel projects has four clear benefits, one of them practical and the others more psychological. The practical benefit is that the multiple projects cross-fertilize. The knowledge gained in one enterprise provides the key to unlock another. This is Erez Aiden’s advantage. He moves back and forth across his network of enterprises, solving an impasse on one project with ideas from another, or unexpectedly fusing two disparate lines of work. Dick Drew did much the same at 3M. Or as David Bowie once put it, “The idea of mixtures has always been something that I’ve found absolutely fascinating, using the wrong pieces of information and putting them together and finding a third piece of information.”33 The psychological advantages may be just as important. First is the point emphasized by Brian Eno, that a fresh context is exciting; having several projects may seem distracting, but instead the variety grabs our attention—we’re like tourists gawping at details that a local would find mundane. The second advantage is that while we’re paying close attention to one project, we may be unconsciously processing another—as with the cliché of inspiration striking in the shower. Some scientists believe that this unconscious processing is an important key to solving creative problems.34 John Kounios, a psychologist at Drexel University, argues that daydreaming strips items of their context.35 That’s a powerful way to unlock fresh thoughts. And there can be few better ways to let the unconscious mind chew over a problem than to turn to a totally different project in the network of enterprises. A third psychological benefit is that each project in the network of enterprises provides an… ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=432))

- Erdős had a more important spell to weave: the Hungarian wizard was quite simply the most prolific collaborator in the history of science. The web of cooperation around the world and across the twentieth century spreads so far it is measured in an honorific unit: the “Erdős number.” People who wrote articles jointly with Erdős himself are said by mathematicians to have an Erdős number ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=558))

- of one. Over five hundred people enjoy this distinction. If you wrote a paper with one of them, your Erdős number is two. Over forty thousand people have Erdős numbers of three or less, all spinning in intellectual orbit around this astonishing man. Erdős’s achievement as the linchpin of so many mathematical partnerships is unsurpassed and perhaps unsurpassable. Think for a moment about his five hundred collaborating authors: each one represents Erdős’s launching into a serious piece of intellectual teamwork—a peer-reviewed scientific paper—with a stranger. He did this, on average, every six weeks for sixty years. In his peak collaborative year, 1987—when he was seventy-four—he formed thirty-five new creative partnerships, one every ten days.5 These collaborations bear little resemblance to the self-sacrificing commitment of the tight-knit rowing crew.

- In 1973, Mark Granovetter, an American sociologist, introduced the paradoxical idea of “the strength of weak ties.” Granovetter looked at a simple sociological question: How do people with good jobs find those jobs? To answer it, he did something new: he looked at the structure of their social networks. After all, as the cliché goes: it’s not what you know, but who. Granovetter observed that the most irreplaceable social connections were the distant ones. Jobs were often discovered through personal contacts, but not because they were handed out by close friends. Instead, the jobs were rooted out by following up leads from distant contacts—old acquaintances from college, perhaps, or colleagues from a previous job. More recent data-driven research—for example, using millions of ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=568))

- mobile-phone call records—backs up Granovetter’s claim that the vital ties are the weak ones.6 This seemingly paradoxical finding is obvious in retrospect. In a clique, everyone knows everyone and all your friends can tell you the same gossip. The more peripheral the contact, the more likely she is to tell you something you didn’t know.7 ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=574))

This homeless, drug-dependent genius was an exhausting houseguest. If he wanted something to eat at four o’clock in the morning—and he often did, since he never cooked a meal for himself in his life—then he would get out a couple of ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=592))

He owned very few clothes, although his vest and underpants were made of silk—these needed to be hand-washed frequently, and not by Erdős. He couldn’t drive, so his hosts were forced to drive him. He couldn’t even pack his own suitcase. People found him impossibly demanding; it was like caring for an infant.9 And yet, everyone loved working with him. Years after his death, papers continued to be published listing Paul Erdős as a coauthor, as the seeds he planted continued to bear fruit. •   •   • ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=595))

- the task ahead of them, cutting themselves off from the temptations of the outside world, they were building up their “bonding social capital.” Paul Erdős restlessly traversed that outside world with a plastic bag full of the latest mathematical offprints, bringing news from Beijing to Princeton to Manchester to Budapest—and from set theory to number theory to probability theory and back—and created “bridging social capital.” We can think of bonding as the tidy-minded approach to collaboration. Minimize disruptions, distractions, obstacles; identify what you have to do; focus your energies on doing it as effectively as possible. It’s analogous to the hill-climbing strategy, while the itinerant genius Erdős personifies the random leap. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to focus only on bonding: when it is absolutely clear how the goal needs to be achieved, and hard work is needed ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=601))

- It’s now widely recognized that cognitive diversity is a recipe for creativity and an antidote to groupthink. Indeed, the very word “groupthink” was popularized by a psychologist, Irving Janis, to describe a process whereby like-minded people make bad decisions without seriously examining them. Keen to maintain a friendly atmosphere within the group, they self-censor their own doubts and do not challenge each other. Since the group is full of smart people, each one feels confident that the group must be making a smart decision. Each one abdicates his own responsibility to think critically, assuming that others are doing the hard thinking for him.15 ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=730))

- “There’s a lot of empirical data to show that diverse cities are more productive, diverse boards of directors make better decisions, the most innovative companies are diverse.”18 The logic behind these results is that when dealing with a complicated problem, even the smartest person can get stuck. Adding a new perspective or a new set of skills can unstick us, even if the perspective is off-the-wall or the skills are mediocre. The fresh input works much like the Oblique Strategies employed by Brian Eno or the random leaps used by silicon chip algorithms. It’s the difference itself that helps.

- While this all sounds very reasonable, the truth is that facing up to these different views can be messy and awkward. For example, in 2006 the psychologist Samuel Sommers examined the decision-making processes of juries, some all-white and some racially mixed. (These were mock trials based on real cases.) Deliberating the case of a black defendant, the mixed juries did a better job of working through the information presented to them. This wasn’t just because the black jurors brought a fresh perspective to the deliberation room. It was also because white jurors were less lazy in their thinking when black jurors were present, citing more facts about the case and making fewer mistakes.19 People think harder when they fear their views may be challenged by outsiders. Other researchers have found similar effects. For example, when experimental subjects are challenged to write an essay, they write better, more logical prose when told their work will be read by someone with different political beliefs rather than someone like-minded.20 ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=753))

- When deliberating with a group, then, we should be seeking out people who think differently, who have different experiences and training, and who look different. Those people may bring fresh and useful ideas to the table; even if they do not, they’ll bring out the best in us—even if only by making us feel awkward and forcing us to shape up. That messy, challenging process is one we should embrace. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=762))

- It makes sense that for most teams, there must be a trade-off between the cohesion of a rowing team and the radical openness of an Erdős network. The trouble is that we systematically get the trade-off wrong. Faced with a choice of more cohesion versus more openness, our temptation to be tidy-minded means we’ll go for cohesion every time. Cohesion makes us feel more comfortable. We mistakenly think that diversity is getting in the way even when it’s helping. Like Carlos Alomar in Berlin, we don’t enjoy the disruption, we don’t believe the disruption is useful, and it may be months or years before we finally realize how much we gained from what seemed at the time to be an awful mess.

- Of course it’s human nature to spend time with your friends. But what’s striking about this research is that people said they intended to do exactly the opposite. People went to a networking event with the expressed intention of expanding their social networks, and they didn’t even try. Those that did meet new people encountered only friends of friends, perpetuating old cliques. In principle, the modern world gives us more opportunities than ever to forge relationships with people who do not look, act, or think the same way that we do. Travel is cheaper, communication is free and instantaneous, and a host of tools exist to help us reach across previously unbridgeable social divides. But what do we do with these opportunities? We keep our social networks nice and tidy by seeking out people just like us. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=823))

- The pattern repeats endlessly: we gain new choices about whom to listen to, whom to trust, and whom to befriend—and we use those new choices to tighten the circle around us to people who are more and more like us. Given a larger social map to explore, we pick the tidiest corner we can find. We use a large, diverse campus to meet people exactly like us. At a networking event, we stick with old friends even though our explicit aim was to meet new people. And when we are forced into the discomfiting position of working with strangers, we disparage the very team dynamic that is bringing us success.

- spend time with people who look and sound just like us. Instead we need to find the social equivalent of Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies: people with whom or places or situations where we won’t be able to avoid new kinds of interactions. Perhaps it’s as simple as joining a new group, learning a skill, or engaging in a pastime with strangers. Perhaps it’s taking an extended trip to a distant city, a place where everyone is a stranger. Or perhaps it is being a little braver at the next networking event. A second lesson emerges from the work of de Vaan, Stark, and Vedres on how networks of different teams were able to come together and produce excellent computer games: we should place great value on the people who connect together disparate teams. These are not just Erdős-style free spirits, but people who have worked intimately with more than one group, whom several teams regard as “one of us.” Rather ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=879))

They are both bridging and bonding simultaneously. “The role of these people is to knit together the teams and to build trust,” says Balázs Vedres.33 This is a tough and undervalued role. Says Mathijs de Vaan, “there is a lot of pressure on these people.”34 And Vedres adds, “It is hard to be a double insider.” It is, however, essential. A third lesson is to constantly remind yourself of the benefits of tension, which can be easy to forget when all you want is a quiet life.

The Sky cycling team won the 2012 and 2013 Tour de France, but then underperformed in 2014. The team’s manager, Dave Brailsford, was wise enough to identify the problem: “We’d been becoming pretty aligned over the last six years working together,” he said of the core team around him. “If you gave us a problem we’d come back with the same answer, [we had lost] the cognitive diversity we had as a group. [Before] when I would say something, they would say ‘bollocks,’ we’d argue a lot, there would be tension but we’d come up with some good ideas, constantly pushing forward.”35… ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=894))

- from side to side, bring new people in who will question everything, ask why we are doing this, take us forward.” Sky bounced back and won the Tour de France again in 2015. A final lesson is that we have to believe the ultimate goal of the collaboration is something worth achieving, and worth the mess of dealing with awkward people. Brailsford says that “team harmony” is overrated: he wants “goal harmony” instead, a team focused on achieving a common goal rather than having members get along with one another.

A good problem contains the seeds of its own solution.

But 5S has somehow begun to bleed from car assembly lines and operating theaters and semiconductor manufacturing plants, where it might make sense, to the office cubicle, where ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=976))

Management gurus sing the praises of the “lean office.” As The Wall Street Journal explained back in 2008, adherents of 5S at organizations such as Kyocera “are patrolling to make sure that workers don’t, for example, put knickknacks on file cabinets.” When the Journal went to Kyocera’s San Diego offices and followed the “5S inspector” around (he was a gently spoken middle manager by the name of Dan Brown), he was armed with a checklist and a digital camera as he cajoled his colleagues into removing illicit hooks from cubicle walls. He refused to be deflected by a clutterbug who had swept his junk into boxes and stored them in a closet. The closet was opened, the boxes inspected and photographed.7 This might seem intrusive, but as a management consultant breezily explained, “If managers clearly explain why they’re doing something, I think most people will ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=980))

- understand the rationale.” Perhaps. But then what is the rationale? The closest the Journal got to an explanation was that “to impress visitors, the company wants everything to be clean and neat.” This is why “sweaters can’t hang on the backs of chairs, personal items can’t be stowed beneath desks and the only decorations allowed on cabinets are official company plaques or certificates.” Clear enough: things must look tidy to put on a good show for visitors. But will visitors really be won over by cabinets decorated with Kyocera’s own self-congratulatory plaudits? And if the aim is to impress visitors, why was Dan Brown earnestly examining the inside of filing cabinets and closets? Le Corbusier’s vision was revolutionary; Steve Jobs’s was exacting; Kyocera’s was petty. But in all three cases one can see a very simple mistake being made.

- Managers could be tidy-minded simply because tidiness seems like the right and proper way to be. “We all have this desire for formal order,” Propst had written in 1968. “The only problem is that it conflicts severely with the more organic kind of spatial order human interchange uses best.”29 So far, the desire for formal order is winning. We like tidiness to the point of fetishizing it; we find clutter and irregularity disturbing and don’t notice when it is doing us good.

The longer T George Harris chased credible research into the impact of “good design” on employee productivity, the more elusive that research seemed. “People suddenly put into ‘good design’ did not seem to wake up and love it,” he wrote. What they loved instead was control over the space in which they had to live or work. And that control typically leads to mess.

The improvising brain is a little like the tipsy brain, although alcohol is much cruder, making us clumsy as well as disinhibited. It is no wonder that at its best, improvisation can produce flashes of pure brilliance. No wonder, either, that with the internal censor asleep, it sometimes feels like a messy, reckless thing to risk.

Ratner had told the joke in speeches before, without running into problems. And as he prepared to deliver the speech on a larger stage, he sought advice. Several people advised caution; others encouraged him to tell even more daring jokes. They thought Ratner would sound self-deprecating and that his audience would love the jokes—which on the night, they did. But when written up in the newspapers the next morning, in the depths of a recession, Ratner simply sounded like a millionaire mocking his struggling customers. Ratner’s downfall was caused not by a lack of preparation, but by a lack of judgment. Ratner did exactly what he planned to do—he had simply failed to foresee the consequences. Improvisation was not to blame. ([Location 1631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=1631))

- Sometimes it is wise not to improvise. If you never speak in public but must say something at a wedding, and your highest ambition is not to embarrass yourself, then the risk-reward calculation is likely to point to writing a script. But if you are delivering a talk that should be informal and interactive, yet you are reading out a backdrop of bullet-point slides, you’ve cast a vote of no confidence in yourself—just as a telemarketing script is the micromanagers’ vote of no confidence in their junior staff.

The Apgar score is an example of this: a newborn baby’s Apgar score is not the only thing that matters, but because it is easy to measure, it looms large. It is easier to count trees in a forest than it is to measure biodiversity.

- to the timetable, and who keeps on time by driving past lines of passengers without stopping. These cases are all examples of tunnel vision, resulting from a target or measure that is too narrow. In extreme cases, the target may not be just too narrow, but also downright misleading. David Dranove’s study of cardiac report cards in New York and Pennsylvania shows this starkly. The report cards were supposed to measure whether a surgeon was good at performing heart bypass operations, but they inevitably also reflected how ill patients were before the operation started. The report cards were easily misunderstood by patients, and surgeons were being pulled into fixating on what would make those report cards look good—namely, finding healthier patients rather than improving ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=2338))

- further irony is that when two statisticians, Harvey Goldstein and David Spiegelhalter, looked at the report card data, they concluded that the main determinant of patient survival rates wasn’t the surgeon’s skill—they were all broadly similar—but pure luck. A surgeon might be one of the most dangerous doctors one year, and one of the safest the next.12 Such tunnel vision may be related to a time period. This results in short-termism, where long-term investment is sacrificed in order to hit a short-term target.

You study for months, or years, knowing that only a tiny fraction of the knowledge you’re accumulating will come in handy when you sit for your final exam. As the philosopher Jeremy Bentham put it in 1830, when pondering civil service exams, the deliberate ambiguity as to what might be asked had the effect of “impossibilizing the knowledge” of how to game the examination. The only response to having one’s knowledge of the test “impossibilized”: work hard and try to be good at everything.21 The answer is neither the weighty rule book of Basel nor one simple rule of ([Location 2516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=2516))

The better the automatic systems, the more out-of-practice human operators will be, and the more unusual will be the situations they face.3 The psychologist James Reason, author of Human Error, wrote: “Manual control is a highly skilled activity, and skills need to be practiced continuously in order to maintain them. Yet an automatic control system that fails only rarely denies operators the opportunity for practicing these basic control skills . . . when manual takeover is necessary something has usually gone wrong; this means that operators need to be more rather than less skilled in order to cope with these atypical conditions.”*4 The paradox of automation, then, has three strands ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=2685))

- to it. First, automatic systems accommodate incompetence by being easy to operate and by automatically correcting mistakes. Because of this an inexpert operator can function for a long time before his lack of skill becomes apparent—his incompetence is a hidden weakness that can persist almost indefinitely without being detected. Second, even if operators are expert, automatic systems erode their skills by removing the need for them to practice. Third, automatic systems tend to fail either in unusual situations or in ways that produce unusual situations, requiring a particularly skillful human response. For each of these three strands, a more capable and reliable automatic system makes the situation worse. There are plenty of situations in which automation creates no such paradox.

Not so with an airplane. Autopilots and the more subtle assistance of fly-by-wire do not free up the crew to concentrate on the interesting stuff. Instead, they free up the crew to fall asleep at the controls, figuratively or even literally.

And if they turn off the autopilot in a challenging situation, they may provoke the very accident they are practicing to avoid. An alternative solution is to reverse the role of computer and human.

If we want to predict whether a city block’s residents think that it’s a mess, we would learn more from looking at data on race and poverty than we would learn from looking at videos of what the neighborhood actually looks like.

Most of us know that monoculture is a risky idea, and would scoff at the hubris of replacing an entire ecosystem with a single species and expecting everything to go well. We’ve all read about the importance of “good bacteria.” But it seems hard for us to take these warnings to heart. When a doctor tells us we have a minor bacterial infection and prescribes antibiotics, few of us say that we’d really rather not take them unless absolutely necessary. Indeed, many patients demand to be prescribed antibiotics for viral infections, a situation where antibiotics are useless.

- Yet the great man had one weakness—or so he thought. Ben Franklin’s third virtue was: Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. Franklin never mastered this seemingly simple task. “My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble,” he wrote in frustration in his memoirs, adding, “my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt.” He was not exaggerating. One scholar wrote, “Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor.”2 Franklin’s diary and his home remained chaotic, resisting sixty years of focused effort from one of the most determined men who ever lived. No matter how many disorderly decades passed, Franklin remained convinced that orderliness was an unalloyed virtue: that if only he could fix this deficiency in his character, and become less messy, he would become a more admirable, successful, and productive person.

Over time, recently used documents will shuffle themselves toward the left, and never-used documents will accumulate on the right.

Unused documents gradually settle at the bottom. Of course this arrangement lacks the neat labeling of the Noguchi system, but it offers intuitive physical clues such as the thickness of a document, the shade of the paper, the appearance of dog-ears or Post-it notes. These signals are fallible, but they can be powerful. This is not to argue that a big pile of paper is the best possible filing system.

That’s the thing about a messy desk or a messy office: it’s full of clues about recent patterns of working, and those clues can help us work effectively. David Kirsh, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego, studies the working styles of “neats” and “scruffies.” For example, how do people orient themselves after arriving at the office or finishing a phone call? Kirsh finds that “neats” orient themselves with to-do lists and calendars, while “scruffies” orient themselves using physical cues—the report that they were working… ([Location 3458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3458))

- workplace behavior sometimes make the distinction between “filers” and “pilers”—people who establish a formal organizational structure for their paper documents, versus people who let piles of paperwork accumulate on and around their desks. A few years ago, two researchers at AT&T Labs, Steve Whittaker and Julia Hirschberg, studied how a group of office workers dealt with their paperwork. Who hoarded the most paper? Who used their archives more actively? When an office relocation forced everyone to reduce the size of their archives, who coped best? The answers surprised Whittaker and Hirschberg… ([Location 3472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3472))

- wrote. But that isn’t what they found. The filers didn’t have lean archives full of useful and oft-accessed documents; they had capacious cabinets full of neatly filed paper that they never used. The filers were filing prematurely. In an effort to keep their desks clear, they would swiftly file documents that turned out to have no long-term value. In their bloated archives it was hard to find anything useful, despite the logical organization, because the good stuff was surrounded with neatly filed dross. The Borges problem made things harder—as one person told Whittaker and Hirschberg: “I had so much stuff filed. I didn’t know where everything was, and I’d found that I had created second files for something in what seemed like a logical place, but not the only logical place . . . In some cases, things could legitimately be filed under the business unit or a technology. And I ended up having the same thing in two places, or I had the same business unit stuff in five different places.” And because they were devoting so much effort to their filing systems, the filers became unduly attached to their archives and found it difficult to let go of things. The pilers, in contrast, would keep documents on their desks for a while and sooner or later would pick them up,… ([Location 3477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3477))

Does this e-mail from the boss mentioning a performance review, the office party, and the Acme account go under Work > Human Resources or under Work > Boss or under Personal > Diary or under Work > Accounts > Acme?

- If carefully filing paper documents is counterproductive and carefully organizing e-mails is a waste of time, what should we conclude about the way to manage a calendar? There are two broad approaches to calendar management. One is that a calendar should be used only for noting fixed points—a doctor’s appointment, a flight, a business meeting. Most of the calendar should be left blank to allow us to do whatever seems appropriate in the moment. But an… ([Location 3510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3510))

- Fortunately, we don’t need to guess at which approach works best: three psychologists, Daniel Kirschenbaum, Laura Humphrey, and Sheldon Malett, have already run the experiment. Kirschenbaum and his colleagues recruited a group of undergraduates to participate in a short course designed to improve their study skills. The students were then split randomly into three groups: a control group who were given simple tips on time management (for example: “Take breaks of 5–10 minutes after every ½–1½ hour study session”) and two groups who were given the time-management tips plus instructions as to how to plan their time. The “monthly plan” group was instructed to set out goals and study activities spanning a month or so at a time; the “daily plan” group was told to plan activities and goals day by day. The researchers assumed that the planners would be more successful than the control group, and that the daily plans, with their brief, quantifiable goals, would work better than the rather amorphous monthly plans.13 The researchers were in for a surprise. The daily plans were catastrophic. Students using them started by working 20 hours a week but by the end of the course they were down to about 8 hours a week.

- slightly harder at the end of the 10-week course than at the beginning. These are huge effects—the monthly plan motivated about twice as much work as the daily plan. When the researchers followed up a year later, these trends had continued and were reflected in the students’ grades: the students with monthly plans were doing better than ever, the students with no plans were treading water, and the students with daily plans were sliding ever further down the scale of academic achievement. Why was this happening? The researchers had two theories. First, that the daily plans took too much time and effort (many… ([Location 3526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3526))

- falling short of their own plans. Both of those speculations sound plausible, but they raise the question of why students weren’t able to follow their own daily plans. The answer is that daily plans can’t adjust to unexpected events. Things come up: you catch a cold; you need to stay home for a plumber; a friend calls to say he’s visiting town unexpectedly. With a broad plan, or no plan, it’s easy to accommodate these obstacles and opportunities. Some people manage to take this to extremes.

Otherwise it wasn’t worth signing away a slice of Andreessen’s future. “I’ve been trying this tactic as an experiment,” he wrote in 2007. “And I am so much happier, I can’t even tell you.”14 Another example: Arnold Schwarzenegger insisted on keeping his diary clear when he was a film star, and even tried to do so when he was governor of California. “Appointments are always a no-no.

In the summer of 2014, OkCupid published the results of a few experiments it had been running on the site’s users.18 One of these experiments deployed a kind of placebo matching algorithm: users were told that they were 90 percent compatible (what does that even mean?) when in fact the computer believed them to be barely compatible at all. It soon emerged that being told that the algorithm rated you as a good match was just as effective at promoting an extended online chat as actually being a good algorithmic match.

The computer’s job was to imitate human conversation convincingly enough to confuse the judge.28 Turing optimistically predicted that by the year 2000, computers would be able to fool 30 percent ([Location 3694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3694))

- sleeping with the pickup artist. But I wonder if the true secret of negging is that insults are very simple and elicit simple responses. It’s possible to get through a conversation full of little insults without ever really having to listen, or to improvise a response. If you needle a woman about her weight, you need never engage with the intimidating fact that she is another human being, someone who has her own story to tell, her own talents, friends, history, and hopes. No script could hope to deal with such messy complexity. The “negging” technique is similar to a surprisingly compelling chatbot, MGonz, which fools humans simply by firing off insults: “cut this cryptic shit speak in full sentences,” “ah thats it im not talking to you any more,” and “you are obviously an asshole.” MGonz ([Location 3710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3710))

- would never pass a Turing test with an informed judge, but it has drawn unsuspecting humans into abusive dialogues on the Internet that last for over an hour without its ever being suspected of being a chatbot. The reason? People in the middle of a slanging match share something with computers: they find it hard to listen.31 Even for those who aspire to more meaningful connections than the pickup artist, there are temptations to simplify and tidy by using scripts or algorithms. For an illustration of this, take a look at your smartphone. Start typing and see what it suggests. Composing a text message to my wife, I typed “Ju” into my phone and waited for the phone to suggest the rest, word by word. Here’s the message my wife received: “Just wanted to let you ([Location 3716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BD1SU2E&location=3716))

After a delay, she wrote back: “Thank you! Sorry have been busy! XXXX you are totally amazing! Xx” Or at least I think the message was from her. But much of it may have been from her phone. The reason a smartphone is able to produce a plausible and indeed affectionate sentence is that we repeat ourselves. There is nothing wrong with a little formulaic chat from time to time—why else would we talk of “sweet nothings”?
