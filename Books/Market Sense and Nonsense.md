## Highlights
- ESW began by examining a portfolio formed by the stocks recommended on Mad Money, assuming each stock was entered on the close before the evening airing of the program on which it was recommended—a point in time deliberately chosen to reflect the market’s valuation prior to the program’s price impact. They assumed an equal dollar allocation among recommended stocks and tested the results for a variety of holding periods, ranging from 50 to 250 trading days. The differences in returns between these recommendation-based ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=379))

- portfolios and the market were statistically insignificant across all holding periods and net negative for most. ESW then looked at the overnight price impact (percentage change from previous close to next day’s open) of Cramer’s recommendations and found an extremely large 2.4 percent average abnormal return—that is, return in excess of the average price change of similar stocks for the same overnight interval. As might be expected based on the mediocre results of existing investors in the same stocks and the large overnight influence of Cramer’s recommendations, using entries on the day after the program, the recommendation-based portfolios underperformed the market across all the holding periods. The annualized ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=383))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- underperformance was substantial, ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent. The worst performance was for the shortest holding period (50 days), suggesting a strong bias for stocks to surrender their “Cramer bump” in the ensuing period. The bottom line seems to be that investors would be better off buying and holding an index than buying the Mad Money recommendations—although, admittedly, there is much less entertainment value in buying an index.

- I don’t mean to pick on Cramer. There is no intention to paint Cramer as a showman with no investment skill. On the contrary, according to an October 2005 BusinessWeek article, Cramer achieved a 24 percent net compounded return during his 14-year tenure as a hedge fund ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=392))

- Rukeyser no doubt terminated the Elves Index as an embarrassment. Although he didn’t comment on the timing of the decision, it is reasonable to assume he couldn’t tolerate another major sell signal in the index coinciding with what would probably prove to be a relative low (as it was). Although the Elves Index had compiled a terrible record—never right, but often wrong—its demise was deeply regretted by many market observers.

- Investment Misconception 1: The average investor can benefit by listening to the recommendations made by the financial experts. Reality: The amazing thing about expert advice is how consistently it fails to do better than a coin toss. In fact, even that assessment is overly generous, as the preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that the experts do worse than random. Yes, that means the chimpanzee throwing darts at the stock quote page will not merely do as well as the experts—the chimpanzee will do better!

- My advice to equity investors is either buy an index fund (but not after a period of extreme gains—see Chapter 3) or, if you have sufficient interest and motivation, devote the time and energy to develop your own investment or trading methodology. Neither of these approaches involves listening to the recommendations of the experts. Michael Marcus, a phenomenally successful trader, offered some sage advice on the matter: “You have to follow your own light. . . . As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=486))

- The efficient market hypothesis, a theory explaining how market prices are determined and the implications of the process, has been the foundation of much of the academic research on markets and investing during the past half century. The theory underlies virtually every important aspect of investing, including risk ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=507))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- measurement, portfolio optimization, index investing, and option pricing. The efficient market hypothesis can be summarized as follows: Prices of traded assets already reflect all known information. Asset prices instantly change to reflect new information. Therefore, Market prices are true and accurate. It is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any information that the market already knows. The efficient market hypothesis comes in three basic flavors: 1. Weak efficiency. This form of the efficient market hypothesis states that past market price data cannot be used to ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=509))

- market hypothesis not only requires believing that the fundamentals improved sufficiently between October 1998 and March 2000 to justify a 600 percent increase in this short time span, but that the fundamentals then deteriorated sufficiently for prices to fall 86 percent by September 2001. A far more plausible explanation is that the giant rally in Internet stocks from late 1998 to early 2000 was unwarranted by the fundamentals, and therefore the ensuing collapse represented a return of prices to levels more consistent with prevailing fundamentals. Such an explanation, however, contradicts the efficient market hypothesis, which would require new fundamental developments ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=568))

- view and the efficient market hypothesis framework. Whereas the efficient market hypothesis view of the world argues that it is futile to search for opportunities because the market price is always right, a view that investor emotions can cause prices to deviate widely from reasonable valuations implies that there are opportunities to profit from market prices being wrong (that is, routinely trading at premiums or discounts to fair value).

- In the world described by the efficient market hypothesis, price moves occur because the fundamentals change and prices adjust. Large price moves therefore imply some very major event. On October 19, 1987, a day that became known as Black Monday, equity indexes witnessed an incredible plunge. The Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 index lost 20.5 percent, by far the largest single-day loss ever. Moreover, the actual decline was far worse. The cash S&P index, which normally is kept tightly in line with S&P futures by arbitrageurs, dramatically lagged the decline in futures on October 19, 1987, because the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) order processing system ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=691))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- couldn’t keep up with the avalanche of orders. These mechanical delays resulted in stale limit orders (that is, orders placed earlier in the day when index prices were higher) being executed. Thus the cash market index close on October 19, 1987, was itself stale and significantly understated the actual decline. The more liquid futures market, which did not embed such stale pricing and therefore was a far more accurate indicator of the actual decline, fell by an even more astounding 29 percent! Even Black Tuesday, the October 28, 1929, crash, failed to come close, losing a mere 12.94 percent.6 Although the 1929 Black Tuesday decline was followed the next day by an additional 10.2 percent decline, even the loss on these two days combined was ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=696))

- still one-third smaller than the S&P futures decline on October 19, 1987. All other historic daily declines in stocks were less than one-third as large (using S&P futures as the comparison). In short, the October 19, 1987, crash towers above all other historic declines, including the infamous October 1929 crash.

- There are two ways of looking at the 1987 crash in the context of the efficient market hypothesis. 1. Wow, that was really unlucky! 2. If the efficient market hypothesis were correct, the probability of the 1987 crash is clearly in the realm of impossibility. Therefore, if the model implies the impossible, the model must be wrong.

- Normally, price spreads in copper (as well as other storable commodities) trade in a contango structure, a technical term that simply means that contract months further in the future trade at higher prices than more nearby contracts. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=777))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This premium for more distant contracts makes sense because there is a cost in holding inventories (e.g., interest on financing, storage charges). If supplies are ample, holders of the stored commodity must be compensated, and therefore forward contracts will trade at a premium. In contrast, in times of shortage, everything changes. Here, concerns over running out of supplies will trump storage costs as buyers are willing to pay a premium for immediate supplies, and ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=779))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- nearby months will trade at higher levels than more forward-dated months—a market structure termed backwardation. When the market is in backwardation, producers will be less inclined to hedge their anticipated forward output, because they would be locking in a price below the current price. Even more critical, if cash price levels remain unchanged or go higher, forward short hedge positions will generate large margin calls as their prices rise to meet the cash level with the approach of the contract expiration date. The combination of reduced hedge selling and especially producer short covering, as it becomes too expensive to meet margin calls, can cause a price advance to become near vertical. In this sense, besides merely acting as a barometer of supply tightness, ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=782))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Of course, major unexpected developments will have an immediate market impact when they become known, but for the most part the efficient market hypothesis assumption that prices instantaneously adjust to fundamental news has it exactly backwards. It is far more accurate to say that the financial news will instantaneously adjust to price changes. Whether the market is up or down on a given day, financial reporters have to find an explanation for the price move. Therefore, an explanation will be drawn from the coincident news developments on that day, regardless of whether they are pertinent. This routine process can lead to the comical situation of ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=890))

- August 26, 2011, offered a perfect example. On that day, the market sold off in the morning, and then rallied sharply into the afternoon. The key focus of market attention was a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The following two headlines led stock market news stories issued by the same newswire service on the same day: Wall Street Slides after Bernanke Comments Wall Street Bounces as Bernanke Keeps Hopes Alive The first story read, “Major indexes fell more than 1 percent after Federal Reserve ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=896))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economic recovery was much less robust than hoped but stopped short of signaling further action to boost growth.” The second story saw things a bit differently and explained, “Bernanke raised hope the Fed could consider further stimulus measures for the economy at an extended policy meeting in September.” Now, you could believe that the same event was bearish before it was bullish. It seems considerably more plausible, though, to believe that the interpretation of the event was altered to fit the market price action. I can assure you that if the market had failed to rebound, there would not have been any stories about how the market ignored Bernanke’s constructive comments.

- Indeed, virtually all the contradictions to the efficient market hypothesis we have cited can be traced back to the potential for human emotions and irrational behavior to distort prices. Markets do not accurately discount all known fundamentals, but rather they overdiscount or underdiscount this information, depending on the market’s emotional environment, and indeed this is one of the sources of investing or trading opportunities. A much more realistic model of how markets actually work is that prices are determined by a combination of fundamentals and emotions. The same exact set of fundamentals can lead to different prices given different emotional environments. The long history of market bubbles and crashes provides overwhelming empirical evidence that the “madness of crowds”14 can take market prices far beyond any rational level based on value and fundamentals and that market panics can result in precipitous price declines completely removed from any contemporaneous changes in fundamentals. These and similar events can be explained only by acknowledging the obvious and sometimes overpowering impact of human emotions, which can and often do lead to completely irrational behavior.

- Advocates of the efficient market hypothesis are absolutely correct in contending that markets are very difficult to beat, but they are right for the wrong reason. The difficulty in gaining an edge in the markets is not because prices instantaneously discount all known information (although they sometimes do), but rather because the impact of emotion on prices varies greatly and is nearly impossible to gauge. Sometimes emotions will cause prices to wildly overshoot any reasonable definition of fair value—we ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=1061))

- call these periods market bubbles. At other times, emotions will cause prices to plunge far below any reasonable definition of fair value—we call these periods market panics. Finally, in perhaps the majority of the time, emotions will exert a limited distortive impact on prices—market environments in which the efficient market hypothesis provides a reasonable approximation. So either market prices are not significantly out of line with fair valuations (muted influence of emotions on price) or we are faced with the difficult task of determining how far the price deviation may extend.

Investors with an interest in markets who are willing to put in the hard work to develop an investment or trading methodology and who have the discipline to follow a plan should not be dissuaded from that endeavor by the efficient market hypothesis. The model of market prices being determined strictly by fundamentals is overly simplistic. Prices are determined by both fundamentals and human emotions. Sometimes, the impact of human emotions can completely swamp the fundamentals.

- How do people decide when to invest? How do investors select among different alternatives? In virtually all investment decisions, the key driver is past returns. The investor calculus is simple: High returns are good; low returns or losses are bad. When the stock market has been rising, investor buying interest will increase. Conversely, after a period of market decline, investors will be more prone to liquidate than to invest. The strong relationship between market returns and investor net flows into equity ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=1229))

In fact, insofar as past returns have any relevance as an investment decision input, their significance is more often the exact reverse of what most investors believe it to be—that is, past high returns are more likely to be a negative rather than positive indicator.

In short, the strategy pursued by Fund X is one that would win the majority of times, but occasionally could be vulnerable to a mammoth loss.

- Consider the two managers in Table 8.1. Which is the better-performing manager? We assume that hidden risk, as discussed in Chapter 4, is not an issue and that standard deviation is therefore a reasonable proxy for risk. We also assume that the managers are considered qualitatively equivalent. Table 8.1 A Comparison of Two Managers Many investors would opt for Manager B, reasoning, “I am willing to accept the ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=2539))

- higher risk to get the higher return potential.” But is this reasoning rational? In Table 8.2 we add a third investment alternative—leveraging an investment with Manager A at 300 percent.2 The leveraged investment with Manager A now has both a higher return and lower risk than Manager B. So even risk-seeking investors should prefer Manager A, using a leverage factor that raises return to the desired level. Table 8.2 A Comparison of Two Managers Revisited One can picture risk as a hole—the deeper the hole, the greater the risk—and return as a pile of sand.

Finally, for highly liquid strategies, such as futures and FX trading, which are the types of strategies best suited for managed accounts, a large percentage of the managers are available as managed accounts. Investment Misconception 44: Only poor-quality managers will offer managed accounts. Reality: While there are certainly many excellent managers who do not offer managed accounts, there are also many who do. Moreover, the number of managers who offer managed accounts is steadily growing, as large institutional investors demand better account ([Location 4394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4394))

- control and transparency. Investors seeking the safety of a managed account structure will have a smaller universe of available managers (vis-à-vis funds), but there are more than enough top-quality managers accessible via managed accounts to form a well-diversified portfolio. Investment Misconception 45: Managed account investing is more expensive than traditional hedge fund investing. Reality: This perception is based on superficial comparisons and fails to account for all the relevant factors. We examine the assertion that managed accounts are more expensive than funds separately for ([Location 4399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4399))

- each of the three types of managed account investment: 1. Direct investment. For direct managed account investments, there are no additional fees, and investors large enough to go this route are often able to get a discount to the fund fee levels. 2. Funds of managed accounts. Fees charged by funds of managed accounts are similar to those charged by funds of funds. In addition, some of the advantages of the managed account structure provide benefits that have monetary value (e.g., more prompt repayment of redeemed assets, ([Location 4405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4405))

- more efficient use of investment capital, etc.). 3. Managed account platforms. While platforms do add another layer of fees, these fees are at least partially offset by less directly visible monetary benefits. If all the monetary benefits of managed accounts (implicit as well as explicit) are taken into account, the net additional expense incurred by using platforms is generally small.

- Investment Misconception Investment Misconception 46: The diversification benefits beyond 10 holdings are minimal (even for heterogeneous investment universes such as hedge funds). Reality: Research studies that conclude that diversification benefits beyond 10 are minimal are invariably based on what happens on average across thousands of portfolios rather than what happens in the worst case to a specific portfolio (that is, tail risk). Most investors and portfolio ([Location 4586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4586))

- managers, however, are very much concerned about the worst-case risk for their portfolios, not what happens on average across all portfolios. For these investors, diversification well beyond 10 can provide substantial risk-reduction benefits. How many more beyond 10 will be case dependent, but generally speaking, 20 or more will be a better choice than 10 (as long as added investments are of equivalent quality and sufficiently diversified with other managers to reduce the average correlation of managers in the portfolio).

- Increasing the number of investments in a portfolio will increase diversification and reduce risk (assuming added investments are equivalent to existing investments in return and risk terms). Reality: Increasing the number of investments can actually increase portfolio risk if the added investments are highly correlated to other portfolio holdings or each other.

- Investment Misconception 48: In a multimanager portfolio, performance can be improved by increasing the allocations to managers who are doing well and reducing the allocations to those who are underperforming. Reality: More often than not, doing the exact opposite, as is implicit in routinely rebalancing the portfolio, will provide a better outcome. Of course, a portfolio manager may decide to redeem a manager for any number of reasons, which is an entirely different matter. But as long as a manager is retained in the portfolio, increasing allocations ([Location 4844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4844))

- Investment Misconception 49: If two funds have similar returns (and are similar in other characteristics), the lower-volatility fund will always be preferred. Reality: Although lower volatility is usually preferable, if a fund is inversely correlated to the portfolio to which it is being added, all bets are off. In this case, as was illustrated in the foregoing example, it is entirely possible that higher volatility could be net ([Location 4945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=4945))

- beneficial. (If the assets being combined are inversely correlated, higher volatility may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral, depending on the series being combined.) Investment Misconception 50: A higher return/volatility ratio is always preferred for equivalent funds. Reality: For investments that are inversely correlated to the portfolio to which they are being added, the return/risk ratio breaks down as a meaningful measurement for the individual investment and has meaning only when applied to the combined portfolio.

- Reality: The key implicit premise of portfolio optimization is that past returns, volatilities, and correlations provide reasonable estimates for expected future levels. This inherent assumption is not merely frequently invalid, but when there are major market turning points, optimized portfolios may well yield worse-than-random results. The exactness provided by portfolio optimization is a false precision because it is usually based on inaccurate assumptions.

Reality: Category labels are ([Location 5171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UG7DCS&location=5171))

- unavoidably arbitrary and can be poor indicators of fund differentiation. If the objective is to achieve a well-diversified portfolio, it is far more effective to focus on selecting differentiated managers than to allocate specified percentages to different category buckets. A top-down approach can easily result in an overly correlated portfolio because managers in different categories can still end up being vulnerable to the same risk factors. Investment Misconception 53: If managers are considered qualitatively equivalent, the manager with better return/risk potential would always be preferred.

- Reality: What is true in selecting a stand-alone investment is not necessarily true in selecting an investment for a portfolio. A poorer-performing investment could well be more beneficial to portfolio performance than a superior-performing investment if it is also significantly inversely correlated to other portfolio holdings. Investment Misconception 54: If the investments in a portfolio are judged to be of approximately equivalent merit, then an equal allocation approach is appropriate.

- also likely to be more effective in mitigating portfolio risk. Investment Misconception 55: The portfolio correlation matrix provides a comprehensive tool for identifying funds that are likely to lose money in the same periods. Reality: The correlation matrix is very useful in flagging funds that may be more likely to witness simultaneous losses, but because correlation is based on all months rather than losing months, it can sometimes be inadequate and even misleading in identifying funds that are prone to losses at the same time as other funds in the portfolio.
