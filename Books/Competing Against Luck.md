## Highlights
- You think you know just what your customers would like, but in reality, it can feel pretty hit or miss. ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=36))

- But that doesn’t have to be the case, not when you truly understand what causes consumers to make the choices they do. Innovation can be far more predictable—and far more profitable—but only if you think about it differently. It’s about progress, not products.

- None of that data, however, actually tells you why customers make the choices that they do. Let me illustrate. Here I am, Clayton Christensen. I’m sixty-four years old. I’m six feet eight inches tall. My shoe size is sixteen. My wife and I have sent all our children off to college. I live in a suburb of Boston and drive a Honda minivan to work. I have a lot of other characteristics and attributes. But these characteristics have not yet caused me to go out and buy the New York Times today. There might be a correlation between some of these characteristics and the propensity of customers to purchase the Times. But those attributes don’t cause me to buy that paper—or any other product.

- If a company doesn’t understand why I might choose to “hire” its product in certain circumstances—and why I might choose something else in others—its data3 about me or people like me4 is unlikely to help it create any new innovations for me. It’s seductive to believe that we can see important patterns and cross-references in our data sets, but that doesn’t mean one thing actually caused the other. As Nate Silver, author of The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail—But Some Don’t, points out, “ice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because both occur more often in the summer heat. But there is no causation; you don’t light a patch of the Montana brush on fire when you buy a pint of Häagen-Dazs.” Of course, it’s no surprise that correlation isn’t the same as causality. But although most organizations know that, I don’t think they act as if there is a difference. They’re comfortable with correlation. It allows managers to sleep at night. But correlation does not reveal the one thing that matters most in innovation—the causality behind why I might purchase a particular solution. Yet few innovators frame their primary challenge around the discovery of a cause. Instead, they focus on how they can make their products better, more profitable, or differentiated from the competition. As W. Edwards Deming, the father of the quality movement that transformed manufacturing, once said: “If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing.” After decades of watching great companies fail over and over again, I’ve come to the conclusion that there is, indeed, a better question to ask: What job did you hire that product to do?

- As is true in discovering Jobs to Be Done, we find that stories are a more powerful mechanism for teaching you how to think, rather than just telling you what to think—stories that we’ll weave throughout the book. Our hope is that in the process of reading this book, you will come away with a new understanding of how to improve your own innovation success.

- What job did you hire that product to do? The good news is that if you build your foundation on the pursuit of understanding your customers’ jobs, your strategy will no longer need to rely on luck. In fact, you’ll be competing against luck when others are still counting on it. You’ll see the world with new eyes. Different competitors, different priorities, and most important, different results. You can leave hit-or-miss innovation behind. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=162))

- That work led to my theory of disruptive innovation,1 which explains the phenomenon by which an innovation transforms an existing market or sector by introducing simplicity, convenience, accessibility, and affordability where complication and high cost have become the status quo—eventually completely redefining the industry. At its core, it’s a theory of competitive response to an innovation. It explains and predicts the behavior of companies in danger of being disrupted, providing insight into the mistakes incumbent leaders make in response to what initially seem to be minuscule threats. It also provides a way for incumbents to predict what innovations on the horizon are likely to be the greatest disruptive threats. But over the past two decades, the theory of disruption has been interpreted and misapplied so broadly as to mean anything that’s clever, new, and ambitious. But the theory of disruptive innovation does not tell you where to look for new opportunities. It doesn’t predict or explain how, specifically, a company should innovate to undermine the established leaders or where to create new markets. It doesn’t tell you how to avoid the frustration of hit-and-miss innovation—leaving your fate to luck. It doesn’t tell you how to create products and services that customers will want to buy—and predict which new products will succeed. But the Theory of Jobs to Be Done does. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=219))

- In fact, I realized that even if a company has the intent to disrupt a vulnerable incumbent, the odds of creating exactly the right product or service to achieve that are probably less than 25 percent. If that. For years, I’d been focused on understanding why great companies fail, but I realized I had never really thought about the reverse problem: How do successful companies know how to grow? It wasn’t for months that I finally had an answer. Moesta shared with me a project for a fast-food chain: how to sell more milk shakes. The chain had spent months studying the problem in incredible detail. It had brought in customers that fit the profile of the quintessential milk shake consumer and peppered them with questions: “Can you tell us how we can improve our milk shakes so you’d buy more of them? Do you want it cheaper? Chunkier? Chewier? Chocolatier?” Even when customers explained what they thought they would like, it was hard to know exactly what to do. The chain tried many things in response to the customer feedback, innovations specifically intended to satisfy the highest number of potential milk shake buyers. Within months, something notable happened: Nothing. After all the marketers’ efforts, there was no change in sales of the chain’s milk shake category. So we thought of approaching the question in a totally different way: I wonder what job arises in people’s lives that causes them to come to this restaurant to “hire” a milk shake? I thought that was an interesting way to think about the problem. Those customers weren’t simply buying a product, they were hiring the milk shake to perform a specific job in their lives. What causes us to buy products and services is the stuff that happens to us all day, every day. We all have jobs we need to do that arise in our day-to-day lives and when we do, we hire products or services to get these jobs done.

- You have to understand the job the customer is trying to do in a specific circumstance. If the company simply tried to average all the responses of the dads and the commuters, it would come up with a one-size-fits-none product that doesn’t do either of the jobs well. And therein lies the “aha.” ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=297))

- Executives are inundated with data about their products. They know market share to the nth degree, how products are selling in different markets, profit margin across hundreds of different items, and so on. But all this data is focused around customers and the product itself—not how well the product is solving customers’ jobs. Even customer satisfaction metrics, which reveal whether a customer is happy with a product or not, don’t give any clues as to how to do the job better. Yet it’s how most companies track and measure success. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=353))

- That experience made me realize that part of the problem is that we’re missing the right vocabulary to talk about innovation in ways that help us understand what actually causes it to succeed. Innovators are left to mix, match, and often misapply inadequate concepts and terminology designed for other purposes. We’re awash in data, frameworks, customer categories, and performance metrics intended for other purposes on the assumption that they’re helpful for innovation, too.

- At its heart, we believe Jobs Theory provides a powerful way of understanding the causal mechanism of customer behavior, an understanding that, in turn, is the most fundamental driver of innovation success. If you consider some of the most surprising innovation successes in recent years, I’ll wager that all of them had implicitly or explicitly identified a Job to Be Done—and offered a product or service that performed that job extremely well. Consider the exponential success of Uber, which has succeeded remarkably despite staunch resistance from entrenched, government-backed competitors. As we’ll discuss later in the book, what Uber did was recognize and then nail the unsatisfactorily filled job of urban transportation. It is always tempting to look at innovation success stories and retrofit the explanation for why it succeeded (though I do believe that a well-defined job was implicitly at the core of most innovation success stories in history). But we don’t intend to rely on looking at those successes in hindsight. Instead, we will illustrate how the theory (which we’ll explain fully in the chapters ahead) can fundamentally improve innovation—making it both predictable and replicable through real-world examples of companies that consciously used Jobs to Be Done to create breakthrough innovations. The value of Jobs Theory to you is not in explaining past successes, but in predicting new ones. You may be asking, if Jobs Theory is so powerful, why aren’t more companies using it already? First, as we’ll explain later, the definition of what we mean by a job is highly specific and precise. It’s not an all-purpose catchphrase for something that a customer wants or needs. It’s not just a new buzzword. Finding and understanding jobs—and then creating the right product or service to solve them—takes work. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=388))

- There are multiple layers to the Jobs Theory construct to ensure that you create products that customers will not only want to buy, but also products they’re willing to pay premium prices for, as we’ll discuss throughout this book. Identifying and understanding the Job to Be Done is key, but it’s just the beginning. After you’ve uncovered and understood the job, you need to translate those insights into a blueprint to guide the development of products and services that customers will love. This involves creating the right set of experiences that accompany your product or service in solving the job (as we’ll discuss more fully in chapter 6). And finally you have to ensure that you have integrated your company’s internal capabilities and processes to nail the job consistently (chapter 7). Creating the right experiences and then integrating around them to solve a job, is critical for competitive advantage. That’s because while it may be easy for competitors to copy products, it’s difficult for them to copy experiences that are well integrated into your company’s processes.

- Enter Louis Pasteur who, in the mid-1800s, conducted the critical experiments establishing that bacteria—or more simply, “germs”—were the cause of many common diseases. The widespread acceptance of Pasteur’s work led quickly to the first vaccines and antibiotics, as well as a technique for making dairy products safe for consumption. Why was Pasteur so successful, after hundreds of years of searching for explanations for the mysteries of human disease? Put simply, it was because Pasteur’s work helped develop a theory—germ theory—that described the actual causal mechanisms of disease transfer. Before Pasteur, there were either crude and untestable guesses or statements of broad correlation without an underlying causal mechanism. Pasteur’s work demonstrated that germs were transmitted through a process: microorganisms, too small to see with the naked eye, that live in the air, in water, on objects, and on skin. They can invade hosts (in this case, humans) and grow and reproduce within those hosts. Identifying the process by which people get sick allowed the development of ways to prevent its spread—in effect to interrupt that process, most notably through personal and social hygiene measures. We all owe Pasteur a debt of enormous gratitude, but his contribution was far greater than even the monumental direct descendants of his work—such as pasteurization and penicillin. He helped fundamentally change our understanding of biology and played a critical role in the rapid evolution of medicine from an art to a science, saving millions of lives in the process. Shifting our understanding from educated guesses and correlation to an underlying causal mechanism is profound. Truly uncovering a causal mechanism changes everything about the way we solve problems—and, perhaps more important, prevents them.

- Innovation, in a very real sense, exists in a “pre–quality revolution” state.1 Managers accept flaws, missteps, and failure as an inevitable part of the process of innovation. They have become so accustomed to putting Band-Aids on their uneven innovation success that too often they give no real thought to what’s causing it in the first place.

- Embracing theory is not to mire ourselves in academic minutiae but, quite the opposite, to focus on the supremely practical question of what causes what. Theory has a voice, but no agenda. A theory doesn’t change its mind: it doesn’t apply to some companies or people and not to others. Theories are not right or wrong. They provide accurate predictions, given the circumstances you are in. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=538))

- I’ve watched so many smart, capable managers wrestle with all kinds of innovation challenges and nagging questions, but seldom the most fundamental one: What causes a customer to purchase and use a particular product or service?

- get done, and in our metaphor we say that customers “hire” products or services to solve these jobs. When you understand that concept, the idea of uncovering consumer jobs makes intuitive sense. But as we have suggested, our definition of a Job to Be Done is precise—and we need to take a step back and unpack the elements to develop a complete theory of jobs. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=554))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We define a “job” as the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance. This definition of a job is not simply a new way of categorizing customers or their problems. It’s key to understanding why they make the choices they make. The choice of the word “progress” is deliberate. It represents movement toward a goal or aspiration. A job is always a process to make progress, it’s rarely a discrete event. A job is not necessarily just a “problem” that arises, though one form the progress can take is the resolution of a specific problem and the struggle it entails. Circumstance Second, the idea of a “circumstance” is intrinsic to the definition of a job. A job can only be defined—and a successful solution created—relative to the specific context in which it arises. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=557))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The circumstance is fundamental to defining the job (and finding a solution for it), because the nature of the progress desired will always be strongly influenced by the circumstance. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=569))
    - Tags: [[fundamental attribution error]] [[favorite]] 
- To summarize, the key features of our definition are: A job is the progress that an individual seeks in a given circumstance. Successful innovations enable a customer’s desired progress, resolve struggles, and fulfill unmet aspirations. They perform jobs that formerly had only inadequate or nonexistent solutions. Jobs are never simply about the functional—they have important social and emotional dimensions, which can be even more powerful than functional ones. Because jobs occur in the flow of daily life, the circumstance is central to their definition and becomes the essential unit of innovation work—not customer characteristics, product attributes, new technology, or trends. Jobs to Be Done are ongoing and recurring. They’re seldom discrete “events.” ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=583))

- Consider some of the most recent entrepreneurial success stories through the lens of a Job to Be Done. Take Airbnb, for example. Airbnb could be reduced to its function—providing a place to stay when traveling. On that level, it’s competing against hotels. And by traditional measures of quality in the hotel industry, Airbnb is a far inferior option. Who would pay to stay on an air mattress on the floor of a stranger’s apartment—or sleep in a stranger’s spare bed—rather than stay in the privacy of their own hotel room? It turns out, lots of people. People weren’t hiring Airbnb only because it’s a place to stay. They were hiring Airbnb because having a place to stay allows them to be someplace so they can participate in something in which they want to be part—and because it offers a more authentic local experience than a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-the-world hotel chain. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=659))
- On the surface, it was an improbable success story: “At the beginning people said, ‘You’re out of your mind for starting this company. Nobody’s going to use it. Only crazy people are going to rent a room in someone’s apartment,’” recalls LinkedIn founder and Airbnb investor Reid Hoffman. “But sometimes,” Hofmann says now, “it’s a job you can’t currently see.” Throughout this book we will refer to jobs in shorthand, simplistic terms for ease of reference—but it’s important to emphasize that a well-defined job is multilayered and complex. And that is actually a good thing. Why? Because it means that perfectly satisfying someone’s job likely requires not just creating a product, but engineering and delivering a whole set of experiences that address the many dimensions of the job and then integrating those experiences into the company’s processes (as we’ll discuss in depth later in the book). When you’ve done that well, it’s almost impossible for competitors to copy. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=676))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It’s important to note that we don’t “create” jobs, we discover them. Jobs themselves are enduring and persistent, but the way we solve them can change dramatically over time. Think, for example, of the job of sharing information across long distances. That underlying job has not changed, but our solutions for it have: from Pony Express to telegraph to air mail to email and so on. For example, teenagers have had the job of communicating with each other without the nosy intervention of parents for centuries. Years ago, they passed notes in the school hallway or pulled the telephone cord all the way into the furthest corner of their room. But in recent years, teens have started hiring Snapchat, a smartphone app that allows messages to be delivered and then disappear almost instantly and a whole host of other things that could not even have been imagined a few decades ago. The creators of Snapchat understood the job well enough to create a superior solution. But that doesn’t mean Snapchat isn’t vulnerable to other competitors coming along with a better understanding of the complex set of social, emotional, and functional needs of teenagers in particular circumstances. Our understanding of the Job to Be Done can always get better. Adopting new technologies can improve the way we solve Jobs to Be Done. But what’s important is that you focus on understanding the underlying job, not falling in love with your solution for it. For innovators, understanding the job is to understand what consumers care most about in that moment of trying to make progress. Jobs Theory enables innovators to make the myriad, detailed tradeoffs in terms of which benefits are essential and which are extraneous to a new offering. Understanding the circumstance-specific hiring criteria triggers a whole series of important insights, perhaps most notably that the competitive field is likely completely different from what you might have imagined.

- But from a Jobs Theory perspective, the competition is seldom limited to products that the market chooses to lump into the same category. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings made this clear when recently asked by legendary venture capitalist John Doerr if Netflix was competing with Amazon. “Really we compete with everything you do to relax,” he told Doerr. “We compete with video games. We compete with drinking a bottle of wine. That’s a particularly tough one! We compete with other video networks. Playing board games.” ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=710))

- With all theory building, you have to be open to finding things that the theory can’t explain—anomalies—and use them as an opportunity to strengthen it. We know, for example, that Jobs Theory is not useful if there is no real struggle for a consumer or the existing solutions are good enough. It’s not useful when the decision to be made relies almost entirely on a mathematical analysis, such as commodities trading. Cost or efficiency is not a core element of a job. In those circumstances, there is not a complex bundle of social, emotional, and functional needs in search of progress. There are rational decisions to be made—and ones that can just as easily be made by a computer. A theory is essentially a proposition: we propose this set of processes will help develop innovations that will be successful. But if someone has a better set of processes to deliver more consistently successful innovations, we welcome that in our quest to better refine this theory. But until then, we believe Jobs Theory will make an enormous difference in the quest to shift innovation from a game of chance to a predictable endeavor. Opportunities, competitors, and what matters most to your customers may look very different, but they will also be very clear. Your perspective will be irrevocably shifted—but for the better.

- It wasn’t until the sixteenth century, with one simple but profound observation, that Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus reframed our view of the universe. The planets revolved not around the earth, but around the sun. Finally, understanding that provided a foundation for some of the most important advances in history and the foundation for modern astronomy and calculus. Of course, it took eighteen centuries for someone like Copernicus to see and articulate the flaws in Aristotle’s logic. And even he died without knowing that the world would accept he was right. Changing a well-established view of the world rarely happens overnight—and even when it happens, it still takes time to refine and perfect the right new perspective.

- Jobs Theory is not just another framework or marketing approach, but a powerful lens that has driven breakthrough innovation and transformational growth in some of the world’s most successful organizations—in wildly diverse arenas. Jobs Theory transforms how you define the business you’re in, the size and shape of the market in which you compete, and who your competitors are. This enables you to see customers where there were none, ideas for solutions where there were only problems, and opportunity where you least expect it. Here’s how.

- Intuit cofounder Scott Cook was an early adopter of Jobs Theory—and his work has helped define and shape the theory. Within Intuit he refers to the “improvement in the customer’s life that matters most to him in selecting the product.” But we agree that we’re talking about the same thing: the progress a customer seeks in particular circumstances. He and I eventually went on to coauthor the first article to preview the Theory of Jobs to Be Done in Harvard Business Review2 (along with one of the coauthors of this book, Taddy Hall). This theory helped Intuit launch the wildly successful QuickBooks accounting software for the small business market—and has guided the company’s innovation strategy since.

- A clear view of customers’ jobs means an organization should never overshoot what those customers are actually willing to pay for. On the contrary, we believe that when customers find the right product to respond to their Job to Be Done, they’re often willing to pay more—something we’ll demonstrate throughout this book. Intuit’s $4 billion in revenue and $25 billion in market cap makes clear that Cook and his team understand that. “All that we do is focus on solving the customers’ struggle,” Cook says. “That’s all we do and the only thing we do.” ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1093))

- Be Done, but the initial discovery of a job doesn’t have to be accidental or random. With a deep understanding of this theory, organizations have the ability to fundamentally change the way they innovate and grow. So many innovations that are launched with great hope and fanfare flop because they have focused on improving the product on dimensions that are irrelevant to the consumer’s actual Job to Be Done, with enormous resources wasted in the process. This is because improvements on such dimensions do not cause a customer to pull that product into his life. A product that has been designed specifically to fulfill a well-understood Job to Be Done allows you to crawl into the skin of your customer and see the world through her eyes. It says to the customer, “We get you.” But as we’ll discuss throughout this book, uncovering an unsatisfactorily resolved job is only the first step. Your organization has to build the right set of experiences in how customers find, purchase, and use your product or service—and integrate all the corresponding processes to ensure that those experiences are consistently delivered. When you are solving a customer’s job, your products essentially become services. What matters is not the bundle of product attributes you rope together, but the experiences you enable to help your customers make the progress they want to make. We believe the thinking in this book has the potential to change not just innovation success rates, but to transform companies themselves. But first, executives have to change what they believe is possible. For far too long, companies have accepted that innovation success is just random and we’ve allowed ourselves failure rates that we wouldn’t tolerate in any other aspect of business. Innovation does not have to be the least successful thing that companies do. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1099))

- So where are all these jobs just waiting to be discovered—and how do you find them? The solution lies not in the tools you’re using, but what you are looking for and how you piece your observations together. If you can spot barriers to progress or frustrating experiences, you’ve found the first clues that an innovation opportunity is at hand. We offer here a sampling of ways to uncover jobs: seeing jobs in your own life, finding opportunity in “nonconsumption,” identifying workarounds, zoning in on things you don’t want to do, and spotting unusual uses of products. Innovation is less about producing something new and more about enabling something new and important for customers. Here’s how job hunting works.

Understanding the job enabled the company to get to the causal mechanism of why its customers might pull this solution into their lives. It was complex, but not complicated. That, in turn, allowed the housing company to differentiate its offering in ways competitors weren’t likely to copy—or even understand. A jobs perspective changed everything. The company actually raised $3,500 (profitably), which included covering the cost of moving and storage. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1190))

- Some of the most successful start-ups in recent years have come from the founders’ personal Job to Be Done. Sheila Marcelo started Care.com, the online “matchmaking” service for child care, senior care, pet care, and so on, after struggling with her own child-care needs. It now boasts nearly 10 million members across sixteen countries, and revenues approaching $60 million, less than ten years after its founding. But if you’re breaking out in a cold sweat worrying that you haven’t had a road-to-Damascus insight like these entrepreneurs, don’t worry. The good news is you don’t need to rely on personal inspiration to uncover a job that might provide a valuable innovation opportunity for your organization. You can learn a lot just by watching the customers you do—and don’t—already have. But you have to know what you’re looking for.

- You can learn as much about a Job to Be Done from people who aren’t hiring any product or service as you can from those who are. We call this “nonconsumption,” when consumers can’t find any solution that actually satisfies their job and they opt to do nothing instead. Too often, companies consider only how they can grab shares away from competitors, but not where they can find unseen demand. They may not even see it at all because existing data isn’t going to tell them where to find it. But nonconsumption often represents the most fertile opportunities, as was true for Southern New Hampshire University. Once a company shakes off the shackles of category-based competition, the market for a breakthrough innovation can be much larger than might be assumed from the size of the traditional view of the competitive landscape. You won’t see nonconsumption if you’re not looking for it. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1251))

- As an innovator, spotting consumers who are struggling to resolve a Job to Be Done by cobbling together workarounds or compensating behaviors, as Kimberly-Clark did with Silhouettes, should cause your heart to beat a little faster. You’ve spotted potential customers—consumers who are so unhappy with the available solutions to a job they very deeply want to solve that they’re going to great lengths to create their own solution. Whenever you see a compensating behavior, pay very close attention, because it’s likely a clue that there is an innovation opportunity waiting to be seized—one on which customers would place a high value. But you won’t even see these anomalies—compensating behavior and cobbled-together workarounds—if you’re not fully immersed in the context of their struggle.

- OpenTable, which is an online, real-time restaurant reservation service, was born out of a common workaround. I’ve always hated having to figure out how to make dinner reservations at a restaurant. When you have two friends in town, you decide you want to go out. You want to show them your favorite restaurant. Everybody checks their schedule and agrees, so you call the restaurant and find out they don’t have capacity at the time you agreed with your friends. Can you come at 9:00 instead? So now you have to call your friends back to see if that works. And it turns out, one of them has a babysitting problem. OK, back to the drawing board. What other restaurant should we go to? We’ve all been doing this workaround to get restaurant reservations for ages, but OpenTable solved this job. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1321))

- I think I have as many jobs of not wanting to do something as ones that I want positively to do. I call them “negative jobs.” In my experience, negative jobs are often the best innovation opportunities. What parent doesn’t identify with this struggle: Your child wakes up with a sore throat. Your experience tells you it’s probably strep. You want your child to feel better and know that getting medicine in as quickly as possible is key, but gee, it’s really not a good day for this to happen. It’s a busy day at work, the child-care arrangements will be complicated, and the last thing you want to have to do is take time to get to the doctor for what probably will be a quick poke and prod to confirm what you suspect. If you call the pediatrician, he will, in good conscience, say he can’t prescribe anything without seeing your child. After finagling your way into an unscheduled appointment, you might sit in that waiting room for a long time until the doctor squeezes you in. Hours after that first call, when you finally get into the exam room, the doctor looks at your child, does a quick culture, and concludes it’s strep throat. He’ll call something into the pharmacy but you have to wait thirty minutes to pick it up. The whole afternoon is shot. In this case, the Job to Be Done is “I don’t want to see the doctor.” Harvard Business School alum Rick Krieger and some partners decided to start QuickMedx, the forerunner of CVS MinuteClinics, after Krieger spent a frustrating few hours waiting in an emergency room for his son to get a strep-throat test. CVS MinuteClinic can see walk-in patients instantly and nurse practitioners can prescribe medicines for routine ailments, such as conjunctivitis, ear infections, and strep throat. Because most people don’t want to go to the doctor if they don’t have to, there are now more than a thousand MinuteClinic locations inside CVS pharmacy stores in thirty-three states.

A story I often use to explain to my students how to find jobs that are hidden in plain sight is the case of Church & Dwight’s baking soda “category.” For nearly a century, the company’s iconic orange box of Arm & Hammer baking soda had been a staple in every American kitchen, an essential ingredient for baking. But in the late 1960s, management observed the diverse circumstances for which consumers grabbed that orange box off the shelf. They added it to laundry detergent, mixed it into toothpaste, sprinkled it on the carpet, or left an open box in the refrigerator, as well as other unusual uses. Until then, it hadn’t occurred to management that their staple product could… ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1343))

- Many companies fall into the trap of asking consumers what about their current offering they could tweak to make it more appealing. Faster? More colors? Cheaper? When you start with the assumption that you’re just altering what you already have created, or relying on broader industry-accepted category definitions, you may have already missed the opportunity to uncover the real job for consumers. Procter & Gamble (P&G) learned this the hard way with its initial introduction of disposable diapers into China, which should have been a slam dunk. P&G knew how to make and sell diapers to Western consumers and there were millions of babies in China who, according to local practices, didn’t use diapers at all. Wasn’t that a market full of potential customers? “The concept was that if we could produce a diaper inexpensively enough in developing markets, we could grow the market substantially,” recalls David Goulait, who spent decades within P&G’s world-renowned R&D group. Most of the effort, Goulait recalls, was on how to make “a functional containment device” for a child that would cost only ten cents—dubbed “the ten-cent diaper.” The assumption was that parents in China would buy lower-quality versions of US and European diapers if they were affordable enough. But to P&G’s surprise, the cut-price diapers were not flying off the shelves. Realizing he was trying to create a product for a market that did not automatically see the value of traditional diapers—at all—Goulait was eager to find clues as to what was going wrong. He started by researching how developing-market consumers felt about the functional features of the diapers that had always been a source of pride and excellence at P&G. Were the diapers too rough? Too flimsy? Too expensive? It was hard to find an answer. Not speaking the language in the developing countries in which P&G was doing research, Goulait hovered in a back room of a focus group listening in, reliant on his translator. As the moderator worked through the standard protocol of questions—how did the experience go, what was the high point of the week, and so on—one woman’s answers caused hearty laughter from the group. What had she said to trigger that response? The translator giggled, too. The highlight of this woman’s week, she reported happily, was renewed intimacy with her husband—three times in that one week. How did that relate to the diaper? Because the baby had slept through the night, she, too, could sleep through the night. In turn, she found herself more rested. The rest of the story then made sense. The moderator then asked her what her husband thought about the diaper. “That was the best ten cents he ever spent. . . .” More laughter. In that moment, Goulait realized that his approach had been too narrow, as it had been constrained primarily to the functional characteristics of the diaper. But the Job to Be Done solved by the diaper was more complex and interesting than that; it included social dimensions related to… ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1414))

- Where was the stroke of genius in all these success stories? It’s in knowing what to look for. There is a method to the madness. What they have in common is the search for cause. With a theory to predict what will cause what to happen, breakthrough innovations do not require getting lucky. They don’t rely on someone fiddling with a microwave-emitting magnetron and accidentally discovering the chocolate bar in his pocket has suddenly melted or any of the other magical alchemy of brilliance and accidents that have become innovator lore. The magic of the Jobs to Be Done lens is that there isn’t any magic required at all. The lens allows you to look at the same things everyone else is looking at—but enables you to see differently.

- Consumers can’t always articulate what they want. And even when they do, their actions may tell a different story. If I asked you if you care about being environmentally friendly, most of us would say yes. We’d talk about how we recycle or walk instead of driving whenever possible. But if I opened your cupboards, would they tell the same story? How many new parents do you know who say they care about climate change, but gratefully stock disposable diapers instead of cloth? Do you happily pop a plastic K-cup into your coffee machine? On the other hand, research has consistently shown that a significant portion of customers are willing to pay more for foods that are labeled “organic,” a word that is so generically used that it’s almost meaningless. What explains the disparity? No one aspires to be environmentally unfriendly, but when the actual decision to pull a product into your life has to be made, you pick the solution that best represents the values and tradeoffs you care about in those particular circumstances.

- OK, so if what consumers say is unreliable, can’t you just look at the data instead? Isn’t that objective? Well, data is prone to misinterpretation. Sales and marketing data in the toy industry told Pleasant Rowland that girls between the ages of seven and twelve would never play with dolls. And most data only tracks one of the two important moments in a customer’s decision to hire a product or service. The most commonly tracked is what we call the “Big Hire”—the moment you buy the product. But there’s an equally important moment that doesn’t show up in most sales data: when you actually “consume” it. The moment a consumer brings a purchase into his or her home or business, that product is still waiting to be hired again—we call this the “Little Hire.” If a product really solves the job, there will be many moments of consumption. It will be hired again and again. But too often the data companies gather reflects only the Big Hire, not whether it meets customers’ Jobs to Be Done in reality. My wife may buy a new dress, but she doesn’t really consume it until she’s actually cut the tag off and worn it. It’s less important to know that she chose blue over green than it is to understand why she made the decision to finally wear it over all other options. How many apps do you have on your phone that seemed like a good idea to download, but you’ve more or less never used them again? If the app vendor simply tracks downloads, it’ll have no idea whether its app is doing a good job solving your desire for progress or not. Jobs to Be Done have always existed. Innovations have just gotten better and better in the way we can respond to them. So no matter how new or revolutionary your product idea may be, the circumstances of struggle already exist. Consequently, in order to hire your new solution, by definition customers must fire some current compensating behavior or suboptimal solution—including firing the solution of doing nothing at all. Wristwatches were fired in droves as soon as people began carrying mobile phones that not only told them the time, but could sync with calendars and provide alarms and reminders. I fired my weekly Sports Illustrated when I could suddenly flip on ESPN. The people who hired Depend Silhouette incontinence products fired staying at home instead of risking going out. Companies don’t think about this enough. What has to get fired for my product to get hired? They think about making their product more and more appealing, but not what it will be replacing. A customer’s decision-making process about what to fire and hire has begun long before she enters a store—and it’s complicated. There are always two opposing forces battling for dominance in that moment of choice and they both play a significant role. The forces compelling change to a new solution: First of all, the push of the situation—the frustration or problem that a customer is trying to solve—has to be substantial enough to cause her to want to take action.

- consumers. “I’m used to doing it this way.” Or living with the problem. “I don’t love it, but I’m at least comfortable with how I deal with it now.” And potentially even more powerful than the habits of the present is, second, the “anxiety of choosing something new.” “What if it’s not better?” Consumers are often stuck in the habits of the present—the thought of switching to a new solution is almost too overwhelming. Sticking with the devil they know, even if imperfect, is bearable. I refused to upgrade my mobile phone for years, in spite of all the whiz-bang things my assistant assured me the new phone could do, because I was comfortable with the one I had. This is largely because—as Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman has shown—the principal pull of the old is that it requires no deliberation and has some intuitive plausibility as a solution already. Loss aversion—people’s tendency to want to avoid loss—is twice as powerful psychologically as the allure of gains, as demonstrated by Kahneman and Amos Tversky.1 The anxieties that come into play are powerful: anxiety about the cost, anxiety of learning something new, and anxiety of the unknown can be overwhelming. Why do many consumers hang on to their old mobile phones, even when they might get some trade-in value toward a new one? “What if the new one fails at some point?” “What if I find myself in some kind of unanticipated situation where I need a backup phone?” “What if . . . ?” Health clubs have only recently come around to the idea that… ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1566))

- Think of it this way: the job has to have sufficient magnitude to cause people to change their behavior—“I’m struggling and I want a better solution than I can currently find”—but the pull of the new has to be much greater than the sum of the inertia of the old and the anxieties about the new. There’s almost always some friction associated with switching from one product to another, but it’s also almost always discounted by innovators who are sure that their product is so fabulous it will erase any such concerns. It’s easy to fire things that simply offer functional solutions to a job. But when the decision involves firing something that has emotional and social dimensions to solving the job, that something is far harder to let go. No matter how frustrated we are with our current situation or how enticing a new product is, if the forces that pull us to hiring something don’t outweigh the hindering forces, we won’t even consider hiring something new. The progress customers are trying to make has to be understood in context. I can’t think of a clearly defined job in which the emotional and social forces—and the forces compelling and opposing change—are not critically important. Customers are always reluctant to fire something until they are sure they have something better, even if they’re firing simply ([Location 1587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=1587))

- You might expect a typical interview by a mattress retailer to focus on figuring out which details about the mattress itself led to the decision to buy. “Was it soft enough? Hard enough? Did it provide the right support? Do you care about the number of coils? Was the color or the pattern on the mattress appealing? What else did you consider buying? How important was price in your decision to buy?” But this interview focuses on none of that. Moesta, instead, tries to build a robust picture of the circumstances of the customer’s struggle—how he came to think about buying a new mattress. The original goal involves establishing a timeline of all the triggers that actually led to the eventual decision. Walker might appear to be an impulse purchaser. But the backstory that is established, through what might seem to be irrelevant questions, reveals something far more complex. And it is precisely the complexity and the surprising twists and turns that we are seeking. What is the role that the mattress plays in his life? Why is it important or is it? When is the mattress important and why? Who else is involved in purchase and use of a mattress? What are the barriers and points of friction in buying a new mattress? Depending on the individual’s present struggles and desired progress, what alternatives exist to buying a new mattress? Are there occasions in which the individual does not use the mattress when we might expect him to? Conversely, are there moments in life when he uses the mattress in unusual ways? These are just some of the questions we might have as we seek to piece together the richest possible narrative of the mattress-buying process, beginning well before the moment of purchase, ideally when the very first thought of mattress shopping occurred.

- The other thing to realize is that this is a minidocumentary with more than one character. His wife is with him in the store and she has to sleep on the bed, too. It might be impossible to make a purchase like that on the spot without your wife because of the anxiety of your spouse criticizing your choice: “You bought this cruddy mattress without consulting me!” Because the consumer and his wife were both in the same place, at the same time, and they could both at least touch it, he was able to alleviate the concern that she’d grumble at the decision he made after the fact. As soon as she said, “OK, I know you’re not sleeping well,” she gave her blessing. One major anxiety has been removed. And then, knowing that Costco will take it back without fuss, that’s the final obstacle. As incredible as it seems, because of the competing forces pushing and pulling his decision, it was easier for him to take that leap, never having lay on it, than it is to walk into the mattress store and lie down.

- “There’s no question in my mind that I came from the thesis that innovation succeeds when it addresses a job that needs to be done,” says Rowland, whose unsatisfactory options while shopping for a Christmas present for her nieces triggered the idea. At the time, the most popular options were either hypersexualized Barbies or Cabbage Patch Kids, neither of which would help her connect with her beloved nieces. Her vision for the company, which was born almost entirely out of her own childhood memories, was built around creating similar happy experiences for the mothers and daughters who buy American Girl dolls. As I said in chapter 4, our lives are very articulate. ([Location 2035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2035))

- Under Mattel’s ownership, it has seen a slight dip in sales in the past couple of years, but no one has been successful in unseating American Girl from its perch. “I think nobody was willing to put the depth in the product to create the experience,” says Rowland. “They thought it was a product. They never got the story part right.” To date, no other toy manufacturer has been able to copy American Girl’s magic formula.

- In my classroom I share an illustration with my students to highlight how to think about innovating around jobs. It’s just a simple representation, but it’s intended to underscore the point that although identifying and understanding the Job to Be Done is the foundation, it’s only the first step in creating products that you can be sure customers want to hire. Products that they’ll actually pay premium prices for. That involves not only understanding the job, but also the right set of experiences for purchase and use of that product, and then integrating those experiences into a company’s processes. All three layers—Uncovering the Job, Creating the Desired Experiences, and Integrating around the Job—are critical. When a company understands and responds to all three layers of the job depicted here, it will have solved a job in a way that competitors can’t easily copy.

- IKEA doesn’t focus on selling to any particular demographically defined group of consumers. IKEA is structured around jobs that lots of consumers share when they are trying to establish themselves and their families in new surroundings: “I’ve got to get this place furnished tomorrow, because the next day I have to show up at work.” Other furniture stores can copy IKEA’s products. They can even copy IKEA’s layout. But what has been difficult to copy are the experiences that IKEA provides its customers—and the way it has anticipated and helped its customers overcome the obstacles that get in their way. Nobody I know relishes the idea of spending a day shopping for furniture when they really, really need it right away. It’s not entertainment, it’s a frustrating challenge. Factor in that your children will likely be with you when you’re shopping and it could be a recipe for disaster. IKEA stores have a designated child-care area where you can leave your children to play while you wind your way through the store—and a café and ice cream stand to offer as a reward at the end. Don’t want to wait to get your bookshelves home? They’re flat-packed in cartons that can fit in or on most cars. Is it daunting to lay out all the parts to an unbuilt book-shelf and then have to put it together yourself? Absolutely. But it’s not overwhelming because IKEA has designed all its products to require just one simple tool (that’s included with every flat pack—and actually stored inside one of the pieces of wood so you can’t accidentally lose it when you open the box!). And everyone I know who has tackled an IKEA assembly ends up feeling pretty proud of himself or herself when it’s done.

- You can only shape the experiences that are important to your customers when you understand who you are really competing with. That’s how you’ll know how to create your résumé to be hired for the job. And when you get that all right, your customers will be more than willing to pay a premium price because you’ll solve their job better than anyone else. I should clarify, however: sometimes customers get pushed into paying for premium products because they’re interdependent with a product that they have already hired to solve a job in their lives. Think about the eye-popping price tag for printer-ink cartridges. Or smartphone rechargers or cases. We’ll give in and pay the premium price because there isn’t a better solution at the moment, but we will simultaneously despise the company for taking us to the cleaners. These products actually cause anxiety, rather than resolve it. I hated having to monitor how much color ink my kids were using on our home printer. I don’t like worrying about misplacing a charger. This is not what I mean about premium prices that customers are willing to pay. By contrast, with jobs-based innovations, customers don’t resent the price, they’re grateful for the solution.

They help them overcome the obstacles that get in their way of making the progress they seek. “Help me furnish this apartment today.” “Help me share our rich family history with my child.” Creating experiences and overcoming obstacles is how a product becomes a service to the customer, rather than simply a product with better features and benefits.

- These workarounds should be warning signs to the car-rental industry—which may find itself facing an onslaught from new competitors in the near future as the job of “mobility” takes shape. Failing to deliver the experiences that help your customers solve their Jobs to Be Done leaves you vulnerable to disruption as better solutions come along and customers swiftly jump ship. By contrast, one company that clearly understands the stakes is Uber. In the last several years, few companies have captured the media’s attention like Uber. In my opinion, Uber has been successful because it’s perfectly nailed a Job to Be Done. Yes, Uber can often offer a nice car to take you from point A to point B, but that’s not where it’s built its competitive advantage. The experiences that come with hiring Uber to solve customers’ Jobs to Be Done are better than the existing alternatives. That’s the secret to its success. Everything about the experience of being a customer—including the emotional and social dimensions—has been thought through. Who wants to have to outmaneuver other poor schlubs on the same street corner who are trying to hail a cab? You don’t want to either pay for a car service to wait outside your meeting or be at its mercy when you’re finally ready to call it to come back and get you. With Uber, you simply push a few buttons on your mobile phone and you know that in three minutes or seven minutes a specific driver will arrive to pick you up. Now you can relax and just wait. You don’t have to worry if you have enough cash in your wallet or fear that if you swipe your credit card in that taxi machine, you’ll get a call from your bank wondering if you’ve recently made purchases in some state you’ve never even been to. Calling an Uber has even more potential to ease your anxieties about getting into a cab alone. With Uber there’s a record of your request, you know specifically who is picking you up, and you know from the driver’s ratings that he or she is reliable. Uber isn’t just competing with taxis and ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2231))

Organizations that focus on making the product itself better and better are missing what may be the most powerful causal mechanism of all—what are the experiences that customers seek in not only purchasing, but also in using this product?

- Amazon, too, knows exactly what experiences its customers value. Everything is built around delivering those experiences well. There are many factors that have enabled Amazon’s meteoric growth, but there is no way it could be “the everything store” without its customer reviews. In fact, I’d argue that it’s probably the hardest thing for any would-be competitor to copy. Why are Amazon’s reviews so powerful? Because they help customers make the progress they want to make. If I look around my house or my friends’ houses, for example, I can see a wide variety of products that were purchased on Amazon. A TV. A rice steamer. A digital camera. A smoothie maker. What enables me and millions of others to buy unfamiliar items with greater confidence by virtue of a listing on a website? The requisite list of features and functionality doesn’t help me much—in fact my eye tends to skip right over that section. But it does go immediately to the line that tells me where I can figure out if this is the right product to hire for my job: “56 reviews. 21 answered questions.” Sure, seeing an item with a bunch of four-out-of-five-star ratings helps, but what I really need to know is what do reviewers who were hiring for the same job as me have to say? There might be lots of toaster oven reviews about whether it browns the toast evenly (there are, apparently, a lot of people who care about that stuff!), but I really want to know whether it will help me heat a frozen pizza when I… ([Location 2251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2251))

- Amazon clearly understands the importance of these reviews. There are Hall of Fame reviewers (so noted on each review) and top ten thousand reviewer rankings—ranked by the number and percentage of helpful votes their reviews have received. In 2015 Amazon also introduced technology that automates giving more weight to newer reviews, reviews from verified Amazon purchasers, and reviews that more customers voted as being helpful. Companies that sell their wares on Amazon are so sensitive to the power of these reviews that they routinely email their customers shortly after the purchase has arrived at its destination to ask if they have any feedback—hoping to preempt any negative feedback before they end up on the review page. They go to extraordinary lengths, including no-hassle refunds or replacements, rather than risk a bad review from a top reviewer who will, certainly, influence how many people hire that product for their Job to Be Done.

- Online reviews have fundamentally improved the experience of purchasing almost anything in recent years. We can check reviews on everything from auto repair shops to insurance companies with a few clicks on our keyboard. Online reviews help great products get hired. But they are a two-sided coin. From the business’s perspective, they represent the first time in history where you have to think about how to convey who should not hire your product. A customer who hires your product or service for a job it is not intended to do will be sorely disappointed—and perhaps write a disgruntled online review. Negative reviews can break a business. Restaurant owners routinely grouse about being held hostage to their Yelp ratings, at the mercy of reviews by uninformed palates. Airbnb works with its “host” customers to make sure their listings make very clear who should—and shouldn’t—hire that particular listing, says Airbnb’s Chip Conley. Airbnb advises hosts to imagine that there’s “an invisible report card on the forehead of potential guests,” rating everything about how the actual location met their expectations. “Overselling” your listing will work against you very quickly on Airbnb—and in the increasing number of marketplaces in which reviews function almost like a currency. Airbnb listings emphasize what the local neighborhood is like and what kind of experience guests will have in the home. Is it convenient? Is it quiet and peaceful? Is it in the center of action? All those details are important to capture in both the description and photos so that guests won’t be disappointed with their choice—and write a poor review.

- Purpose brands provide remarkable clarity. They become synonymous with the job. A well-developed purpose brand will stop a consumer from even considering looking for another option. They want that product. The price premium that a purpose brand commands is the wage that customers are willing to pay the brand for providing this guidance. Federal Express illustrates how successful purpose brands are built. A job had existed practically forever: the “I need to send this from here to there—as fast as possible with perfect certainty” job. Some US customers hired the US Postal Service’s airmail; a few desperate souls paid couriers to sit on airplanes. But because nobody had yet designed a service to do this job well, the brands of the unsatisfactory alternative services became tarnished when they were hired for this purpose. But after Federal Express specifically designed its service to do that exact job, and did it wonderfully again and again, the FedEx brand began popping into people’s minds. This was not built through advertising. It was built through people hiring the service and finding that it got the job done. FedEx became a purpose brand—in fact, it became a verb in the international language of business that is inextricably linked with that specific job.

They may have cost more than other family car options and, let’s face it, they were unattractive—but they stood for something important: safety. As far back as its founding in 1927, its two original leaders set the compass directly on this purpose: “Cars are driven by people. The guiding principle behind everything we make at Volvo, therefore, is and must remain, safety.” And in the decades since then, the Swedish car company had earned its sterling reputation—as a purpose brand for safety and reliability.

- Purpose brand makes very clear which features and functions are relevant to the job and which potential improvements will ultimately prove irrelevant. A purpose brand is not solely valuable to the customer in making his choices. Purpose brands create enormous opportunities for differentiation, premium pricing, and growth. A clear purpose brand guides the company’s product designers, marketers, and advertisers as they develop and market improved products. As I’ll discuss in the next two chapters, having a Job to Be Done as a North Star helps guide an organization to design the right product and experiences to achieve that job—and not “overshoot” in a way that consumers won’t value. Achieving a purpose brand is the cherry on the top of the jobs cake. Purpose brand, when done well, provides the ultimate competitive advantage. Look no further.

- When you think of the word “process” you might instantly conjure images of a manufacturing assembly line or a bureaucratic standard. But processes touch everything about the way an organization transforms its resources into value: the patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision making through which they accomplish these transformations are processes. Product development, procurement, market research, budgeting, employee development and compensation, and resource allocation are all accomplished through processes. Helping customers have a delightful experience using your product is made up of processes. What information do we need to have in order to decide what to do next? Who is responsible for each step? What do we prioritize over other things? Resources, generally speaking, are fungible. They can be bought and sold. Products can, often, be easily copied. But it is through integrating processes to get the job done that companies can create the ideal experiences and confer competitive advantage.

- Processes are invisible from a customer’s standpoint—but the results of those processes are not. Processes can profoundly affect whether a customer chooses your product or service in the long run. And they may be a company’s best bet to ensure that the customer’s job, and not efficiency or productivity, remains the focal point for innovation in the long run. Absence of a process, as is the case with most traditional hospitals, is actually still a process. Things are getting done, however chaotically. But that’s not a good sign. W.

- he Secret Sauce For years, Toyota freely opened its doors to competitors. Twice a month, the Japanese auto manufacturer allowed rival auto executives and engineers into its manufacturing complex to observe how Toyota makes cars. Not only were the executives allowed to see every aspect of the famous Toyota Production System, the tours also included a robust question and answer session. Nothing was off-limits. To an outsider, Toyota’s openness might seem shocking. After all, the American rivals were clearly trying to learn Toyota’s secrets in order to emulate or even improve upon them. Why would Toyota so willingly give competitors a hand? Toyota wasn’t really worried that it would give away its “secret sauce.” Toyota’s competitive advantage rested firmly in its proprietary, complex, and often unspoken processes. In hindsight, Ernie Schaefer, a longtime GM manager who toured the Toyota plant, told NPR’s This American Life that he realized that there were no special secrets to see on the manufacturing floors. “You know, they never prohibited us from walking through the plant, understanding, even asking questions of some of their key people,” Schaefer said. “I’ve often puzzled over that, why they did that. And I think they recognized we were asking the wrong questions. We didn’t understand this bigger picture.” It’s no surprise, really. Processes are often hard to see—they’re a combination of both formal, defined, and documented steps and expectations and informal, habitual routines or ways of working that have evolved over time. But they matter profoundly. As MIT’s Edgar Schein has explored and discussed, processes are a critical part of the unspoken culture of an organization.1 They enforce “this is what matters most to us.” Processes are intangible; they belong to the company. They emerge from hundreds and hundreds of small decisions about how to solve a problem. They’re critical to strategy, but they also can’t easily be copied. Pixar Animation Studios, too, has openly shared its creative process with the world. Pixar’s longtime president Ed Catmull has literally written the book on how the digital film company fosters collective creativity2—there are fixed processes about how a movie idea is generated, critiqued, improved, and perfected. Yet Pixar’s competitors have yet to equal Pixar’s successes. ([Location 2439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2439))

- There’s another important lesson in the story of SNHU’s success: it systematically removes the complexity and frustrations from the prospective student—such as navigating the financial-aid process and tracking down transcripts—and resolves them through the structured processes of SNHU. This is what processes aligned with customer jobs do: they shift complexity and nuisances from the customer to the vendor, leaving positive customer experiences and valuable progress in their place. Without the clear job spec of SNHU’s students’ Jobs to Be Done, the university would never create such a high-intensity process, but nor would it be as productive. Nor would any standard operating data suggest it should. SNHU’s old system might have generated, for example, the number of information packages sent out compared with the number of new student applications. But nothing about that ratio would tell the university why that number is good or bad. By contrast, the right job spec leads to the right processes that will generate the right data to know “How are we doing?” Jobs Theory focuses you on helping your customers do their jobs, rather than narrow internally measured efficiencies.

- Through a jobs lens, what matters more than who reports to whom is how different parts of the organization interact to systematically deliver the offering that perfectly performs customers’ Jobs to Be Done. When managers are focused on the customer’s Job to Be Done, they not only have a very clear compass heading for their innovation efforts but they also have a vital organizing principle for their internal structure. This is not a subtle distinction. We have managers in charge of every major function or set of activities. We have executives in charge of product lines. But in most cases, nobody is in charge of understanding—and ensuring that the company is delivering on—the job of a customer. It’s only through predictable, repeatable processes that organizations can fully integrate around a customer’s Job to Be Done.

- Jobs Theory changes not only what you optimize your processes to do, but also how you measure their success. It shifts the critical performance criteria from internal financial-performance metrics to externally relevant customer-benefit metrics. SNHU tracks how many minutes it takes to respond to an inquiry, for example, because it realizes that time is critical to the process of its online prospects. Amazon focuses on when orders are delivered not when they are shipped. For each new product, Intuit develops a unique set of performance metrics based on the specific customer benefit that the specific Intuit solution delivers. Keeping what matters in focus is challenging for any organization, especially with the forces at play as a company grows. “Now that we’re a much larger company, it’s been a challenge to keep the various parts of the company focused on the customer benefit,” says Intuit founder Scott Cook. “It’s so tempting for parts of the organization to start looking at other things. In our kind of business, you get all this data about ‘conversions’ and ‘retention,’ and so on. We got seduced by that.” It is, to be sure, easier to focus on efficiency rather than effectiveness. Most businesses are very, very good at that. Creating the right metrics is hard. But so important. ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2555))

- Having the right measurements in place helps institutionalize a process. It’s how your employees know they’re doing the right thing, making the right choices. As the old saying goes, “What gets measured, gets done.” From its inception, Amazon has laser-focused on three things that solve customers’ jobs—vast selection, low prices, and fast delivery—and designed processes to deliver them. Those processes include measuring and monitoring how it’s achieving those three ultimate goals on a minute-by-minute basis. The end goal is getting the customers’ jobs done—everything works backward from there. “We always start with the customers and look at all the metrics that matter for the customer,” explains Amazon’s senior vice president for international retail Diego Piacentini.

- “It all starts with that press release,” Piacentini says. “No matter who owns the pieces of the product, you’re part of that process.” The textbook definition tells us that process optimization relates to efficiency. But what Jobs Theory—and Amazon’s example—says is, “Yes, but . . .” The “but” is that optimization should also incorporate a factor for job alignment—otherwise you’re focusing on getting better and better at the wrong things. There is a second very important lesson in the Amazon story: there is a degree of ambidextrousness that enables processes to be both highly efficient and flexible. Jobs are not flexible—they have existed for years and years, even centuries. But how we solve for jobs varies over time. The important thing is to be attached to the job, but not the way we solve it today. Processes must flex over time when a better understanding of customer jobs calls for a revised orientation. Otherwise you’ll risk changing the concept of the job to fit the process, rather than the other way around. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2597))

Even when competitors opted to buy the OnStar technology for their automobiles, their own processes couldn’t compete with the internal GM team’s ability to validate and test new versions in GM’s cars. So competitors’ cars might be offering version three of OnStar while GM cars were on to the far superior fifth-generation version.

- Ford’s core mistake—of focusing on the product spec rather than the job spec—gets repeated all the time. In fact, the misstep is so common in the high-tech world, that Anshu Sharma of Storm Ventures has earned justifiable recognition for calling attention to the problem, which he has dubbed “stack fallacy.” Stack fallacy highlights the tendency of engineers to overweight the value of their own technology and underweight the downstream applications of that technology to solve customer problems and enable desired progress. “Stack fallacy is the mistaken belief that it is trivial to build the layers above yours,” Sharma says. It’s the reason that companies fail so often when they try to move up the stack. “They don’t have first-hand empathy for what customers of the product one level above theirs in the stack actually want. They’re disconnected from the context in which their product will actually be used.” Stack fallacy applies outside of the technology sphere, too. For instance, it might be easy for you to have a vegetable garden. You know what herbs and vegetables you like—and all you have to do is to learn how to grow them and use them in your own cooking. On the other hand, your understanding of growing and using herbs does not prepare you to open and run a restaurant. In fact, eight out of ten restaurants fail within five years. Knowledge of production, Sharma says, is not the same thing as knowing what customers are looking for. In short, stack fallacy and Jobs Theory shine light on the same hazard: to mistake technical know-how—which Ford and Qualcomm had in spades—for the customer’s Job to Be Done, about which they understood very little. The high-stakes consequence is to dismiss the specific customer application as trivial when it is, in fact, essential. By contrast, Huber and his team maintained clear focus on the Job to Be Done. They invented, reinvented, and reinforced an entire set of processes to ensure that they were delivering peace of mind to customers. By 2009 OnStar, by itself, had become a key reason that people bought certain GM cars. Processes are powerful. By their very nature, processes are set so that employees perform tasks in a consistent way, time after time. They are meant not to change. When processes are organized around the customer’s Job to Be Done—optimized to facilitate the progress and deliver the experiences that customers seek—processes are the source of competitive advantage.

- “Two-thirds of our R&D budget is spent on process innovation,” Whitman says. The goal is to create offerings that shift complexity out of the client’s process, making the experience of using FranklinCovey’s products easier. “It’s no good if they thought they signed up for an exercise class and realized once they got there, they had to commit to climb Mount Everest!” Whitman says. The converse is equally true: when processes are not aligned with a compelling customer job, optimizing the process means getting better and better at doing the wrong thing. There’s a reason that the fast-food company didn’t implement the changes that Moesta and his colleagues recommended to boost milk shake sales. It may have been a great idea, but the organization’s “immune system” rejected it out of hand. Local managers deemed the required changes in their routine processes and resource allocations too difficult to implement and the idea died a quiet death. Many smart companies unwittingly undermine their own great ideas with hidebound processes. This is a good thing when the processes are perfectly aligned with the Job to Be Done.

- People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole. It’s a profound insight—first popularized by legendary Harvard marketing professor Ted Levitt decades ago.1 Customers don’t want products, they want solutions to their problems. Peter Drucker, too, warned us that the customer rarely buys what the company thinks it sells him. There is, as these two sages pointed out, often a profound disconnect between the company and the customer. These are the two most important marketing insights of the last century—and I don’t know many marketers who would disagree. But the marketers’ actions tell us something different. We believe that most successful organizations are founded, de facto, on this perspective—essentially they identified a Job to Be Done. But after companies have successfully launched, the wisdom of Levitt and Drucker seems to fade away.2 Something shifts. Even in some of the best companies, the Job to Be Done that brought them success in the first place can somehow get lost in the shuffle of running and growing the business.

- Even great companies veer off course in nailing the job for their customers and focus instead on nailing the job for themselves.

- Consequently, companies organized around a brick-and-mortar business model rather than a customer job are unlikely to thrive over the longer term. Increasingly, they will find themselves playing defense rather than profitably expanding. By contrast, consider recent success stories like OpenTable, Salesforce.com, Airbnb, or enduring successes such as craigslist or IKEA. Each of these businesses is very clearly organized around a distinct Job to Be Done and each has enjoyed sustained success with minimal competition. It’s a totally different game. This is not a new phenomenon. As Ted Levitt pointed out in the pages of Harvard Business Review decades ago, the railroad industry did not decline because the need for passenger and freight transportation declined. That need actually grew, but cars, trucks, airplanes, and even telephones stepped in to handle that job nicely. The railroads were in trouble, Levitt wrote back in 1960, “because they assumed themselves to be in the railroad business rather than in the transportation business.”4 In other words, the railroads fell into the trap of letting the product define the market they were in, rather than the job customers were hiring them to do. They organized and tracked and measured themselves as if they were in the business of selling drills, not quarter-inch holes.

- By contrast, many successful start-ups do start out selling quarter-inch holes. The original kernel of the idea for Netflix was uncovered the way many start-ups gain traction: an entrepreneur found himself in a circumstance with no clear solution and declared, “I’m going to fix this!” In a sense, he began both as the CEO and a target customer—there was no separation between the innovator and his customer’s job. Much of the information needed to make decisions about solving for a job is found in the context of the struggle. We call that “passive data” because it has no voice or clear structure or champion or agenda. Passive data, by itself, doesn’t tell us what is going on in the world because the Job to Be Done doesn’t change much. Passive data is just unfiltered context. It’s always present, but it isn’t loud. In discovering an unfilled or poorly done job, managers are surrounded by nonconsumption and workarounds. They are immersed in the passive data of context. Familiar marketplace markers such as product sales, quality standards, and competitive benchmarks are all missing. Instead, signposts of innovation opportunity take the form of individual customers’ frustrations and undesirable tradeoffs and experiences. Making meaning out of the jumble of real-life experiences is not about tabulating data but about assembling the narrative that reveals the Job to Be Done. Innovators have to immerse themselves in the messy context of real life to figure out what potentially successful new products might offer to customers. In the early stage, managers are puzzle solvers, not number crunchers. Passive data does not broadcast itself loudly. You have to seek it out, put clues together, relentlessly ask why? But it’s critically important because it is the way to identify innovation opportunities. Here’s how the trouble starts: managers by their very nature respond to information—and negative information, in particular, causes them to respond quickly. We can predict, however, that, as soon as a Job to Be Done becomes a commercial product, the context-rich view of the job begins to recede as the active data of operations replaces and displaces the passive data of innovation. Once products are launched, a faucet is opened and data is created, data that didn’t exist until sales had been made and customers created. Managers feel an understandable sense of reassurance when they shift their attention from the hazy contours of a story of struggle to the crisp precision of a spreadsheet. And this switch happens organically and with little fanfare: Product sales generate data about products: how many, how profitable, and which ones, etc. Customers’ purchases generate data about customers themselves: business or consumer, large or small, wealthy or not-so-much, direct or via sales channel, local or far-flung, etc. Investments in people, facilities, and technology generate data on their productivity, returns, and value.

- When a company makes big investments in developing relationships with customers, natural incentives arise to find ways to sell more products to existing customers. The marginal cost of selling more products to existing customers is very small—and the profit is oh so alluring. We call this “surface growth.” Companies see products all around them made by other companies and decide to copy or acquire them. But in doing so, companies often end up trying to create many products for many customers—and lose focus on the job that brought them success in the first place.7 Worse, trying to do many jobs for many customers can confuse customers so they hire the wrong products for the wrong jobs and end up firing them in frustration instead.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The Fallacy of Conforming Data is the third fallacy that causes companies to lose their focus on the customers’ Job to Be Done. Data has an annoying way of conforming itself to support whatever point of view we want it to support. In fact, Nate Silver, a well-known statistician and founder of the New York Times political blog FiveThirtyEight (it was acquired by ESPN in 2013), noted, “The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how it really is.”8 We don’t realize this, we don’t mean for it to happen, but it is an unfortunate frailty of the human brain. Psychologists have explained that when we hold conflicting ideas or beliefs in our minds, this “dissonance” produces reactions of stress and anxiety that we naturally seek to minimize and avoid. Uncomfortable truths are just that—uncomfortable. As data comes in, it’s not that we lose objectivity—we never had it to begin with. I can’t help but think of every parent-teacher conference I ever attended—my wife and I would always leave the room with totally different perspectives on what we just heard. I heard, I’m sure, the things that confirmed my expectations. My wife, I suspect, heard something closer to what the teacher actually said. We make the data and the messages conform to what we believe. So often, companies are blindsided by a competitor’s innovation or what turns out to be a missed opportunity. “Why didn’t we see that coming??” The truth is, you had no chance of seeing it because you weren’t looking for it. In the words of Sherlock Holmes, “There is nothing more deceptive than the obvious fact.” ([Location 2945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2945))

- We pick and choose the data that suits us. “Decisions don’t get made. They happen,” observes neuromarketing expert, Gerald Zaltman, a longtime colleague at Harvard Business School who has spent years studying how managers represent their ideas and apply their ideas and knowledge. Among the common mistakes he’s identified? “The tendency to treat facts as insights and leap directly from data to action,” Zaltman recently wrote in the Journal of Advertising Research. “It is common when research is used to prove points rather than as fuel for imaginative insight.” ([Location 2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2967))

- There’s an even more fundamental problem with data. Many people view numerical data as more trustworthy than qualitative data. But where does “objective” data come from? The data used in many research projects comes from companies’ financial statements, for example. Is this objective? H. Thomas Johnson and Robert S. Kaplan showed quite convincingly that the numbers representing revenues, costs, and profits in financial statements are the result of processes of estimation, negotiation, debate, and politics in allocating overhead costs that can produce grossly inaccurate reflections of true cost and profit.9 The healthiest mindset for innovation is that nearly all data—whether presented in the form of a large quantitative data set on one extreme, or an ethnographic description of behavior on the other—is built upon human bias and judgment. Numerical and verbal data alike are abstractions from a much more complex reality, out of which a researcher attempts to pull the most salient variables or patterns for examination. Whereas the subjectivity of data from field-based, ethnographic research is glaringly apparent, the subjective bias of numerical data hides behind its superficial precision.

- Data is not the phenomena. The primary function of data is to represent the phenomena—to create a simulation of reality. But there is a misconception about data that is so prevalent it’s tacitly embedded in many organizations—the idea that only quantitative data is objective. There’s a pervasive belief that there is some set of ideal data that can, together, yield the perfect insights about customers. It’s just a matter of figuring what the right data is. In short, we can know “truth” if we just gather the right data in quantitative form, the kind of information that can be fed into a spreadsheet or regression analysis. How many? What? Where? Who? When? By contrast, qualitative data—observations and insights that don’t fit neatly into a spreadsheet to be sliced and diced—is not as reliable as quantitative, because there’s no single “truth” at the core. Quantitative data, the thinking goes, is somehow better. But that’s not correct. Deity does not create data and then bestow it upon mankind. All data is man-made. Somebody, at some point, decided what data to collect, how to organize it, how to present it, and how to infer meaning from it—and it embeds all kinds of false rigor into the process. Data has the same agenda as the person who created it, wittingly or unwittingly. For all the time that senior leaders spend analyzing data, they should be making equal investments to determine what data should be created in the first place. What dimensions of the phenomena should we collect data on and what dimensions of the phenomena should we ignore?10 ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=2989))

- The Big Idea Many companies have lofty mission statements with a variety of intentions from motivating workers to informing strategies to attracting investors, but almost as many companies struggle to translate these mission statements into everyday behaviors. However, when the job has a voice in an organization, individual work streams have meaning and employees understand why their work matters. A well-articulated job provides a kind of “commander’s intent,” obviating the need for micromanagement because employees at all levels understand and are motivated by how the work they do fits into a larger process to help customers get their jobs done.

- A clearly defined job spec that everyone understands can serve the same purpose—a focal point for employees to make the right decisions without being told specifically what to do each time. Absent a specific directive, employees know how to balance the tradeoffs that necessarily come with any new initiative. What’s most important? What can’t we compromise on? What’s the ultimate goal? What’s my role in achieving that ultimate goal? Jobs Theory provides you with the right set of lenses to make everyday choices that connect to the jobs you are solving in customers’ lives. Jobs Theory provides a language of integration, whereby marketers, engineers, salespeople, and customer service employees can communicate with each other, rather than talk past one another.

- As Mercer’s Jacques Goulet sees it, the concept of a Job to Be Done serves this purpose perfectly “because of its simplicity. It’s a simple expression—one-syllable words. Jobs. To. Be. Done. It’s not overly engineered and overly complicated. But it’s powerful, it’s simple, and it focuses the mind.” It’s not easy to get these jobs-based goals right—as we’ve discussed, jobs are complex and nuanced and require a deep understanding of the progress a consumer is trying to make. But when you do, the impact on an organization’s productivity can be dramatic, because the resulting clarity enables a much greater share of the organization’s human capital to be deployed with the right balance of autonomy and alignment. Since we know that strategy is formed in the everyday choices employees make about resources, processes, and priorities, clarity about what jobs your customers are hiring you to do provides a kind of intuitive playbook.

- As was true for Intuit’s Cook, Huber found the power of focusing his team around the Job to Be Done extended beyond knowing what features and benefits made most sense. The clarity of a Job to Be Done actually motivated employees to do their best work because they clearly understood why that mattered. When the arrow on the “two-sided compass” shifts to point more clearly at a deeper understanding of the job, so too must the other side of it, aligning with a better job spec. “Whenever something came up that we had never thought about, but clearly intersected with this compass heading, people just did it. They just got on it,” Huber says. “You didn’t get the normal reaction, ‘Don’t give me one more thing to do.’” Instead, Huber says—like what Cook found at Intuit—the team would often be energized by the focus.

- “What gets measured, gets done.” It’s generally used in the positive sense of urging managers to measure for benchmarking efficiency and improvements. But the data we use to measure efficiency is double-edged. Yes, it enables measurement and management, but data also creates a model of the external world. Managers inside a corporation—especially large ones—rarely know their customers directly. They know the customer only through data—the models and spreadsheets that slice, dice, and reconstruct real people into “segments” of similarly attributed phenomena. When companies organize themselves into business units with responsibilities for products of certain characteristics or units with responsibilities for certain customer groups, data is gathered through those filters creating models that rarely map to customer jobs. “Turns out in the modern world, there’s so much you can easily measure: screens, traffic, conversion rates, frequency, screens per use. . . . There were so many things to measure that our people got full of measuring all the stuff that was easy to measure because it rolled off our servers,” says Intuit founder Scott Cook. But in spite of the volume of data that Intuit had on every click its customers made, something fundamental was missing. “We weren’t measuring what was most important to our customers. Because it’s hard to measure. But it matters profoundly. We were not measuring whether we were improving customers’ lives.” “Improving customers’ lives” didn’t translate into a single piece of data that Intuit was already capturing. But it was possible to measure whether Intuit was providing the experiences in purchase and use that its customers were seeking in hiring Intuit software. For example, Intuit knows that accountants who hire Intuit software are trying to save time doing clients’ tax returns. That frees them up to take on more clients (and consequently bill more) or simply to have more free time to pursue other activities. Did Intuit software help them achieve that? Cook, who served on the board of Amazon for years, points to the online retail giant as the model of understanding how to measure what matters most to customers’ Jobs to Be Done—while still focusing on improving efficiency. As we discussed earlier, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been crystal clear since its inception that there are three things that matter in their retail business: vast selection, low prices, and fast delivery. In Amazon’s now famous “customer backward” innovation process, those three measures are monitored on a minute-by-minute basis. Bezos doesn’t consider delays to be accidents or poor performance, he considers them “defects” to be eradicated. For example, to stay true to its foundational promise of “lowest prices,” Amazon built a shopping robot, an automated search engine that scours the prices of hundreds of benchmark products twice a day. If a lower price was found, the Amazon price was automatically lowered to beat that competitor’s price.… ([Location 3273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=3273))

- In economics, Adam Smith’s construct (1776) of an “invisible hand” helped explain how free markets work. Figuratively, the invisible hand allocates capital and labor to activities that bring prosperity, and it takes resources away from entities that waste them. It has helped billions of people understand how capitalism, properly structured, helps mankind. In the theory of disruption, the key to defining the essence of disruption was being able to visualize trajectories of how technological progress and market needs interact. Why this diversion into the role of constructs in theories? The term “job” is a construct. It fits exactly the definition of what a construct is, and the role it plays in the Jobs to Be Done Theory. Understanding jobs as a construct involved carefully defining the terms that I needed to communicate what I had been seeing. The terms “hire” and “fire,” for example, are not simply cute words. Rather, they helped me visualize how the processes of buying and selling actually work. ([Location 3467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=3467))

- When the Theory is “Wrong” A theory never pops out of a researcher’s mind complete and perfect. Rather, it evolves and improves as people use it. Good theories actually need anomalies—things that the theory cannot explain—in order to improve. The discovery of anomalies forces researchers to dive back into the phenomenal muck. They need to improve the theory so that it can account for the anomaly, or define a new boundary beyond which the theory ought not be used. Each time we discover and account for an anomaly, we learn something more about how the world works. One of the silliest habits of many in academia is to orchestrate a finding that “disproves” a theory that a colleague has developed and published. The authors publish their paper in a journal of repute, and then smugly lie back on a beach somewhere because their paper is now “in the literature.” This helps no one. Anomalies do not disprove anything. Rather, they point to something that the theory cannot yet explain. Scholars who find anomalies need to roll up their shirtsleeves and work to try to improve a theory or replace it with a better one. I hope that you and the other readers of this book will find things that the Jobs Theory cannot yet explain. If you will communicate these problems to me, it will help me improve our collective understanding. At the time of writing, I am developing ways for these theories to be improved collaboratively online and I welcome your thoughts. My deepest thanks, in advance, for joining the quest to learn more and more about the theory, and helping all of us to understand how to manage innovation more successfully.

- Two decades ago, I used the term “disruptive innovation” to describe the phenomena by which entrant companies can topple powerful incumbent companies. The Theory of Disruption has guided tens of thousands of companies toward prosperity. But because, like most words in the English language, “disruption” has many meanings, the Theory of Disruption has also been misapplied. It’s been used to describe many phenomena and situations where it actually does not apply. I’ve puzzled about whether I could have used a better term or descriptor, but have yet to find a better alternative. For this reason, I would like to try to put boundaries around the word “jobs” as we are using it. It is easy to slip into using “jobs” to describe our attempts to understand a wide range of human motivations. But not everything that motivates us is a Job to Be Done. Jobs, as we’ve defined them here, take work to uncover and understand properly, thus dubbing something a job shouldn’t roll off the tongue with minimal thought. My definition of a job in this book is intentionally precise. I see two problems that you must avoid as you study and apply Jobs Theory. First, if you or a colleague describes a Job to Be Done in adjectives and adverbs, it is not a valid job. It might describe an experience that a customer needs to have in order to do the job, but it is not a job, as we have defined it here. For example, “convenience” is not a Job to Be Done. It might be an experience that might cause a customer to choose your product rather than a competitor’s product, but it is not a job. A well-defined Job to Be Done is expressed in verbs and nouns—such as, “I need to ‘write’ books verbally, obviating the need to type or edit by hand.” In contrast, the sentence “We should aspire to be more honest” is a… ([Location 3498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=3498))

- A couple of examples: “I need to have a chocolate milk shake that is in a twelve-ounce disposable container” is not a job. The possible candidates that I could hire to do this are all in the milk shake product category. I could call this a need or a preference—but it isn’t a job. We need to go up another level of abstraction in order to discover the job. “I need something that will keep me occupied with what’s happening on the road while I drive. And also, I’d like this to fill me up so that I’m not hungry during a 10:00 a.m. meeting. I could hire a banana, doughnuts, bagels, Snickers, or a coffee to do this job.” The candidates to do the job are all from different product categories; and our rule of thumb is that this is the right level of abstraction. Another illustration: “I need a thin sheet of material that we can wrap around a house just before we apply shingles, siding, or bricks. It needs to have a high coefficient of friction; a low coefficient of thermal conduction; and a high coefficient of toughness—so that it won’t rip as we wrap the house. Oh—and it also must be impervious to moisture.” This isn’t a job, it’s a technical specification. It gives me the choice of buying Tyvek by DuPont, or to be cheap, ignore the spec, and use nothing instead. I need to go up to a higher level of abstraction in order to discover a job. This is what we might find as we explore for it: “We’re building a new house here in Boston, where the cold, damp air of winter and the hot, humid air of summer both easily penetrate walls. I want my family to feel warm and cozy in my home in the winter—and cool and dry in the summer. I need to insulate the outside walls of this house so I can minimize the costs of heating and air-conditioning.” I could hire wood (paper) pulp and blow it into the space in my walls to do this job. I could also hire rolls of fiberglass insulation and staple it to the studs in the wall. Or I could hire Tyvek by Dupont. And to nail things down even tighter, I could hire Tyvek and rolls of fiberglass together.

- In 2012 Karen Dillon and I joined with James Allworth, one of my most thought-provoking former students, to write How Will You Measure Your Life?2 In its sixth chapter, we put on the Jobs to Be Done Theory, like a set of lenses, and looked at what goes on in our personal lives. We see things that have been hiding in plain sight in our personal lives and families for many years. We pose questions such as, “What is the job that our children hire parents to do for them?” and “What is the job(s) that my wife needs to get done, for which she might hire a husband?” These questions are posed at the right level of abstraction. For example, when something breaks in the house a wife might hire her husband to do the job. She could also hire a tradesman to repair it. She might simply do it herself. Or she might just live with it, never fixing the problem. Another job is that she needs to feel loved. She could hire a husband to get this job done. But all too often the husband doesn’t do the job very well. So she could hire friends and family to do the job, or her profession to do it. Or she could live her life without ever getting this job done well. We hope you will read this and think about the jobs you are being hired for in your life—and if you are performing them well. It might be a sobering exercise. ([Location 3550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=3550))

One of the most important ways they do this is by assuming responsibility for the cost of care—by insuring consumers, for instance. The organizations’ financial sustainability therefore depends on keeping consumers as healthy as possible over the course of their relationship with providers; and this dependency enables jobs-focused innovation around disease prevention, and care efficiency and effectiveness, to flourish. It enables providers to focus on keeping consumers healthy, instead of waiting until they get sick to step in; and on helping them get well as soon as possible, or effectively managing chronic conditions, when they do get sick. The result? The jobs of the provider and consumer are aligned well. These plans are in stark contrast to traditional plans, in which providers are paid only for specific services delivered to consumers. In this context, providers have no financial incentive to keep consumers healthy over the long term or to manage the cost of care delivery—and they have every incentive to increase the volume of care delivered. Their jobs and consumers’ jobs are painfully misaligned. ([Location 3586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BBPZIHM&location=3586))

- What job do we elect a political leader to do for us and our nation? What job do they think we are hiring them to do and how does that compare with the job we think we’re hiring them to do when we go into the voting booth? Are they aligned? Are we hiring people to lead us? Or to give voice to our fears? They’re not the same thing. As I mentioned in chapter 8, Peter Drucker famously cautioned us: “The customer rarely buys what the company thinks it is selling him.” I suspect there’s a profound disconnect between voters and politicians, too, and that’s why we’re continually dissatisfied with the people we elect to serve us. Think about this disconnect the next time you go to church, synagogue, or another house of worship—or deliberately don’t go. The Jobs to Be Done Theory explains why so many churches are struggling to keep their members. They have lost a sense for the jobs that arise in their members’ lives, for which they might hire a church. I could go on for hours about how the Theory of Jobs helps us see the world in unique and insightful ways. Good theories are not meant to teach us what to think. Rather, they teach us how to think. I encourage you to continue the conversation from here in your home or your office after you put this book down. How Theory Helps You A few years ago, in the middle of the class I teach at Harvard—“Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise” (BSSE)—one of my students raised her hand to ask a question. We were about halfway through the semester and, as usual, we had spent our time learning various theories that I believe are the most important tools I can give my students before they venture out in the world. I’ve gotten a lot of questions over the years, and I’m usually prepared for anything. But this one threw me a bit. “Excuse me, professor. I don’t mean to be rude, but I wanted to know what’s the purpose of this course?” I was surprised because I thought it was clear that we were preparing them to accomplish great things in their careers and personal lives and to navigate the difficult decisions that would inevitably come their way. But I asked her if I could think about it overnight. The next day I had an answer that not only satisfied her, but satisfied me: “In this class we learn theories that explain what causes what to happen. Isn’t it great to know how things work?” That has been the aim of this book, too. If you know how innovation works—what truly causes innovation to succeed—your efforts don’t have to be left to fate. We’ve allowed ourselves to believe that luck is essential for far too long. There are whole industries, such as venture capital, that are currently organized around the belief that innovation is essentially a game of playing the odds. But it’s time to topple that tired paradigm. I’ve spent twenty years gathering evidence so that you can put your time, energy, and resources into creating products and services that you can predict, in advance, customers will be eager to hire.
