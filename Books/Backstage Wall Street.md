## Highlights
- If the World’s Oldest Profession is prostitution, then surely its second oldest is financial advice. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=238))
- A stockbroker is someone who invests your money until it’s all gone. —Woody Allen ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=270))
- “Wall Street,” reads the sinister old gag, “is a street ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=276))
- with a river at one end and a graveyard at the other.” This is striking, but incomplete. It omits the kindergarten in the middle, and that’s what this book is about. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=277))
- What I am attempting to convey, however, is that professionals tend to be less emotional. Part of that stems from the fact that professionals are managing other people’s money, and so they have that luxury of emotional detachment. Another part stems from their being desensitized to a lot of the volatility by the sheer fact that they live with it 32½ ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=340))
- hours a week while the markets are open. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=343))
- The brokerage business has always been a very “heads we win, tails somebody else loses” proposition. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=375))
- Martin Shafiroff was one of the early practitioners of the cold-call stock sale. He literally wrote the book on it, called Successful Telephone Selling in the ’90s. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=777))
- Marty eventually made it out and became an incredible financial advisor success story, but most of the guys who learned (and bastardized) his methods in the ensuing decades didn’t. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=790))
- His telephone technique became known as the Lehman Method. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=798))
- As a quick aside, you’ll notice that I’m using the masculine pronouns he and his and him while I dissect the process of account opening and pitching stock. This is not accidental. I would estimate that more than 90 percent of the brokers who had come up this way in the business were male and that 99 percent of ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1042))
- the affluent investors on the other end of the phone have been male as well. This is by design, as the pitch and progression from lead to account to client are all very much built around appealing to the male psyche. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1044))
- or naked greed like wealthy men do. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1047))
- I’m not interested in turning this discussion into a battle of the sexes; it is a fact that men (including myself) have deep-seated insecurities about money and about missing out on the opportunity to make more. Over decades the Straight Line Pitch and variants of it have succeeded in exploiting these ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1047))
- insecurities, but it just didn’t seem to elicit the same kind of response from members of the fairer sex. Because this was the case, most efforts to pitch women over the phone were abandoned early on and never attempted again. The irony here is that this institutionalized bias ensured that those brokers were never actually talking to the real decision maker in the ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1049))
- family. There was always this stigma to “talking to the wife” in the old days. When counseling rookie advisors and less experienced industry participants, one of the first myths I shatter for them is this one. These days, some of my best and most satisfying client relationships are with the female heads of the households I serve. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1052))
- Most of the brokers I know and have met over the years are phenomenal, world-class salespeople. Like me, they have learned an ironclad sales rap that, when employed prodigiously and often, produces a logic-defying amount of income. But a great many of these ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1063))
- securities-selling savants don’t attain the knowledge necessary to actually accomplish anything for their clients. As I have come to learn over the years, selling one’s expertise is much easier than actually developing an expertise, especially as it pertains to investing. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1065))
- Let me not dance around this simple and ineluctable truth a moment longer: ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1067))
- brokers have no business making investment decisions for anyone. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1068))
- We now have an equity fund industry that’s worth $2 trillion, and if everyone wants their $2 trillion back tomorrow, they’re not going to get it. —John Bogle ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1082))
- By driving the costs out of trading, the online brokerages had inadvertently driven the investment banks back to the profit drawing board—as history has shown time and again, Wall Street getting creative is almost never a good thing. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1184))
- The stockbroker services his clients in the same way that Bonnie and Clyde serviced banks. —William Bernstein ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1798))
- For the uninitiated, the investment management business classifies itself in two different factions, the buy-side and the sell-side. The buy-side is made up of firms that manage money such as pensions, mutual funds, asset managers, and hedge funds. Buy-side analysts would be the people ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1916))
- employed by these firms to research and analyze investments in-house. The sell-side would be the brokerage firms and investment banks that make recommendations to the buy-side in exchange for the trading commissions that come when the buy-side reacts to these calls. ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=1918))
- In July 2001, the acting chairperson of the SEC, Laura Unger, testified before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises. You should have been there, it was hilarious. But seriously, the findings in her report were so off the wall that even people with no ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2028))
- understanding of the regulations were blown away by the brazen immorality of it all. In the eyes of the ordinary citizen, Wall Street’s behavior in this era was the business-world equivalent of slapping babies and stepping on puppy dogs. Here were some of the items that Unger laid bare for all to see on Capitol Hill that day: ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2030))
- The lines between research and investment banking have indeed blurred. Seven of the nine firms inspected reported that investment banking had input into analysts’ bonuses and the analyst hiring process. At at least one of those firms, 90 percent of an analyst’s bonus is based on ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2034))
- investment banking revenue. The staff inspections found that investment banking did not formally supervise analysts. However, analysts assist investment banking by consulting on IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, participating in pre-IPO roadshows, and initiating research of prospective investment banking clients. ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2036))
- Interviews with former analysts revealed that it was well understood by all of these analysts that they were not permitted to issue negative opinions about investment banking clients. About one quarter of the analysts inspected own securities in companies they cover. The staff found that 16 of 57 analysts reviewed ([Location 2038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2038))
- made 39 investments in a company they later covered. All of the investments were pre-IPO. Most significantly, examiners found that three of these analysts traded contrary to their research report recommendations. Examiners also found that in 26 of 97 lock-ups reviewed, research analysts may have issued “ ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2041))
- booster-shot” research reports. These reports reiterated “buy” recommendations shortly before, or just after, the expiration of the “lock-up” period. (“Lock-ups” are the time period preventing insiders and others obtaining pre-IPO shares from selling the shares.) In each of these instances, the firm underwrote the IPO, or the firm’s ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2043))
- analysts owned stock in the company. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2046))
- On April 28, 2003, NASD, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the National Association of State Securities Administrators [sic] (NASAA), and the New York State Attorney General announced the final ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2137))
- terms of the Global Settlement of Conflicts of Interest between Research and Investment Banking (Global Settlement). The Global Settlement followed joint investigations by the regulators into alleged conflicts of interest between investment banking and securities research at brokerage firms. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2139))
- As a result of the investigation, ten of the nation’s top investment firms agreed to pay $1.4 billion—$387.5 million of it in restitution to be returned to harmed investors through a process overseen by the SEC, and $487.5 million in penalties. Funds have also been earmarked for investor education and to help pay ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2142))
- for independent research for investors. The firms have also agreed to reforms in the way they do business to help prevent these conflicts in the future. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=2144))

- I’ll leave this discussion of the future with a sentiment from Carl Richards that I think all my colleagues can get behind. “My hope is that somehow the traditional financial services industry will figure out that behind the money there are real people, living in the real world, with hopes and ([Location 3125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007F8EZ9M&location=3125))
