## Highlights
- Why do these runners disregard their pain to the point where continuing to push through means that some body part breaks? And again, after the injury, why do they continue on, putting their future ability to run another race at risk?

- Because there’s a finish line. Finish lines are funny things. You either reach them or you don’t. You either succeed or you fail. There is no in between. Progress along the way matters very little. When we consider how off base our intuition is that we will walk away when circumstances make it clear that we ought to, these marathon runners help us to understand why we’ve got it so wrong. Once you start the race, success is only measured against crossing the finish line. And even a broken leg won’t make us quit when facing the choice between falling short or continuing on in pain.

- But just because there are a lot of benefits to setting goals doesn’t mean that there isn’t a downside to them as well. As you might already suspect, clearly defined finish lines should come with a warning: Danger, you may experience escalation of commitment.

- The point the authors are echoing is that, while goals do help us to be grittier, grit isn’t always a virtue. As you already know, grit is good for getting you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile, but grit also gets you to stick to hard things that are no longer worthwhile. In part, what makes goals effective is that they get you to focus on the finish line and motivate you to keep going. But the duality is that goals also keep you from quitting in a bad situation because they focus you on the finish line and motivate you to keep going. Why? In part, because they are graded as pass-fail. To understand why the pass-fail nature of goals can impede progress and increase escalation of commitment, consider this thought experiment. Which feels worse? If you never try to run a marathon, or if you make the attempt and have to stop after sixteen miles? In the first case, you never train for a marathon, never start one, and never finish one. You run zero miles. In the second case, you decide to try, you train, you start, and sixteen miles in you have to quit. I think that we all share the intuition that the latter case would feel worse, even though that version of you trained for distance running and ([Location 3561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3561))

- actually ran 16 miles of a 26.2-mile race, compared with the version of you that never got off the couch. The reason it feels worse is that if you don’t try, if you never start the race, there is no failing to reach the finish line because you never set that as a goal for yourself in the first place. The pass-fail nature of goals impedes your progress because it stops you from starting things for fear of being unable to complete them. No doubt, the person who trained and ran sixteen miles of a marathon is better off health-wise than the person who never started. If your goal is to be healthier, the person who tried has clearly made more progress toward that goal. But for so many of us, that fear of falling short makes us not want to start. As Richard Thaler quipped, “If a gold medal in the Olympics is the only grade that passes, you do not want to ever take your first gymnastics class.” Once we set a goal, that’s what we measure ourselves against. If we’re running in a marathon, anything but 26.2 miles is a failure. This is how goals exacerbate escalation of commitment, because anything short of the finish line is unacceptable to us. It doesn’t matter what’s happening in the world or what’s happening in our bodies. We don’t want to feel like we’ve failed. We’ll just keep running toward the finish line until our leg snaps. When it comes to our aversion to closing accounts in the losses, the pass-fail nature of goals makes this problem worse. As soon as you set a goal or a target, you put yourself immediately in the losses, at least in relation to your distance from the goal. As soon as you cross the starting line, you are now short of the finish line. When an economist talks about being in the gains or losses, they’re talking about whether you are currently winning or losing as compared with where you started. But as is so often the case, when it comes to goals, our cognition cares very little for what economists have to say. Being in the losses is as much a state of mind as anything else. We don’t see ourselves as being in the gains, even though we’ve gone farther than where we started, because we’re not measuring ourselves by how far we are past the starting line. We’re measuring ourselves by whether we’re short of the finish line. Because we don’t want to close mental accounts in the losses, we’re just going to keep running toward the finish line, even if we feel our leg is about to snap, and even after it does.

- Progress along the way should count for something, but we discard it because goals are pass-fail, all-or-nothing, yes-or-no. There’s no partial credit given. Altogether, the pass-fail nature of goals can impede progress, cause escalation of commitment, and stop us from considering the progress we make along the way as a success. The shame in all this is that those finish lines are often arbitrary. ([Location 3600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3600))

- Goals work, but sometimes they work to the point where they make us ignore clear signs that the goal is not worth continuing to pursue. When a goal is all-or-nothing, your choices are essentially not to start or stick to the goal no matter what.

- This is part of what creates the paradox of quitting. The beauty of having the option to quit is that it makes it easier for us to make decisions under uncertainty. Whenever we make a decision, whether it’s starting a race, or starting up a mountain, or starting a business, or starting a relationship, we’re making that decision with incomplete information in a world that’s stochastic. We’re under the influence of luck. The world can change. We can change. For almost anything that we choose to believe or choose to do, we’ll have the option to change our mind or walk away at some point in the future. When we face that decision, we’ll generally have much better information than at the time we made the original choice to start. But that option to quit is only helpful if we actually use it. The problem is that we don’t, and here we see why. Once we start, we put ourselves in the losses. We’re short of our goal, the progress along the way counting for almost nothing. That makes us keep heading toward the finish line, broken leg be damned. ([Location 3614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3614))

- Exacerbating the pass-fail problem is that once we establish a goal, we rarely revisit it. Goals tend to be set-it-and-forget-it. The finish line doesn’t move. If there were no uncertainty and the world didn’t change, that wouldn’t be a problem, because whatever North Star you were striving for would not only be the exact right North Star for you but also would remain as such. Of course, the world is uncertain and the world does change. That means that our goals ought to change in response. But the goals we set are remarkably unresponsive to new information. Whenever we set a goal, we’re making trade-offs. There are all sorts of different things that we value—money, time with our family, time for hobbies, time for friends, our health, the feeling of helping other people, so on and so forth. There is no goal we can set that can allow us to maximize every single thing that we value. By their nature, goals will privilege certain things we value over others. Essentially, we’re ([Location 3623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3623))

- asking ourselves, “What do I want to achieve, and what am I willing to give up to get it?” Presumably, the benefits of pursuing the goal will outweigh the costs. ([Location 3631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3631))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A goal is the expression of that balancing act. In other words, we’re trying to maximize our expected value and the goals that we set for ourselves are supposed to help us do that. ([Location 3632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3632))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Either explicitly or implicitly, the goal you set is a proxy for an expected-value equation, balancing the benefits that you’re trying to gain against the costs you’ll bear to get them. This is all part of the process of setting the goal. But what happens to that calculus once you’ve set the goal and you’re pursuing it? After we set a goal, it becomes a fixed object. This thing that is a proxy for something else becomes the object itself. The goal is the thing we’re trying to achieve, instead of all the values expressed and balanced when we originally set the goal. The goal becomes fixed even as all the inputs that led to choosing that particular goal evolve. The conditions in the world change. Our knowledge changes. The weights we attach to the benefits and costs change. Our preferences and values change. As these things change, if we were to rerun the cost-benefit analysis, the output would surely be different. But we don’t rerun it. To achieve the things we want to achieve, we have to be responsive to the way the world is changing around us and the way that we ourselves are changing. That would mean unfixing our goals, but we don’t naturally do that. In combination, the pass-fail and fixed nature of goals causes us to just keep on toward the finish line, even when the finish line is no longer what we should be running toward. Inflexible goals aren’t a good fit for a flexible world. ([Location 3645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3645))

- Goals are powerful tools. They can make it possible to accomplish worthwhile things. But the mere fact of having a goal can cause escalation of commitment, where you end up sticking to a goal that’s no longer the best way to achieve the things you want to achieve. Of course, it’s partly the fixed nature of goals that wreaks this havoc. Once we set a goal, we learn new information. The world changes. We change. We solve for certain monkeys. Creating more flexible goals is a way to address this. An “unless” is a powerful thing. Adding a few well-thought-out unlesses to our goals will help us achieve the flexibility that we’re seeking, be more responsive to the changing landscape, and reduce escalation of commitment to losing causes. “I’m going to pursue this lead unless I can’t get an executive in the room.” “I’m going to stay in my job unless I have to consistently take my work home or I find myself ([Location 3657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3657))

- dreading the start of the workday and that feeling persists.” “I’m going to keep developing this product unless I fail to hit clear benchmarks within the next two months that I’ve set with my quitting coach.” “I’m going to continue to run this marathon unless I break a bone.” This is why having kill criteria is so important. When you set a goal, creating a list of kill criteria gives you the unlesses that you need to be more rational about when it’s the right time to walk away. Those kill criteria could be about what the world is signaling to you, like observing behavior that tells you that your boss is toxic, or interest rates are rising, or a fog is rolling in, or there’s an onset of a pandemic. Or they could be about changes in yourself, whether it’s the pain you might feel that precedes your fibula snapping or, as… ([Location 3665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3665))

- Or that the sport you used to love now makes you miserable. To make these unlesses most effective, we need to create strong precommitment contracts that set out how we’re going to follow through on those kill criteria. Then, to make sure that we’re picking the unlesses that are going to get us to the fastest answer about whether the thing we’re doing is worth pursuing, we need to do the work of identifying monkeys and pedestals. Doing this work with a quitting coach who can hold you accountable to those unlesses is even better. These unlesses, of course, require advance planning. You’re trying to anticipate as many scenarios that might unfold as possible. But you can’t anticipate every circumstance under which you might stick and every circumstance under which you might quit. That means you have to keep checking back in on the cost-benefit… ([Location 3674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3674))

- costs that you’re bearing, are still worth it. Those check-ins also offer an opportunity to reevaluate old kill criteria and set new ones. Good unlesses allow us to escape the pull of short-term goals that don’t actually help us achieve the long-term goals that we’re striving for. It’s so easy for us to get trapped in trying to win a single hand of poker, or in trying to make sure that we don’t cash out of a game as a loser. But those local goals can impede us from acting in a way that embodies the reality that life is one long game. That means trying to maximize the expected value over our lifetime, which requires us to sometimes give up on these interim finish lines. There are lots of unlesses you can apply in poker. I’ll keep playing, unless I’ve lost a certain amount of money, or unless new players have joined the game who are significantly better than the ones who’ve left… ([Location 3682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3682))

- behavior more closely with our long-term best interests. Sticking to something that’s no longer worthwhile is going to stop you from reaping the benefits that were the original reason for setting the goal in the first place, or it’s going to cause you to incur more costs than you were originally willing to bear. Your goals should change because the world changes and you change.

- It’s a pretty rigid view of the world that defines success only as crossing the finish line. It’s not just that we need to set more flexible goals. We ourselves also need to be more flexible in the way we evaluate success and failure. The way we view goals as pass-fail is, by definition, inflexible and categorical, causing us to discount or completely ignore any progress that ([Location 3697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3697))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- we’ve made. That means, to counteract this problem, we need to find ways to mark that progress, to celebrate the things that we’ve accomplished on the way to the finish line. If you’re trying to summit Everest because you get a lot of value out of that physical and mental challenge, you’re not objectively in the losses if you make it to Camp 1, 2, 3, or 4, or 300 feet from the summit, certainly not in comparison with not having tried at all. Of course, that’s not our subjective experience. That’s what we need to change. We need to find a way to flip the script and stop measuring ourselves solely by how far we are from the finish line. We need to start giving ourselves more credit for how far we are from where we started. If we do that, a silver medal will feel much less disappointing, because in reality it’s a huge accomplishment, as measured against where any figure skater has ever started. Doing that would let you see what an accomplishment it is to earn acceptance as a private student from Itzhak Perlman or, in my case, to have completed five years of graduate-level work.

- It’s easier to mark and celebrate your progress toward a goal if the goal itself is not so all-or-nothing. There are some goals that you set where there is little of value that you can glean if you come up short. While there are other goals where there are lots of things of value that you can accomplish or learn along the way, no matter whether you actually cross the finish line. Those are the types of goals we should prioritize. ([Location 3709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3709))

- You’re already familiar with the problem of opportunity cost neglect. Goal setting can exacerbate this issue. Once we settle on a finish line and a path to get us there, we become myopic, failing to explore other paths that might be available to us or other finish lines that might be better for us to head toward. We don’t see them, and that’s not just a flaw in our peripheral vision. ([Location 3740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3740))

- If they couldn’t see the gorilla right in front of their noses, what do you think you are missing when you are pursuing a goal? You need to be really wary of this myopia because it’s counterproductive to seeing the opportunities around you. That’s another reason why developing an exploratory mindset is so important. You have to be making sure that you’ve got a good view of the landscape, that you are taking calls from recruiters, that you’re exploring other functions, and that you’re generally trying out new things, so that you can start to add to and expand your portfolio. Quitting coaches can also reduce myopia, because they can generally see the opportunities that are available to you better than you can.

- We loathe closing mental accounts in the losses. But as soon as we set a goal, we start ourselves in the losses. This adds to the ruckus caused by all those other biases that gaff the scale against quitting. We are endowed to our goals, and they can easily become part of our identity. They become the status quo. Once we start toward a finish line, we accumulate the sunk costs of time and effort and money spent trying to get there. What makes it so hard to quit, if we were to sum up everything that we’ve talked about in this book, is that when we quit, we fear two things: that we’ve failed, and that we’ve wasted our time, effort, or money. We need to redefine what “failed” and “wasted” mean. When we worry that quitting means we’ve failed, what exactly are we failing at? If you quit something that’s no longer worth pursuing, that’s not a failure. That’s a success. The way we naturally think about failure is to have stopped something short of the goal, as in failing to make it to the finish line.

- continuing to pursue something that’s no longer worth pursuing, isn’t that a failure? How do we start to redefine that and think about failure as failing to follow a good decision process? Success means following a good decision process, not just crossing a finish line, especially if it is the wrong one to cross. That means appropriately following kill criteria, listening to our quitting coaches, and recognizing that the progress we’ve made along the way counts for a lot. We also need to redefine what waste is. What does it mean to waste your time or money or effort? Our problem is that we tend to think about these things in a backward-looking way. We feel like if we walk away from something, that means we’ve wasted everything that we put into it. But those are resources that are already spent. You can’t get them back.

- Once you think about it that way, you realize how much time has actually been wasted in the service of the idea that if you quit, the time you’ve already spent will be for naught. Just look at the California bullet train, where they’re continuing to dump money into something for fear that they will have wasted the time and taxpayer money that they’ve already put into it. We need to redefine failure. We need to redefine waste. But ultimately, what we need to do is rehabilitate the very idea of quitting. Lots of hard things are worth pursuing and grit is good for getting you to stick with it when it’s right. But lots of hard things are not worth pursuing and the ability to walk away when it’s right is also a skill worth developing. Hopefully this book has given you the tools to do that. Ultimately, where you’re going—where we’re… ([Location 3787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3787))

- Chapter 11 Summary Goals can make it possible to achieve worthwhile things, but goals can also increase the chances that we will escalate commitment when we should quit. Goals are pass-fail in nature. You either reach the finish line or you don’t, and progress along the way matters very little. Don’t just measure whether you hit the goal, ask what you have achieved and learned along the way. Set intermediate goals and prioritize goals that allow you to recognize progress along the way or acquire something valuable even if you don’t reach the goal. Goals, when set, are a proxy for an expected-value equation, balancing the benefits that you’re trying to gain against the costs you’re willing to bear. Inflexible goals aren’t a good fit for a flexible world. With better advance planning (like identifying monkeys and pedestals and kill criteria) and the help of a good quitting coach, you can make goals more flexible, setting at least one “unless” and planning… ([Location 3797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PTLY4BL&location=3797))
