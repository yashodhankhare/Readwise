## Highlights
- Delay alone can turn a good decision into a bad one, or vice versa. Much recent research about decisions helps us understand what we should do or how we should do it, but it says little about when. Sometimes we should trust our gut and respond instantly. But other times we should postpone our actions and decisions. Sometimes we should rely on our quick intuition. But other times we ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=61))

- should plan and analyze. Although time and delay have not occupied a prominent spot in decision-making research, these concepts lurk behind the scenes, especially in discussions about human nature. Many scientists say the key skill that distinguishes human beings from animals is our superior ability to think about the future.4 However, thinking about the future is ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=63))

- to figure out, for selfish reasons, whether my own tendency to procrastinate (the only light fixture in my bedroom closet has been broken for five years) was really such a bad thing. I interviewed more than one hundred experts in different fields and worked through several hundred recent studies and experiments, many as yet unpublished, in divergent areas of research. I noticed that decision researchers with different types of expertise do not cross paths very often.5 Frequently, they haven’t heard of each other. Decision research has become so sprawling that experts in one sub-area often don’t know experts in another, even if they… ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=69))

- us tend to react too quickly. We don’t, or can’t, take enough time to think about the increasingly complex timing challenges we face. Technology surrounds us, speeding us up. We feel its crush every day, both at work and at home. Yet the best time managers are comfortable pausing for as long as necessary before they act, even in the face of the most pressing decisions. Some seem to slow down time. For good decision-makers, time is more flexible than a metronome or atomic clock. During superfast reactions, the best-performing experts instinctively know when to pause, if only for a split-second. The same is true over longer periods: some of us… ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=78))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And low heart rate variability is bad—it is associated with higher levels of anger, hostility, stress, and anxiety.10 It is a counterintuitive result, but having a heart that can respond rapidly helps us delay gratification and remain calm, even in the face of great temptation or fear. Being fast in our heart helps our brain go slow later. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=168))

- Asthma, for example. A reptile, with its primitive brain stem, needs to radically conserve oxygen when it is under attack. But that same shutdown could be lethal for an oxygen-hungry mammal. An asthma attack might be a defensive move by the reptile side of the nervous system, when it senses that the cardiovascular system has been working too hard in response to a dangerous situation.16 Or autism. Although the idea is controversial, some studies suggest that autistic children have less responsive heart rates and are more vulnerable to the reptilian shutdown response.

- Yet concluding that children are better off delaying gratification doesn’t tell us why waiting is so much easier for some than others. The marshmallow tests might be widely known, but their results are not well understood. Although we have some understanding of the brain regions that are triggered by these kinds of tests, we don’t really know whether some four-year-olds are naturally able to wait fifteen minutes to get a second marshmallow and therefore do better in life, or whether we can save impatient children by training them to delay gratification for a few extra minutes. This is a new version of the old debate about nature versus nurture. Nor do we understand precisely how long children should be able to wait. We... think a four-year-old who is only capable of waiting a second or two before scarfing down a marshmallow might be in trouble because children without impulse control are more likely to encounter emotional problems.

Wait as long as you can so you’ll have a better chance of swinging only at fat pitches. Much of the battle between superfast athletes is too fast to see. It requires careful research using high-speed cameras. As with heart rate variability, much of what matters to our reactions and decisions over the course of milliseconds is so quick that it is largely hidden from view. The superfast tools we have developed to replicate human behavior are likewise hidden from view. Computers and software algorithms that are modeled on our own decision-making circuitry are hard to tell apart from us at high speeds.

The E-Mini is based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of top stocks, except that it is traded in small amounts (hence “Mini”), and it goes through an electronic trading platform instead of the frenzied “open outcry” method still used for other futures contracts (hence “E-”). To hedge $4.1 billion of stocks, Waddell & Reed would need to sell 75,000 E-Mini contracts. Instead of having its own employees manually enter these orders or call a broker, Waddell & Reed used this automated computer program. Each minute the program calculated the number of E-Mini contracts traded in the market during the previous minute. It then automatically sold 9 percent of that number.

What, then, should we do about high-frequency trading? The first lesson for us as individual investors is simply to beware.

- Another lesson is that, although high-frequency trading seems to be driven by computers, there is a lot of human wisdom that goes into the programming and monitoring of those computers. Essentially, the most profitable high-frequency trading firms are managing time—they speed up when appropriate, but they also slow down.10 Several leading high-frequency traders told me they encourage employees to take more time to reach decisions and they program their computer algorithms to anticipate how other traders will react, and then wait for those reactions. Sometimes these computer algorithms are set to minimize delay. But more often they are optimizing delay—buying and selling only a few shares during the first milliseconds, like the initial feint of a fencing duel, to test how other traders respond. Today the top trading firms teach internal decision sciences classes in which they ensure their human traders understand why their computer algorithms react the way they do in different scenarios. They emphasize strategy more than quick math. For example, when interviewing prospective employees, one leading high-frequency trader likes to ask which fraction is larger, or , not so he can see who gets the right answer first, but to get a window into how people think. He is less impressed by the math whiz who can quickly divide both fractions to the thousandths place ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=657))

But this extra time also can lead us to interfere with our unconscious reactions even if they are perfect. Sometimes having an understanding of precisely what we are doing unconsciously can kill the natural spontaneity. If we are too self-conscious, we will impede our instincts when we need them.

Clark developed a theory of acting based on hockey, pole vaulting, and a simple observation: the best actors are the ones who don’t panic.

- What Clark is talking about, and Stewart is doing, is acting at a very high level, but there are lessons here for everyday communication. We constantly face some kind of an audience, whether it is one person or a group. Although we don’t usually think about delay thresholds when we are having conversations, they are there. Some of us are better at talking than others, and a lot of the reason for that has to do with panic and pauses. If we don’t pause enough, we lack drama. If we pause too much, we sound boring or fake. The best storytellers naturally pull people along with their words and the spaces between their words. According to Jose Benki, a speech scientist at the University of Michigan, speakers who use frequent short pauses are ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=1551))

First, Colin Firth had to think about how to stammer. Then, he had to do it un-self-consciously. What is so remarkable about his performance is that he appears so naturally to confront and overcome the panic arising from a speech defect that he does not have. Great communicators naturally understand how long a speech should be: as long as possible, but not a millisecond longer.

When I met LaCota, it wasn’t for lunch but for happy hour at a fashionable restaurant. I hoped we might observe some dating couples in the wild.

- delay becomes a problem. It makes good sense to wait until the end of lunch to decide whether to ask someone on a second date. But what if you are still putting off the decision a month later? Where is the line between good delay and bad delay? The economist George Akerlof was spending a year in India after graduate school, and his good friend and fellow economist Joseph Stiglitz visited him there. (This was decades ago, before both men won the Nobel Prize.1) Stiglitz had purchased many souvenirs and clothes during his trip. On his return, when a customs official at check-in told Stiglitz he had too many bags and would have to leave one behind, Stiglitz put the extra ornaments and clothes in a cardboard box and asked Akerlof to ship it back to the United States. Then Stiglitz flew home. Neither of them imagined that this box would form the basis of one of the most important theories in behavioral economics. Akerlof is charming and mild-mannered, a rigorous and focused scholar who has written dozens of important articles and several books. Recently, I asked him if he is a procrastinator, and he answered, “Absolutely not. I’m the opposite. I take care of the important things right away.” But when I mentioned Stiglitz’s box, he hesitated. Then he asked, “Well, what do you do when you’re supposed to send a box from India?” ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=1954))

- In 1991, twenty-five years after his postgraduate year in India, Akerlof was invited to give a lecture at the 103rd meeting of the American Economics Association. By this time, he had developed an economic model to explain why humans procrastinate. He began his lecture, entitled “Procrastination and Obedience,” by telling the crowd about Stiglitz’s box.23 The heart of classical economics is the assumption that human beings are rational and forward-looking. Essentially, economists assume that people use a simple tool—multiplication—to make decisions in two different ways. First, economic models assume people multiply the probability of each possible outcome of a decision by how desirable that outcome would be, and then choose the decision with the highest total “expected” value. For example, we would rather have $100 with certainty than a chance at $150 on a coin flip, because the coin flip is expected to be worth, on average, just $75 ($150 multiplied by one-half). However, we’d take the coin flip over a certain $100 if the coin flip paid $250—that chance is worth, on average, $125. According to this theory, we would almost never buy a lottery ticket, because its “expected” value is usually negative: the cost of the ticket is more than the tiny probability of winning multiplied by the payoff (except when the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million in 2007 and the odds of winning were a mere 175 million to one). The assumption that we make these kinds of calculations might seem implausible, but it held up pretty well for more than two centuries after mathematician Daniel Bernoulli first proposed it in 1738. The second assumption is that people use multiplication to “discount” the value of payments to be made in the future. The basic idea of discounting is straightforward: a dollar tomorrow is worth less than a dollar today. Most of us naturally would prefer to pay someone $100 in one year instead of $100 today. Conversely, we would prefer receiving $100 today to $100 in one year. Classical economists assume that the way people decide between money today versus tomorrow is by multiplying any future payment by a discount factor, which we calculate based on the amount of time and risk involved (adjusted for inflation). For example, if you are assessing a promise from me that I will pay you $100 in a year, you might discount it by multiplying it by nine-tenths. In other words, in today’s terms, my $100 promise would be worth just $90. When interest rates and risk are low, we don’t discount future payments very much, but when they are high we discount them a lot. If these two assumptions hold, and people are multiplying correctly, there can be no such thing as procrastination. Instead, if someone is delaying a decision, it must be because they have calculated the probabilities and discounted the future costs and benefits correctly, and then determined that it simply is not worth it to act today. (As a child who liked math, I made a similar argument… ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2024))

- Not that day, or the next. Or the one after that. To the horror of the economists in the crowd,25 Akerlof confessed how long he had taken to ship the box, and how he had decided each day not to ship it: “Each morning for over eight months I woke up and decided that the next morning would be the day to send the Stiglitz box.” Eight months? This wasn’t just rude to young Stiglitz. It was a slap across the face of classical economics.26 Akerlof claimed that, although people are not irrational in general, we are prone to small repeated errors of judgment “due to unwarranted salience of some costs and benefits relative to others.” The mere mention of this unwarranted “salience” froze the roomful of economists, rationalists to a man or woman. Akerlof was suggesting that human beings are irrational. And he was saying it using math. Akerlof described an algebraic model of his decision, which included the cost of sending the box, the value of the clothes to Stiglitz, and a new factor related to the vividness of the activity he might do each morning instead of navigating Indian shipping regulations. Using math to describe human behavior is at the core of economics, but mathematizing the problem didn’t comfort the economists, and it didn’t hide Akerlof’s radical conclusion: people make bad short-term decisions even when they understand the long-term consequences. Worst of all, Akerlof had understood his mistaken thinking about “salience” even as he continued to postpone shipping the box. He knew he’d get up each morning, smell the hot sambar and coffee, think about the nightmare that was Indian bureaucracy, and put off sending Stiglitz his box for yet another day. Akerlof knew the benefits of sending the box outweighed the immediate costs. He knew the probabilities and the discount factors indicated he should send it. He did the multiplication. Yet he still didn’t send the box. For economists who believed in rationality as an article of faith, this was heresy. In his talk, Akerlof compared his decision to other bad short-term decisions with long-term consequences, ranging from alcoholism to dieting to the savings habits of elderly retirees. His audience was full of old, overweight,… ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2052))

- But the discounted cost of future payments is at the heart of many of our decisions, and we don’t always call these decisions to delay payment procrastination. The key to thinking about future payments is the discount rate. For most of the twentieth century, economists assumed that people discount the future at a consistent rate for both the short term and the long term.28 If our discount rate is 10 percent, they assumed, we use that same rate regardless of when we owe money—in a day, a month, or a year.29 Economists also assumed we use the same rate regardless of our level of wealth, or whether we owe or are owed money. The standard economic model assumed that people think about these factors and are consistent about risk and time. Then, in 1979, psychologists began dropping bombs on these assumptions. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published an article in Econometrica, a prestigious economics journal, arguing that the standard economic model of decisions was wrong. A few economists, particularly Richard Thaler, showed that people’s discount rates vary dramatically depending on how far into the future they are discounting. In 1981 Thaler reported the results of an experiment designed to test what people’s discount rates actually were for different periods of time by asking them a series of questions about whether they would prefer money today or in the future. Thaler found that his subjects’ discount rates were much higher in the short term and then declined over time. His subjects didn’t have anything close to the same discount rate for different time periods. Instead, their discount rates were 345 percent for one month, 120 percent for one year, and 19 percent for ten years.30 Discount rates were high at first and then fell precipitously. Other scholars soon joined the criticism. Thaler and the economist George Loewenstein examined how inconsistent humans are about time.31 The psychiatrist George Ainslie developed a model of impulsiveness that was closely related to Thaler’s findings. Ainslie said humans use very high discount rates in the short term, meaning that when we want something today, we really want it and we don’t think much about future costs.32 These researchers found that in the short term we are like the impatient four-year-old who cannot wait for a second marshmallow—we have high discount rates. Yet in the longer term, we are better at resisting the pull of temptation—we have lower discount rates. For example, if we are offered the choice of $50 today or $100 in a month, we might prefer to receive $50 today. But if we are offered the choice of $50 in a year or $100 in thirteen months, we almost certainly will choose to receive $100 thirteen months from now. The wait is a month in both instances, but our assessment of now is very different from our assessment of twelve months from now. We anticipate that our one-month discount rate in a year will be a lot lower than it is today. But after a year passes, that one-month rate is… ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2089))

- In the early 1980s, many scientists were skeptical about whether any animals think about the future. Even people who thought chimps might be able to think about the future didn’t imagine anything useful might come from experiments on pigeons. But James Mazur did. He thought studying pigeons might yield insights about human impatience and the mistakes we make in assessing probabilities and discounting. In his early pigeon studies, he designed a set of meticulous tests in which he gave pigeons varying amounts of food at varying times, depending on whether they pecked a green or red key. Mazur found that pigeons could learn what each key meant: pecking the green key might get them a few morsels within one second, whereas pecking the red key got them twice as much food but with a delay of ten seconds.34 Richard Thaler had calculated people’s discount rates for different time periods by asking them whether they preferred some money today or more money in the future. The pigeons obviously couldn’t talk to Mazur about their preferences, but he could learn about those preferences by tracking which keys they pecked as he varied the amount of delay. In a series of experiments, Mazur found the same pattern of results for pigeons that Thaler had found for humans: their discount rates were very high in the short term and then rapidly declined. The pigeons’ timing was much faster than that of humans, seconds instead of months, but the insight was the same: just like the four-year-old child who grabs the marshmallow before fifteen minutes have elapsed, or the human adult who takes $50 today instead of $100 in a month, pigeons were very impatient in the short term. Mazur’s most significant insight came when he collated how the pigeons’ discount rates varied over time. He found that they followed a curved “hyperbolic” shape: they were very high for short periods of time, but then declined rapidly and leveled off, like a steep roller-coaster drop.35 It might seem implausible that pigeon preferences would follow an equation from high school trigonometry. But if hyperbolas show up in bridge suspension cables and tree trunks, why not in pigeon brains? Over the years Mazur has shown in multiple experiments that pigeon discount rates consistently track this hyperbolic roller-coaster curve: high in the short term and then sliding steeply down. Pigeons want food right away,… ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2126))

- Economists, particularly David Laibson at Harvard, have cited Mazur’s findings in developing new mathematical models to replace the classical models of human decision-making. Economists love math, so Mazur’s claim that discount rates follow a hyperbolic curve had instant appeal. Laibson and others tweaked Mazur’s hyperbolic equation to develop a “quasi-hyperbolic” mathematical model that does a reasonably good job of describing how people actually behave.37 The key insight is that human beings, like pigeons, have high short-term discount rates and lower long-term discount rates.38 Today many economists use the term “present bias” to describe the fact that our immediate discount rates are so high: we prefer happiness today to happiness in the future.39 Present bias models are complicated and controversial.40 The math gets tricky, and no one seriously believes that people—even high school students who are taking trigonometry and can remember the equations for… ([Location 2149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2149))

- The main difference between these new economic models and James Mazur’s earlier findings, other than some technical tweaking, is that human beings’ time frames are much longer. One second for a pigeon is like a day or so for us. Fifteen pigeon seconds is a human month. Beyond that, we are at the limit of the pigeon’s attention span. The parallels between pigeon and human discounting are another example of the connections we can make by looking at behavior through different time lenses. Humans and pigeons follow similar behavioral patterns, the main difference being that we take longer. There is a concept in mathematics called “self-similarity” in which some objects, especially shapes known as “fractals,” look the same regardless of how much you magnify them. Mazur explains how the pigeon and human versions of procrastination are self-similar: The same thing happens with people, where there may be some small amount of work that we have to do right away such as get a small repair job done on our car and we’re likely in many cases to procrastinate and in the end we are paying three or four times as much for a… ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2160))

- There have been so many experiments about discount rates over the years that researchers now use standardized questionnaires to elicit people’s rates. For example, in the Kirby Delay-Discounting Monetary Choice Questionnaire, subjects answer twenty-six questions, beginning with: “Would you prefer $54 today, or $55 in 117 days?” The amounts range from $11 to $85, and the timing ranges from 7 to 186 days. The questions usually reveal that people have a present bias: their discount rates are higher for one week than for six months. These tests confirm that the new economic models do a decent job of describing our behavior. The tests also show that some people have higher discount rates than others overall. These people are in trouble. Over and over, studies have shown that high discount rates correspond to bad behavior. People with high discount rates are generally less happy and less successful. They are fatter, have more debt and less savings, drink more alcohol, smoke more, exercise less, have lower-paying jobs, don’t stay in a job for as long, and are more likely to be divorced.43 If you have a sense of someone’s discount rate, you know a lot about the kinds of problems they are likely to have. In contrast, people with lower discount rates tend to think more about what they are doing and why. They have more moderate habits, they carry less credit card debt, and they consume and savor healthy foods.44 While people… ([Location 2171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2171))

- prone to have high short-term discount rates.45 They frame economic decisions in narrow terms, using blinders, which is one reason why so many poor people are trapped by crushing debt loads. Poor people are more likely to get “payday” loans—high-interest-rate advances on their next paycheck.46 They are less likely to understand that the charges for payday loans are absurdly high, even compared to credit card rates. Or perhaps they do understand, but must have the money at once anyway. It remains unclear which way the causation runs: are people poor because they have high discount rates, or do they have high discount rates because they are poor? Young people also tend to have high discount rates. If four-year-olds understood enough details about money to fill out the Kirby Questionnaire, we probably would find that the ones who grab marshmallows right away have higher discount rates. For older children, especially adolescents, we know from numerous studies that high discount rates are… ([Location 2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2184))

- With all of this research, we now have something approaching a general theory of procrastination, in two parts. First, our discount rates are the key variables. If they are reasonable and we delay some action, we really shouldn’t call that procrastination, not in any pejorative sense. Instead, procrastination occurs when we use a discount rate that is too high, that is, when we discount the future too much. High discount rates are one of our biggest problems as decision-makers. High discount rates lead to the bad kind of procrastination. Second, procrastination is closely related to impatience. Their kinship is based on discount rates and our bias toward the present over the future.50 Both are examples of the human tendency to overdiscount future events. In both impatience and procrastination, we overweight the immediate. The main difference between the two is whether the immediate thing we are… ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2195))

The answers are similar for all of our impatience problems: find ways to reduce our short-term discount rates to levels that are both reasonable and closer to our long-term discount rates.

- In 2005, Paul Graham, a computer programmer, investor, writer, and painter, wrote an essay called “Good and Bad Procrastination.” He opens by saying, “The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators. So could it be that procrastination isn’t always bad? Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure it. But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.”60 Graham notes that when we procrastinate we don’t work on something. However, he says, we are always not working on something. In fact, whatever we are doing, we are by definition not working on everything else. For Graham, the issue is not how to stop procrastinating, since we will always be not working on something, and thus procrastinating. Instead, our real challenge is to figure out how to procrastinate well—how to work on something that is more important than the something we are not working on. In thinking about procrastination, Graham says what matters most is comparing what we are working on with what we aren’t.

But if we are working on something important, then does it really make sense to judge us negatively for not working on something less important? If we put off errands because we are trying to cure cancer, are we really procrastinating? And if that is the meaning of procrastination, why is it so bad? For Paul Graham, procrastination is all about trade-offs. We are constantly trading off what we are doing now against what we might do in the future. As long as we are doing that in a reasonable way, it doesn’t matter that we are putting some things off. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2262))

- By structured procrastination Perry means that we should structure, or plan, which items on our to-do list are the best candidates for being put off. He says structured procrastination can “convert procrastinators into effective human beings, respected and admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of time.” As Perry explains it: All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, such as gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they find the time. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because accomplishing these tasks is a way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him to do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely, and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important. Perry’s advice is, first, to make a list of the things you have to do. Put a few important tasks at the top—these are the ones you will procrastinate. Then, below them, list some tasks that aren’t as important but that you nevertheless need to do. According to Perry, doing these less important tasks “becomes a way of not doing the things higher on the list.” Perry says that procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack: They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this approach ignores the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be, by definition, the most important. And the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is the way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being. Perry admits there is a potential problem with the important tasks at the top of the list, because we aren’t going to do them. So we have to fool ourselves—first by inflating the importance of the top items, and then by pretending that the lower-down items aren’t as important. Perry puts finishing an essay for a volume on the philosophy of language at the top, along with the book-order forms for his next semester’s classes. He finished his essay on procrastination long before the one on the philosophy of language, and before he had completed the book orders.62 ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2272))

He didn’t know what to do, or even where to begin: “My real problem was I didn’t know how to send it without wasting my whole day. This was India. It wasn’t the United States.” When I asked Akerlof how important he thought the contents of the box were to Stiglitz, he told me, “Imagine the least practical clothes in the world—well, it was worse than that. There was a wedding costume from Nepal, for example. He didn’t need these clothes right away. If Joe never saw the box again, it would have been a positive in his life.” In other words, Akerlof’s immediate cost from sending the box, hanging around an Indian post office all day dealing with the bureaucracy, would have been significant. And there really wasn’t much of a benefit to Stiglitz from receiving the box any sooner than eight months after he left India. As a young, untenured economics professor, Stiglitz probably wasn’t planning to wear a Nepali wedding costume very often anyway. So Akerlof’s procrastination wasn’t so irrational after all. He didn’t suffer from self-control problems or impatience generally. He felt bad about not sending the box—we often feel bad about not doing things—but his behavior didn’t suggest that his short-term discount rate was too high. The cost of sending the box was high, and the benefit was low. The box was like one of Paul Graham’s… ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2293))

- These successful financial professionals are a diverse group, but they share one important characteristic: they are focused on the long term. Their investment horizon extends to years or even decades. They are capable of moving quickly, but they understand how to avoid dangerous short-term impulses.5 They can do what some financial executives call “seeing around corners.” They would never pick stocks during a lightning round. They do not respond to, or even watch, Mad Money. Warren Buffett says one key to his success as an investor has been delaying decisions. He likens buying stocks to hitting a baseball—except without the strikes: “I call investing the greatest business in the world because you never have to swing. You stand at the plate, the pitcher throws you General Motors at 47! US Steel at 39! And nobody calls a strike on you. There’s no penalty except opportunity lost. All day you wait for the pitch you like; then when the fielders are asleep, you step up and hit it.”6 As Buffett puts it, “We don’t get paid for activity, just for being right. As to how long we’ll wait, we’ll wait indefinitely.” ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2359))

- Although Gawande is focused on the benefits of routinizing the straightforward parts of surgery, and he does not explicitly argue about delay, one of the overlooked reasons why checklists are so useful and important is that they force us to pause. A checklist adds a speed bump before a task, to force surgeons or builders or airline pilots or investors to stop and think through what they are about to do before they do it. A checklist is an example of how skilled professionals move back and forth between thinking about the present and the future. Atul Gawande’s surgery checklist includes three “pause points”: before anesthesia, before incision, and before leaving the operating room. Each pause is designed to last no more than a minute—just long enough for members of the team to make basic checks (confirm the patient’s identity at the beginning; check for all the needles and sponges at the end). It might not seem like something as simple as making sure everyone on the surgery team introduces themselves by name and role would matter. But the results are striking: even taking just a few extra seconds before the incision helps to slow down the tempo of a surgical procedure, and that slower tempo leads to better outcomes.

- Much human behavior is based on “clock time,” which divides our day into quantifiable units, measured by an objective clock. In clock time, those units dictate when tasks begin and end.1 Some of clock time is based on nature, but much of it is fabricated. A day is a natural length of time, determined by the rotation of the earth, and the rising and setting of the sun understandably drove our ancestors’ living patterns, particularly in farming. The cycle of a day is physical and biological, and early calendars naturally followed days. Then, imprecisely, calendars evolved to include months and years, with leap periods added here and there to keep the whole thing roughly in line with the annual cycle of the seasons and the earth’s orbit around the sun.

- But the hour, sixty minutes, is an entirely arbitrary unit of time. It is an unnatural fraction of a day, a legacy of Babylonian culture, which was built around a base of sixty (sixty seconds in a minute; sixty minutes in an hour), and then of the Egyptians’ derivative preference for counting in base twelve. If our ancestors had used base ten, as we do, an “hour” would be 20 percent longer (one-twentieth of a day instead of one-twenty-fourth). Yet the ancient practice of dividing up twelve hours of daytime and twelve hours of night has become the fundamental way we slice up our days. Clocks depict hours and fractions of hours. The hour is the time unit we use to schedule meetings and lunches and soccer practices. The hour is so fundamental to our daily lives that, if it didn’t exist, we would have to invent it.

- Technology also has allowed more of our personal lives to merge into work time. We spend more time at leisure, social planning, and Internet surfing during the workday. A generation ago we spent forty hours a week working; today we spend fifty hours a week “working,” but only thirty of those hours on our actual job. Commuting also has lengthened the average workday. Long commutes are bad for all sorts of obvious reasons—traffic, fuel, stress, accidents, and distance from family. Studies show that our commute generally is the worst part of our day, and that a longer commute make us less happy, even if it helps us make more money.8 Commuting also makes people feel locked into the workplace, so they stay at work longer even if they don’t work more. One recent study found that, for every hour of commuting, people spend an extra thirty-five minutes at work.9 Some of these changes are difficult to control: if your boss doesn’t leave work until 8:00 PM, you might feel obligated to stay late as well, or you might take on a longer commute if that is the only way you can afford to buy a house.

- As shorter-term clock time comes to dominate our work and the pay gap widens, there are two potentially serious consequences. First, for many people, work becomes less satisfying overall. Ideally, at the end of our lives we want to be able to look back on our accomplishments as events that followed a long arc; we derive satisfaction from seeing that some of the seeds planted early in our careers have grown and matured. If we are motivated to accomplish something important in our work, we will be willing to wait decades and understand that the jobs we start might not be finished until long after we are gone. Hourly pay and annual bonuses eat away at this philosophy and ultimately make work less fulfilling. The second risk is that the accelerating pace of technology and the relentless ticking of the clock will make companies less profitable over the long term. As companies manage to the media cycle—not just for quarterly and annual disclosures of financial information but for more frequent product releases, daily blogs and website updates, and nearly continuous reactions to customers—employees inevitably think and act at a faster pace. As we saw with master professionals, quick responses are important and useful, but so is strategic perspective. Workers who are accustomed to instant gratification and continuous access to information expect major advances to come quickly. But what if that doesn’t happen? What if the most important engines of economic growth run at a much slower pace than modern life? There is a familiar story about innovation that you probably have heard in some version. It has been referenced in numerous business books and studies.* I even saw it recently in one of my daughter’s sixth-grade textbooks. Yet although this story is told frequently, it is almost always inaccurate and incomplete, often so much so that we are led to precisely the wrong conclusions about innovation. This story is such a classic and has become such a part of business lore that we should get it right once and for all, with every colorful detail.

- We like eureka stories. Popular lore is filled with this kind of thing. One warm evening, Isaac Newton is sitting under an apple tree in his garden when an apple falls and bonks him on the head; he instantly discovers gravity.9 Thomas Edison is staying up all night at Menlo Park, frantically experimenting, when suddenly he creates a new lightbulb that glows continuously for thirteen-and-a-half hours.10 Tim Berners-Lee is helping some scientists share data when out of the blue an idea hits him and he invents the World Wide Web.11 But these stories are rarely accurate. Newton had been working on the problem of gravity for years, and neither he nor his biographer said an apple hit him on the head. The first incandescent bulb was invented seventy-five years before Edison’s innovation, which was not the bulb itself, but a filament made of bamboo. Tim Berners-Lee mocks the notion that he suddenly discovered the Internet, as if he “just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web.”12 The most important innovations of modern times—the automobile, camera, computer, cotton gin, lightbulb, penicillin, sewing machine, steam engine, telephone, television—were not ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2840))

- overnight epiphanies. They took decades or longer to invent and develop. And although the cycles are getting faster, the most dramatic innovations of the modern era—from Apple, Google, and Facebook—have taken years. In most cases these innovations began not when the inventors and entrepreneurs first began seeing and pushing their big ideas, but when they were children, building the creative base for their later insights. In his brilliant book Where Good Ideas Come From, Steven Johnson shows that important discoveries typically do not come from calculated judgments. They cannot be forced out by rigorous analysis. Instead, intuition plays a central role in these discoveries. But the form of intuition is slow, not snap. As Johnson concludes, “The snap judgments of intuition—as powerful as they can be—are rarities in the history of world-changing ideas.”13 Johnson describes innovative ideas the same way Art Fry and Spence Silver talk about the big ideas at Minnesota Mining: “They start with a vague, hard-to-describe sense that there’s an interesting solution to a problem that hasn’t yet been proposed, and they linger in the shadows of the mind, sometimes for decades, assembling ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2850))

Scientific innovators at work are similar in kind to fireground commanders at a burning house, or chess masters “chunking” the location of game pieces—except that they are several million times slower. New technological insights emerge almost magically from our unconscious processing or even while we are asleep, but they do so at a glacial pace.15 Steven Johnson has the perfect term for this kind of gradual intuition. He calls it the “slow hunch.” ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2859))

- grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility and to encourage men and women to exercise their initiative. This requires considerable tolerance. Those men and women, to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way. Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs. Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And it’s essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.

- The word Einstellung means “attitude” in German. The Einstellung effect refers to our tendency to become stuck in our ways, to act or think in the same manner we’ve always acted or thought, even when we are presented with alternatives that are obviously better. The best innovators—people like Art Fry and Spence Silver, or Newton and Edison, or Steve Jobs—are skilled at overcoming the Einstellung effect. They follow the old Apple Computer slogan and “think different.” They do not develop an attitude. To see how the Einstellung effect matters to innovation, and to help finish the story of the sticky bookmark, we are going to revisit Peter McLeod, the neuroscientist ([Location 2903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2903))

- from Oxford who showed us how the best cricket batsmen delay hitting the ball until the last split-second. McLeod (who, incidentally, is a terrible procrastinator) and two other scientists, Merim Bilalíc and Fernand Gobet, have been quantifying how the Einstellung effect arises when we make decisions, even when we are experts.22 Their conclusions are important for virtually every area of new discovery, from science to politics to business. But they start with chess. McLeod and his colleagues set up a chessboard with a three-move solution to checkmate that is counterintuitive and requires innovative thinking. Most of us would never see these moves on our own. The solution involves moving your queen three times: first, to force your opponent’s king into the corner; then to a spot where a pawn has been positioned to take your queen but cannot do so with the king in the corner because doing so would expose the cornered king to check from your bishop near the opposite corner; and then finally, to take a pawn and put the king in check. Three-move Checkmate Only The three-move checkmate begins with ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2908))

- the white queen moving up to e6 to put the black king in check. When the black king moves to the corner to escape check (it can’t move to f8, because then the white knight would take the pawn at h7: checkmate), the white queen moves to h6. Black can’t take the white queen with its pawn, because that would open the black king to white’s bishop. At this point, black is done: no matter what it does, the white queen will be able to take one of… ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2917))

- Then the white knight moves to f7, putting the king in check. The black king has no choice but to move back to g8, its original position. Now the white knight moves to h6, again exposing the black king to check from the white queen. When the black king retreats back to the corner, the white queen attacks the black king by moving right next to it. The black rook is forced to take the queen, leaving the king trapped, or “smothered,” by its own piece. Finally, the white knight moves back to f7 for checkmate (1. Qe6+ Kh8 2. Nf7+ Kg8 3. Nh6++ Kh8 4. Qg8+ Rxg8 5. Nf7 mate). Both the three-move and five-move checkmates are available in the second diagram, immediately above. But the five-move checkmate doesn’t work in the first diagram, because the black bishop is covering f7, preventing the white knight from moving there. Most of us wouldn’t see this five-move solution either (it’s a version of “smothered mate,” where the king becomes trapped by its own pieces). But for master-level players, the five-move solution is a familiar tried-and-true strategy. They know those five moves cold.… ([Location 2927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2927))

- level players saw it. And even among the most highly skilled players, at the level of international master, only half figured out the three-move solution. There’s something stranger still: even after McLeod moved the pieces back to the original setup, the experts who hadn’t seen the three-move solution continued to have trouble seeing it—even though the five-move solution was no longer available. The distorting effects of seeing the familiar solution lived on, like a ghost haunting their ability to find anything new. These experts eventually found the three-move solution, but it took them more than twice as long as the experts who had never seen the five-move solution. The players who had seen it became stuck in their ways. We normally think of chess as rewarding creative genius. It requires tremendous brainpower and innovative thinking. Yet even chess masters are vulnerable to the Einstellung effect when they are exposed to familiar situations. The five-move checkmate was a well-worn path, like a predictable task at work. When chess experts saw that solution, they instinctively knew what they were looking at—they had seen this game before. And that effect, that attitude, persevered, even when they were put in a new situation. McLeod concluded that the Einstellung effect exerts a constant influence: it “continues to distract experts even when it is removed.”23 The challenge for innovation is that the Einstellung effect persists even when we believe we are doing everything in our power to avoid it. The experts told McLeod they were looking all around the board. They insisted they were examining every possible piece and move, trying to spot a new, creative solution. They truly believed they were looking for an innovative checkmate. But McLeod is a skeptic, like Stephen Porges, the psychiatrist who studies how heart rate variability is related to emotional well-being.

- move solution dwelled on the squares and pieces relevant to that strategy. They didn’t look at the squares involved in the three-move solution, even though they claimed that they did. McLeod and his colleagues concluded that the “eye movement data demonstrate how a pattern of thought, once activated, can prevent other patterns of thought becoming active.”24 These brilliant chess masters believed they were looking everywhere, not just at the tried-and-true squares on the chessboard. They insisted they were doing their best to be creative and open-minded. But their eyes weren’t moving. There are two ways to defend against the Einstellung effect in order to protect our fragile creatures of innovation. One is to avoid known, comfortable situations, or at least to be acutely aware of their potential drawbacks. This is why many organizations, including successful technology firms and the most innovative parts of government, require that employees switch jobs every couple of years. It is why they fund pure research and development, why they insulate some groups of employees from the short-term pressure of quarterly profits, and why they encourage workers to spend 15 percent of their time on something new. The goal is to push employees out of their comfort… ([Location 2954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2954))

It is why diversity has become so popular, not just as social policy, but for business innovation. It is why so many new businesses have open-architecture offices—so employees will be frequently exposed to others with a different perspective.

- of years. Today, many smart business leaders protect against the dangers of the Einstellung effect, even if they haven’t heard of it, by using a similarly fast-and-slow approach. Some technology companies host “hackathons,” periodic one- or two-day breaks from normal work life where employees gather to develop new ideas or products. A hackathon combines focus on the short term and the long term: the event itself is brief, but it can be preceded by several months of anticipation and followed by several months of reaction. Hackathons help a company’s engineers and programmers see better alternatives and possibly major new innovations. The idea for Twitter, for example, came from a hackathon. Likewise, some online retailers harness the power of the Internet to avoid what Keynes called the ramification of old ideas. Shop It To Me, the popular free online personal shopper, takes suggestions from customers and runs experiments in real time, tweaking its website and emails continuously to see which features customers prefer. Would you use a new filter that sends you information about a particular Diane von Furstenberg dress immediately when it goes on sale? Would you like to set a maximum price or minimum discount? When do you want to receive notifications? The company runs quick experiments, some lasting just a few minutes, so they can precisely test the effects of one change in isolation. It also tests the exact opposite of what customers say they want. If you request more search filters, the company might let you try more filters, but also test what you do with fewer filters. Shop It To Me’s employees have discovered that when we say we want X, we really might want Y. By assessing the data from these quick experiments over much longer periods of months or even years, they get a much more complete understanding… ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2973))

- bosses scribbled back. They passed along samples to other employees, who also wrote notes to themselves and others. Given Minnesota Mining’s open culture and environment, word spread. Fry started to see these little pieces of paper all over different offices around the firm, stuck on desks and calendars. Employees who had nothing to do with the development of the sticky notes saw the checkmate Fry hadn’t spotted before. For years he and Silver had seen only the sticky bookmark. Finally, with the help of his colleagues and their own humility, a new product emerged. As Fry explains, “It wasn’t a bookmark at all, but a note. This was the insight. It was a whole new concept in pressure-sensitive adhesives. It was like moving from the outer ring of the target to the bull’s eye.”27 It took several more years, but by 1977 Fry had persuaded his bosses that the sticky notes had enough potential to support some market research. They called them “Press ‘n’ Peel” and tested them with potential customers in four major cities. The results were lukewarm, however, and the idea sputtered again. The managers still saw them as bookmarks. Yet Fry persisted. Meanwhile, the staff at Minnesota Mining had become addicted to the sticky notes. They couldn’t get enough of Fry’s samples. At first, he gave out just one pad at a time, so he could keep track of how many notes people used. His data showed that within the company people were using between seven and twenty pads per year. Soon they were demanding even more. There were entire pallets of the sticky notes stacked up in the hallways. By comparison, the company’s customers used only about one roll per year of Magic Tape, a popular and hugely profitable product. Fry saw the potential of the sticky notes and refused to give up.28 After yet another year, Fry persuaded his bosses to try one last market research effort. They decided to distribute samples widely in one town, to see if they would catch on in the same way they had caught on within the firm. They selected Boise, Idaho, and doled out the sticky notes throughout the city in what they called the “Boise blitz.” By now Fry and his colleagues had refined them. The sticky notes were small and yellow. They had just the right size and feel. The… ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008O5AQBG&location=2993))

- free time policy with its own 20 percent “innovation time off” program, which was the source of as many as half of its newly launched products in a given year, including Gmail, Google News, and Google Earth.29 But in late 2011 Google abandoned that program (though it continues to fund new ideas through a cutting-edge research arm). Other companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, have imposed limits on their free time policies. Johnson says, “Part of the secret to having great ideas lies in creating a working environment where those fragments are nurtured and sustained over time. This obviously poses some difficulty in modern work environments, with deadlines and quarterly reports and annual job reviews.”30 Not many CEOs appreciate learning that an employee has a hunch about a product that will not generate profits, if at all, for more than a decade. Yet Minnesota Mining once had just that kind of visionary leadership. In 2001, in the aftermath of the collapse of Enron, Minnesota Mining hired as its new leader James McNerney, an executive at General Electric who had lost the competition to replace Jack Welch as GE’s CEO. McNerney was by all accounts an accomplished professional manager, but he was not a scientist.
