## Highlights
- There are four simple themes to this book.First, human nature never changes. Therefore, the stock market never changes. Only the faces, the pockets, the suckers and the manipulators, the wars, the disasters, and the technologies change. The market itself never changes. How can it? Human nature neverchanges, and human nature runs the market-not reason, not economics, and certainly not logic. It is our human emotions that drive the market, as they do most other things on this planet.Second, the achievement of material goals and career ambitions does not equal the achievement of happiness in life. There is no correlation between ([Location 45](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=45))

- success and happiness. There is no automatic balance between worldly riches and emotional fulfillment.Third, it is our will that allows each of us to accomplish our goals, not our intellect. Talent is not enough. Luck is not enough. Only the will to suffer hard work and incredible persistence leads to the attainment of the impossible. There are no shortcuts; there is no easy way. Especially, as you'll find out, in the stock market.Finally, it is the individual, not the group, that has led to the great discoveries of humanity. The great ideas, the great fortunes, and the giant steps forward in technology, politics, and medicine have all come from individuals, not groups.

- He was the most famous bear on Wall Street, a trader who was as likely to sell short as to buy long. He didn't care; he knew that stocks went down as often as they went up-but when theydeclined, they did it twice as fast as when they went up, and that was what was going on today.

- The action on the board would become one of the keys to his later success. He quickly learned that it was never what the brokers, or the customers, or the newspapers said-the only thing that was important was what the tape said. He also observed that the ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=312))

- tape's pronouncements very rarely matched what the brokers or the customers had predicted. The tape had a life of its own, and its was the most important life. Its verdict was final.He loved the actual physical job of writing the quotes on the chalkboard because he had a photographic memory when it came to numbers. His memory for numbers was perfect-the yelling of the quotes from the ticker could not come quick enough for Livermore. He never fell behind in posting the quotes, no matter how fast they came. They racked up in his brain like stacked cordwood.Eventually, he started to see repeating patterns come alive in the numbers. At night, alone in his room, he would write out the numbers for several issues from memory. He started keeping a numerical diary, and certain recurring numerical patterns emerged. He noticed that the numbers moved in consistent waves, often in smooth repeating trends. When the price of a stock started to go upward, or downward, it usually remained in that trend until some pressure caused it ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=313))

- to reverse. The clues to this action were often in the numerical patterns."Stocks act in line with the laws of physics," he thought. "A body in motion tends to stay in motion, until a force or obstacle stops or changes that motion." He kept logs tracking the stocks for longer periods, and then he had another revelation: There were patterns within the patterns, and even larger patterns emerged.He kept the diary in secret and discussed his observations with no one. He was secretive by nature. He had ultimate confidence in his mathematical ability, even at the age of 14. Besides, he was too busy posting the numbers and watching the action of the market on the chalkboard to engage in idle chatter during business hours.Because he was working the chalkboard-listening for the… ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=319))

- After six months of doing his job every day, eventually making a series of paper bets in his notebook and keeping track of them, he was still missing a crucial part of the equation, and he knew it. He had yet to buy his first stock. He knew that unless he actually purchased a stock, he could never know how he would handle himself. Like a gambler who has never made a wager, it was only talk and speculation until he slapped his money down. When a trader made a bet everything changed, and he knew it. Then and only then did the trader enter the heated jungle of emotions. He knew that he would always have his intellect under control, and it was a strong one. What he did not know was whether he could control his emotions.He had watched… ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=331))

- Arnold Rothstein, known in underworld circles as "the Brain," was a genius with money. He started out as a gambler, but after a fantastic string of successes, he became an underworld king and lived like it. He was accused of many crimes, among them fixing the 1919 "Black Sox" World Series. His fortune was vast. His financial tentacles reached into every vein of American vice.Among Rothstein's many holdings were most of the bucket shops in the major cities of the United States. A bucket shop looked like a broker's office. It had a gallery for the customers, a chalkboard to record the stock quotes, and an active stock ticker spewing out the daily trades on an almost instantaneous basis.… ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=343))

- have only 10 percent of the price of the stock they wanted to buy. The rules were simple: Put up 10 percent and make a bet by buying a stock. A ticket with the buy number would immediately be printed and given to the purchaser. This ticket would indicate the time, the price paid for the stock purchased, and the number of shares purchased. The purchaser would watch the quotes, and as soon as the stock lost 10percent of its value, the shop moved in and quickly swept away the money. Conversely, if the stock price went up and the trader won, the trader went up to a clerk who marked the ticket stub with the price of the last trade on the stock ticker. Then the trader went to the cage window to collect the money. It was a sucker's play-the house won 95 percent of the time.Most important for the functioning of the… ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=348))

- quick and fierce. Traders could buy as few as five shares or as many as the house could cover-thousands of dollars worth.Because Livermore had no capital, no stake, it was inevitable that he would enter the bucket shops, a world controlled by the crime bosses. It was only a matter of when and how.In 1892, when Livermore was 15 years old, his friend Billy, another board-crew kid, approached him. "Jesse, you got any money?""I'm eating my lunch.'"Never mind your lunch. You got any money?""Why?""I got a tip on Steel.

Billy asked."I'm reading my horoscope for today," Livermore answered. He checked the history of the trading figures on U.S. Steel in hisnotepad. The numbers were moving in the same pattern as they usually moved before the stock went up. He was satisfied they had a good chance. "Okay."He handed his friend the money. Two days later he smiled as he pocketed his winnings-a pure profit of more than $3. Livermore was in the game.

He always wanted to learn from his mistakes and thereby profit from those mistakes. There was no arguing with the tape. The tape was always right; it was the players who were wrong. He reviewed his bad trades, and the conclusions became clear to him.His first conclusion was that he won when all the factors were in his favor, when he was patient and waited for all the ducks to line up in a row.

- Beating the market was like alchemy-changing lead into gold. The market changed paper into gold and created fortunes beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The market was where $100 became $1,000, $1,000 became $1 million, and $1 million became $100 million. All the trader had to do was call the moves before they occurred-and, as with any great puzzle, the answer was always right there. All the trader had to do was figure it out.

- Modern usage has made the term speculator a synonym for gambler and plunger. Actually the word comes from the Latin speculari, which means to spy out and observe.I have defined a speculator as a man who observes the future and acts before it occurs. To be able to do this successfully-and it is an ability of priceless value in all human affairs-three things are necessary:First, one must get the facts of a situation or problem.Second, one must form a judgement as to what those facts portend.

- Third, one must act in time, before it is too late.I have heard many men talk intelligently-even brilliantly-about something only to see them proven powerless when it comes to acting on what they believe. If action is delayed until the need is apparent to everyone, it will be too late.To be evident to all, a danger must be on top of us and out of hand.My Own Story, Bernard Baruch ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=462))

- "Successful trading is always an emotional battle for the speculator, not an intellectual battle. It is only after a bet has been placed on a stock or a commodity, when the money has changed from cash in hand to stock certificates, that the emotions spring to life."

- These scallywags, in Livermore's mind, manifested on Wall Street as tipsters. They stood at the entrance to the great gold mine and sold their wares. These hucksters handed out tips to the uninitiated before the uninitiated even got a chance to dig for the gold themselves. An easy road to success is what they promised-hit the mother lode fast, with no work.Livermore noticed that the novices never asked the simple questions:• Why have you chosen me to receive this priceless advice?"• If you have this information, then why aren't you rich?• What is driving you to give me this advice to buy a stock? Are you secretly selling it to me at higher and higher prices?" ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=480))

- Livermore knew the basic laws of the market, as did everyone:• When you are wrong there is one thing that cannot be denied-you lose money.• When you are right, you make money.• Therefore, you are right only when you make money and wrong only when you lose it.

It was this advice that Livermore was later to cherish.He was now learning that before a play could be made, he first had to decide on the overall… ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=630))

Second-grade suckers or, as Livermore called them, semi-suckers, who get their information from suckers of an even higher grade.

- Livermore knew that bad news in a bull market climate takes a lot longer to sink in with the public than bad news in a bear market, when the climate is already negative. In fact, before the market closed, stocks had rebounded to their former levels. Livermore was short 5,000 shares, but he was flat on the trade. He had made no money.His friend had also returned to New York. "You ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=678))

You should have listened to me, J.L.," he said."Winds change," Livermore said, reading the ticker tape, not looking up.Livermore figured that even if the disaster proved not to be as bad as was originally thought, railroad stocks would not go up.The next day the news dribbled in from San Francisco and the market drifted down, but not drastically. Livermore was convincedhe was right. He went to his broker, got a special line of credit, and sold another 5,000 shares of Union Pacific short.The next day, the third day after the earthquake, the market tumbled. Union Pacific fell like a stone, and Livermore walked out of the wreckage with $250,000 in profit. He never figured out exactly why he did what he did in listening to his inner voice. It was one subject he did not analyze too deeply. He quietly slipped the cash into his account.

If the market went sideways, he would wait in cash for a clear direction to be established.He had no interest in finding a bargain or a cheap stock. He was not a bottom fisher.

He was known on the Street as the Boy Plunger, but plunging had not always served him well. He had been busted, broke, three times by the age of 30.He watched the most successful Wall Street traders in action. He observed that they were all good money managers, each with an individual approach. He knew he needed his own system.He now knew it was not whether the market or a stock would turn, but exactly when it would turn-timing was everything. But he also realized that no one could call or predict exactly when the market would turn or what a stock would do. So, Livermore developed his probing, or testing the market, approach.The strategy was simple: Do not plunge.

Suppose he paid $100 a share. If the price dropped after he made his first purchase, he would either close out the first position or wait-never taking a loss of more than 10 percent.He expected the stock price to rise. If it did, he would buy a second position of another 2,000 shares at, say, $101 per share. He would then be in profit.If the stock continued to rise, he would take a third position of 2,000 shares at, say, $104.At this point he would own 6,000… ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=727))

- stock was moving in the right direction.Now he would wait for a further move and a correction. For example, suppose the stock moved from $100 to $112, then had a normal correction down to $104 dollars, the spot where he had made his last purchase.If the stock moved up from this price of $104, Livermore would make his final purchase of 4,000 shares at, say, $106, giving him an average price of around $105 for the total position of 10,000 shares.To put it another way: Livermore would establish 20 percent of his planned position on the first purchase, 20 percent on the second position, and 20 percent on the third position. He would wait for a confirmation and then take his final position of 40 percent.He considered each of these purchases to be a crucial stage… ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001C4TENM&location=733))
