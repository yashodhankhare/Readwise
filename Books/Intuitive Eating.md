## Highlights
- Humans are privileged to experience a dynamic interplay of instinct, emotion, and thought, which work together to orchestrate life, and are mediated by the brain. Psychiatrist and mindfulness expert Daniel Siegel, MD, calls this process “Mindsight.” There are three regions of the brain responsible for this powerful integration. The first region is called the reptilian brain, because when the early reptiles roamed the Earth, they acted and responded exclusively by instinct. They didn’t rationalize or feel—they simply went for it. As life evolved, another level of brain function developed, called the limbic brain, which mammals also possess. Emotions and social behaviors originate here. In the limbic brain, feelings are layered upon the instincts of the reptilian brain. The instincts originating from the reptilian brain are sent to the limbic brain, which serves to expand awareness (Levine 1997). Eventually, the third key region of the brain, called the rational brain, or the neo-cortex, evolved. The rational brain integrates instincts and feelings from the other two brain regions. The rational brain does not control instincts—instead, it perceives the instinctual and feeling parts of our beings and reflects upon them. The rational brain creates thoughts and language.

- Intuitive Eating is truly about trusting that you will be able to access all of the information you need, by using all aspects of your brain—your reptilian instincts, your limbic connection with your emotions, and your rational thoughts.

- The Intuitive Eating principles work by either increasing interoceptive awareness, or by removing the obstacles to this “superpower.” The obstacles usually arise from the mind in the form of rules, beliefs, and thoughts.

- Yet in spite of the fact that up to 95 percent of all diets fail, you tend to blame yourself, not the diet! Isn’t it ironic that with a massive failure rate for dieting we don’t blame the process of dieting? ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=174))

- The failure of dieting is that it promotes weight stigma by not recognizing that people come in all sizes and shapes and that each individual is worthy just as they are. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=179))

- The problem is that any focus on weight loss will sabotage your ability to reconnect with your body’s Intuitive Eating signals. When you focus on weight, it places your attention on external measures for eating—such as the portions of foods, the macros of food—rather than connecting you with your internal cues. (That’s why we like to say that ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=239))

- Intuitive Eating is an inside job.) Instead, focusing on your day-to-day progress—such as getting more satisfaction from your meals and staying more present in eating and life—will give you a sense of connection, which can lead to feelings of joy and well-being.

- Sandra had hit diet bottom. By now, however, she was more obsessed with food and her body than ever. She felt silly. “I should have had this dealt with and controlled long ago.” What she didn’t realize was that it was the exposure to weight stigma, the idea that her body was not okay, and the process of dieting to “fix” it, that had done this to her. Dieting had made her more preoccupied with food. Dieting had made food the enemy. Dieting had made her feel guilty when she wasn’t eating diet types of foods (even when she wasn’t officially dieting). Dieting had turned on her body’s defense mechanism to thwart the self-induced famine by slowing her metabolism.

- Sluggish metabolism. Each diet teaches the body to adapt better for the next self-imposed famine (another diet). Metabolism slows as the body efficiently utilizes each calorie as if it’s the last. The more drastic the diet, the more it pushes the body into the calorie-pinching survival mode. This effect made headline news when a study on Biggest Loser contestants found that six years later, their metabolism was still blunted by an average of 700 calories per day. Worse yet, their muscle mass was lower than their baseline by over ten pounds (Fothergill et al. 2016). Fueling metabolism is like ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=676))

- stoking a fire. Remove the wood, and the fire diminishes. Similarly, to fuel metabolism, we must eat a sufficient amount of calories, or our bodies will compensate and slow down. Part of that compensation is that the body will cannibalize its own muscle tissue to use as an energy source (as it has the ability to convert amino acids from the muscle protein into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis).

- Although Sandra felt she could never diet again, she still engaged in the Last Supper phenomenon. (We regularly encounter this when we see someone for the first time.) She literally ate higher quantities of food than usual and ate plenty of her favorite foods (she thought she would never see these foods again). It was as if she were getting ready for a long trip and was packing extra clothes. Just the thought of working on her food issues put her into the pre-diet mentality, a common occurrence.

- There is a body of research that shows that food restriction for the purpose of weight loss is not effective in the long run, not sustainable, and moreover causes harm—even if it’s prescribed by a physician or dietitian! In spite of this research, weight loss continues to be prescribed. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=717))

- This is a modern-day Semmelweis reflex, which is the rejection of new evidence because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms. This cultural reflex is named after the physician who discovered that patients’ lives could be saved if doctors washed their hands. But Dr. Semmelweis was summarily dismissed and scoffed at by his medical colleagues for his preposterous idea! He was later proven right, after his death.

Sadly, we have heard women contemplate in our offices that they too have considered taking up smoking or vaping on e-cigarettes as a weight loss aid.

- Health has become synonymous with weight—losing weight or being lean, which ultimately restricts what you eat. The key will be shifting the focus to the practices that support health that are possible in a given person’s life. Weight is not a practice or a behavior. Health is not a moral imperative or a requirement for being treated with dignity and respect. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=820))

- In order to honor your fullness, you need to trust that you will give yourself the foods that you desire. Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry and observe the signs that show that you’re comfortably full. Pause in the middle of eating and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what your current hunger level is. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1231))

- Before becoming Intuitive Eaters, Marsha, Lisa, and Cynthia were coping with the problems of their lives by using food as a distracter, comforter, and calmer. But they soon learned to savor the foods they had chosen, eat in an inviting environment, and honor their biological hungers. Increased gratifying eating experiences allowed each to let go of using food as a coping mechanism. These experiences also offered clarity—it was easier to distinguish an eating urge from an emotional urge. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1262))

- These women discovered that food never tasted as good or was as satisfying when they weren’t really hungry or hadn’t figured out what they really wanted to eat or when they bolted the food down without respecting fullness. Marsha, Lisa, and Cynthia found coping mechanisms and appropriate outlets for their emotions. Now they save their eating for the times it gives them true satisfaction and are in tune with the quantities of food their bodies need.

- Consider this scenario: You are on a hiking trail and encounter a fork in the road that is hard to decipher with your trail map. Do you go to the right or left? You ponder for a while and decide to go left. While walking, you spot something you’ve never seen before, a bright-green caterpillar shimmying up a purple flower. A few steps ahead, you discover an unusual bird. But a few steps beyond these glories of nature is a big boulder signaling that you chose the wrong path. You turn around, go back to the fork, and take the other path. Was this detour a waste of time? No! Similarly, on the path to Intuitive Eating, you will take many turns and experiment with new thoughts and behaviors. You may even find that after making noticeable progress, you go back to old ways that are uncomfortable and unfulfilling. But like taking the “wrong” ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1334))

- path on the scenic hiking trail, you’ll discover that excursions into old eating patterns can be used as learning experiences. (Most hikers would not chide themselves for being unsure of which path to take; instead, they’d be grateful for the discoveries of nature that a blocked path offered.) It’s important to be kind to yourself and appreciate the learning that comes out of the experience. This process involves coming from a place of curiosity rather than a place of judgment, so whatever you do, don’t beat yourself up mentally!

- The road to Intuitive Eating is like investing in a long-term mutual fund. Over time, there will be a return on the investment, in spite of the daily fluctuations of the stock market. It is normal and expected. How ironic that we have been taught that, in economics, the day-to-day changes in the stock market are normal, and seldom is there a get-rich-quick fix, yet, in the multibillion-dollar-a-year weight loss business, “get thin fast” is the only goal for success. We are invested, instead, in helping you bring peace to your relationship with food and body. You will receive more satisfaction from eating and feel more in tune with your body’s signals. On the path to this goal, keep in mind Webster’s definitions of “process”: “a continuing development involving many changes” and “a particular method of doing something, generally involving a number of steps or operations.” ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1348))

- “Willpower” can be defined as an attempt to counter natural desires and replace them with proscriptive rules. It also implies the ability to do unpleasant tasks that are not essential. The desire for sweets is natural, normal, and quite pleasant! Any diet that tells you that you can’t have sweets is going against your natural desire. The diet becomes a set of rigid rules, and these kinds of rules can only trigger rebellion. Willpower does not belong in Intuitive Eating. As Marilyn became an Intuitive Eater, she found that listening to her personal signals reinforced her natural instincts, rather than countering them. She had no one else’s proscriptive rules to follow or to rebel against. Marilyn has stopped fighting the phantom willpower battle and has made peace with food and her body.

- In physics, resistance always occurs as a reaction to force. We see this principle in action in society—riots often erupt when the force of authority becomes too great. Similarly, the simple act of being told what to do (even if it’s something you want to do), can trigger a rebellious chain reaction. Just like “terrible two-year-olds” or teenagers who revolt to prove they are independent, dieters can initiate rebellious eating in response to the act of dieting, with its set of rigid rules. And so, it’s not surprising to hear from our clients that breaking the rules of a diet makes them feel just like they did when they were defiant teens. But take heart: rebellion is a normal act of self-preservation—protecting your space, or personal boundaries.

- When a pound is not a pound. Many factors can influence the number on the scale, so deifying the scale to give you the power to feel good or bad about yourself is falling prey to the influence of false facts. The number on the scale is affected by water retention or release of water. Anytime the scale suddenly rises or falls, it is usually because of a fluid shift in the body. Many factors can influence fluid retention—hormones, excessive sodium intake, and even the weather! Yet how easily chronic dieters believe they did something wrong. Conversely, a rapid drop on the scale immediately after an hour of aerobics is mostly water loss from sweat. Also, muscle is made up of mainly water (70 percent). When a hungry body is not given enough calories, the body cannibalizes itself for an energy source. The prime directive of the body is that it must have energy, at any cost—it’s part of the survival mechanism. The protein in muscles is converted to valuable energy for the body. When a muscle cell is destroyed, water is released and eventually excreted. The whittled-away muscle ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1790))

- Muscles are metabolically active tissue—generally the more muscle we have, the higher our metabolic rate. That’s one of the reasons men burn more calories than women—they have more muscle mass. Increased muscle mass, while metabolically more active, weighs more than fat. A chronic dieter often gets frustrated by the rising, or unchanging, number on the scale. The scale does not reflect body composition—just like weighing a piece of steak at the butcher’s does not tell you how lean the meat is. Weighing in on the scale only serves to keep you focused on your weight; it doesn’t help with the process of getting back in touch with Intuitive Eating. Constant weigh-ins can leave you frustrated and impede your progress. Best bet: let go of weighing yourself. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1798))

- Whether or not you are a chronic dieter, powerful biological mechanisms are triggered when your body does not get the energy from food that it needs. It’s no accident that food is included as one of the fundamental needs in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs—a model that ranks human needs, suggesting that certain basic needs must be met before you can go on to fulfill more complex ones. Food and energy are so essential to the survival of the human species that if we don’t eat enough we set off a biological fuse that turns on our eating drive, both physically and psychologically. The hunger drive is truly a mind-body connection. Eating is so important that the nerve cells of appetite are located in the hypothalamus region of the brain. A variety of biological signals triggers eating. What many people believe to be an issue of willpower is instead a biological drive. The power and intensity of the biological eating drive should not be underestimated. The neurochemicals from the brain coordinate our eating behavior with our body’s biological need. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1951))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Through a complex system of chemical and neural feedback, the brain monitors the energy needs of all our body systems, moment to moment. And it makes very emphatic chemical directives as to what we should eat. Fasting or restricting is particularly counterproductive to appetite. It simply turns on the neurochemical switches that induce us to eat. Many studies have shown that dieting makes no sense metabolically or to our brain chemistry. In fact, it’s counterproductive. The biological chemicals that regulate appetite also directly affect moods and state of mind, our physical energy, and our sex lives. Most researchers agree that there are both complex biological and psychological mechanisms that influence our eating. In this chapter, we will focus on the profound biological mechanisms that turn on our desire to eat, especially if we have been food-deprived or dieting: Heightened Digestion In food-deprived individuals, research has shown, the body gets biologically primed for the moment of eating, like a sprinter crouched in a ready position for an explosive start, the moment the starting pistol is triggered. •  Salivation increases with increases of food deprivation, even when there is no food present or suggestion of eating! This has been demonstrated in studies both on dieters and normal (nondieting) individuals. •  Increased digestive hormones have been found in dieters both before and after eating. The Carbohydrate Craver: Neuropeptide Y Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a chemical produced by the brain that triggers our drive to eat carbohydrates, the body’s primary and preferred source of energy. While most of what we know about NPY comes from research on rats, there is a lot of evidence that shows that this brain chemical can have a profound impact on human eating behavior as well, by increasing both the size and duration of carbohydrate-rich meals.

- Food deprivation or undereating intake drives NPY into action, causing the body to seek more carbohydrates. When the next meal or eating opportunity rolls around, it can easily turn into a high-carbohydrate binge—not because you lack willpower or are out of control; it’s your biology (rather NPY) screaming, “Feed me.” NPY is revved up after any imposed period of food deprivation, including an overnight fast from dinner to breakfast. NPY’s levels are naturally the highest in the morning because of the short-term food deprivation from an overnight fast. The elevated NPY levels are part of the biological basis for eating in the morning! During an overnight fast, your body’s stores of carbohydrates (in the liver) are drained and need refilling. You literally wake up on empty in the morning. But if you skip breakfast, you are likely to pay for it with increases in NPY level, which can… ([Location 1976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=1976))

- we eat more carbohydrates, it helps to increase the production of serotonin, which in turn shuts off the production of NPY and puts a halt to the desire for carbohydrates. The more you deny your true hunger and fight your natural biology, the stronger and more intense food cravings and obsessions become. Fasting or restricting especially revs up the NPY and drives the body to seek more carbohydrates. So, by the time the next eating opportunity occurs, it can easily become a high-carbohydrate binge.

- One reason people lose weight so quickly on low-carbohydrate or fasting diets is that they are devouring their own protein tissues as fuel. Also, with each pound of body protein, three or four pounds of associated water are lost. If your body were to continue to consume itself at this rate, death would occur within about ten days. Even the vital heart muscle is burned as fuel. Sadly, this is part of the reason that people on low calorie diets have died—because of cardiac wasting. Even when the heart muscle is deteriorating, it still has to keep up the same amount of work, with less power and at a slower heart rate. In essence the cannibalized heart muscle has to work harder with a smaller, faulty engine; pumping performance is not reduced in proportion to the amount of heart tissue lost. Eventually, the body can convert stored fat to a usable energy form for the brain and nervous ([Location 2011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2011))

- The first step to reclaiming the world of normal eating, free of dieting and food worry, is to honor your biological hunger. Your body needs to know consistently that it will have access to food—that dieting and deprivation have halted, once and for all. Otherwise, your biology will always be on call, ready to avert a self-imposed food deprivation. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2064))

- The ebb and flow of your hunger might not match other people’s—that’s okay; it’s individual. Take care not to get overly hungry or ravenous. If this is difficult for you to gauge, a general guideline is to go no longer than five waking hours without eating. This is based on the biology of fueling up your carbohydrate tank in the liver, which runs out every three to six hours. We have observed that clients who go longer than five hours without eating tend to overeat at the next eating opportunity. (For some people, this can happen even after three or four hours without eating.) ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2109))

- Emotional hunger. Once you are truly able to identify and distinguish biological hunger, it becomes easier to clarify why you want to eat. It is not unusual for a number of our clients to eat because of emotional hunger—to quench uncomfortable feelings (such as loneliness, boredom, or anger). Ironically, many of our patients are often amazed that what they assumed to be emotional eating was, in many instances, primal hunger eating. But the out-of-control feeling of eating is nearly identical, whether it was triggered emotionally, biologically, or as a result of cognitive distortion.

- Why would Biosphere scientists or the healthy men in the Minnesota Starvation study (described in the previous chapter) exhibit behaviors so unlike their normal eating patterns? Deprivation. These people had not been tainted by the dieting trap, yet their reactions to deprivation were virtually identical to those of dieters. While you have already seen the effects of biological deprivation in the last chapter, you should not underestimate the effect of deprivation psychologically. This effect is the focus of this chapter. ([Location 2196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2196))

- Psychologist Fritz Heider states that depriving yourself of something you want can actually heighten your desire for that very item. The moment you banish a food, it paradoxically builds up a “craving life” of its own that gets stronger with each diet and builds more momentum as the deprivation deepens. Deprivation is a powerful experience both biologically and psychologically. You already saw in the last chapter how food deprivation sets off a biological drive. Psychological forces wreak havoc with your peace of mind, triggering cravings, obsessive thoughts, and even compulsive behaviors.

- If deprivation backlash is so powerful, how do dieters actually diet at all? Aren’t the biological and psychological forces too compelling? Chronic dieters adapt by changing both their mindset and their responsiveness to inner body cues. This adaptation is known as restrained eating. Unfortunately, these changes work against them. In the long run, deprivation backlash still prevails. Restrained eaters, in essence, are chronic dieters who are preoccupied with dieting and weight control. To stay in control with their food, restrained eaters set up rules that dictate how they should eat, rather than listening to their bodies. Forget honor your hunger; instead they calculate what to eat, choosing foods with their mental brakes on, and second-guessing the needs of their bodies. Their eating appears to be fine until one of their sacred rules is violated. When a rule is broken, so is their restraint—and, wham, overeating begins. This has been described as the what-the-hell effect by leading ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2297))

- compelling sense of guilt for most dieters. And as the guilt increases, so does the quantity of food intake. The more deprived you become from dieting and from specific foods, the greater the deprivation backlash. We see this all the time—we call it the seesaw syndrome. When it comes to dieting, feelings of deprivation and guilt work in an opposing manner; like two kids on a seesaw—“what goes up must come down.” When dieting, as you restrict foods that you enjoy eating, deprivation becomes higher and higher. Meanwhile, in tandem, guilty feelings go down—because you haven’t eaten any “bad” foods. But there’s a limit to how high the seesaw can climb. The level of deprivation rises to its highest point, where you can’t bear one more meal, let alone one more day ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2338))

Meanwhile, guilty feelings are at their lowest, because you have not eaten any forbidden foods; you’ve been “good.” Since you have no buildup of guilt, you’re wide open to allow some forbidden foods into your life and able to tolerate the beginning feelings of guilt that these foods engender.

Now the seesaw looks like the following diagram: At this point the syndrome repeats itself—up and down, up and down—every time you go from diet to binge, diet to binge.

- Also, research shows that people will tire of eating the same kind of food—it’s called habituation. Habituation studies have shown that the more a person is exposed to a particular food the less appealing it becomes. (See the sidebar “Habituation Response Explains Why Foods Become Less Enticing with Exposure.”) In fact, you may have already witnessed this type of eating in other people. For example, observe the all-you-can-eat buffet dining that is popular in vacation spots such as Las Vegas. On the first day, people typically load up their plates and grab three or four desserts. By the last day, however, they are choosing their food selectively. The novelty has worn off, and they know there is plenty of food.

You cannot have an experience through knowledge; rather, you need to go through it, bite by bite. Otherwise it would be like trying to learn how to play the guitar by reading a book on music theory. You may understand the components, but only after you practice and struggle with the strings personally will you truly know how to play. And the more you practice, the more confidence you will have.

Yes, make peace with food, and eat what pleases your palate. Yes, give yourself the freedom to eat unconditionally, and eat as much as you need to satisfy your body.

By identifying its strong presence in your mind, however, you will learn how to challenge its power and loosen its hold on you. Cyndi had a powerful Food Police voice that criticized every eating act. She woke up every morning praying for a “good” day, which meant eating only diet foods.

On some days her growling stomach would beg for more food—just adding a piece of toast. Cyndi would “cave in” and have a piece of dry rye toast, and her Food Police would shout, “Now you have to skip lunch or dinner.” When Cyndi was able to skip lunch, she’d get too hungry and find herself at the vending machine devouring whatever she could afford. Now, once she had officially broken her Food Police rule, she would reactively overeat the rest of the day.

- When working with dieters in our offices, we have seen over and over that there is actually a middle step between the initial dieting thought and the subsequent eating behavior. We have found that the inner dieting myths (which are cognitive distortions) lead to feeling bad when the self-imposed dieting rules are broken. This concept is widely accepted and well explained by Dr. Albert Ellis and Dr. Robert A. Harper, highly respected pioneers in the field of rational-emotive psychotherapy, a system of psychotherapy that deals with the effect of our thoughts on our feelings and then our behaviors. (An offshoot of this therapy is called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT.) According to Ellis and Harper, we routinely flood our heads with unrealistic and sometimes absurd notions as well as sane and rational messages. These thought processes are called internalized sentences, or self-talk. Negative self-talk often ([Location 2871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2871))

When we feel better, we’ll act better. In a review of hundreds of research studies of this type of therapy, it has been shown that if we can first change our beliefs, our feelings and behaviors will also change in a chainlike reaction. Therefore, it makes sense to examine our food or diet beliefs and the influence they can have. ([Location 2877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=2877))

After you have done this consciously for a while, you’ll find that you hear your own negative thoughts transform into more positive words. You will also become sensitive to how hard you’ve been on yourself. Once you begin to see the world in terms of the cup being half-full, you’ll find that your daily dose of happy moments increases regularly.

If you’re still in diet mentality when you eat, it’s likely that you’re not choosing the most satisfying food, or, if you do choose it, you are judging yourself for eating it.

Challenging the Food Police, who chastise you for what you eat or for even eating at all, will also allow for optimal satisfaction. Later in this book, you will learn more about how movement and nutrition fit into Intuitive Eating, but suffice it to say that a person who feels good moving their body will also find that eating in a satisfying way will enhance this self-satisfaction.

Each has its own trigger, and each has its own appeasement. Food won’t fix any of these feelings. It may comfort for the short term, distract from the pain, or even numb you.

- PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS THE ULTIMATE STRESS BUFFER Exercise helps to protect the body from the health-damaging effects of chronic stress. Chronic stress can create a hormonal imbalance, which results in increased production of cortisol in the body, while also rendering insulin less effective (which is known as insulin resistance). Increases in cortisol are also associated with elevated neuropeptide Y release (which, you may recall, increases appetite). But regular physical activity can counteract this effect by improving the effectiveness of insulin and mood. Additionally, regular movement improves sleep patterns, which is often disrupted during stressful times. Notably, sleep deprivation is associated with insulin resistance and disturbed appetite regulation. ([Location 4425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=4425))

Let’s identify and refute them: The it’s-not-worth-it trap. We know many people who wouldn’t walk unless they could get in one hour—anything under that “doesn’t count.” Therefore, a fifteen-minute walk break during lunch doesn’t count. Instead, they do nothing. We commonly see clients discount their workout because they didn’t reach their prescribed quota. It “didn’t count” because they only exercised three times in a week, rather than five. All the more reason to be focused on how exercise feels, rather than doing it by the numbers. Besides, over the long term, it all counts. We like to take the power out of numbers, whether those numbers refer to pounds, calories, or even minutes exercising. In this case, however, we use numbers to show how even the smallest amount of movement does matter. ([Location 4447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084722THN&location=4447))

- Ordinary activity, and even vigorous activity such as running, does not leave you immune to muscle-wasting due to age. A ten-year study following master runners (minimum age of forty) showed that while they maintained their fitness from running, they lost an average of 4.4 pounds of muscle from their untrained areas. Their muscles stayed the same size in their legs but decreased in their arms. There was an exception, however, for three runners who did upper-body weights. They were able to maintain their muscle weight in their upper body. Therefore, you don’t have to lose your muscle mass. Stretching helps prevent injuries and improve muscle performance, and keeps the tendons flexible, the latter of which is important as you age. Aging often results in substantial loss of tendon flexibility, which limits motion and increases risk for injury.
