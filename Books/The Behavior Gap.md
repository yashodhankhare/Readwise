- Our assumptions about the future are almost always wrong. We can never think of everything—but we can take sensible steps to protect ourselves from life’s inevitable surprises. We can embrace uncertainty. ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=82))

- COMPANIES like Morningstar and Dalbar have done a bunch of studies that try to quantify the impact of investor behavior on real-life returns. The studies typically compare investors’ actual returns in stock funds to the average returns of the funds themselves. Just to be clear, they’re trying to compare the returns investors get to the returns investments get. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=115))

- We do the same thing when it comes to investing. If we haven’t done our research (figured out where the sprinklers are) and we behave poorly (run over the sprinklers), we’re not going to like the results. And we can’t blame the investment for our decisions. At some point, we must accept responsibility. Otherwise we’ll keep making the ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=186))

- One definition of insanity goes something like this: insanity is when you keep doing the same thing (in this case, blaming your investments for your losses) and expect a different result (in this case, good returns). Let’s stop acting crazy. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=189))

- Mountains are dangerous. That doesn’t mean you don’t go climbing (although maybe you don’t). But it does mean that if you want to stay alive you’d better respect those dangers. The same is true of stocks. They’re dangerous. When we pretend otherwise, we get into trouble. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=225))

- Overconfidence is a very serious problem. If you don’t think it affects you, that’s probably because you’re overconfident. In fact, the people who are most overconfident are the ones least likely to recognize it. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=246))

- The next time you’re about to make an investment decision because you’re sure you’re right, take the time to have what I call the OC (Overconfidence Conversation). It’s been a truly powerful tool to help people in their decisions. Find a friend, spouse, partner, or anyone you trust, and walk them through your answers to the following questions: ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=259))

- A guy I know had his money invested in his company’s stock. He had enough money to retire comfortably, but he believed there was a good chance the value of the stock could continue to rise—maybe even double. He wanted to know if he should sell the stock upon retirement, or hang on and wait for the stock to go up further. We had the Overconfidence ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=264))

Question two: What if you hold the stock and you’re wrong? Answer: You’re going back to work—maybe for twenty years. Question three: Have you been wrong before? Answer: Yes. He sold the stock.

- Before you invest your hard-earned money, ask yourself: Are you buying a particular investment because you think it’s a good investment? Or are you relying on a Greater Fool to come along? If so, doesn’t that make you—no offense—a bit foolish yourself? ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=277))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Sigh. We’ve been doing this for a long time. We do it because we make investing decisions based on how we feel rather than what we know. Falling stocks scare us; rising stocks attract us. But we know buying high and selling low leads to losses—and we need to stop doing that if we want to get different results.

- We don’t know what comes next for the financial markets. In the end, our own behavior is all that we can control—and ultimately, our behavior can make a huge difference in our financial success and our personal happiness. In other words, it’s up to us to close the behavior gap. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=326))

- Brooks’s conclusion: modern society concentrates on the wrong things. Governments track economic trends, but pay little attention to how social programs and institutions affect happiness. Likewise, individuals worry too much about money and not enough about things like fun and…well, love. How does this relate to your financial plans?

- First, be honest with yourself. Let’s say you invested in a stock at ten dollars, and it climbed to thirty dollars. Were you smart or just lucky? If you’re being honest (which isn’t always easy, since evolution has wired our brains for a certain amount of self-deception), you’ll probably acknowledge that any triple-baggers in your portfolio reflect at least as much luck as skill. Second, take the ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=1142))

- Overnight Test. Would you buy it now, based on the company’s or the fund’s prospects and price? (If you don’t know, the answer is no.) Third, review the investment’s potential role in helping you reach your goals. Picking the next Apple is not a financial goal. Saving for retirement or having enough money to send your kids to college are financial goals. Once we’re clear about the why—that is, about the goals that motivate us to invest in the first place—making investment decisions becomes much simpler.

In other words, does it play a role in your efforts to reach your goals? If not, sell. Fourth, walk away and don’t look back. It’s quite possible that if you make the decision to sell an investment because it doesn’t align with your goals, the stock will promptly take off. Likewise, if you make the decision to continue to hold an investment because it does align with your plans, the ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=1149))

- With that in mind, you need to be emotionally prepared for the times when your faith in your perfectly sound, reality-based decisions will be tested. And of course, this applies to every investment decision—not just the decision to sell or not to sell. Meanwhile, let’s not make all this seem harder than it is.

- hold an investment is relatively simple when we’re aware of the cognitive traps of fear and greed. It should be clear to anyone that if you own an investment that has tripled in price, and you made that investment based on luck, it would be wise to take the profit and invest it in something that more accurately reflects your plan. As usual, doing the right thing is simple. Maybe not easy. But simple. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005GSYXX6&location=1156))
