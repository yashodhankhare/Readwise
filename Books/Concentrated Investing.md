## Highlights
- The returns generated by investors do not always correlate to their ability to analyze and understand companies. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=258))

- Was it a matter of selecting the right securities, or holding them in the right amounts? ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=265))

- I recall one individual, whom we’ll call Investor Number One, whose returns were decent, but who seemed to be totally off-base when it came to the highly subjective and trickier job of figuring out whether a company’s business and management were fundamentally attractive, or worth skipping over. He ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=266))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- had made some notable blunders, on one occasion pounding the table to his colleagues about a soft goods company that was soon destined for bankruptcy. To me and a few others with whom I spoke at the time, it wasn’t difficult to comprehend that this company was not attractive and perhaps even precariously situated, so it left me scratching my head when I read his fund’s performance ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=268))

- results, which seemed to have a way of levitating away from what must have been some costly errors. On the other hand, another acquaintance whom we will call Investor Number Two was deeply insightful when discussing an industry or company and always grasped the investment case, for or against, with enviable precision and knowledge of the relevant facts. This second person’s returns, however, ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=271))

- were decidedly lackluster. He somehow never managed to fully capitalize on his insights, which were tremendously valuable and, one would have thought, should have led to very outstanding returns. This paradox got us thinking about the topics of security analysis and portfolio construction, and how they relate to returns. Apparently, analytical ability alone does not ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=274))

- constitute a really good investor. Investor Number Two in the preceding example should have been doing better with his ideas, and just imagine what Investor Number One could have accomplished if he had been more analytically competent. A lightbulb turned on when I realized the investors I admire the most (and this admiration comes only in part from the amazing success they’ve achieved) tend to share one characteristic: They are concentrated value investors. That is, they adhere to a concentrated approach to portfolio construction, holding a small number of securities as opposed to a broadly diversified portfolio. We set out to study the mathematical and statistical research that has been done by various academics on the subject of portfolio concentration, and to chronicle the methods and ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=277))

- Buffett in particular embraced Keynes’s philosophy, discussing in detail in his annual Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Chairman’s Letters his own evolution from Grahamite value investor to a value investment strategy that is remarkably similar to the one Keynes finally adopted. In 1991, he said Keynes was a man “whose brilliance as a practicing investor matched his brilliance in thought” before quoting from a letter Keynes wrote to a business associate, the chairman of Provincial Insurance, Francis C. Scott, on August 15, 1934. Buffett, who was endeavoring to describe his own investment philosophy, held that Keynes’s letter “says it all:”11 As time goes on, I get more and more convinced that the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes.

Enterprise only pretends to itself to be mainly actuated by the statements in its own prospectus, however candid and sincere.

He also notes that the cost to build a comparable deep-water rig today is $600 million, so the Borgsten Dolphin is worth between $300 million and $400 million.

As the industry started to pull back, one operator, Global Marine, actually increased its pace of rig construction.

- vessels that were all being mismanaged. Not one single asset, except the pension fund, which was overfunded, had a pleasant surprise. Emblematic of the company’s problems, the company’s main asset—its tanker ships—was poorly run, and losing money. When Siem went onboard a tanker to inspect it, he found that only the officer’s bar had been maintained:37 In those days the officers onboard the Common Brothers vessels met for drinks every evening in a bar. It was really shiny. The rest of the ship was falling apart. I think that was very symptomatic of all the assets and the care. The liabilities were equally ugly. Common Brothers had several hundred employees spread throughout the world. Siem was aghast when he found out the head office in Newcastle was situated over three floors in a brand new office building that Common Brothers had leased for 40 years at a very high rent. He moved immediately to end the lease and the huge liability it represented. Common Brothers was a mess that would take Siem four years to clean up. The problem, he says, was that the two members of the founding family who ran it were not interested in the detail of shipping. Both were “gentleman who were a pleasure to deal with”38 but the company had no controls, and they had lost grip of the financial details.

He kept all of the good deals for himself, and off-loaded the bad ones onto Common Brothers. Common Brothers also had a poorly run insurance broking business. Siem didn’t know the insurance business at all, and realized that he needed to get involved. He found the whole industry to be run by people whom he describes as “not very high caliber:”39 It was more important to them what kind of car they were driving, and having their yacht and claret for lunch and so forth. I tried to get them to renounce some of these benefits in return for a participation in something much bigger. There was no interest at all. Siem decided that he needed to move urgently to make the insurance business profitable, and then merge it with somebody else who could run it. Over a series of transactions, it eventually became Lowns Lambert, then Heath and Willis, now owned by the buyout shop Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of New York.

- Siem Industries made numerous successful investments since it became a publicly traded company in 1987, growing its shareholders’ equity from $5.3 million in June 1987 to over $2.01 billion at the end of 2014, growing at a compound rate of 25 percent. Siem has been instrumental to the success for many of the company’s investments, being named as chairman of the investee company in almost every instance for the purpose of enacting the strategies he outlined. It is a testament to his hands on, industrial investment philosophy. Siem on Valuation Siem’s success in the oil and gas drilling and shipping industries points to an unconventional facility for identifying and valuing investment opportunities there. How does he find those opportunities, and what does he look for when presented with an investment? He has worked his entire career in oil and gas drilling and shipping, with a particular focus on offshore drilling and other services. His first investments were made in individual assets, and he was fully concentrated in each of those deals, investing all of his capital into a single asset. Siem argues that such a huge concentration of capital was warranted because he had done his homework. The downside risk, from his perspective, was relatively small because he knew the industry so well. He also notes that he was young and “didn’t have the experience to see all the potential pitfalls that come with age, and the problem when you have old people deciding is that you get the benefit of their experience, but also they may lack the courage at times.”78 He says that, though he didn’t have a lot of experience at the time that he acquired the Haakon Magnus, his first investment, he had spent all of his working life in the oil and gas offshore drilling industry, and knew it well:79 I knew all 118 submersible rigs in the world by name, where they were, and their contracts. I came young into a young industry, so I had a very good grip and understanding of all the dynamics in this industry, and therefore the quality of my judgment was high. I saw it as a fantastic opportunity to put all my wealth and energy into it. His view is that the best way to get the valuation right is to have industry knowledge that can only come from experience.

- Ed Thorp applied the Kelly Criterion first as a gambler, and then as a convertible arbitrage investor. In 2011, he examined the application of Kelly theory to value investment.

- than parallel—several bets filling a portfolio at once.31 He noted that this occurred because value investors may be failing to consider the opportunity costs of each position. Thorp offered the example of a portfolio with two opportunities that each required a bet greater than 50 percent of the portfolio’s capital. If the optimal Kelly bet for each is greater than 50 percent of the capital, the total capital committed to ([Location 6539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=6539))

- the positions would amount to more than 100 percent of capital. But this cannot be. Kelly will not allow more than 50 percent of capital in both opportunities because it risks total loss, which Kelly always avoids. The optimal bet in that situation must therefore be less than 50 percent of capital. Thorp argues that the same reasoning applies for any set of opportunities of two or more, and hence, “We need to know ([Location 6543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DRD6DVQ&location=6543))
