- variable: memory. People act on what they remember, not on what they forget. The concept of memory is refueling the efforts of scholars and neuroscientists who are deepening the understanding of human behavior. The latest scientific findings place memory at the heart of adaptive behavior and decision-making. Scientists are also increasingly worried that our society is being stripped of the responsibility to remember much. We have increasingly more ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=164))

- devices and programs that remember for us. Our phones store people’s numbers, social apps remind us of birthdays, slides prompt us on what to say in presentations, and more recently, plants can use Twitter to remind us to water them. At this rate, we are grooming generations of amnesiacs. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=169))

- These questions are natural because when we aspire to be a part of people’s future decisions, we implicitly ask what the future will bring. The attempt to anticipate the future is mandatory in understanding how to influence others’ memory. This is because all neurologically intact people are relentlessly on fast-forward. The brain has evolved to be a prediction engine because natural selection favors those who can accurately predict the future.

- If the brain is a prediction engine, memory is its fuel. We can argue that the only reason we need memory of the past is so we can inform the future. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=190))

- The purpose of this book is to translate current memory research into practical techniques you can apply today to help others remember and act on what you consider important. Let’s start with what people remember ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=198))

- naturally. Studies show that when we choose an action, we rely on memory to predict rewards and to guide our behavior in three ways:   1.   A reflexive way, through which we subconsciously alter behavior to ensure biological fitness. It takes only one experience with a hot surface (stimulus) to remember what to do next time to prolong survival (reward).   2.   A habitual way, through which we repeat actions that proved rewarding in the past. Unlike the reflexive route, where rewards have innate, biological value, habitual decisions involve learning and remembering arbitrary associations. In scientific experiments, after trial and error, animals learn to turn left or right to receive food and go on autopilot afterward; we do the same after we initially exert cognitive effort to find the best way to get to work and follow it without thinking once it’s proved suitable.   3.   A goal-oriented way, through which we anticipate outcomes based on the past but are willing to change our minds in light of new information. For example, we may take a new road to work because the habitual one is under construction, or we may apply for a new job because the old one does not pay as much. All three routes to our next move have strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=200))

- they work cooperatively; other times they compete against each other. However, all of them are adaptive and predictive and are fueled by memory. To be on people’s minds, you must become part of their reflexes, habits, and/or goals they consider valuable. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=211))

- He also believes that forcing information on people makes them want to reject it, whereas inviting them to search for information makes them interact and remember. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=225))

- The mistake some people make when trying to influence others’ memory is that they overestimate the importance of goals and underestimate the impact of existing reflexes and habits. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=239))

- For example, business people don’t go to work and think, “Today I will spend 30 minutes to improve my memory.” But they do think, “Today I am going to spend 30 minutes to figure out how to win Customer X.” This thought is implicitly about how to influence someone else’s memory because people make choices based on what they remember. So we can count on the fact that we are more likely to put effort into influencing other people’s memory than working on our own. In addition, it is impractical to study individual memory in isolation; enhancing our own memory is nice but not sufficient to guarantee a significant improvement in our lives. People function and evolve in complex systems. Even when we use autobiographical memory ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=261))

- and reflect on individual experiences, many of those are a result of interacting with others. Behavior and success are shaped by social memory. It is not only possible to influence other people’s memory; it is crucial to human progress. When we share great ideas, and others remember and act on them, we progress. When we have great ideas and others forget them, we stagnate. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=266))

- The concept of proportion binds all the practical techniques in this book because there is no single factor that makes something memorable. It is a combination of elements, used in the ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=298))

- proper ratio. If you put one spoon of sugar in your coffee, it will taste better. Three spoons of sugar will make it taste awful. It is the same with memory. Surprise, for example, is memorable, but too much of it can be disconcerting. An audience may still remember a surprising segment but not for the proper reasons or with the intended emotion. What are some elements that we can combine to influence memory? To make recommendations on the proper ratio of variables, we must first agree on what memory is, as it means many things to many people. Memory is the picture that comes to mind when you think of your last vacation; it is the ability to swim in a pool even though you haven’t done it in a while; it is being nauseated thinking of food you hate; it is taking the same route to the grocery store without thinking; and it is the knowledge that the Mona Lisa has no eyebrows. We have multiple memory systems to account for this array of memory types, and one of the formal ways to study memory is to look at it as the process we use to encode, store, and retrieve information. We can also study memory by its duration (short term versus long term) or by whether it is declarative (you can put it into words) or procedural (such as habits or skills). Regardless of type, all memories consist of an association between neurons, so that when one fires, others fire, creating a pattern. Memory research shows multiple variables impacting memory. Some are under our control when we ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=299))

- want to impact what people remember, and others are not. Overall, I have identified 15 variables we can use to influence others’ memory: context, cues, distinctiveness, emotion, facts, familiarity (tied to integration with reflexes and habits), motivation, novelty, quantity of information, relevance, repetition, self-generated content, sensory intensity, social aspects, and surprise. It is impossible to control how much sleep your audiences are getting before they listen to you, how much other content they just consumed or will view later, how similar this content is to yours, how long after content exposure specific memories must become active, how stressed they are, the mood they are in, or the drugs they are taking—all of which influence memory, too. However, we can focus on using the variables we can control in proper proportions. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=310))

- We often start creating content from a place of abundance. To avoid the temptation of including too many stimuli, set a framework and then decide the degrees of distinction within that framework (more about this in later chapters). When there is a framework, let’s say a set of slides in a PowerPoint presentation, some items can become distinct relative to their “neighbors.” Scientists ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=329))

- call this salience. Items with less salient neighbors will be more distinct than items with more salient neighbors. This view challenges the belief that the beginning and ending of a sequence are always more memorable than what happens in the middle. It is possible that the beginning and ending of a sequence are salient because of their privileged position: no neighbors on one of the sides. However, you can rescue any middle in your communications (presentation, blog, e-mail, marketing campaign, training program) if you establish a framework first and then determine neighboring items around the ones you want to make memorable.

- Hugh Hefner took advantage of the concept of salience. Some issues of Playboy included pieces by John Updike, Arthur Miller, John Irving, Ian Fleming, and Ray Bradbury. In the 1960s and 1970s, Playboy was appealing to a literate, daring reader, appreciative of in-depth articles. It wasn’t unusual to read an essay about Hemingway by his son Patrick, and even the first English translation of a poem by Goethe. In recent years, the magazine has showcased investigative journalism and quality fiction. At some point, Hugh Hefner is known to have told the Playmates that ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=338))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “Without you, I’d be the publisher of a literary magazine.” The articles served as quality sidekicks to the pictures intended to be salient points, offering some justification for the famous claim “I read it for the articles.” In 2015 Playboy announced a new policy of no full nudity, so it will have to find new ways to distinguish what is important and what should serve as sidekicks. David Walsh and Hugh Hefner could afford to include sex in their frameworks as salient points. When creating corporate or academic content, it’s not so easy. However, it’s not the type of stimulus that counts but how a stimulus relates to others within that framework. It’s about nibbling from the mushroom in the proper ratio. As you investigate the content you share with others, look at the ratio between different stimuli you’re including (text, pictures, videos, etc.). Ultimately, every component in your communication has the potential to be remembered. Even a complex chart can be memorable if it appears after a string of simple text-based elements because it is seen as a surprise that breaks a pattern.

- If we could put Kilian in an MRI machine as he is relating this story, we would be surprised by what we see: ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=396))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- most of the brain areas involved in reminiscing about the past are the same brain areas involved in planning for the future. Understanding this overlap will impact the way you communicate to be remembered. When Kilian is thinking about his past mountaineering adventure and imagining a future one, he is drawing from similar types of information. For instance, when he constructs a scene from the past such as the trip to Mt. McKinley, he combines these components into a coherent narrative: vivid visual imagery (skis, snow, midnight sun, skinning the slope, putting on crampons), contextual information (the mountain, Orient Express), facts (details about his three friends, his location), conceptual information (“It’s all about improving, not winning”), personal meaning (he is at the forefront of a growing trend), and emotions (elation when meeting with friends and skiing in a surreal place together). An MRI machine would show us that these processes activate modality-specific cortical areas (e.g., visual, motor, sensory, planning) and that these are the same neural networks that contribute significantly to his description of a future trip to Everest. We know that thinking about the past and thinking about the future are linked not only because of MRI studies but also because of studies on patients who have damage in the areas responsible for relating past experiences. Many amnesic patients who have trouble with the past are also likely to have difficulty picturing the future. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=396))

- Of course, there are some neural differences between remembering the past (retrospective memory) and “remembering” the future (prospective memory). The obvious difference is that the two systems have a different temporal orientation. Past memories are also more vivid and more detailed. And when engaging in prospective thinking, we may combine older pieces of information in new ways. But for the most part, past and future memory draw from the same neural resources. This is important because it makes us rethink the way we consider memory, especially when we want to influence it in other people and become impossible to ignore. What if memory has evolved to keep track of the future, not the past? After all, there is little evolutionary advantage for humans simply to recall the past. It would do Kilian no good merely to reminisce about his previous mountaineering… ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=407))

- What are the three most important memory problems you experienced last week? This is a question scientists often ask people when they investigate memory issues more deeply. A series of research studies have found that 60 to 80% of our memory problems are related to forgetting to execute on a future intention. Yesterday you may have intended to give someone a call, send a specific e-mail, or stop by the store to buy milk, and only remembered these today. Some unfulfilled intentions linger for a longer time. How many books have you promised yourself you will read on your next vacation … for the past five years? We have good intentions but forget to execute on them, or if we remember them, the reward is not compelling enough to get us to act. Our audiences are no different. They listen to us, and they may agree that what we say is helpful. When they leave, they might still remember something from what we had said but don’t do anything about it. We can address that by changing our approach to how we view memory. Instead of viewing memory as merely recollecting things from the past, let’s look at memory from the lens of… ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=417))

- predict what happens next. We can see evidence of our inclination to anticipate the future in many activities: completing other people’s sentences, salivating before taking the first bite, or laughing just before someone is about to tickle us. Second, we constantly look to the future to extract value for our present actions. Yale psychologists George Newman and T. Andrew Poehlman have studied the human brain’s tendency to look to the future and identify value for the present. They sampled 240 YouTube videos showing a child prodigy and an adult performing the same song. In a side-by-side comparison, the child performances garnered 10 times as many views. Some explain the larger viewership as a result of novelty or awe or the skills being incongruent with the kids’ age. Some ascribe the youths’ talent to a divine source. Consistent with findings on the topic of “conceptual consumption,” psychologists estimate that we consume not only the product or the experience in front of us, but also an idea of its future. For child prodigies, we may wonder, “If they are so good right now, imagine where they will be in the future.” These projected images about future achievement generate positive emotions… ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=427))

So it is pragmatic to ask, what is happening in people’s lives, and what do they intend to do at Point B? If we know this already at Point A, we can prepare for Point B so we can become part of people’s memories and intentions. Getting people to act on what they remember always starts with an intention—an intention they already have or one you wish to place in their… ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=438))

- In advertising, brands are also researching prospective memory because it hurts business when companies spend a large marketing budget and customers remember the ads at the point of purchase, but they either don’t buy that brand or, worse, choose a competitor’s product. From a wider business perspective, whether we work in sales, training, marketing, finance, or IT, we can use findings from research on prospective memory and extract practical insights to help others act on future intentions. Research reveals that when people act on future intentions successfully, they complete these three steps, sometimes within fractions of seconds:   1.   Notice cues that are linked to their intentions   2.   Search their memory for something related to those cues and intentions   3.   And if something is rewarding enough … execute ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=462))

- Let’s say you have a dinner party and want to buy some wine on your way home from work. You tell yourself in the morning, “When I drive by the store ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=471))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- tonight, I must stop and buy the wine.” The intention is to buy the wine, and the reward is your guests will think of you as a wonderful host. On your way back, you see the store (notice cue); you think, “What was I supposed to do? Oh, yes, buy wine” (search memory); and you pull into the store (execute on intention). Now consider your own content and imagine you must help your audiences go through the process described. With this prospective memory model in mind at Point A, you can prime your audiences with the proper cues, help them to keep in long-term memory what is important, and make it easier for them to execute on intentions at Point B. Currently, in the business world, the process of prospective memory is left to chance, and as a result, our audiences forget a lot, and the little they may remember does not always lead to action. We can fix this. The three steps of prospective memory—noticing cues, searching memory, and executing on intentions—have a few things in common. They are all tied to the brain’s tendency to seek rewards and avoid punishments. When we speak about future intentions, what we picture is a reward we will get from either moving toward something positive or away… ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=473))

- Proper cues moderate access to existing memories. The question is, how are memories formed, stored, and retrieved at the right time? This is important to answer because even in the prospective memory process, at Point B, retrospective memory counts. We still need the past to execute on the future.

- When analyzing your own content, ask this: When you are no longer in the room with your listeners, what type of cues will be available in their lives to trigger the appropriate memory and entice them to act? Prime their brains with those cues at Point A, so they are recognizable and will prompt the right memories at Point B. Also ask: Will they have sufficient cues to remind them of what you consider important, or will they have to recall something on their own, without any external help? There is no right or wrong answer, but clarifying this at Point A increases the likelihood that you’ll be satisfied with what happens at Point B. Sometimes people like to choose what they remember, and sometimes they prefer to be reminded what to do (in other words, to be given cues).

- 3. Executing on Intentions It is possible for people to remember what we tell them but still forget to act. Lots of businesses capitalize on this human tendency. I am sure you know people who:     •   Bought products for the rebates but never claimed them     •   Have automatic renewal payments for services they no longer need     •   Are going to switch to a cheaper health insurance plan or rebalance an investment portfolio that currently has high service fees “some day” Most of us are humble about our memory for the past, but just as many of us overestimate our ability to remember to do things in the future. Harvard University professor Keith Ericson recently completed a series of studies on our overconfidence in remembering future effort.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The ideal way to study what influences action is to understand it in relation both to memory and to its two close cousins: emotion and motivation. Together, the three processes compute the rewarding or punishing features of a stimulus. Some scientists believe that this combination—memory, emotion, and motivation—is at the basis of the brain’s design. We process stimuli around us with our senses, and in the process, we identify the value of those objects that we can use for a specific outcome. We evaluate which stimulus is associated with which reward, or we form a new association, and then we select an appropriate behavior. Stimuli do not lead to action. Stimuli contain value codes, which activate emotional states, and these states may lead to actions. Let’s consider the following definitions, which are gathering consensus from scientists:     •   Emotions are states elicited by rewards and punishments.     •   Motivation is the state we are in when we are willing to work to receive a reward or avoid a punishment.     •   Memory is the process that leads to the selection of appropriate action to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=594))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Remembering rewards and punishments is how we are able to cope efficiently in a complex and changing environment. As scientist Edmund Rolls states, “We guide our behavior toward stimuli that are useful and away from those that are not.” For example, we are motivated to work to obtain rewards such as affection, praise, physical touch, or money. The emotion we feel when we obtain these rewards is happiness. We are also willing to work to avoid negative emotion, such as a boss being disappointed by subpar performance. We feel emotions when we expect a reward and don’t get it, such as frustration when someone else gets the credit for our work. Or we feel relief when a punishing stimulus stops, such as someone quickly answering a cell phone that interrupts an important conversation. Memory, emotions, and motivation are impacted by the presence, absence, or termination of rewarding or punishing stimuli.

- For example, imagine you are one of four vendors proposing a new marketing platform to a potential client. How do you steer the decision makers in your direction, especially when you may not know specifics about their reflexes, habits, or goals? Despite complex situations and moving variables, there is something that stays the same: the brain’s quest for seeking rewards or avoiding punishments. People execute on intentions, taking into consideration the following variables:     •   Effort. “How much work am I willing to do to obtain rewards?”     •   Time delay. “For how long am I willing to wait before I receive rewards?”     •   Risk. “How much uncertainty am I willing to accept?”     •   Social aspects. “What are the outcomes of other people’s actions in relation to my actions?” ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=629))

- Prospective memory, which means remembering a future intention, has remarkable advantages for any business because it keeps us viable: we stay in business when people remember what we say and act on it in the future.     •   When people act on future intentions successfully, they complete these three steps, sometimes within fractions of seconds: they notice cues that are linked to their intentions; search their memory for something related to those cues and intentions; and if it is rewarding enough, they execute.

- The effectiveness of cues depends on how strongly they are related to a desired intention and how salient they are to draw attention at the time of remembering.     •   Memory, emotions, and motivation are influenced by the presence, absence, or termination of rewarding or punishing stimuli.     •   People execute on intentions according to the following variables tied to rewards: effort, time delay, risk, and social aspects.

- So far, we have noted that it is practical to approach memory from a future perspective for three reasons: (1) the brain is constantly on fast-forward to stay adaptive, (2) we look to the future to extract value for our present actions, and (3) when we communicate at Point A, we aspire for others to remember and act in the future at Point B. Prospective memory, which means remembering to act on an intention in the future, includes noticing cues, searching memories, and ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=663))

- executing on intentions. If we have prepared an audience for these three steps at Point A, we increase the likelihood of action at Point B. When we want to influence others’ memory, we must start with this question: What is it exactly that we want them to remember and act on? In asking this question, we implicitly ask another: How much would we like others to remember? We realize it is not ideal for our audiences to remember everything we do or say. There are situations when we would prefer that people forget something we did or shared. Budweiser may want people to forget a controversial Bud Light bottle that read “The perfect beer for removing ‘no’ from your vocabulary for the night.” Urban Outfitters wants us to forget its women’s T-shirt that read, “Eat less.” Amazon and Sears want us to forget that at some point they carried swastika rings on their sites. JCPenney pulled out of its shops a girls’ T-shirt that read, “I’m too pretty to do homework so my brother has to do it for me,” apologizing to consumers and admitting that the T-shirt “does not deliver an appropriate message.” ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=666))

- For over a century, scientists have been investigating how much people remember after being exposed to new information and, equally important, how much they forget. A concept called the “forgetting curve” hypothesizes that we lose information over time when we make no effort to retain it. The forgetting curve is exponential after the first session, meaning that in the first few days after exposure to content, we forget most of it, up to 90% by some accounts.

- What erodes existing knowledge? Forgetting typically happens for three reasons: People don’t pay attention to what we tell them in the first place (failure to encode). Even if memories do become encoded, people may still forget because their memories are not consolidated. Consolidation of a memory trace takes a few days or weeks—sometimes even longer—and is influenced by sleep, stress, anxiety, or exposure to more information after we speak to that specific audience (this causes interference and failure to store). Even when memories are encoded and stored, people may be missing the proper cues to bring those memories to mind (failure to retrieve). The forgetting curve should not be confused with the myth that people remember 10% of what they read, 20% ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=691))

- of what they hear, 30% of what they see, 50% of what they see and hear, 70% of what they see and write, and 90% of what they do. No study has found such conveniently progressive statistics. This memory pyramid is not supported by science (how is “reading” different from “seeing”?). Donald Taylor, chairman of the Learning Technologies conference, notes that “those who prefer copy-and-paste to reflect-and-consider” have been perpetuating this memory myth with a series of Technicolor pyramids and bar graphics, which have no validity. The forgetting curve, which is backed by science, reminds us that retention decreases quickly at first and more slowly later. Psychologists and mathematicians have joined forces to create a mathematical formula that expresses the nature of the forgetting curve. What we know so far is that the forgetting curve depends on the strength of the initial memory trace and the difficulty we have in retaining that memory over time. For example, if we learned an array of nonsense syllables, we may be able to recite them well immediately after learning them (the memory trace is strong), but we will have difficulty retaining those memories for a long time. However, if we had a discussion with a loved one, even weeks later, the strength of the initial memory may be weak, but we are still somewhat familiar with what took place during the conversation, even though we don’t recall the details (“I vaguely remember you mentioning that interior designer and the witchcraft”).

- The scientific approach to memory has borrowed from fuzzy logic and has produced the fuzzy-trace theory, according to which we form two types of memories: verbatim and gist. Verbatim memories are word-for-word, accurate representations of what we learned in the past. Recalling European capitals is an example of verbatim memory. These answers belong to crisp sets. By contrast, gist memories include the general meaning of something that happened in the past, and they are less accurate and specific. They belong to fuzzy sets. For example, thinking back to the last hotel you stayed in, you may not remember the exact room number, but you may remember whether you had a good experience. Gist memories result in a sense of “familiarity” with the stimulus. This is why students sometimes fail on exams that require precision: they mistake familiarity for verbatim. “I thought I knew it” is their typical response at a failed grade. Gist is tied to meaning, and it does not always map directly to verbatim information because it is relative. We consider a 20% chance of rain low and a 20% chance of a heart attack high. Gist memories tend to be longer lasting than verbatim memories. This is because people go in and out of paying attention to others every 12 to 18 seconds. During these segments, we engage in an internal dialogue that is more valuable and more rewarding than the details of the stimulus. Our internal dialogue has a stronger chemical signal, a natural high. During these moments, we formulate a meaning, and because of the stronger chemical signal, it is longer lasting than the precise details ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=749))

A few early readers of this book wrote me to say that they enjoyed the section on “clues” (instead of “cues”) and that they appreciated the idea behind the “exactness” of words (their way of describing the word “verbatim”).

- Keeping verbatim and gist memories in mind, at Point A it is critical to decide what is more important to you and in what ratio. Are you after a gist or a verbatim 10% message, or a combination? The answer may depend on your industry. In the medical field, for example, a lack of verbatim memory may be life-threatening. Consider these drug names: Advair versus Advicor, Bidex versus Videx, Cidex versus Cedax, Dioval versus Diovan, Doxil versus Paxil, Kwell versus Qwell, Ranexa versus Prenexa. They are so easy to confuse. People have even confused Allegra with Viagra. About 25% of medication errors are related to pharmaceutical names that are barely distinguishable from others, and doctors, pharmacists, and patients report experiencing this confusion.

- Reflecting on your own content, ponder this: What is your 10% message for your next communication? Should your audience be able to repeat it verbatim or just get the gist? And if just the gist, what degree of fuzzy will work in your favor? Is a sense of familiarity sufficient for people to come back and interact with your content again in the future? Verbatim memory is more easily accessible immediately after viewing a stimulus, while gist is more accessible after a longer time. It is then important to ask: When do we expect our audiences to make decisions on something important to us? Immediately after we talk to them or in a few days? The answer will determine whether we repeat specific details (and fewer of them) or share general information but stay on the surface.

- Most people don’t sit around and wait for cues. This means the cues we create at Point A and aim to be noticeable at Point B must be distinctive enough to attract attention and prompt a specific memory, even when people are busy doing something else. If there is one thing that neuroscientists agree on, it is that cues are signals to act, and we know that people act on three things: reflexes, habits, and/or goals. So let’s learn how to build cues mapped to the same three decision factors, keeping in mind that, regardless of the cue type, the brain is in a constant search for rewards.

- Gibsonian affordances apply to business content creation too. For example, a few years ago, I remember helping Phil Fernandez, CEO of Marketo, create a presentation about his book, Revenue Disruption. Out of 45 slides, 14 had key words whose size was 30% bigger than the text in the rest of the presentation. These were words related to several problems marketers were facing (e.g., “limited choices,” “Mars versus Venus”—to describe the marketing versus sales dynamic, “five stages of grief”), and solutions (e.g., “create revenue,” “enormous opportunity,” “revenue performance management”). Marketers would encounter many of these physical stimuli later on during their daily tasks, long after the delivery of the presentation. When reinforced through subsequent e-mail reminders, a white paper, and a webinar recording, they act as cues that signal action.

- The continuum we are after is for people to notice cues, search their memory, and act on intentions. This means we must work at creating and training the association between the cue, memory, and intention. At Point B, it’s not just reactivating the same stimuli that counts; it is reactivating the association between stimuli and intention that counts. fMRI studies show that when we repeat the encoding of the same stimuli (we are shown the same things over and over), there is less activation of the hippocampus. However, when we reactivate the associations between the stimuli, there is greater activity in the hippocampus, and this is what leads to more accurate memory retrieval. To encode links between cues, memory, and intentions, you can explicitly state them, or you can ask others to state their own intentions: “When I am in situation X, I will perform action Y.” Both work equally well, whether stated verbally or in writing, and are superior to not having any intentions and simply expecting people to perform something from their own memory. Studies show that prospective memory is more effective when it follows the formula of written instructions + imagery. For example, “When I receive a prospect’s information, I will check his or her LinkedIn profile” (and we see a picture of someone’s LinkedIn profile). Any modality of instructions has the possibility to improve prospective memory when you show people “how” to do something. Research findings remind us that even asking people to imagine for 30 ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1056))

- seconds that they will do something in the future improves the likelihood of its execution. It is critical to encode distinctive cues that are not associated with anything else in long-term memory except you or your cause. At the point of decision, Point B, a cue must be distinctive enough so people don’t confuse us with someone else, particularly the competition. We must be humble enough to realize that at Point B, people are typically preoccupied with other things: the right prospective cue is extremely important. How do we gauge if our cues meet the mark? Consider these guidelines:   1.   The nature of the cue. The more the cue corresponds to the memory itself, the stronger the memory. For example, if, in your mind, Kleenex represents tissues and only tissues, then saying “tissues” may quickly bring to mind the brand Kleenex. If someone says “lightbulbs,” you may not immediately think of Philips because the company stands for a lot more than lightbulbs. What we bring to mind is always cue dependent, whether we provide the cue ourselves or someone else does. Weak connections do not activate specific memories.   2.   The strength of the cue. If someone says “beer” but you are not a beer drinker, then that cue does not bring about a particular memory. Cues become strong with enough exposure and repetition.

- 3.   The number of connections of that cue in our memory with other elements. If someone says “beer,” how many brands come to mind? If you address an audience and say “predictive analytics,” are you the only vendor that comes to mind? Can you find a word or term that only you’re associated with in your listeners’ brains? People find it hard to form if-then plans if the number of cues increases. Here is an example of how these findings are reflected in content creation. As part of a university advertising campaign aimed at convincing students to drink less, posters around campus read, “65% of students at our university have 3 or fewer drinks when they party.” It was meant to appeal to the student population using social proof: the more students were shown to follow acceptable behavior, the more students might be motivated to emulate others. Social proof may be a great decision driver, but students need to remember the message at a time and place when it matters most: at Point B, in places where they might drink, not while walking around on campus, away from the bar. To increase the likelihood that the “drink less” message will not be ignored when it counts,… ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1079))

With your content in mind, consider the nature of cues at both stages: encoding and retrieval. So far, we’ve discussed using cues for attracting attention at encoding. In the retrieval stage, cognitive scientists remind us of three criteria that cues must meet to impact memory and action when it counts:   1.   People must recognize the cues at retrieval. In the “drink less” campaign, a more effective strategy would have been also to advertise those LED ice cubes so they don’t look completely new when they are spotted in bars.   2.   Once people recognize the cue, they must still retrieve the associated action. In the “drink less” campaign, this means that they must be reminded that the LED ice cubes are linked to “don’t drink.” This association is stronger at retrieval if established at encoding.   3.   People must be able to coordinate what they are doing now and what they should be doing. In the “drink less” campaign, this means that… ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1090))

- In attempting to influence your audience’s memory and actions, using cues that will be noticed later on is one of the most important steps because that’s often where memory and intentions start. Researchers are observing, “The noticing function might be more effortful than the search function. The noticing function might frequently require explicit memory or rehearsal to respond to a prospective cue, but once the cue is noticed, relatively little memory is needed for the search function to determine what to do.” So once you take care of this step—helping others notice cues—your task as an effective communicator becomes easier. Just as easy as noticing a red jacket in a crowd.   KEEP IN MIND     •   When the cues you use to attract attention at Point A are similar to what people encounter later at Point B, the cues are more likely to signal action.     •   Physical properties of stimuli such as unusual colors, textures, size, motion, loud sounds, harmony, or orientation of objects can force people to… ([Location 1103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1103))

When you engage your audiences in reflective attention, you promote long-term memory because of a process called elaborate encoding.     •   Link your message to people’s most important goals. Unlike reflexes or habits, goals require cognitive effort, but attention is still possible because goals are fueled by needs. Consider acknowledging that an audience may have conflicting needs, such as uncertainty versus structure, people versus privacy, and survival versus transcendence.     •   Tie your message to a current but unfulfilled goal. People tend to pay greater attention to and remember more of what is not finished because the brain seeks closure.     •   Link cues to social desirability because impression management is a strong motivation driver… ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1116))

- Earlier in the book, I mentioned a study of the most popular SlideShares of 2015. The results showed that surprise was the single most reliable predictor of staying on people’s minds long enough for them to act in our favor. When surprise was included, even a small dose (5–10% of the slides) was sufficient to compel viewers to like, share, download, comment, or embed the presentation on their own sites. It is useful to understand the neuroscience of surprise, because when you surprise someone, whether the outcome is good or bad, you can rely on extra emotion and engagement. This chapter offers guidelines on how best to create surprises for audiences in such a way that we influence attention, memory, and action.

- So it looks like we are faced with a biological paradox: on one hand, we like to predict accurately, but on the other, we also seem to enjoy some surprises. Can we create for our listeners something that is predictable and surprising at the same time? To answer this, we must first understand how the human brain learns to predict and what is likely to appear surprising. For this, we turn to the psychology of expectations.

- HOW DO WE FORM EXPECTATIONS? Our brains map out everything we do. Eating, working, feeling pain, or making love—many of these activities take place in the mind first. Neurocognitive studies have demonstrated that actions, such as a simple movement of the hand or physical exercise, take place in the brain first before they take place in reality. And we learn to predict what happens in the end by forming expectations. The brain starts with the end in mind.

- We have expectations constantly—of how our day unfolds, how we’ll react to a show, or what our partner may say after we share some news. When our expectations are met, we experience pleasure because we predicted accurately. When our expectations are not met, this prediction error is a teaching moment: we learn how to adapt. Negotiating the gap between what we expect and what happens is how the brain becomes a better prediction engine. And the value of good predictions is the most precious gift of all: living longer.

- Accurate expectations = biological advantage The terms “expectation” and “anticipation” are often used interchangeably. For this discussion, let’s keep them separate; let’s consider that expectations run constantly and sometimes quietly in the background, while anticipation is expectation in action. Anticipation is also linked to dopamine, which has a critical role in our ability to hold people’s attention and get them to act. This is why the next chapter is dedicated specifically to anticipation. For now, let’s focus on expectations, which constantly feed our future-obsessed brains, and let’s see how we can use them to offer our audiences surprises they enjoy and convince them to pay attention and make decisions.

- IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURPRISE AND NOVELTY? Before we look at practical ways in which to create surprise for our audiences, let’s distinguish two more terms, which people tend to use interchangeably: “surprise” and “novelty.” Even though the terms are related, there are some differences, and knowing these differences helps us change our approach to how we create content to attract attention. We’ll define the term “novelty” as something that has not been previously experienced and “surprise” as something that occurs unexpectedly. It is easy to swap the terms because we often witness them together. For example, while working with a company on a presentation about a platform that scales marketing campaigns, we showed a first slide that displayed “The End.” The intent was to tell the people in the audience this was the end of their traditional marketing story, meaning there are currently too many tasks in marketing that happen manually and would benefit from automation.

For example, according to a 2015 Bank of America report, approximately three-quarters (71%) of respondents sleep with their mobile phones. We may not have known that exact number (new information), but we’re not surprised by it. Sometimes, we experience surprise without novelty, such as a presenter checking a smartphone in the middle of his own presentation: we’ve seen people checking their phones, but seeing someone doing so in that context is unexpected. For the most part, however, we tend to witness novelty at the same time as surprise. And our audiences’ brains are constantly looking to mitigate the tension between two states: on one hand, people want to minimize the energy necessary to process their environment and appreciate it when incoming stimuli conform to their expectations. On the other, they want to learn new things and revise their schema… ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1209))

- Familiarity wins over novelty when our conscious mental processing is disrupted or distracted. If you are tired after a day’s work and you are browsing through your iTunes, with limitless choices, do you find yourself migrating toward a familiar tune? Keep this principle in mind especially when you’re talking to people who are tired or overwhelmed. We constantly want to impress others with novelty, but when their conscious processing is already spent, you’re feeding the fast brain, which is drawn to familiarity. Our preference for familiarity is called the exposure effect and has several scientific explanations. When we perceive something as familiar, we can let our guard down. The lower level of arousal means that we attend to the stimulus in a relaxed state, which creates pleasure. Another theory is that we misattribute the ease of processing to the actual stimulus: “Since it was so easy to see or taste or hear, it must be good, so I will choose it.” Based on these theories, we can estimate that it’s not so much that familiarity gives us pleasure; it is accurate prediction that gives us pleasure. And we attribute that positive feeling to the stimulus itself. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1231))

- Surprise is departure from an expected norm. In order to deviate from a pattern, we must first identify a pattern that people recognize, and then we must modify it slightly. Picture the Mona Lisa. It is a painting you have seen multiple times in your life—whether the actual work of art or a photograph—and if you were to see it one more time, there would be no surprises. If you want to show the Mona Lisa to others and surprise them, you would have to break away from what ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1257))

- they expect. If we type in any search engine “Mona Lisa variations,” we find the classic Mona Lisa morphed with Miss Piggy, Lara Croft, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), Santa Claus, the Terminator, Snow White, and many others. We also see her in different outfits—Egyptian goddess, biker chick, belly dancer—and with different accessories—sunglasses, cigarettes, devil ears, gas mask, tiara, clown nose and makeup, a fat cat that she is holding, hair rollers, or no hair at all. We even see the Mona Lisa in a wheelchair: this image advertised an event for an organization for people with disabilities. None of these effects would surprise us if we did not have the initial schema of this classic painting. So consider giving your audience members both something they expect and something they don’t expect. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1262))

- Another way to provide surprise—and therefore attract attention by causing a prediction error—is not only to break a pattern but to break one that people consider sacred. For example, you may be familiar with a painting called Liberty Guiding the People by Eugene Delacroix, which he completed in 1831. The painting depicts the heroes of the French Revolution, alongside the dominant figure of Liberty. Portrayed as a goddess, Liberty is standing rebellious and confident, despite the dress that has slipped below her breasts. Her right arm is extended up, holding the French flag toward the sunlight. This is all well and good, except that her raised arm shows an extremely hairy armpit. It was this detail that caught the critics’ eye at the time. A goddess was always depicted with smooth, hairless skin. Critics were appalled that an allegory should have so much realism, that a goddess should resemble a natural woman so closely. The imperfection was forgiven, though, and the painting was welcomed with enthusiasm at the Louvre in 1874. Bare-breasted Liberty became such a French icon that she appears everywhere, from posters to book jackets and postage stamps. Bobby Fischer, American chess prodigy, is known for having broken many sacred rules. In one internationally acclaimed match, he sacrificed his queen, a bold move dubbed “Be6,” that won him the match. In any industry, there is a natural cycle: experts establish the rules, and practitioners follow them. But at some point, someone comes around and breaks a few of those rules. The unconventional approaches work until they become the new rules. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1285))

- lucky underwear tend to enhance self-efficacy. Science demonstrates that this is not magic. When researchers look at the psychological impact of “tools” such as four-leaf clovers, horseshoes, dice, and lucky numbers, they realize that one of the reasons they are effective is because they reduce anxiety, and anxiety has a negative impact on performance. From this angle, lucky socks can indeed be helpful in a job interview. Placebo pills are another example of how the brain turns expectations into self-fulfilling prophecy. Abundant research demonstrates how patients who take placebo pills report significant improvement when they need relief from pain, anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, digestive disorders, insomnia, and even tremors in Parkinson’s disease. The common thread across these conditions is that they impact the brain regions that generate beliefs and expectations, interpret social cues, and anticipate rewards. Using MRI and EEG technology, scientists are able to pinpoint the neurological foundation of placebos. As we saw earlier, when faced with pain or fear or stress, the brain produces its own analgesic compounds called opiates, and placebos are known to activate them.

- associations between your content and something your audience truly enjoys. This is because enjoyment feeds the expectation of a desirable future. For example, when promoting pills, advertisers are brilliant in linking the benefit of taking a specific drug to a lifestyle that gives people satisfaction. When promoting acid reflux pills, marketers don’t just show the product and say, “Take this; it will relieve your symptoms.” In an ad from Saatchi & Saatchi, for instance, the intent is to associate an acid reflux pill with areas in someone’s life that offer peace of mind: “Is it time with your children? Is it curling up with a good book on the couch? Is it your favorite television show? Is it a little purple pill that helps you get rid of acid reflux?” When interviewed, the Saatchi & Saatchi advertisers said that the uplifting associations have the potential to feed into people’s expectations and activate the placebo effect.

However, each time you’re surprising your audiences and the outcome is pleasant, you’re helping them build a new set of expectations, a new set of possibilities for the next time they see you. This means that if you choose to offer surprises and elevate the familiar each time, they will start to expect it next time in order to stay satisfied. In the 1920s, scientist Otto L.

- Anticipating well gives us not only a biological and cognitive advantage but a competitive advantage, too. For instance, experienced sports players in baseball, boxing, badminton, squash, tennis, or karate show superior performance compared with novices because they are good at anticipating an opponent’s next move. Sports psychologists consider these athletes as able to literally “expand the present.” The Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase, one of the world’s top players in the 1970s, was considered to operate on “manufactured time.” This is the result of lots of practice, which turns skills into automated actions, and it allows real-time detection of relevant information about the opponent. Based on these advantages of anticipation, let’s look at practical ways to create it for our audiences to impact the way they notice cues, search their memories, and act on intention at Point B.

- WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXPECTATION AND ANTICIPATION? It is a bit of an exercise in hairsplitting because anticipation is part of expectation, and both are related to the brain’s tendency to be on fast-forward. For this discussion, let’s consider expectations as general beliefs about the world, which produce the tacit knowledge that something is going to happen. Anticipation is thinking consciously of what’s going to happen and preparing for it. While expectations run in the background and may be generic, anticipation brings forward a specific moment. For example, let’s say you’re at a restaurant and have a sip of wine left in your glass. You’re looking forward to finishing these last few drops when the waiter takes the glass away. That’s interfering with your anticipation. However, if the waiter suddenly spills coffee on your lap, that’s interfering with your expectations. Let’s apply the same definitions of anticipation versus expectations from your audience’s perspective. When people listen to you, they hold in mind a wide range of possibilities, based on their previous knowledge, experiences, and memories of a similar context. With anticipation, you help them zoom in on a specific occurrence.

Anticipation invites others to imagine how the future unfolds, and that can impact the way they feel and make decisions.

- So far we’ve learned that anticipation has an impressive résumé: it leads to sharper focus (noticing cues), improved cognition, and faster reactions and decisions. Why does anticipation have so much power over our brains? The power stems from the “juice” that fuels it: dopamine. When we simulate the future, we are looking for rewards, and neuroscientists confirm that stimuli predicting the possibility of a reward invoke the same neuronal activity as the one triggered by the reward itself; this finding is valid in both human and animal research. Simply seeing the TV remote can get us excited in anticipation of all the fun things we get to see when we grab it.

- Dopamine spikes in anticipation of rewards. If we know how dopamine is released, we have the opportunity to impact not only the noticing of cues but also our listeners’ motivation and momentum to act on what we say. Let’s define motivation as the mental state in which we are willing to work to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment. Neuroscience research confirms that people feel more motivated to take action with a boost of dopamine. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1481))

- components: wanting, liking, and learning. Consider chocolate. Wanting implies the motivation to go get it (that extra “oomph” we need to get on our feet and do something). Liking is the pleasure we get from eating it. And learning includes associations based on past experiences, which help us predict that the next experience with the same stimulus will feel just as good. Once we get a fix, we look back on the event to extract meaning and evaluate our predictive accuracy. Research has shown that even abstract pleasures, such as completing a project, admiring a painting, listening to music, or sharing opinions with others, can be as strong in generating a pleasant experience as basic sensory pleasures, such as eating something sweet.

- Neuroscientists have dispelled the myth that dopamine mediates liking or the subjective pleasure we get from a reward. For example, researchers have observed that even patients with Parkinson’s still like the sweet taste of foods even though they endure severe dopamine depletion. In other words, we don’t need dopamine to like chocolate. We need dopamine to go get it. Why should we be concerned with dopamine when we create content? It is because the presence of dopamine increases the likelihood that people have enough motivation to not only notice cues but come and get the rewards we’re promising—and return to us again.

This mindset is important because anticipation triggers dopamine, which activates motivation and action. ([Location 1700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=1700))

- anticipation and invite action. People don’t just think about the future; they feel the future, and emotion influences decision-making.     •   People feel more motivated to take action with a boost of dopamine. The presence of dopamine increases the likelihood that people have enough motivation to not only notice cues but come and get the rewards we’re promising and return to us again.     •   Dopamine is released when we help people anticipate a reward accurately, but also when we reserve room for some uncertainty. The area of the brain that predicts rewards is the same area that handles novelty.     •   Dopamine spikes in the face of unexpected events. In general, uncertainty makes us uneasy, which is why it is often referred to as “tension.” We can tolerate some tension as long as (1) we know its degree, (2) we are reminded about the importance of the final outcome, and (3) we can tolerate the amount of delay until that outcome is realized.     •   Unusual activities or performers with skills different from your teams’ are anticipation hooks and serve as strong cues that announce worthy outcomes.     •   If the delay before realizing a promised reward is brief, find the right words for the reveal and practice them.

- When we share information at Point A, we hope others will retain it and retrieve it at Point B to inform their next action. This means that at Point A we must create a memory strong enough that it endures long term. One technique for solidifying memory is repetition. The impact of repetition on memory is rarely doubted. However, since we are looking at memory from the perspective of the future, this chapter is not so much about repeating the same message over and over at Point A.

- TIMELESS APPEAL A message can be repeatable across space (context), but it can also endure through time. How long would you like to be remembered? Is it OK if others repeat your messages only for a few months until a project or a campaign is complete? Would you like your peers to repeat your content for years, even after you’ve moved on? Or would you want others to repeat your messages for a lifetime, perhaps even after you pass away? If you want to craft a timeless message, then you aspire to create a “classic.” But what is classic? To answer this, we look beyond quantitative studies in cognitive neuroscience and learn from qualitative insights provided by sociologists, historians, writers, and anthropologists. Unlike psychologists, interested mainly in the individual, other scientists study group dynamics. If your message endures through time, that means it becomes part of a larger collective memory.

- A classic anything (book, movie, slogan, dress, gesture, one-liner) has lasting impact. For example, reflecting on the world’s greatest works of literature, historian Richard J. Smith identifies what makes a book a classic by offering a three-point checklist. Any of us can benefit from this simple guide, regardless of the type of content we create: “First,” Smith advises, “the work must focus on matters of great importance, identifying fundamental human problems and providing some sort of guidance for dealing with them. Second, it must address these fundamental issues in beautiful, moving, and memorable ways, with stimulating and inviting images. Third, it must be complex, nuanced, comprehensive, and profound, requiring careful and repeated study in order to yield its deepest secrets and greatest wisdom.” The checklist applies to short messages, too. Take the classic quote “My mama always said, ‘Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.’” You can see how it meets the three criteria. It addresses a fundamental human problem: the inability to fully predict the future. It builds a mental picture in your mind. And the metaphor bears repeating.

- In his book Why Read the Classics, Italo Calvino reveals a longer list of characteristics for a classic. Here are a few extra points that complement Smith’s checklist. In Calvino’s view, a book is a classic when:     •   It does not exhaust what it has to say to its readers.     •   The more you think you know it by hearing about it, the more original, unexpected, and innovative you find it when you actually read it.     •   You cannot remain indifferent to it; it helps you define yourself in relation to it or even in opposition to it.

- There are many paradoxes in the remembering process, one of which stems from the tension of going back to what happened in the past and trying to fit that into what the self requires in the present. From this angle, memory is adaptive. It helps us to survive another day. Sometimes memory is random. You go about your day and suddenly something pops into your head, such as that week you had a fever or the lyrics to “Love Shack.” Other times you retrieve what you need to complete a task, contribute to a conversation, emphasize a point, or bond with someone. From this angle, memory is motivated. As we aspire to create repeatable messages, we must ask: What are some motivations that prompt the repetition of those messages? Sometimes we remember things and repeat them to please ourselves; other times we remember things and repeat them to please others. Let’s look at internal motivations first.

If our audiences are likely to repeat messages to look good in front of others, it is useful to keep track of other people’s desires, beliefs, and intentions. But how do we know what others find desirable? Several previous chapters include information about people’s motivations and drivers. Here is another angle. One source we use to analyze others’ thinking and what they may find desirable is ourselves.

- When you’re speaking to listeners who are different from you, developing repeatable messages is not as easy as self-reflection. When you perceive others to be different or you’re speaking to mixed groups, you have to ask a different question: Are there universally accepted values that most people like to speak about because it will make them look good in front of others without fail? The most robust theory of basic human values has endured for almost five decades and contains the following values: achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, concern with nature, social concern, benevolence, conformity, personal security, and group security. Research based on 200 samples in more than 60 countries from every inhabited continent shows that these values are recognized across cultures. The values refer to openness to change, self-transcendence, conservation, and self-enhancement. As was the case with the human needs presented in Chapter 4, some are in conflict with each other, such as self-direction versus conformity. So when creating messages with repeatable value for mixed audiences, check to see if they match with at least one of the values from this universal set. To resolve conflict between values, zoom in on one that is a priority in the context you’re addressing. For example, at a specific moment, conformity may be more important than self-direction. Ultimately, getting our audience to repeat our words is not only about looking good in front of others; it is also about connection.

- It is possible that isolating items helps recall because it reduces interference from other elements that are too similar. Researchers suggest that when the brain detects differences between isolated and background items, encoding results in two categories: the isolated items and the background items. Since the isolated items represent a smaller category compared with the background items, recall is better for isolates. The probability of retrieving an item from one of the two categories is inversely proportional to the size of the category. This is why when we create content, it is useful to ask:   1.   How many items do we want to isolate?   2.   Do they represent the most important content we want others to remember?

- KEEP IN MIND     •   Distinctiveness is important for long-term memory because isolated items draw more attention and rehearsal time. In addition, isolated items come to the foreground, reducing interference with other items, and also appear in smaller numbers, which makes them easier to recall long term.     •   The more similar things are, the harder it will be to retrieve them later. However, similarity is important for the brain to detect distinctiveness.     •   The brain is constantly looking for rewards. In business, when many messages are the same, we can create distinctiveness, and therefore improve recall, by being specific about these rewards, which we can frame as tangible results.     •   If you’re not first to market, observe pockets of similarity in your domain and then strike with distinctiveness. Allow your audiences’ brains to habituate to similarity; it will be easier for your message to stand out.     •   The more an item differs from other items, the bigger its effect.

- Do we remember pictures more than text? Intuitively, people believe that pictures are more memorable, but let’s investigate more deeply to see if this is always so. The analysis matters because it is not always easy to create sophisticated visuals to include in our communication materials; or if we do have the budget to create amazing visuals, under some conditions, they may still be forgettable. Words and numbers are often easier and cheaper to produce, but they have some conditions for recall. Visuals seem to win memory space because we have a reflexive preference for them. We are visual beings: we take the world in mainly through visual receptors. Pictures are often more enjoyable and help us arrive at meaning more quickly. They also tend to provoke stronger emotions and provide a context. Which one would you be more likely to remember in a few days: the text or the image?

- visuals is often more efficient than processing text, especially when text is in a number format. In Brain Bugs, author Dean Buonomano says, “We can find a face in a crowd faster than we can come up with the answer to 8 × 7.” He adds, “We have an inherent sense of the quantities 1 through 3, but beyond that things get hazy. We may be able to tell at a glance whether Homer Simpson has two or three strands of hair but you will probably have to count to find out whether he has four or five fingers.” Image processing efficiency means that a picture enables us to absorb a large amount of information quickly, hence the adage “A picture is worth 1,000 words.” From a memory perspective, let’s place this maxim under scrutiny. Two scientists from the University of North Carolina recently noted, “A picture is worth 1.5 words to be exact.” They discovered that while simple line drawings resulted in superior recall compared with the printed word, this advantage disappeared when the words were spoken. This suggests that there may be another way we can ask the question about memory for images versus memory for text: In what situations are pictures not superior? Surely there are circumstances for text supremacy. If someone asked us to picture the rainbow, we could do it effortlessly. If we were asked to name the colors in the right order, we would struggle … unless we remembered the mnemonic device we learned if we attended an English-speaking school: ROY G BIV.

- because generating two memory traces (dual coding) increases the likelihood of retrieval. The same holds if we see the text “banana.” We can still encode it twice: the verbal code we see and its visual correspondent, which is easy to create because the item is easy to picture.

- Text and graphics have the potential to be equals in memory. What this means to our content creation is that we don’t have to create or buy a picture for everything we share. We can still impact others’ memory with text, as long as the text generates a mental picture and this picture is easy to form. For example, “I write this sitting in the kitchen sink” is the first line in Dodie Smith’s novel I Capture the Castle. She continues, “That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog’s blanket and… ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2452))

- Based on the evidence so far, we can infer it is possible for some text to be memorable and for pictures to be forgotten. Ultimately, images and text are both graphical elements. Each comes with its own set of conditions for impacting memory. Artist Bert Dodson offers a strong metaphor to use words and pictures for maximum memory impact. He asks us to imagine two ladders, one labeled “Words” and one labeled “Pictures.” You start climbing one of them until at some point, he says, “the climbing gets difficult.” Dodson advises that instead of getting stuck, “You simply cross over to the other ladder. Suddenly the climbing gets easy again.” So it’s not one or the other; it’s moving from one to the other.

- When content is abstract, it is important to ask: Do the abstract concepts mean the same to you as they do to your audiences? Different people have different images of abstract words, depending on various contexts, life experiences, beliefs, and current intentions. Take the word “value,” for instance. If you’re an accountant, you may understand it as the monetary worth of a specific good ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2477))

- or service. If you’re an economist, you may see it as the benefits and rights of ownership, such as utility or the possibility to exchange those goods or services for something else. If you’re in marketing, you may consider the perceptive value of a good or service and whether people are willing to pay for it because it meets a need. If you’re a mathematician, value is simply a quantity represented by a number. When we communicate in abstract concepts and leave it to an audience to come up with a mental picture for what we said, we run into a couple of problems:   1.   People may find it hard to imagine some abstractions and give up. For instance, how do you visualize these words: “Our virtualization products deliver a complete and optimized solution for your entire computing environment”? Unless you work in cloud computing, it is difficult to picture much. Your audience is likely to zone you out and focus on other stimuli that take less cognitive effort.   2.   When people don’t understand what we mean, we have to speak to them multiple times, which is ineffective. And what happens if we don’t have the opportunity to clarify our message multiple times? One way to ensure that others extract the same meaning we do about a concept is to pair abstract words with concrete pictures.

- Another advantage to linking abstract words with images is that when we process images, we store not only the meaning of the picture but also visual details, such as color, size, shape, and texture, which means we help others form multiple memory traces, increasing the likelihood of retrieval. Often communicators use visual metaphors to link abstract concepts to something concrete or specific, especially in an effort to make complexity easier to understand. Imagine something complex, such as an aircraft. Remember Bert Garrison, the SR-71 pilot? He also flew the B-52, which is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. He remembers a metaphor he was taught, which changed his flying style forever. “I was flying kind of rough, and one of my first aircraft commanders said to ‘fly like you’re chauffeuring people holding champagne glasses.’” It is a metaphor that he’s retained for decades.

In the finale of the show Mad Men, the main protagonist and advertising guru Don Draper, one of the most compelling lead characters in modern TV, ends up at a hippie commune on the California coast. During a morning therapy session, people are sitting in a circle and sharing their problems, and it looks as if Don is about to take the hot seat. However, another participant, Leonard, unexpectedly gets up, takes the hot seat instead, and tells his story: “I work in an office. People walk right by me.

And then the door closes again, the light goes off.” His words are so emotionally vivid, we can picture them and feel them, without the need for real images or PowerPoint slides. There were 3.3 million viewers who tuned in for this final episode of Mad Men, and after three days’ worth of DVR playback, that number jumped to 4.6 million, making it the show’s highest-rated episode.

- Reflecting on your own content and the emotional state of your audiences, ask: Is the emotion in the content you include appropriate for the emotional state that your audiences are likely to be in when they listen to you? Let’s see how taking into account the four emotion tracks and an audience’s emotional state plays out in real life. Shark Tank is a TV show in which five investors listen to pitches for various products and services. We can learn from this show when crafting content because it provides abundant examples of persuasive scenarios: people have something to sell, and investors need to be convinced to buy. Kevin O’Leary, one of the investors, is known for caustic criticism but also for metaphors and stories he links to business concepts. In one episode, O’Leary is talking to a couple pitching a kids’ clothing line. He is appalled that the entrepreneurs ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2732))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- had 2,700 SKUs, which they felt were needed to keep the line fresh and modern. After several business-related questions, O’Leary tells a story from Greek mythology that expresses his fear of a dangerous business tactic. O’Leary’s story is about the goddess Persephone, daughter of Zeus and Demeter. “One day she was picking flowers, and she was always tempted to go for more colors. The earth opened, and she fell into the bowels of hell. Here we are in hell.” Fellow investor Mark Cuban pretended to be asleep after the second sentence. Even investor Lori Greiner, who is typically sweet and polite, said to the entrepreneurs in reference to O’Leary, “Hell is his home.” This is an example in which the speaker’s emotion (O’Leary’s) does not match the emotional state of the others around him. “Fear” means we are moving toward a punishment, and that’s not where the others were. If anything, the high number of SKUs may cause some apprehension, which is on the other emotional scale, moving away from a reward. To avoid the raised eyebrows, a story expressing apprehension would have been better received. O’Leary knows when he is pushing buttons, so he cut the story short and made the point that too many choices have bad consequences. As we discussed earlier, there are memory trade-offs. You can take the chance and use a different emotional scale than where your audience may be and generate negative emotions. This still results in memory.

- Use Nostalgia Nostalgia is an emotion that helps to abstract and extract meaning. It is especially effective with cynical audiences because it levels the knowledge in the room. Romancing the past has the potential to strengthen the bond with others. When everyone feels like an equal, people are more likely to trust each other and are more likely to allow themselves to be swayed in a certain direction by others. This is why messages that start with “Remember when …” are so effective. Remember when we only had a few channels on TV? Remember when there were no cell phones? Remember when there was no Facebook? Nostalgia is associated with persuasion because it has the potential to impact our senses, our preferences, and our loyalty toward an object or a person. Advertisers take advantage of this. I remember a KFM radio station ad that showed a cassette tape with a callout box that said, “iPod, I am your… ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2752))

- past and build from there? The formal definition of nostalgia is a “bittersweet longing for home.” During this emotional state, we yearn for an idealized or sanitized version of the past. I can immediately relate to the definition of nostalgia because I grew up in Romania, in the 1980s, under the Communist regime. I often long for our small apartment, eating polenta after a day of unsupervised play in the streets, and not being tempted into prolonged TV watching because we only had two channels. In reminiscing about the “good old days,” we ignore many negative traces. If my own recollection of that tiny home in Romania were to include an accurate description, I would also mention how we had hot water only once a week, how the electricity would go out at random times for no apparent reason, and how you could hear all your neighbors’ arguments through the thin walls. The two hours of television a day were mostly filled with patriotic poems, sterile Communist propaganda, and censored films. These were times of scarcity and restrictions placed on almost everything, including heat, food, travel, and information.

- Research on psychological arousal finds that high arousal (versus low arousal) leads to better memory. For example, highly intense positive emotions, such as awe, excitement, and amusement, and highly intense negative emotions, such as anger and anxiety, leave a stronger impression compared with their low-arousal counterparts, such as contentment on the positive side and sadness on the negative side. The more emotionally intense and crisp your statements are, the more likely they are to be repeated. Lines such as “Come with me if you want to live” ([Location 2814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2814))

- from Terminator 2, or “I just shot Marvin in the face” from Pulp Fiction, or the pun “I am having an old friend for dinner” from The Silence of the Lambs all express strong emotions. Messages such as “Here is how to gain access to tools and resources for your job” or “Efficiency of value generation must be quantified and evaluated” are fated to be forgotten if they are not associated with emotional intensity. How do we add emotional intensity? Think of current events, and tie the stories behind them to business messages.

- Any content that has a high-arousal characteristic, such as awe, anger, amusement, or anxiety, tends to be more viral, so if we create emotion-based messages, we have the opportunity not only to influence memory but to influence more people’s memory. For example, a study analyzed all New York Times articles published online over a period of three months and discovered that those articles that contained high-arousal emotions were more likely to be e-mailed compared with articles that evoked low-level emotions, such as sadness. Emotion seems to influence not only whether a message will become repeatable but also how much and how quickly it will be repeated. A German study using SentiStrength—which analyzes emotions in tweets by looking at emotional terms, amplifications (haaaaapy), emoticons, and spelling corrections—examined 165,000 tweets and found that the more positive or negative emotions a tweet expressed, the more quickly and frequently it was retweeted.

- In this chapter, we addressed the components mandatory for creating content in such a way that it becomes easy for people to search and retrieve it days, weeks, or even years later. When we look at the combination of these elements, they provide the formula for memorable storytelling. Ultimately, all memories include some combination of sensory elements, contextual details, cognitive processes involved when that memory was formed, abstract concepts, and meaning. To make the search for memories easier at Point B, appealing to emotion ensures retrieval because of an additional marker in memory.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- KEEP IN MIND     •   Memorable stories contain the following components: perceptive (sensory impressions in context and action across a timeline), cognitive (facts, abstract concepts, and meaning), and affective (emotion).     •   Something is concrete if we can perceive it with our senses. If we can’t perceive it with our senses, we are talking about an idea or a concept, which is abstract. Balance both in your communication and, to avoid habituation, break the pattern an audience learns to expect.     •   While abstract and concrete are opposites, generic and specific are subsets of each other, with generic being a large group and specific representing an individual item within that group. Zoom in on specific details based on your audience’s level of expertise (advanced audiences can handle abstracts better).     •   Text and graphics have the potential to be equals in memory. Make pictures easy to label and text easy to picture.     •   Pair abstract words with concrete pictures to ensure that your audience extracts a uniform meaning from your message.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Use visual metaphors to explain abstract concepts. Steer away from clichéd metaphors by either giving an old metaphor a fresh meaning or using unexpected metaphors.     •   Wrap abstract words in concrete contexts. Repeat information in the same context for verbatim memory. Vary the context for gist memory.     •   Appeal to the senses to activate multiple parts of the brain and create more memory traces. The more personal experiences you share, the more opportunities to include sensory details.     •   Avoid clichéd images. Instead, use vivid images to evoke tension, mystery, wabi-sabi, or nostalgia.     •   Use strong emotions by showing an audience how to:          Move toward rewards: pleasure, happiness, elation, ecstasy, love, sexual arousal, trust, empathy, beauty.          Move away from rewards: frustration, indignation, disbelief, sadness, anger, rage.          Move toward punishments: apprehension, disgust, aversion, fear, terror, unfairness, inequity, uncertainty, social exclusion.          Move away from punishments: relief, liberation.

- A few days from now, will we remember these stories better than longer stories? Brevity is advantageous because it gets attention and sustains it since there is not much to absorb. It also creates a feeling of mastery and completion, which generates positive emotions. Message miniaturization is increasingly popular and appeals to modern audiences. But what happens when we can’t bow to the rhetoric of the micromessage? And how short is too short and how long is too long where memory is concerned? Let’s start with the assumption that you have a message that will move your audience toward a reward or away from a punishment. If this condition is not met, the discussion about optimal length does not apply because no amount of content will be memorable if it’s not linked to obtaining relevant rewards or avoiding pain. If this condition is met, consider the steps below when determining the length of your message. ([Location 2887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2887))

Someone may just want your elevator pitch. Adjust to any of these situations by starting with two questions: “What do I want the audiences to remember?” and “What do I want them to act on?” If these are clear—and knowing that we speak at a rate of about 140 to 160 words per minute—you have a metric for how much you can say in 30 seconds, 10 minutes, or 1 hour.

Reflect on ways in which you can show your audiences how much progress they’ve made toward the completion of something they find rewarding. Showing progress through a presentation, setting specific times for conversation (“I will spend 10 minutes discussing X”), and providing progress bars for content download are just a few examples of how you can positively impact the perception of time.         For written online content, reading position indicators—in the shape of color progress bars, a display with the number of words left, or even “minutes left”—helps us manage our ([Location 2965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=2965))

- Despite following these guidelines, it is possible our audiences need even more convincing to act. This chapter will equip us with additional persuasive power. Much has been published on the concept of neuroeconomics and the neurobiology of decision-making. The difference between the two fields is that neuroeconomics offers models that aim to predict or explain our observable choices. Neurobiology aims to explain the mechanisms in our nervous system that mediate behavior and generate choices. We can use insights from both fields. This chapter presents research-based guidelines to influence decision-making that have not been widely discussed beyond academic circles. HOW DOES THE BRAIN DECIDE? At the beginning of the book, we discussed three angles for understanding how the brain makes decisions. We make choices in a reflexive kind of way: we instinctively and subconsciously react to tastes, sounds, sex, novelty, altruism, or control over our environment and decide what to do next quickly and subconsciously. Reflexes require few resources. As I was writing this, an ad from Pinterest popped up on my computer saying, “Access these photos so you never miss anything on the latest fashion.” A message such as “never miss anything” is effective because it appeals to our instinct to control. It takes more energy to ignore that message than it does to indulge it. We also make choices based on habits, which we develop when we explore our external environments and inner states. Habits are conscious at first, become automatic in time, and tend to stick when they are rewarding and not costly in cognitive energy. We also decide according to goals. Depending on what we consider rewarding (public image, financial wealth, or health), we are willing to make deliberate decisions. Unlike reflexes and habits, goals require willpower, which implies more cognitive resources. As our lives unfold in a series of decisions, ranging from fully automatic to fully strategic, we may experience some tension balancing them. An instinctual voice in your head may say, “I am craving something sweet.” The automatic voice adds, “A KitKat bar would be really good.” And the strategic voice asks, “Can I afford the calories?” Reflecting on your own content, ask this: What gives your own audiences a rush? What do they crave? What lights their fire naturally? Can you divide your content approaches… ([Location 3025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3025))

- Thinking about your own content, ask this: How long has your audience been performing a task that you would like them to change? If they have not been doing it for long, present goal-oriented information (e.g., “reduce Facebook time to be more productive at work”). If they’ve been doing it for a long time, tie the change you want to see to an existing habit (e.g., “every time a Facebook notification pops up, write a sentence for work before opening it”). If your content is aimed at convincing people to change an existing habit, it’s important to remember that habits are formed by doing, not by not doing. Frame your messages in a positive way. Imagine if the famous slogan “Just do it” was “Don’t procrastinate.” ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3090))

- What can we apply from prospect theory when we create persuasive content? We can frame messages to emphasize gains or losses. Research in the health industry, for example, looks at gain-framed versus loss-framed messages and concludes that for prevention medicine where the risk is low, gain-framed messages are more likely to lead to behavior change. For instance, “Join us to find out how an increase in your walking regimen helps to prevent heart disease” works well because there is little risk in walking. This may also work because it promotes self-efficacy and positive emotions. Gain-framed messages also appear to have a bigger impact on how they are processed and therefore remembered later.

- When we ask people to act on something in our favor, we must ask: Are they familiar enough with us? Often, communicators are too ambitious and ask for a decision before familiarity is assured and risk is addressed. Audiences also respond to the authority heuristic when they believe the content they see comes from an authority figure. Ensure your content is well researched, and include third-party confirmation of your credibility. ([Location 3275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3275))

- The way your audiences view time impacts their decision-making. How do we know this? We know temporal judgment takes place in the same brain regions as decision-making. People who seek immediate gratification tend to have larger neural responses when judging short delays than when judging long delays, while those who are patient in terms of gratification show the opposite. In fact, scientists can predict simply by looking at brain activity whether someone will place value on something that will happen in the future (and is willing to wait for it) or simply discount it and look elsewhere. Temporal discounting means that we tend to prefer smaller-now versus larger-later rewards. This could be because the future seems more abstract and uncertain, while closer events are more vivid and concrete. So if you are offering content and promises that will materialize at some point in the future, make them vivid and concrete to increase the affective impact. To test this hypothesis, ([Location 3289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3289))

- researchers asked participants while in an MRI scanner, “Would you prefer $20 now or $40 in one month?” They also gave participants a concrete context in which they could spend either choice they selected (e.g., a pub). In some conditions, participants were asked to describe what a delayed reward could buy them, while in others, they were asked to imagine how the money could be spent in the future. Participants were also asked to rate the vividness of the emotional intensity associated with what they described or imagined. The results showed that imagining specific ways in which to spend the money led to more vivid imagination and higher emotional intensity. These dimensions impacted their choice of rewards. Participants who scored higher for vividness and emotional intensity opted for the longer-term payoffs. The ability to imagine future events shapes their affective value, which influences current decisions. ([Location 3296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3296))

- Many are familiar with the classic marshmallow test in which researchers at Stanford worked with over 600 kids to study delayed gratification. Children were told they could have one marshmallow at the time of the study or two marshmallows if they waited 15 minutes. There has been a recent twist on this test. Researchers wanted to see whether waiting for a larger reward was simply a sign of self-control or whether the environment played a role as well. Celeste Kidd, the lead author of the new study, stated, “Delaying gratification is only the rational choice if the child believes a second marshmallow is likely to be delivered after a reasonably short delay.” In her experiment, she told kids they would receive supplies to complete an art project. In one of the groups, the promise for better supplies was not kept, and kids were made to feel that the environment in which they were working was not “stable.” Then the same kids were invited to complete the marshmallow test. Only 1 out of the 14 kids who ([Location 3309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3309))

- had been in the “unstable environment” group waited for 15 minutes to receive the second marshmallow. Kidd was inspired to create the study after volunteering at a homeless shelter, where she observed how kids were fighting for resources. “When one child got a toy or treat, there was a real risk of a bigger, faster kid taking it away,” she said. “I read about these studies and I thought, ‘All of these kids would eat the marshmallow right away.’” Reflecting on your content and the decisions you’re asking others to make, ask this: How stable do they perceive the environment to be? In gauging the time delay before they receive a reward for making a decision, are you able to help them perceive a stable environment? For example, if a new software platform will be implemented, showing how many other systems (financial, operational) will stay in place until one major change is completed helps ease the tension of uncertainty.

- A company we can learn from in terms of adjusting messaging to how other people think and what they consider rewarding is Domino’s Pizza. Recently, the company has had great success in India because it tapped into several social dimensions that impact decisions: it hooked into existing cultural keystones (sharing food and eating with your hands); it did not impose fully Western menus but rather included local options; and it recognized that people like to make an impression by being seen appreciating “Western anything.” For example, in northern India, Domino’s offered the Taco Indiana, a combination of kebabs, parathas, and pizza. In a Domino’s ad, a woman tells a man that he is like a Taco Indiana: “Western-looking on the outside, but Indian on the inside.” In southern India, where pizza is not so popular, instead of forcing something new, Domino’s provided ingredients that locals appreciate. That’s how the spicy, raw-banana pizza was born.

- filling, a “Western slice that tastes just Indian enough.” Are you able to consider others’ thinking and create your message from where they are sitting? Can you phrase your message in such a way that if people acted on it, they would look good in front of others? Are you offering a slice of content that is “[socially desirable concept] enough and [socially desirable concept] enough”? The repetition is intended to prompt us to include seemingly contradictory values. For instance, we may like to project an image of authority but also one of humility, both of which are socially desirable.

- KEEP IN MIND     •   If your audience has been performing a task for a long time, link your content to an existing habit. If there are no habits related to your products or ideas, present goal-oriented information. When you do it repeatedly, you help an audience form new habits.     •   Habits are formed by doing, not by not doing. Frame your messages in a positive way.     •   Decisions typically include four steps:         1.   Identify sensory stimuli: What are they?         2.   Select an action that will maximize a reward: What is it worth?         3.   Act on the intention.

- 4.   Evaluate the results: Did you predict the outcome well?     •   The values our audiences assign to different objects, people, and experiences can range from functional and concrete to something more abstract. People buy things because of emotional, epistemological, aesthetic, hedonistic, or situational value. Clarify these values for your audiences.     •   Even unattended stimuli influence choice. There is no break from greatness for the communicator who aspires to be influential, because everything you share has the potential to influence decisions.     •   Variables that have an impact on our choices include effort to get the reward (physical, financial, or mental), time delay until we get the reward, perception of risk in getting the reward, and social impact in relation to that reward.     •   If your audiences perceive a high amount of uncertainty in their interactions with you, consider heuristics, such as availability, familiarity, or authority, to help them make quick decisions.     •   Fast decision-making is also based on the perception of a stable environment and social factors.     •   A balance between desirability and feasibility leads to more persuasive content. This is because feasibility will help people with their own decisions, and desirability will help them in their transactions with others.     •   Develop content that hooks into rewards from the past but also provides sources for new rewards.

- The ability of your audiences to remember will influence their decisions, but their ability to forget may be equally important to your cause. Think of it this way: forgetting is accidental or purposeful. Accidental forgetting happens when people fail to encode new information we provide them or when existing knowledge we’ve given them decays over time because of a lack of reactivation. Forgetting is purposeful when we want to convince people to give up old routines in favor of new thinking. In this case, it is preferable that audiences forget the old and remember the new. Reflecting on your own content, consider catering to both types of forgetting: reactivate your most important message often to avoid accidental forgetting and purposefully direct your audiences’ attention toward new things ([Location 3540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3540))

- When we share information at Point A and plan for people to remember and act on it at Point B, the trajectory is not always a straight line. Portions of their lives often unfold like S shapes. Our audiences may plan to do something and may start off slowly at first, settling into routines or “best practices,” until something happens. An updated technology, a market crash, or a company restructure provides enough disruption, and a new S shape emerges. When we plan to influence other people’s memories and decisions, we must anticipate that these moments may occur in their lives, so we must be ready to generate new content and to associate it with new cues, memories, and decisions when disruption hits. Analyzing your content and your audiences’ context, consider studying literature on “black swans,” unexpected events that can have an extreme impact on your goals and ([Location 3556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3556))

- One of the most important memory lessons I remember from graduate school came from Steve Joordens, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough. In one of his lectures, Joordens discusses Dante’s Inferno, in which Dante travels to various circles of hell and meets horribly tormented souls. When they realize Dante will eventually return to the land of the living, the most pressing wish of these tormented souls is to be remembered by those who are still alive. At some point, we all desire to be in other people’s memories and to impact them in some way. Being on someone’s mind and influencing decisions is a position of honor and responsibility. UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, reminds us that “wars begin in the minds of people” and “that’s where peace can be constructed too.” Using the guidelines in this book, consider placing in people’s minds thoughts and ideas that are enduring enough and rewarding enough to take us on fulfilling paths. After all, if people remember you, you are still alive. ([Location 3582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3582))

- Imagine your content as a sequence of segments (e.g., slides in a sales deck, paragraphs in a blog, messages in a marketing campaign, or sections in a training program—each of which has a strong meaning if viewed in isolation). At a macro level (e.g., deck, campaign, or training session), include, on average, 9 of the variables from the checklist in at least half of your segments. This will help with gist memory (people will retain the general meaning of your communication). To ensure that a variable is present in your content, use the checklist to score its level of intensity on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest. To create precise memories and compel action, at a micro level, 40% of the segments in your content need to be intense, meaning you must include at least 7 of the variables in the same segment. For example, you might create a slide ([Location 3592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DZ2EO7E&location=3592))
