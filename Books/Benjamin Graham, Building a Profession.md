## Highlights
- Every decade or so, critics have fired their peashooters at Graham, carping that he is out of touch, obsolete, irrelevant. What the nitpickers always fail to see is that the passage of time has the same effect on Graham as it has on Shakespeare or Galileo or Lincoln: The unfolding years provide ever more ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=75))

- evidence of his importance. No one else, before or since, has surpassed Graham’s intellectual firepower and common sense, his literary mastery, his psychological insights, and his dedication to the dignity of security analysis as a profession. He matters more today than ever before. Can anyone possibly doubt that the Internet bubble and the credit crisis would have been less devastating if more investors had taken Graham to heart? There are few things we can be certain of in the world of financial analysis. This is one: A generation from now, and in all the decades to come, Benjamin Graham will be regarded as an even more indispensable guide than he is today. Read on, and see why.

- What should separate investors from speculators, Graham argued, was not what they chose to buy but how they chose it. At one price, any security could be a speculation; at another (lower) price, it became an investment. And in the hands of different people, the same security—even at the same price—could be either a speculation or an investment, depending on how well they understood it and how honestly they assessed their own limitations. Most shockingly of all to readers traumatized by the Crash of 1929, Graham insisted that even a margined trade on a merger arbitrage need not be speculative. Analyzed properly from the right point of view, it turned into an investment.10 The task of the financial analyst, Graham proposed, was to think like an investor regardless of the form of the security being analyzed.11 ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=158))

- In immortal words that should be inscribed upon the doorposts of every fiduciary, Graham wrote: “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”12 ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=165))

- In one mighty blow, Graham had shattered the false dichotomy between bonds as investments and stocks as speculations. Bonds could be speculative, and stocks most assuredly could be investments. The job of the analyst was to determine which was which—based not upon the form of the security but rather upon its quality and its price relative to value.

- Getting a CFA charter is such hard work that it seldom occurs to the people who have one that the designation might have been even more difficult to create than it is to obtain. Only by taking a closer look at how the CFA designation came about can you fully grasp how difficult the struggle was. But there is an even more important reason to understand how the CFA designation developed: To know what it means to be a security analyst today, you should know what it meant to Benjamin Graham. From the outset, when he first proposed what he called the QSA (qualified security analyst) designation in “Should Security Analysts Have a Professional Rating? The Affirmative Case,” Graham insisted on professional standards that were both broad and deep. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=231))

- The qualified analyst, he wrote, would: Possess “good character” “Observe rules of ethical conduct” Pass an exam to demonstrate “knowledge of his field” Obtain required experience to show “professional competence” Be devoted to “advancing the standards of his calling” ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=240))

- It is striking how Graham emphasizes the element of “good character.” In the introduction to the 1945 essay that kicks off Part 1 of this volume, he places it first, ahead of even “education and experience.” In his final sentence, he returns to it, placing it before “sound competence.” What exactly did Graham mean by good character? In his own private life, he flouted conventional standards of morality. Graham certainly would have agreed with the pungent observation of H. L. Mencken in 1919 that great achievers do not “come from the ranks of the hermetically repressed.”1 ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=243))

- But Graham’s definition of character goes beyond honesty and integrity. To him, the word “character” captures not just how you act but how you think. Although he never pairs the two words directly, Graham uses “character” as a synonym for “rationality.” In 1949, Graham answered the rhetorical question of what it means to be an “intelligent” investor: The word “intelligent” . . . will be used . . . as meaning “endowed with the capacity for knowledge and understanding.” It will not be taken to mean “smart” or “shrewd,” or gifted with unusual foresight or insight. Actually the intelligence here presupposed is a trait more of the character than of the brain.4 And, in 1976, he summed up investing with these words: “The main point is to have the right general principles and the character to stick with them.”5 In short, when Graham said an analyst must possess good character, he was thinking of a set of traits—what we might call a mental toolkit—that he so often praises throughout his writings: A hunger for objective evidence As Graham put it, “operations for profit should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic.”6 An independent and skeptical outlook that takes nothing on faith Your skepticism must also be directed at your own beliefs.

- The patience and discipline to stick to your own convictions when the market insists that you are wrong In Graham’s words: “Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may hesitate or differ. (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.)”7 What the ancient Greek philosophers called ataraxia, or serene imperturbability—the ability to stay calm and keep your head when all investors about you are losing theirs One of Graham’s wives described him as “humane, but not human.”8 While it may have made Graham less than ideal as a husband, that quality of cool detachment made him a superb analyst. “Good character” consists of these characteristics. Training, education, and experience can go only so far. No matter how thorough your analysis, you must also develop self-control and emotional discipline, or you will never be able to hold your views steadfastly against the whims of the market. In “On Being Right in Security Analysis,” Graham raises a question that sounds easy to answer: How should analysts (or their clients) determine whether their recommendations were valid? Two factors combine to make the question far more difficult than it sounds. First, the extent of learning depends on the quality of feedback: How much we can find out about the results of our actions depends on how well we can track them. Tennis players, anesthesiologists, and firefighters are among the many practitioners who can learn steadily through repetition and experience. Their work environments offer prompt and unambiguous feedback: They do not have to wait an indeterminate amount of time to learn whether the ball was in or out, the patient lived or died, or the fire was properly controlled. Security analysts, on the other hand, practice their craft in an environment that provides delayed and ambiguous feedback: You recommend a stock at 20. The next day it goes to 21; you seem right already. A week later it is at 18; now you seem wrong. The next month it is at 25; right again! Six months after your recommendation, it is at 14; wrong again, you start to check your earnings model for errors. A year after your recommendation, it is at 30; now you were right all along. Because market prices change so much so often, the feedback you get is in continuous flux, making it extraordinarily difficult to know what to conclude about the quality of your analysis.9 Second, humans are better at rationalizing than at being rational. When reality makes mincemeat of our forecasts, we do not say we were wrong. Instead, we say that we were right too soon, that we will be proven right in the end, that we were almost right, that we were closer to being right than anyone else was, or that uncontrollable forces that no one could have foreseen prevented our reasonable assumptions from being realized.10… ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=273))

- explicitly compare the practice of security analysis to the practice of medicine.11 Doctors, he contends, have a deeper body of knowledge to draw on: decades of scientific evidence on symptoms, causes, and treatments. Analysts, in contrast, must contend with a lack of “systematic knowledge” about the performance of securities with various characteristics. That shortcoming has largely been cured, in the intervening years, by the publication of vast numbers of empirical papers in the Financial Analysts Journal, the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Portfolio Management, and elsewhere. Indeed, many investors now regard the kinds of questions that Graham raised here as having been answered once and for all: Empirical research appears to have proven, for example, that small stocks will outperform large and that “value” will outperform “growth” stocks.12 For those who think this way, however, in “The Hippocratic Method in Security Analysis,” Graham has another warning: By the time we have completed the cumbersome processes of inductive study, by the time our tentative conclusions have been checked and counterchecked through a succession of market cycles, the chances are that new economic factors will have supervened—and thus our hard won technique becomes obsolete before it is ever used. The discovery of market anomalies lays the groundwork for their destruction: Once investors recognize that a strategy has outperformed reliably in the past, they rush into it, hampering its ability to excel… ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=310))

- “There is only one objection to this procedure,” writes Graham. Without a rigorous assessment of whether the value of the underlying business is above or below the current market price for the stock, this kind of analysis “is not good enough. It is not real analysis, but pseudo analysis.” That critique, written in 1946, still hits distressingly close to home today.

- Analysts recommend bonds and preferred issues as well as common stocks. The warranty behind each such suggestion is that the issue has quality at least commensurate to the yield. Such recommendations may be tested two ways: either by the review of the analysis of quality or by the subsequent market action of the issues approved, preferably as compared with a suitable group index. This field of activity does not raise serious problems of testing, except where very refined results are required. Assuming we can test the analyst’s performance on individual recommendations, we can develop a crude batting average for his work, based solely on the percentage of times he is right out of total number of recommendations made. How high should this average be for a good analyst? And is it necessary to refine this test by distinguishing between “very right” or “very wrong” and just “rightish” or “wrongish”?

- Both medicine and security analysis partake of the mixed nature of an art and a science; in both the outcome is strongly influenced by unknown and unpredictable factors; in both we may find—in Henderson’s phrase—“the concealment of ignorance, probably more or less unconsciously, with a show of knowledge.” ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GIPEDQ&location=525))
