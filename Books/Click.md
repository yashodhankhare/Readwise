## Highlights
- So what’s the difference? What makes one new ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=68))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- product a runaway success? What makes another fail? Of course, there are a zillion factors. Team. Management. Technology. Execution. Design. Pricing. Timing. Luck. But all of these lead (or don’t) to one decisive question: ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=68))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Does it click? This is the most important thing. The product and the customer must fit together, like two LEGO bricks. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=70))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If a product solves an important problem, stands out from the competition, and makes sense to people, it clicks. If not, it’s a dud. That’s it. Making it click is the fundamental key to success. I know, this is pretty obvious stuff. But even though it’s the most important thing for any big project… it’s kind of easy to lose track of the click. We get wrapped up in the technology and execution and design and pricing and all the other important factors—and in the noise, we forget the paramount question: When we offer this to people, will they want it? All too often, we bet on the wrong strategy, and our products don’t click, they flop. But it doesn’t have to be like this. There is a better way. And that’s what this book is all about. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=72))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This book is about unlocking the power of the fundamentals. Teams who build winning products share some fundamental traits. They know their customers—and what problem they can solve for them. They know which approach to take—and why it’s superior to the alternatives. They know what they’re up against—and how to radically differentiate from the competition.

- As an investor, I’m biased toward outcomes, and as a human, I’m biased toward meaning. I want projects to be both successful for their creators and valuable to the people they serve. That’s why I’m super excited to share the Foundation Sprint with you. In the Foundation Sprint, you create, as our cofounder Eli says, “the atomic building blocks of a great product.” You craft an essential, just-what-you-need strategy at warp speed. Arguments disappear. Distractions evaporate. You can feel like a kid completely absorbed in an exciting project. You can also practice a new way of working with your colleagues, building great habits for today’s ambitious effort and beyond. And you do all this with your customers—and what they want—at the center of your attention. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=163))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But there is a small problem. This lesson—“Drop everything and sprint on the most important challenge until it’s done”—is easy to say. But it’s not easy to do. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=237))

- Group brainstorms are in our DNA. They’re fun—at least, for extroverts. But they don’t work. They produce mediocre ideas. They exclude those who aren’t comfortable in the group, those who don’t excel at verbal sales pitches, and those who do their best thinking in silence. So when it’s time for you and your team to collaborate, do NOT brainstorm out loud. Do NOT have an open-ended discussion. Instead, work alone together.

- Give each person time to generate proposals in silence, time to review others’ proposals in silence, and time to form opinions and vote in silence. Silent, parallel work is counterintuitive but profoundly effective. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=293))

- Start the Foundation Sprint by establishing the Basics: who your customer is, the problem you want to help them solve, your team’s unique advantages, and your strongest competition. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=314))

- In the executive’s presentation, he talks a lot about what the toy’s sales could do for the company, but doesn’t say a thing about what the toy could do for kids. And in real life? A lot of projects out there are Skyscraper Robots. We focus on what we want rather than what we can do for our customers. We put profits and ego first, losing sight of the fact that if customers don’t care, there won’t be any money or glory at all. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=334))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But absurdity—and worse—happens when we don’t put the customer first. This brings me to the second key lesson for making things click: 2. Start by identifying your customer and a real problem you can solve. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=341))

- Use the Note-and-Vote instead of a group brainstorm ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=362))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We created a method called the Note-and-Vote to help teams quickly find good ideas and make decisions. Mark this page, because you’ll use the Note-and-Vote a bunch of times throughout the Foundation Sprint. It works like this: ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=363))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- With a conventional group brainstorm, one idea jumps out—either because it’s the first reasonable suggestion or because it’s presented by the loudest voice—and then that idea dominates the discussion. Group brainstorms are a highway to hell consensus. Not just consensus, but mediocre consensus. With a Note-and-Vote, you boost quality by tapping the power of working alone together. Each person develops opinions independently, without trying to talk and think at the same time (which I, for one, cannot do). And, because the proposals are anonymous, you can vote, debate, and decide without worrying about flattering or offending your colleagues. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=379))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In addition to the quality of the proposals, the depth of the participation, and the honesty of the discussion, the Note-and-Vote has another important advantage: It’s WAY faster than group brainstorms and open-ended discussions. I predict you’ll love it. We’ve led hundreds—maybe thousands!—of these Note-and-Votes, and we find that they work best if you use two simple tricks: plain language and the common sense test. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=385))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Take the common sense test When you’re finished identifying the customer and problem, ask the team: “Does this make sense?” ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=396))

- 3. Take advantage of your advantages. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=417))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So what are your advantages? They come in three different flavors: capability, motivation, and insight. To show you how these different kinds of advantages work, let me take you back to the year 2014 and introduce you to three people who eventually became startup founders. As we go, see if you can identify the advantages they bring to their projects—and take a guess at what kind of company each might eventually create. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=420))

- Let’s review, starting with customers and problems: Katie is solving inefficient industrial control systems for big manufacturers. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=452))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Jim is solving electricity-guzzling data centers for Google. Veda is solving… hmm. I don’t think he’s really solving Go. I think the problem he’s solving is actually the brain’s limited capacity to deal with complex problems, and I think his “customer” is humanity. I know, that sounds a bit grandiose, but I think it’s right. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=453))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Notice that, for two of the three, the primary fuel was frustration. If that’s your motivation, hey, that’s okay. Some of the world’s best products were created by people who were aggravated, vexed, galled, rankled, or driven bananas by the status quo. You don’t have to start with a grand vision. Fury works. Okay, with capability and motivation combined, these future founders’ advantages become more unique. But what kind of company might each one create? Let’s follow their stories a little further to find out. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=470))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To get there, they needed the third type of advantage: insight. Insight is a deep understanding of the problem and of customers. Insight gives you a perspective that others just don’t have. Jim had insight into data centers, and Veda had insight into deep reinforcement learning, but what unlocked Phaidra’s strategy was Katie’s insight into how industrial plants—and the companies who run them—operate. When you combine the capabilities and insight of the three Phaidra founders, you get something special. You can think of it as an equation: capability + insight + motivation = unique advantage ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=514))

- set on signing with Adidas. Converse is his backup plan. He won’t even agree to meet with Nike. What follows is, essentially, a sprint. Sonny has only days to change Jordan’s mind. Sonny needs a winning strategy, fast. Like the teams we work with, he starts with the customer problem: Sonny’s customer is Michael Jordan. Jordan’s problem? On the surface, it’s “How do I get the best shoe deal?” But Sonny recognizes that Jordan is special, so his problem is more like, “How do I get the most out of being a superstar?” Sonny has special insight—he sees something in Jordan that others do not. And Nike is desperate. They’re in last place. They’re motivated by frustration. So, inspired and outgunned, Sonny breaks all the rules. He convinces Nike founder Phil Knight (Ben Affleck) to abandon the plan of signing several athletes and instead offer the entire basketball budget to Jordan. He convinces Nike designer Peter Moore to do something unheard of—design a signature basketball shoe for a rookie. Not only that, but, against the wishes of Jordan’s agent, Sonny goes so far as to visit Jordan’s parents at their home in North Carolina—uninvited. In North Carolina, he realizes something big: his real customer is not Michael Jordan, it’s Jordan’s mom, Deloris (Viola Davis). She is the one he has to convince. Sitting across the table from Deloris, with the Jordans ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=560))

- slated to meet Converse and Adidas in a matter of days, Sonny decides this moment is his only chance to change her mind. “I’ll make a bet with you,” he says. “I’ll tell you exactly how those meetings are gonna go. And if I’m wrong, then don’t take a meeting with Nike. But if I’m right, please consider that you and Michael come out.” He goes on to predict that Converse won’t have a plan for making Jordan stand out from Magic, Bird, and Dr. J. He predicts that Adidas’ leadership will appear disorganized—a problem, he points out, that will cause headaches for Jordan in the future. I don’t think I’ll spoil the movie for you if I give away the ending, because everyone knows what happened. Sonny’s predictions come true, and Michael and Deloris agree to visit Nike. Deloris tells Nike they’ll have to give… ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=571))

- The first Air Jordan was black, red, and white. (The color scheme violated NBA rules, but Nike paid Jordan’s fines.) The shoe is a work of art, with a bold design and elegant lines. When Michael Jordan held it in his hands for the first time? It clicked. Watching it happen on-screen, this sneakerhead got goose bumps. But it’s that backyard conversation between Sonny and Deloris that is the key moment in the movie. Sonny’s knowledge of the competition earns Deloris’s respect. And in that conversation, Sonny foreshadows how his knowledge of the competition will shape Nike’s winning strategy. Adidas looks disorganized? Nike will demonstrate its vision with an over-the-top offer. Converse won’t put Jordan above its… ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=580))

- Or you might be competing against nothing Remember how I JUST said that no competition usually means there’s not a real problem? Well, the word usually is key. Usually, no competition means the team is deluding itself. But sometimes customers do have a real problem; it’s just that nobody has offered a reasonable solution yet. In these situations, you’re competing with nothing. These are the riskiest opportunities, but also the most exciting. At Character Capital, we encountered this situation with a startup that made it easy for small businesses to calculate their carbon footprint. When we did this step in a Foundation Sprint with the team, they ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=610))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- realized that the “competition” they were up against was… their customers doing nothing and feeling bad about it. So they wrote that down and took their best shot at designing a product that was better than doing nothing. In the end, the startup abandoned the carbon-accounting idea because not enough small businesses were willing to pay for their product. As I said, it’s risky competing with nothing! In this case, the startup learned that “do nothing and feel bad about it” was tough to beat, and pivoted in another direction. Another Character investment, a startup called House Rx, helps medical clinics set up in-house pharmacies so that patients with complex or chronic conditions can more easily get the specialty medications they need. Before House Rx developed their solution, it was impossible for clinics to run their own pharmacy—so they, too, were competing against “do nothing.” But in this case, their strategy clicked. They designed a service that offered so much value to clinics and their patients that they overcame the inertia of “do nothing.” It can be done, and it can lead to something awesome, but don’t expect it to be easy.

- Setting your sights high will push you to create the best possible solution. Sonny didn’t tell Deloris Jordan how Nike was better than Keds or New Balance, because those companies weren’t serious contenders. To make your solution click, you’ll have to stand out from the best. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=632))

- Design differentiation that will set you far apart from the competition, then write project principles to bring your differentiation to life. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=645))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 5. Differentiation makes products click. When you create a new product or service, you’re asking people to make a change, and every change has a cost. To get people to pay that cost—whether it’s money, time, effort, risk, stress, or just brainpower—your solution must stand out. That’s where differentiation comes in. Differentiation is… well, it’s what makes your product or service different from the alternatives. It’s the essence of your solution; the most important message that customers need to understand. It’s how you capture customers’ attention, and why they switch. It’s what makes your solution click. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=685))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The most successful products don’t just differentiate a little—they create radical separation from the competition. These products make a bold and exciting promise: “Try the new way, and it will blow the old way out of the water.” To do this, they offer customers not just a new solution, but a brand-new framework for evaluating solutions. They illuminate factors that people may never have considered, or may not have realized could be improved. The most successful products change how customers see the world.

- Strong differentiators can create a durable opening in the market. Even years later, Google Meet’s differentiation holds up against Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Apple’s FaceTime. Sure, there are other criteria that are more important to some customers, but for those who value browser-based simplicity, Google Meet still stands out. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=709))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Once you start seeing the world through differentiation goggles, it’s hard to stop. So let’s make a few more diagrams. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=712))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Differentiation looks different for every solution—that’s kind of the point. But getting it right is always a big deal. No, strike that. It’s a HUGE deal. Because, again, it helps both your customer and your team. Differentiation helps your customers at every stage of their experience. At first, it helps them understand ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=729))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- why your solution is worth learning about. Later, it helps them understand why it’s worth adopting. Eventually, it helps them explain your solution to other people. Differentiation is a throughline from the moment you start building your product to the moment customers encounter your new creation to the moment they recommend it to someone else. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=732))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Differentiation also energizes your team. To explain what I mean, consider the opposite: a project that copies the competition and offers nothing special to customers. Working on that irrelevant project would probably feel uninspiring and demoralizing. What’s the point of giving your best effort if nobody cares about the result? But with clear differentiation, the team comes alive. They know what they’re building and why it’s exciting. They know why they work here and not for the competition. Doing something that’s never been done before, something that will matter to customers? That’s invigorating. As our cofounder Eli says, “Differentiation builds clarity and momentum.” ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=735))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Start with “realistic optimism” At the risk of sounding hippy-dippy, you gotta start in the right mindset. If you’re too negative, you’ll sell your team short and miss the best differentiators. If you’re overly optimistic, you’ll pick dream-world differentiators that are unachievable. Instead, use realistic optimism. This is no compromise—it’s pure optimism; it’s just tethered to reality. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=745))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Follow our differentiation recipe I have to level with you: Finding great differentiators ain’t easy. It requires deep thought, considering multiple perspectives, and experimentation. That’s why most leaders and teams don’t ever get to great differentiation—which is too bad, because they miss out on all the benefits I outlined earlier. It’s not easy, but it’s also not rocket science. The way I see it, great differentiation is like making pizza from scratch. If you have the right recipe and ingredients, and you’re willing to give a special effort, anybody can do it. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=754))

- So what do you believe matters most to your customers? What factor could make your solution unique—and, importantly, what crummy opposite attribute could describe the competition? Once again, work alone together so that each person has a chance to create their own scales. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=771))

- Make a 2x2 chart with extreme differentiation In 2007, Steve Jobs walked onstage to introduce a new product. He put up a slide with what he called a “business school 101 graph.” One axis went from smart to not so smart; the other from easy to use to hard to use. Jobs proceeded to fill out the graph with the competition. Regular cell phones (remember those?) weren’t smart, he said, but they also weren’t that easy to use. Smartphones (in 2007) were kind of smart, but even harder to use than regular cell phones. “We don’t want to do either one of those things,” he said. “We want to make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super easy to use.” He pointed at the top right corner, where a single word appeared: “iPhone.” ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=779))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- That slide wasn’t just marketing fluff. You can bet there was as much emphasis on easy to use during the development of the iPhone as there was onstage. That’s something at which Apple still excels: they build the same thing that they market. There is one throughline from development to delivery, and it’s focused on the customer. I want you and your team to have Jobs-like clarity, and a 2x2 chart of your own is a powerful tool to help you get there. So, once you’ve chosen your top two differentiators—whether they’re classic or custom—make a 2x2 chart, place your project in the top right, place the top competitors on there, and adjust your differentiators until it’s realistic, optimistic, and you’ve got the top right quadrant to yourself. Now, if you’re a skeptic, I get it. We’ve all seen mediocre 2x2s. They’re usually throwaway slide-deck fillers, hastily created and short-lived. They typically focus on technology, logistics, industry… everything but the most important thing: Customer perception. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=786))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And in these mediocre 2x2s, the magic upper right quadrant is often littered with alternatives. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=793))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is not good enough. If you’re only 3 percent better than the competition, it won’t be worth the calories for your customers to even think about trying your product. Make it an easy decision for them. When you create your 2x2, keep trying until you find differentiators that put you all alone in that top right quadrant and push the competition into the other three quadrants (which form an L shape that I like to think of as Loserville). ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=795))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- leaders and teams don’t get the differentiators right on the first try, so don’t worry if it takes some effort. Differentiating ain’t easy. If you’re honest about the strengths of the competition and your own advantages, and if you put in the time to find the right factors, the 2x2 differentiation chart is a simple, clear, and powerful method of stating your strategy. Of course, it’s still just a hypothesis and you still have to prove it, but it’s a fantastic way to start. A great 2x2 chart can become a beacon for everyone who interacts with the project. The leaders will know exactly what value they’re creating for their customers, the builders will know what they’re building, the marketers will know what they’re selling, the buyers will know what they’re buying, and the recommenders will know what they’re recommending. You’ll make a million decisions during your project, and this simple chart can help you make the right choices by reminding you of what matters most.

The orientation staff handed out garish propeller hats in blue, yellow, red, and green with the word Noogler (short for “new Googler”) stitched on the front.I They showed us presentations about how the search engine worked. They also introduced us to a document called “Ten Things We’ve Found to Be True.” “Ten Things” was a list of lessons learned in Google’s first years.

- Use practical principles to reinforce differentiation. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=837))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The word practical is important here. Like 2x2 charts, principles are common but rarely relevant. Plenty of teams have phrases like “pursue excellence” or “always be innovating” listed in some forgotten document, the dust-covered relic of a team off-site or a boss with too much spare time. They’re well-intentioned but ignored. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=838))

- So how do you get practical decision-making principles for your own project? Here are our techniques: Practical principles, not company principles First, don’t try to write company principles. Instead, keep it simple and just write principles to help with the project at hand. One huge reason why the “big three” Google principles are useful is that they came from the earliest days of the company. They’re a time capsule from an era when Google was a tiny startup who had to get every project right. As a result, the principles are imbued with a sense of urgency. That makes them easier to translate into action. Or consider Apple’s principles, written by Mike Markkula in 1977, when the company was a startup ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=847))

- on the verge of launching its first major product, the Apple II. Paraphrasing, the three principles are: 1. Understand customer needs better than any other company 2. Eliminate unimportant opportunities 3. People DO judge a book by its cover These aren’t the principles of an established company with the luxury to sit around and describe how to treat one another nicely. This list is a survival guide. Sure, this manifesto just so happened to serve Apple well for decades, but it wasn’t designed to do that. These principles were written for 1977, to get the Apple II out the door, into the world, and onto customers’ desks. They were written to keep a tiny company from going bankrupt. Urgency is what made them great. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=853))

- A handy trick for writing this kind of principle is to answer the question “What advice would I give a new team member to make sure we follow through on our differentiation?” That’s what a good principle is: advice for your future self and your future team.

- Differentiate, differentiate, safeguard How many principles should you write? I think a good number is three. I suggest using the “Differentiate, differentiate, safeguard” formula: one principle for each of your two differentiators (from chapter 5), plus one to protect against the unintended consequences of building a product that’s successful in an unfortunate way.

- Pivoting as you learn is smart. Very few products click with customers before pivoting at least once. Slack started out as a computer game called Glitch. Nike started out as Blue Ribbon Sports, an importer of Japanese running shoes. Yes, pivoting is smart. However, it’s also time-consuming. When I failed to get a cookie, it took only a few minutes to acquire an apple. But when a big project flops, it typically takes months—or longer—to try a different approach. Glitch took two years to build, and when it faltered, it was another two years before the launch of Slack. Blue Ribbon Sports scraped along for seven years as an importer before manufacturing the first Nike shoe. Most teams don’t have that kind of stamina. They run out of conviction, cohesion, motivation, and money long before they relaunch. But what if you could pivot before you even began?

- By this time, I was working at Google, and I began to follow my dad’s advice. I started going out of my way to find contrary opinions. I forced myself to listen to the engineers before making a sales pitch for my own ideas. In meetings, I tried to list my colleagues’ opinions on a whiteboard before making a decision. Sometimes I found that there was true consensus around one option. Sometimes I’d find one dissenting viewpoint that was so compelling I had to change my mind. Other times I’d hear the arguments and still decide to go with my own idea—but at least it was an informed decision. Running this kind of “structured argument” felt awkward. But it worked. On the Gmail team, structured arguments helped me design a string of successful features.

All of them are based on the lesson I learned from my dad, with an assist from Abe Lincoln: 8. Consider conflicting opinions before you commit to an approach. As usual, this lesson is easier said than done. Abraham Lincoln had a bunch of adversarial advisors and a high tolerance for heated arguments, and if you have those, great—but most of us don’t. Most of us work with like-minded teammates and most of us don’t love to fight. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1042))

- When we do disagree, it’s hard to know how to handle it. Some common methods are playing devil’s advocate (also known as “dishing out withering criticism but acting like you don’t mean it”), passive-aggressive emails, and the ever-popular political dogfight. Since all of these are unpleasant, most of us keep our disagreements polite and brief. This kind of collegial environment is lovely—98 percent of the time. But then there’s that other 2 percent. The really big decisions. The kind of decision that dictates how we spend the other 98 percent of our time. When you’re choosing how to approach a big project, you need to debate your options without politics or personal bias and you need to consider contrary opinions even if those contrary opinions are not on your team. You need Magic Lenses. ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1050))

- Seen through this revised version of the vision lens, the combination of a website and physical signs appears to be an even better experience for tourists than the app. Now, all of this perspective switching? It’s a lot of mental gymnastics. Examining a problem from different perspectives and weighing multiple options against multiple factors requires a huge amount of thinking. It strains the boundaries of our limited working memory. Just writing about it makes my forehead sweat. That’s why, yet again, the old 2x2 chart is so useful. It takes the complexity out of our heads and makes it visual. I’m telling you, 2x2 charts are underrated. And if we draw a series of charts as we go, we can then zoom out and look for patterns. Considering these last three perspectives on Genius Loci—pragmatic, middle-of-nowhere, and revised vision lenses—the combination of website and signs is consistently strong. And in the crucial middle-of-nowhere lens, it wins by a mile. When we visualize the perspectives, the best approach is obvious.

- On September 23, 1846, an assistant at the Berlin Observatory received a letter. He opened it. He read it. His eyes probably got big, and he probably reread it while murmuring excitedly to himself in German. I’m making up his reaction, but this next part definitely happened: That evening, following the letter’s instructions, the assistant pointed the observatory’s telescope at a precise point in the night sky. He peered through the eyepiece. And there it was. A previously undiscovered object: the planet Neptune. The author of the mystery letter was a French guy named Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier was a math genius. He studied irregularities in the orbit of Uranus and, in accordance with Isaac Newton’s laws of motion, predicted that there was an eighth planet causing the disruptions. He calculated exactly where this ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1150))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- hypothetical planet would be on any given night. He needed a professional astronomer with a powerful telescope to prove his prediction, so he sent the letter to Berlin. Discovering Neptune must have felt fantastic, and afterward, Le Verrier became a big deal in scientific circles. You probably couldn’t have a happening French mathematics party if you didn’t at least try to get Le Verrier to show up—but good luck with that, because he was already busy with a new project. Throughout the rest of the 1840s and into the 1850s, Le Verrier used his number-crunching prowess to calculate the precise orbits of all the other planets in the solar system. Then, in 1859, he dropped another bombshell on the astronomy world: his calculations revealed new orbital irregularities pointing to the existence of a ninth planet. Nope, not Pluto. Le Verrier predicted that this ninth planet, which he called Vulcan, could be found between the sun and Mercury. Around the world, astronomers followed Le Verrier’s instructions, pointed their telescopes at the sun—seriously, do NOT try that at home—and searched for Vulcan. Nothing. Then an amateur astronomer spotted a tiny dot moving across the sun. Le Verrier investigated and announced that he’d found proof of Vulcan. The press went wild. But no professionals could verify the amateur’s observation. Then another amateur spotted something, and Le Verrier kicked off another wave of excitement, but this data also could not be corroborated. This happened again. And again. For the next eighteen years, amateur astronomers looked for Vulcan, and sometimes they saw… something? A sunspot? A planet? Each time, Le Verrier announced that Vulcan had finally been discovered. Each time, no reputable astronomer could verify the data. No matter how often he was proved wrong, Le Verrier refused to let go of his hypothesis. He searched in vain for Vulcan until his death in 1877. There is no planet Vulcan.I In 1916, Albert Einstein solved the mystery of Mercury’s irregular orbit with his theory of relativity: Apparently, the sun is so massive that it bends space-time and that is what warps Mercury’s orbit. Le Verrier’s math was correct, but his desire to discover another planet blinded him from something even more astonishing: there is more to the universe than Newton’s laws. Le Verrier was doing what scientists do: stare into the unknown, make predictions, and run experiments. Sometimes the experiment works and the scientist is a hero—but more often, the prediction is incorrect. Heck, even Einstein got things wrong. In 1917, he declared that the universe is static; then, in 1929, Edwin Hubble proved that the universe is expanding.II ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1155))

- But there is a key difference between Einstein and Le Verrier. When Einstein was proven wrong, he acknowledged the error—which he called his “biggest blunder”—and adjusted his equations. He changed his worldview. Le Verrier, on the other hand, spent eighteen years with tunnel vision on Vulcan. What if he had acknowledged that his planet hypothesis was wrong and moved on? I’m not suggesting that he would have come up with the theory of relativity, but he could have, I don’t know, worked on a different project? With his rare analytical skills, Le Verrier might have made another truly worthwhile contribution to mankind, like inventing Wordle. We’ll never know. So what, exactly, was Le Verrier’s problem? Well, he was only human. Researchers have identified patterns of mistakes that humans make, again and again, when confronted with complex situations. Our poor brains want to conserve energy, so they take shortcuts—and they… ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1177))

- See, until your solution clicks with customers, your whole foundation is just an educated guess. And I hate to say it, but in one way or another, that guess is almost certainly wrong. Maybe you’re taking the wrong approach. Maybe you’re differentiating on speed when people care most about simplicity. Maybe you chose the wrong problem or the wrong customer. First guesses might be off by a lot or a little—but they are almost always off. To put it another way: 9. It’s just a hypothesis until you prove it. So don’t call your foundation a plan just yet.

- But maybe you’re moving at startup speed. Startups must find “product-market fit”—that is, a market of people who will pay for their product—before they run out of money. So, instead of a perfect solution, most startups build a simpler product that is just enough to be useful to customers, and launch it as quickly as possible. This is called a “minimum viable product” or MVP, and it’s a smart tactic for moving fast. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1335))

- But other signals can give you the confidence to stop sprinting and start building. In particular, as you test with customers, watch for the difference between feedback and reactions. Feedback—that is, customers giving you advice about your solution, or telling you what they think you ought to do—is sometimes valuable. But reactions—that is, genuine unguarded moments when people respond to your product—are solid gold. Salespeople are often masters at interpreting reactions and understanding a customer’s state of mind. As you interview customers one-on-one in Design Sprints, you, too, will quickly become attuned to their physical and verbal signals. When customers lean forward, when they ask if they can start using your solution right away, when they try to pull it out of your hands—that’s the good stuff. When it clicks, you’ll know. Some folks object to the one-on-one customer tests in Design Sprints. They argue that you won’t know whether you have product-market fit until your product launches to the market. This argument? It’s not wrong. When you have a real product out in the real world and real people are spending real time and real money on it (or not), you can tell, for real, if you have product-market fit. If you test a prototype with individuals, that is just flat-out not the same thing. It’s a simulation. ([Location 1407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D22FCWPS&location=1407))

- However, this kind of simulation is a powerful educational tool. I think about it like this: Would I rather ride with a pilot who’s following a hunch about how to fly the aircraft—or one with lots of experience in a simulator? Given that choice, a simulator sounds pretty good to me. Now, it is also true that individuals are not a substitute for the entire market. But then again, what is the market? It’s not a farmers’ market or a supermarket or a flea market. No, the “market” in “product-market fit” is business jargon for a large group of people who have something in common, and to whom we can sell stuff. This kind of market might be anything: people who work with remote teams, people who manufacture chemicals, people who hate email, people who love sandwiches, people who live in Milwaukee, you name it. The common element is people. A market is just a concept; what we’re really talking about is a bunch of individuals.
