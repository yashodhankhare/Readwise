## Highlights
- bionic: a mechanical or computer-driven device that replaces or improves the normal ability of a body part. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=169))
- Robotics and Bioengineering Bioengineering is the use of science, math, and building techniques on living things. Robotic bioengineers design machines that can help people live better lives. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=175))
- A sensor detects what’s going on. A controller reacts to what the sensor detects. And an effector can take action. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=181))
- cochlear implant: an electronic device that is attached to nerves under the skin to help a deaf person detect sounds. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=346))
- Robotic medical devices also help people in their daily lives. Australian scientist Graeme Clark invented the cochlear implant to help deaf people detect sound. It is inserted under the skin, and sends sounds directly to the person’s brain. Since 1978 almost 200,000 deaf children and adults have had cochlear implant surgery.

- powered exoskeleton: a “robot suit” that can be worn to give a person added strength. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=355))
- The Dragon Eye ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=381))
- TALON, ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=393))
- ABE ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=406))
- swarm: a group of identical robots designed to work together as a team. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=492))
- A biomimetic robot is based on an animal or other life form. In 1995, MIT engineers began testing the fish-shaped RoboTuna in its underwater tank. RoboTuna may someday help in the design of autonomous mini-submarines that swim like fish. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=504))
- Robolobster ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=507))
- BigDog ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=508))
- Dash ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=514))
- Sometimes, scientists need to invent new materials for their machines. This is what they did with the soft DARPA robots. Or they might find new uses for old materials. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=523))
- The key is a special artificial skin Hanson invented called Frubber. It makes his robot faces bend and crinkle in a lifelike way. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=552))
- When you add borax to glue, a chemical change takes place that makes the glue stretchy instead of sticky. You can flatten out the mixture to make a smooth layer of Frubber-like material. Experiment with the ingredients to change the thickness, stickiness, and stretchiness. Make notes as you try different formulas, so you know which one you like best. IMPORTANT: Be careful not to get ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=564))
- works somewhat like a battery, but it uses light rays from the sun to knock electrons off of atoms and set them in motion. NASA uses solar energy to keep the batteries in its Mars rovers charged. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=661))
- direct current (DC): electricity that flows in one direction. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=663))
- alternating current (AC): electricity that flows back and forth at a steady rate. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=664))
- A BEAM robot ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=666))
- No matter where it gets its power, the part of a robot that makes it move is called an actuator. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=697))
- The Absolute Beginner’s Guide to Building Robots by Gareth Branwyn ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=708))
- servo: a motor that can be can be controlled electronically. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=718))
- solenoid: an electromagnetic device that pushes a rod up and down. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=722))
- To get a robot to balance while standing, walking, running, or going up stairs takes a lot of complicated programming. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=761))
- RiSE ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=769))
- Solenoids are electromagnetic coils wrapped around a tube with a metal plunger inside. When the electricity is turned on, a magnetic coil attracts the plunger and pulls it in. Sometimes permanent magnets are attached to the plunger. Then the electromagnet can also repel the plunger when it is turned on and push it out. Solenoids are used in many mechanisms such as car door locks. In robots, they can be used instead of a motor to push or pull an effector in a straight line. They can also be used to hit objects, like the keys in a robotic xylophone. This model shows how a solenoid uses electricity to move a plunger back and forth. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=802))
- A mech is like a super-sized powered exoskeleton, big enough for a person to ride inside. Sakakibara Kikai, a Japanese company that builds farm machinery, also makes mechs for fun. The Kid’s Walker is a child-sized mech. It has two enormous arms with large metal clamps as effectors. Its two thick legs have wheels that act like roller skates to move it along smoothly. To drive the Kid’s Walker, the human user climbs into a seat in the robot’s chest, high off the ground. ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=893))
- Effectors and other parts of the robot that can move around have different degrees of freedom. Each direction in which a robotic part can move is one degree of freedom. An arm that can only move up and down has one degree of freedom. If it can also move side to side, it has two degrees of freedom. And if it can also rotate around in either direction, it has three. Each degree of freedom usually needs a joint and an actuator to move it. The ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=906))
- the Canadarm on the International Space Station, has six degrees of freedom. Like a human arm, it has shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The shoulder can move up and down as well as side-to-side, so it has two degrees of freedom. The elbow can move up and down, so it has one degree of freedom. The wrist has can move up and down, side-to-side, and turn, so it has three degrees of freedom. This makes a total of six degrees of freedom along the entire arm. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=916))
- It might seem like adding more degrees of freedom would be a good thing. But each extra degree of freedom makes the robot more complicated to build. All the different movements have to be powered and controlled so they all work together. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=919))
- That’s why robot designers usually try to include the fewest degrees of freedom needed for the robot to do its job. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=921))
- The Universal Jamming Gripper is an experimental effector that uses a totally different kind of design. It works on the principle of “jamming.” When rough grains of material such as sand are loose, they flow like a liquid. But when they’re packed tightly together, they act like one solid mass. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=928))
- photoresistor: a light sensor that works by changing the resistance in an electrical current depending on the amount of light. ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1071))
- ultraviolet (UV): a type of light with a shorter wavelength than visible light, also called black light. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1072))
- A resistor is an electronic device that controls how much electricity flows through it. A photoresistor uses light to control the electricity flow. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1077))
- The photoresistor consists of a small disk with a squiggly line painted on it that is connected to an electrical circuit. The line is made of a chemical that is sensitive to light. When light hits the chemical the resistance goes down and more electricity flows through the circuit. The lower the resistance, the better it conducts electricity. So a photoresistor lets the robot know when it’s in the shade or in bright light. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1078))
- The longer it takes for the echo to reach them, the farther away the object. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1131))
- sonar: a way to detect objects by bouncing sound waves off them and measuring how long it takes to detect an echo. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1135))
- lidar: a device that measures distance by shining light at an object and measuring the time it takes for the light to reflect back. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1141))
- infrared (IR): a type of light with a longer wavelength than visible light, which can also be felt as heat. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1142))
- telepresence: a robotic device that uses video and other types of sensors and displays to let someone in one place act and feel like they are in a room someplace else. ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1157))
- accelerometer: an electronic device that measures acceleration. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1159))
- On a robot, an accelerometer can measure its speed and the distance it has gone. It can also tell when the robot starts and stops moving, when it has crashed into something, and whether it is tilted or straight. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1186))
- A pressure sensor is a type of touch sensor. It works as a resistor. The harder it is pressed, the more electricity can flow through. A robotic hand with pressure sensors on its surface or skin can tell how tightly or gently it is holding an object. On the bottom of a robot’s foot, a pressure sensor signals when the foot has touched the ground. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1215))
- photovore: a robot that chases light. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1259))
- transistor: an electronic component made of a solid piece of material and used as an on/off switch in electronic circuits. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1294))
- semiconductor: a material such as silicon that can vary the amount of electrical charge it will carry depending on certain conditions. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1296))
- A transistor is a switch made from an element such as silicon that acts as a semiconductor. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1300))
- It is much easier to use than a vacuum tube, and much less breakable. Transistors can be used in combination with other components such as resistors and capacitors as the controller for simple robots. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1301))
- One of the latest ideas in robotic control is cloud computing. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1317))
- How a Computer Works—The Binary System Every tiny electronic switch on a computer’s microprocessor has only two settings: “on” or “off.” If it’s on, electricity is flowing through it. If it’s off, no electricity flows through. When you program a computer, you are setting certain switches on or off. Since the computer deals with two choices, this method of making decisions is called the binary system. (“Bi” comes from the Latin word for “two,” as in bicycle and binoculars.) Mathematically, the two choices are represented by the numbers zero and one. If a switch is off, it is set to zero. If it is on, it is set to one. To a computer, a program looks like a long line of zeroes and ones. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1339))
- Boolean logic: named after George Boole, it is a way to turn the decisions a computer makes into yes or no questions. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1374))
- Modern versions of Mindstorms use a more advanced program called LabView. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1418))
- The science of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about figuring out how to make computer brains smarter, so they don’t need people to tell them what to do. chatbot: an AI program designed to have naturalsounding conversations with humans. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009093LZS&location=1596))
- People have long wondered whether robots are helpful or harmful. In I, Robot, author Isaac Asimov created three Laws of Robotics. The laws were designed to make sure that robots would not be able to harm humans. • Law 1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. • Law 2: A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. • Law 3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. • A fourth law was later added: A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. As it turns out, Asimov’s Laws have not been followed in real life. Robots are often used to fight wars and terrorism.
