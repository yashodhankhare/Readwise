## Highlights
- We get to “see” the young Buffett interact with his portfolio companies and grapple with issues at some of them. To modern senses and sensibilities, the corporate governance issues Buffett sometimes encountered can smell the way Disneyland ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CP5ZP7KM&location=62))

- looks on a dank, disappointed, rained-out day. We learn, yet again, that fat pitches are often only fat pitches with hindsight. We tend to look at the past with rose-tinted glasses, especially if things worked out well a posteriori. A priori, there are often things that can go wrong with every investment, and when such investment is available at a compelling price, it is usually because there is some kind of “hair” on it, or risk that has become patent. The challenge for any investor is to work out if it is worthwhile underwriting the “hair” and risks of the investment at such price, sometimes with dread hands and dread feet. On this subject, the chapters on American Express and Disney make for especially riveting reading, particularly for those unfamiliar with their histories.

- Charlie Munger said many memorable things, but my favorite quote of his is this modest one: “The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more.” With this book, I believe that Brett has achieved the goal of helping us know more about perhaps the most closely studied investor in the world, and in an entertaining and accessible manner to boot. This is quite a feat. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CP5ZP7KM&location=117))

- Buffett’s own overly simplistic characterization of his investments often did a disservice to the intensity of the work he performed to amass his early fortune. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CP5ZP7KM&location=169))

- The second stage was when Buffett started buying better businesses, where he was heavily influenced by Charlie Munger and Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CP5ZP7KM&location=172))

- author Phil Fisher. The investments in the first stage had more of their value derived from the balance sheet, while the companies bought in the later stage had more value dependent on the ability of the business to generate and grow free cash flow. In this second stage, business quality—the ability to sustainably earn high returns on invested capital—mattered more than in the first stage.

- In this book, I write about ten investments Buffett made in the 1950s and 1960s. This period, when Buffett earned his highest returns, is an understudied component of the billionaire’s career. While researching these investments, I discovered that there were other reasons for Buffett’s success rather than the idea he simply feasted on immature and inefficient financial markets.

- I concluded that the following four factors drove Buffett’s outperformance in this period of his career. First, Buffett’s use of activism helped him generate spectacular profits. He took significant positions in companies and influenced management teams to change corporate policy to help close the price-to-value gap. Second, Buffett ran a highly concentrated portfolio, occasionally investing more than 20% of his fund in a single investment idea. Great investment ideas are rare; Buffett seized on them whenever he uncovered them. Third, Buffett was a tenacious and creative researcher, traveling extensively to learn about companies and industries, pushing his understanding of business beyond ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CP5ZP7KM&location=187))

- what he could learn from the documents. While he was certainly a voracious reader, he also applied similar ferocity to uncovering information through people. Fourth, Buffett possessed a remarkable filter. His ability to sift through investment opportunities quickly, something he has honed throughout his career, allowed him to seize on the best ideas and concentrate his efforts on wringing the most profit out of those.

- Despite Marshall-Wells’ stock doing well, Buffett produced a 75.8% return in 1951, 144.8% in 1954, and 29.5% annually throughout his partnership years.56 Marshall-Wells is one of the cheapest stocks discussed in this book, but it wasn’t a big winner for Buffett. Investments like this were not why Buffett did so spectacularly. As discussed in the preface and explored in detail later in this book, Buffett’s biggest winners in the 1950s and 1960s usually had an extra kicker—a shift in capital allocation that drove superb returns.
