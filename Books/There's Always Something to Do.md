- My primary objective is to make money for my clients and then to make my business profitable. I believe that the way to achieve this is through associating with truly competent people with unshakeable business integrity, to ensure strict financial controls, a culture of thoroughness, a measured capacity for action; i.e. no seat of the pants stuff and a spirit of humility and cohesive teamwork. What I am beginning to perceive is that investors tend to follow trends and fashion rather than taking the trouble to look for value. This must offer opportunity for the professional investment manager, as a result of the short term mispricing of securities. During his early days at Yorkshire Peter wrote and passed the Chartered Financial Analyst Association exams as part of one of the first groups to qualify. The work involved elicited another important comment. I think that intelligent forecasting (company revenues, earnings, etc.) should not seek to predict what will in fact happen in the future. Its purpose ought to be to illuminate the road, to point out obstacles and potential pitfalls and so assist management to tailor events and to bend them in a desired direction. Forecasting should be used as a device to put both problems and opportunities into perspective. It is a management tool, but it can never be a substitute for strategy, nor should it ever be used as the primary basis for portfolio investment decisions.

- I believe that there is probably one opportunity in every man’s life which demands his knowledge, his guts, his self-esteem, and his judgement. If he seizes it with both hands and it is successful, he joins the first rank, if not he remains a mortal with feet of clay. Credit Foncier may well be my test.

- In fact, in his search he had come to two important conclusions: that the majority of models used by investment research departments were essentially worthless and that attempting to make general market calls was a “mug’s game.” Most of the analytical tools tended to be heavily reliant on extrapolating history and market calls involved far too many variables, as well as being conditioned by the herd instinct, which, more often than not, was triggered by some completely unpredictable event. He also concluded that pure chartists were simple fantasists, in approximately the same category as those gambling punters who believe that they can predict the next fall of a roulette ball on the basis of previous history. Despite all his efforts, although he had recorded some useful thoughts that seemed to be leading him in the right kind of direction, up to the moment when he read Super Money on the airplane a satisfactory, comprehensive answer had eluded him. As his summary at this time shows, he had not really made great progress, except perhaps through the elimination of many of the “dead ends”: ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=277))

- Management’s ability to predict earnings is universally poor. • It is the strategic modelling behind a portfolio that matters most. • One needs to develop a sense of spaced maturities in a common stock portfolio in a way that is comparable to a bond portfolio. • In a macro sense it may be more useful to spend time analysing industries instead of national or international economies. • It must be essential to develop and specify a precise investment policy that investors can understand and rely on the portfolio manager to implement.

- He started his investigation by subjecting the two securities to a form of regression analysis that he had devised for the purpose, the idea being to arrive at a “predicted judgement of likely price appreciation.” The departure point was to define what he considered to be the most important variables and give each of them a weighting that he could adjust later in light of the outcome. This approach was valid because he already knew what the actual price appreciation had been over any given period, once the first investment had been made. The categories of variable that he chose were book value, dividend growth, growth in earnings per share, frequency of senior management changes/philosophy, favourable/unfavourable industry environment, degree of recognition by the investment public, general economic environment, available float, flow of funds, general level of interest rates, equivalent money instruments, time horizon, and the feel of the company. The equation was Appa = Jppa - (V1+V2+V3...) where Appa is the actual percentage price appreciation, Jppa the anticipated percentage price appreciation, and V is the weighted variable. Of course it was far too complicated to work satisfactorily. It needed the combined wisdom of Ben Graham and Warren Buffett for Peter to make his breakthrough and the moment could not have been more opportune.

- Based on my studies and experience, investments for the Venture Fund should only be made if most of the following criteria are met: • The share price must be less than book value. Preferably it will be less than net working capital less long term debt. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=340))

- The price must be less than one half of the former high and preferably at or near its all time low. • The price earning multiple must be less than ten or the inverse of the long term corporate bond rate, whichever is the less. • The company must be profitable. Preferably it will have increased its earnings for the past five years and there will have been no deficits over that period. • The company must be paying dividends. Preferably the dividend will have been increasing and have been paid for some time. • Long term debt and bank debt (including off-balance sheet financing) must be judiciously employed. There must be room to expand the debt position if required. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=342))

- Privately he confided some of his other investment principles to the journal and they too make fascinating reading: I will never use inside information or seek it out. I do implicitly believe in Sir Sigmund Warburg’s adage, “All you get from inside information is a whiff of bad breath.” In fact it is worse than that because it can actually paralyse reasoning powers; imperilling the cold detached judgement required so that the hard facts can shape decisions. Intuition, whether positive or negative, is quite another matter. It is a vital component of my art. Stock manipulations only have a limited and temporary effect on markets. In the end it is always the economic facts and the values which are the determining factors.

- similar to character in an individual – it stands up better in adversity which it overcomes more readily. Once the analysis is complete and you have reached the firm conviction that an investment is right you should not try to be too clever about the purchase price. If you have to take a loss do it decisively – don’t dither. Learn the lessons and then forget about it. In every analysis you need to isolate what the real assets are and you must not forget to examine the franchise to do business, to review the character and competence of the management and to estimate the outcome if the whole business had to be turned into cash.

- take the initiative without waiting around for someone else to take the first plunge. I haven’t yet found a solution for determining timing on the sell tack. People say it ought to be largely dependent on one’s perception of the trend in the overall stock market, but I am suspicious of this. I think that the financial community devotes far too much time and mental resource to its constant efforts to predict the economic future and consequent stock market behaviour using a disparate, and almost certainly incomplete, set of statistical variables. It makes me wonder what might be accomplished if all this time, energy, and money were to be applied to endeavours with a better chance of proving reliable and practically useful. The timing difficulty in selling does not lie in not knowing when the trading discount to intrinsic value has been eliminated, but in judging by how much it is likely to be surpassed.

- Peter’s assessment turned out to be entirely accurate and within a year he was able to sell his entire position at $19.00 and rub his hands contentedly. But six months later there was a “sting” when Avon Products made an all share offer for Tiffany worth $50.00 per share and Hoving unhesitatingly accepted it. Peter’s comment was that he ought to have asked Hoving, “Never, ever – at any price?” This outcome prompted considerable discussion among the Cundill Value Fund board members over the question of how to deal with the problem of when to sell. Peter himself could come up with no absolutely satisfactory proposal for a formula. In the end the solution turned out to be something of a compromise: the fund would automatically sell half of any given position when it had doubled, in effect thereby writing down the cost of the remainder to zero with the fund manager then left with full discretion ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=513))

- as to when to sell the balance. Peter expressed his collected thoughts in the journal, based on the first five years of his accumulated experience as a value investor. The ultimate skill in this business is in knowing when to make the judgement call to let profits run. While it is true that 99% of investment effort is routine, unspectacular enquiry, checking and double checking, laboriously building up a web of information with single threads until it constitutes a complete tableau, just occasionally a flash of inspiration may be necessary. Once we have begun to build a position it has to be recognized that our intentions may change in the course of its construction. An influential, or even controlling, position quite often results from a situation where a cheap security does little or nothing price-wise for such a long time that we are able to buy a significant percentage of the equity. Whether our intentions remain passive under these circumstances depends on an assessment of the outlook for the company and the capability of its management, but I don’t think that we ought to be pro-active merely for the sake of it. My task is principally the identification of opportunity and the decision to press the buy button. This may sometimes turn out to be a catalyst in itself, but normally we should rely on others to do the promotional work or to put the company directly into ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=519))

- Bache’s boss, Harry Jacobs, had recently fought off a run taken at his company by Gerry Tsai, a successful New York fund manager to whom Jacobs had declared, even more roundly than Walter Hoving had done when he met Peter, “I’m going to fight you to the death.” And he had done so, buying Tsai’s position at a premium to the market price, a practice known as “greenmailing,” which today would attract the immediate attention of the sec.

- There was a further dimension to London as a location in those days that made it reasonable for the city to lay claim to being the most conveniently placed international community in the world. It was the era of the supersonic Concorde, which had begun its thirty-year flying career in 1969, making it possible to travel from London to New York in a mere three and a half hours. By the middle of the 1980s it had attained the status of a commuter flight for those for whom time was money. In fact it had become possible to take the 10 am Concorde flight from London, arrive in New York at 8:30 am local time, take the helicopter service into Manhattan for a meeting at 9:30 am, and then return to London after an early working lunch, arriving back at Heathrow at 10 pm and ending up in central London an hour later – a long day, but not extraordinarily so. It did not, of course, work quite so well in reverse for residents of New York, which simply added to the attraction of London. Peter quickly became a regular Concorde passenger and commented: The Concorde is a sort of club in the air for the world’s top 10,000.

- associates in the departure lounge, or seated beside me on the flight, and there is something about flying in the stratosphere at twice the speed of sound which seems to inspire the exchange of confidences. It is a remarkable sounding board, especially in my world of matters financial. For me some of these conversations are invaluable from the point of view of insights and perspectives. One becomes even more keenly aware that there is never just one factor determining events, there are many of them interwoven and acting simultaneously. Indeed, from my own professional standpoint, I always need to discipline myself to be aware of the world generally, rather than trying to be specific. I only need to be specific about the numbers. Funnily enough, having travelled on the Air France Concorde flight from Paris into Washington, I found it was not at all the same experience, at least not for those in my line of business, perhaps it may be for diplomats, politicians, and bureaucrats.

- The 1980s were filled with compelling investment stories out of the Cundill Value Fund stable of discoveries and there were some all-time classics, one of which was Cleveland Cliffs. The company was in a sense the equivalent of a producer of “widgets”; it was North America’s largest supplier of iron ore pellets, an old style “muck and brass” kind of operation that was of little interest in an investment world that was becoming obsessed with technology and companies with “unlimited” growth potential. Cliffs surfaced on the radar screen through Alan Kahn, an increasingly influential member of Peter’s network. It was a potential net-net, although not a pure one because it was a participant in a series of joint ventures that could not strictly be regarded as liquid assets, however solid they might be. Nevertheless, it was a neglected security. The shares had fallen from just under $40 in mid 1980 to $18 at the beginning of 1985; book value had also declined over the same period, but from $30 to $22. As Peter examined Cliffs more closely, he noticed that the company owned a power plant in Michigan that was carried on the balance sheet at a negligible value and he began to wonder whether this might not be an additional and hidden asset, the golden nugget that would constitute the margin of safety, perhaps even the catalyst for public recognition. By the second half of the 1980s Peter was in the habit of calling on the group of like-minded “net-netter’s” that he had so carefully cultivated to back up his research independently. He was aware Alan Kahn had already done some work on power plants in Arizona and he called him in great excitement to ask him to have a look at Cliffs’ Michigan facility. About ten days later Peter received an equally excited return call from the visit. Alan was virtually incoherent with enthusiasm, the plant was, he said, “worth a zillion ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=894))

- dollars.” Peter’s eyebrows went up a fraction at this, but he wasted no time in calling for a second opinion from Don Kennedy in San Francisco, another value player who had a good understanding of the power industry as well as a usefully sceptical approach to analysis. Don’s endorsement was more cautious but he had no hesitation in confirming that he was also convinced that the plant was worth “a lot of money” and so Peter started to buy Cliffs at $15.00 and the stock proceeded to slide relentlessly month after month. Peter, Don Kennedy, and the Kahns appeared to be the only buyers in a market awash with institutional and retail sellers who simply wanted to be out of such a “dog of a security” at any price so that they could make use of the proceeds in the more promising area of computer software development. Of the three buyers Peter was by far the largest, and it took a steady nerve and utter conviction, especially as another very large seller came out of the woodwork in the fall. It seemed that every time Peter bought a block of stock, another would promptly be offered. Years later he recalled standing on the steps of the Metropolitan Club in New York with Don Kennedy in that November, splitting up what had been their latest block purchase at $6.00 and wondering whether it might just turn out to be the “last hurrah.” It was – the selling pressure began to ease after that. By then the fund owned well over 100,000 shares at an average price of $9.75, representing nearly 4 per cent of total assets. By the spring of 1987 the long bull market was entering its final euphoric phase, carrying everything with it, even solid old companies like Cliffs, as investors finally began to scour the indices for asset values and take-over candidates. By July Cliffs had hit $20, triggering the Cundill rule that half the position should be sold when any holding had doubled. By the time of the October stock market crash Peter had unloaded about 15 per cent of the position at an average of around $19.00. Over the next few weeks the shares plummeted once again, and without hesitation Peter bought back all that he had sold, and more on top, at an average price of $10. The fund then held the majority of the position until 1990 when most of it was sold and the last of it went in 1991. The compound rate of return was over 30 per cent. The margin of safety had served Peter well, but it had still required a steady nerve and plenty of patience and he later wrote: None of the great investments come easily. There is almost always a major blip for whatever reason and we have learnt to expect it and not to panic. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=907))

- It had been possible to revisit Cliffs successfully because a major market crash had intervened after the company’s underlying value had begun to be recognized by the wider investment community. Down-draughts of that kind tend to be regarded as “gifts from heaven” for disciples of Ben Graham and value investors tend to hold significant proportions of cash at most times, so that they are in a position to take advantage. Of course, no true value investor would claim to be able to predict the swings of the market and would never make any attempt to time either buying or selling on the basis of other people’s market predictions. However, the value discipline has an intrinsic tendency toward the accurate prediction of major trends. In purely practical terms, when the stock market is at or near a peak, there are likely to be very few, if any, bargains to be had and securities actually selling below liquidation value will be even scarcer. There is, therefore, a naturally induced bias towards selling and building cash during such periods, when investments within a value portfolio reach and surpass book value and continue upward to become statistically overvalued. This is not to suggest that it makes the selling judgement straightforward… ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=926))

- making money over the long term is not to lose it. It led Peter to a conclusion to which he frequently returns in his president’s letters to the Cundill Value Fund shareholders: The “value method of investing” will tend to give better results in slightly down to indifferent markets and less relatively sparkling results in a raging bull market. What matters, however, is that the method will provide a consistent compound return in the middle teens over very long periods of time. However, the more that Peter began to explore some of the by-ways of value, the more some slightly divergent avenues began to make investment sense. The first of these was the potential attraction of “holding companies,” which he had started to notice very early in the life of the fund. More often than not holding companies are disliked by ordinary investors, both institutional and retail, as being difficult to understand, without the simplicity of a single clearly identifiable business, and sometimes requiring skilled “forensic” accountancy to arrive at any… ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=937))

- where his own well-honed professional accountancy skills could be utilized most effectively to exploit the advantages of the value methodology. Anglo American Corp was the first real holding company in which Peter invested and it was drawn to his attention by Don Kennedy as early as 1976. It was the start of a long and happy association with Oppenheimer companies. Anglo has never been other than a very well run company, with extremely reliable reporting standards, but its exposure to diamonds, gold, and base metals made it subject both to investment fashion and cyclicality and those two factors have been responsible over several decades for a number of opportunities for the value buyer. There is a note in Peter’s research books about material he presented to the Value Fund board members, some of whom were inclined to be sceptical about whether the fund ought to be exposed to any markets that could be viewed as carrying a serious element of political risk. The note tells the company’s story, gives a very clear picture of Anglo’s appeal, and sells the concept of the investment with useful precision. It is a cogently argued case study that… ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=947))

- become the backbone of the Cundill process of investment analysis and still remain in regular use: Anglo American is a South African holding and management company providing a complete range of technical and administrative services to 285 companies worldwide. In addition they hold significant equity interests in a group of international mining, industrial, and investment companies including De Beers, Engelhard, Charter Consolidated, Hudson’s Bay Mining and Smelting, Amax, and Anglo American Gold. De Beers controls over 80% of the world’s diamond output and Anglo’s investment has a market value of over $200 million. Anglo’s mining interests last year produced 29% of the Free World’s gold production and substantial quantities of coal, uranium, copper, iron ore, platinum, nickel, and zinc. They have invested in a number of successful petroleum consortia in the UK and Dutch sectors of the North Sea, including the Forties and Argyll fields.

- Anglo is holding cash and equivalents of $235 million. Their investment portfolio is carried at a cost of $600 million against a value for the quoted securities alone of $1.1 billion. The shares at $2.50 are selling at a ten year low with a capitalization of a mere $313 million, the company is profitable (will earn about 60 cents this year), and the dividend yield is 10% and more than twice covered. The numbers are solid but the share price is clearly signalling a problem or problems – precisely what we like to see. As I see it, first of all there is the gold price, which has recently sunk back from $170 and is now teetering on the brink of $100, and I take this to be a psychologically important resistance point which may or may not hold. At the same time mining costs have risen sharply, so it would be sensible to assume that Anglo’s dividend stream from its gold-producing subsidiary will be substantially reduced for the next little while. In a worst case scenario this could lop about 20% off the earnings, but still leave the dividend twice covered – a considerable margin of… ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=967))

- The other problem is clearly the politics, with the harbingers of doom predicting a collapse of order as black South Africans press more violently for equality, the demise of white supremacy, and a fair share of their birthright. The risks of labour unrest are undoubtedly real and might include sabotage and the spectre of expropriation if things really got out of hand. My instinct is that the worst case scenario is highly unlikely and, even if it were to happen, Anglo’s internationally acknowledged expertise is in mine-management and someone would still have to manage the expropriated mines. However the true margin of safety lies in the diversified portfolio of assets outside South Africa. Peter bought Anglo American for the fund in 1977 and sold it in 1979. The gain was over 100%. Another avenue among the by-ways of value whose potential Peter quickly came to appreciate was distressed securities. His interest had originally been stirred through the work he had done on the liquidation of the Commonwealth Trust Company in BC in the early seventies, while he was at the Yorkshire Trust. The thing that had surprised him about this work was the sizeable and highly profitable realizations that the real estate portfolio had achieved as the liquidation process progressed and that, under the protective umbrella of the bankruptcy, these sales had taken place in an orderly fashion, not a fire-sale. Then, shortly after he joined the board of the American Investment Corporation in 1979, Alan Johnson, AIC’S legal counsel and a fellow director, had introduced Peter to Tony Novelly. Their first meeting was over a dinner, during which copious quantities of white wine were consumed, and the two formed an immediate bond. During dinner Novelly turned to Johnson and said: “I like this guy Cundill, I want him on my board.” To which Johnson replied “Tony, you don’t have a board.” There was moment’s silence before Novelly responded: “Well you’d better get me one!” It was the era of the Savings and Loan crises and real estate… ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=977))

Peter declined the offer but made arrangements to visit the Drexel office on his next trip to LA. When he turned up a month later he found a small but dynamic and extremely focused group. He was introduced to a young man named Michael Milken, who was brimming with energy and ideas, as well as to Peter Ackerman, who took the trouble to lead Peter into the complex world of distressed debt in spite of the relative insignificance of the funds that he then had under management. Peter quickly forged a close relationship with the Drexel team, especially Peter Ackerman, who became a lifelong friend, and in the years prior to Drexel’s fall from grace they became his principal brokers. The distressed debt element of the value fund portfolio at times amounted to as much as 20% of the total and contributed some stellar results. The analytical process was in every respect in harmony with Grahamite principles, relying as it did primarily on balance sheet evaluation and hard liquidation values, accompanied by a detailed examination of the relevant… ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=997))

In 1985 the Cundill Value Fund had returned a highly satisfactory 22%, but the early part of 1986 was proving to be rather problematic. Stock markets across the globe were extremely frothy, with the more speculative growth stocks leading the pack. Value securities were being left to languish and there was, in any case, a scarcity of value-based opportunities. By the early summer Peter was becoming frustrated as he set off for his annual hiking holiday in the Swiss Alps. I did some numbers while waiting for the flight to Lyons. We are making money in absolute terms, which is fine, but in relative terms it’s awful. We manage $333 million of which 34% is in cash, but we have far too many holdings.

- very rarely succumbed. However, cash kept building up relentlessly in the fund as the markets rose to dizzier and dizzier heights and the holdings became statistically “overvalued” and, therefore, subject to automatic pruning. A lot of self-discipline was essential to avoid straying from the value framework and in Peter’s case this was always accompanied by a good deal of soul-searching. Peter’s strictures about the proliferation of individual shares in the portfolio was one that consistently worried him because experience had convinced him that concentration was almost always an important factor in achieving superior performance. But in this instance the criticism was not entirely justified. The Value Fund’s top ten holdings still represented 30% of assets and cash stood at a little over 30%. What had occurred was that a number of companies in which he had intended to build up a full position had run away in price before it had… ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=1017))

As I have watched events unfold I have come to the conclusion that computers actually don’t do much more than make it quicker for investors to react to information. The problem is that having the information in its raw state on a second by second basis is not at all the same thing as interpreting and understanding its implications, and this applies in rising markets as well as falling ones. Spur of the moment reactions to partially digested information are, more often than not, disastrous. My impressions of the last week are that most people in shock need to share their gloom and doom, to reassure themselves that they are not out there on their own, and so it feeds on itself. The authorities are continuing to do the right things internationally, with the notable exception of Japan, which appears to be sweeping every problem under the table.

- On the subject of the “fallen angels” of stock markets that occupy so much of our detective work as value investors, I try to keep in mind Oscar Wilde’s comment that “saints always have a past and sinners always have a future,” so no investment should be ruled out simply on the basis of past history. We focus on liquidation analysis and liquidation analysis alone. ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=1158))

- I’ve thought a lot over the years about the everlasting obsession with trying to predict where markets will go at any particular juncture, not least since last year’s crash when it was our value disciplines that kept us out of trouble, holding oodles of cash. We believed that a correction of some magnitude was highly probable but we had no idea when it would happen. So, for what it’s worth, here’s my present thought on the subject – maybe not my final thought, who knows? Synchronicity begins where pure chance ends, with one event leading to another, like a chain reaction, but all brought about by the initial event which cannot be predicted or explained. In other words – don’t waste your time. Just have patience and make sure you’re confident about the margin of safety in each investment.

- bonds drop onto the bottom rung of the non-investment grade group. In the case of many investing institutions this means that they are obliged by statute to sell them, if they can, whether they like it or not. Even institutions that may not actually be obliged to sell may do so anyway to avoid the embarrassment of having an obvious carbuncle in their portfolio. In consequence the price decline of bonds in these circumstances is usually precipitous and very often totally unrelated to any realistic estimate of intrinsic value. At this stage there was usually a predatory glint in Peter’s eye – a look that his wife came to recognize instantly – once famously remarking in public: “You must be happy. You’re wearing your vulture’s smile.” Another feature of distressed debt that Peter was quick to recognize is that its trading price bears practically no correlation to the general direction of either the stock market or the bond market. It is almost entirely determined by the condition of the company alone. The only external factor that may have an influence is the overall direction of interest rates but, unless there are extreme changes, even this seems to have little impact. The result is that such investments provide a lot of what is technically referred to in a portfolio as Alpha, a measure of the risk-adjusted return on any investment. Such a measure tries to determine whether the return on an investment is sufficient to justify the exposure. Clearly, if one can eliminate most of the stock and bond market risk, the answer is more likely to be yes. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=1211))

- The final aspect of distressed debt that Peter was early in appreciating was that once the bad news is out and the price has fallen, if the analysis demonstrates to one’s satisfaction that the company is going to survive, or that it can sell off enough valuable assets to settle with its creditors at an appealing level in relation to the price at which the debt can be purchased, then the downside risk is minimal. The “x factor” is “the time value of money.” In simple terms this means that the longer one is obliged to hold an investment, the higher the end return needs to be to justify it – 10% in a month is a better return than 100% in two years. However, the returns on distressed debt, if the analysis is correct, will be comparable to the returns on a successful equity portfolio and not a conventional bond portfolio.

- Both Peter and the Deltec people had been watching these developments with increasing interest. Peter had noted Noriega’s taking refuge in the Vatican Embassy in his journal that Christmas Eve. In the aftermath of the invasion Panamanian debt prices fell even more steeply and Peter set to work to look at the situation in detail from an economic standpoint. What emerged from his analysis over the next few months was startling and mouth-watering. The cash assets belonging to Panama that were frozen in US banks equated approximately to its outstanding defaulted obligations. With order reestablished the economy was beginning to thrive once more and there was every reason to suppose that the US Government would move to restore a properly elected democratic administration in Panama as soon as possible and, by implication, a legitimate, recognized independent Panamanian government would be fully entitled to expect conformity with the treaty terms relating to the control and administration of ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=1256))

- the Panama Canal, which had been abrogated at the time of the invasion. In Peter’s judgement this constituted a very considerable and solid margin of safety. In effect one would be buying cash at a discount and getting the canal and the Panamanian economy for nothing. If ever there were a good example of the principle of “buying a dollar for 40 cents” – a phrase that was already a motto for the Cundill Value Fund – this was it. With the Republic of Panama dollar-denominated debt trading at just over 50 cents by early 1992, Peter was more than a little tempted but the selling pressure was still intense and so he held off, remarking: Markets can be overvalued and still keep on getting more expensive for quite a while, or they can be undervalued and keep getting cheaper, which is why investing is an art form, not an exact science.

- But I tell you statistical overvaluation is a funny thing – it can go on for a very long time, far beyond the limits of rationality, and it is a problem for the value investor in two ways: it can tempt one to compromise standards on the buy side and it may lure one into selling things far too early. I have less of a problem with the selling temptation because I have always loved cash – if you’ve got lots of it you will never have to pass up a great opportunity.

- To my knowledge there are no good records that have been built by institutions run by committee. In almost all cases the great records are the product of individuals, perhaps working together, but always within a clearly defined framework. Their names are on the door and they are quite visible to the investing public. In reality outstanding records are made by dictators, hopefully benevolent, but nonetheless dictators. And another thing, most top managers really do exchange ideas without fear or ego. They always will.

- We dined out in Europe, we had the biggest positions in Deutsche Bank and Paribas, which both had big investment portfolios, so you got the bank itself for nothing. You had a huge margin of safety – it was easy money. We had doubles and triples in those markets and we thought we were pretty smart, so in 1996 and 1997 we took our profits and took flight to Japan, which was just so beaten up and full of values. But in doing so we missed out on some five baggers, which is when the initial investment has multiplied five times, and we had to wait at least two years before Japan started to come good for us. This is a recurring problem for most value investors – that tendency to buy and to sell too early. The virtues of patience are severely tested and you get to thinking it’s never going to work and then finally your ship comes home and you’re so relieved that you sell before it’s time. What we ought to do is go off to Bali or some such place and sit in the sun to avoid the temptation to sell too early.

- Now for the story: “In the 1950s scientists were studying Japanese monkeys on the island of Koshima. They provided the monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand; the monkeys liked the sweet potatoes but hated the sand. Then a young female named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her playmates learnt it too and taught their mothers. In the following years, all the young monkeys learned how to wash the potatoes and taught their parents. Those adults unable to learn from their children carried on eating dirty potatoes. Then something startling took place. In the fall of 1958, a certain number of monkeys were washing potatoes – we don’t know exactly how many. But let’s suppose that as the sun rose that morning there were ninety-nine monkeys washing potatoes and let us then suppose that later the same morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes. That’s when it happened. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=1833))

- ahead of the game, making quick, reasoned decisions, especially in a crisis. CALCULATED RISK “Be prepared to take risks but never gambles. Value investors are often perceived as taking the safe investment route and that is true. But the time scales required for a value investor can be contradictory. Holding on to heavily discounted stock that the market dislikes for a period of five or ten years is not risk free. As each year passes the required end reward to justify the investment becomes higher, irrespective of the original margin of safety. Equally for the growth specialist, speculating that a company in a favoured market, with negligible current earnings, will in due course enjoy exponential growth is not risk free. On top of which there is no margin of safety. Either could be regarded as gambling, or calculated risk. Which side of that scale they fall on is a function of whether the homework has been good enough and has not neglected the fieldwork.” INDEPENDENCE OF MIND “I think it is very useful to develop a contrarian cast of mind combined with a keen sense of what I would call “the natural order of things.” If you can cultivate these two attributes you are unlikely to become infected by dogma and you will begin to have a predisposition towards lateral thinking – making important connections intuitively.” HUMILITY “I have no doubt that a strong sense of self belief is important – even a sense of mission – and this is fine as long as it is tempered by a sense of humour, especially an ability to laugh at oneself. One of the greatest dangers that confront those who have been through a period of successful investment is hubris – the conviction that one can never be wrong again. An ability to see the funny side of oneself as it is seen by others is a strong antidote to hubris.” ROUTINES “Routines and discipline go hand… ([Location 2255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5BR9S&location=2255))
