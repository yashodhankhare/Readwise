## Highlights
- On average, my chosen 99 investors outperformed the market by about twelve percentage points a year for 25 years. At the time of writing, they each manage an average of $10 billion. If they continue at this rate for another ten years, and the benchmark is zero, they will create an excess return of $1,206 billion to be distributed to clients, themselves, and – as is very evident in this book – charity. By comparison, according to the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, the total global aid budget in 2012 was $127 billion.

- The objection to this kind of reasoning, according to many, is that the financial market is not alchemy. Investors cannot make money, they just grab a larger slice of the pie than others – it is a zero-sum game. Yet that idea really doesn’t hold water. It is not a zero-sum game for society. Fair enough, it is impossible to measure in exact terms the good investors can do, but with bad investors, for example, we might have had ten parallel railroads in each country and perhaps a hundred car manufacturers producing cars at significantly higher prices than today. Weak businesses and weak industrial structures would be supported overly long, and otherwise viable ventures would be starved of the necessary financing.

- It was the famous German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht who coined the phrase ‘Erst kommt das Fressen, dann die Moral’, ‘Food first, then morality’. However, most of the investors in this book are nothing like the caricature, in fact many of them give ample proof of an altruistic view of the world ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=125))

- Take only two quotes from the deeply religious Sir John Templeton, one of the most successful global investors in modern times: ‘Measure success with a single word – love’, and, ‘I think God supplies all of our needs if we are trying to help other people, so we do not need to be concerned about our own welfare’. This is a million miles away from the popular metaphor of ‘snakes in suits’. Successful investors deserve respect for not throwing away clients’ savings on unworkable business models and instead investing the money where the return will be best for both clients and society; the worst investors deserve nothing of the sort.

- My inclusion of the legendary trader Jesse Livermore, who went bankrupt several times, may seem inconsistent. But by scraping together a fortune of $2.5 billion (in today’s money) from pure speculation, his investment strategy remains required reading for today’s traders. Yet by the same token, I cannot include the American portfolio manager Bill Miller. He beat the comparable index for 15 consecutive years with managed assets that at times exceeded $20 billion. If he had stopped when he was at the top, he would have been hailed as a hero. Instead he continued, read the ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=230))

- market wrong during the financial crisis of 2008, and for the last six years of his 28 years in the driver’s seat lost against the benchmark. His insights and advice are perhaps even more interesting now as a result. Here they are: Lowest average cost wins. If it’s in the newspapers, it’s in the price. 100 % of the information you have about a company represents the past, 100 % of its valuation depends on the future. Financial crises are not caused by people borrowing to buy risky assets; they are caused by people borrowing to buy assets they thought were safe, but that turned out to be risky.

- It was George Soros who said, ‘The fascinating thing about investments is that there are so many different ways to succeed.’ That is the moral of this book in a nutshell. The path to becoming a successful investor is not lined with miraculous universal formulas. This book contains about as many strategies as there are investors. Let’s look at some examples: ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=301))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Note, though, that this discipline and firmness of principle applies only in the short term. In the longer term, it is more the rule than the exception that investors adapt to changes in the market. This is perhaps the single most important lesson to be learned from studying the best investors. Only a very few have found a narrow niche where they have been able to operate undisturbed by the competition, able to keep to their strategy come hell or high water. Clinging grimly to a favoured strategy is quite simply not a proven route to success. Instead, it is flexibility and responsiveness to change that is the winning formula. This is what Ken Fisher means by his pithy remark, ‘everything changes’. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=329))

- An impressive display of new thinking combined with a good deal of self-assurance. It is easy to draw a parallel to the standard paraphrase from the theory of evolution: ‘It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.’ Another surprise is the investors’ risk-taking and views on risk. It might be tempting to think that the best results come from taking the greatest risks. You’d be wrong. The complete opposite is true. Low risk-taking and careful risk management are common to almost all the investors here. However, it is not just the ability to be risk averse and flexible in their investment strategy when the market changes that unites them. The fact is that there is such a thing as a successful investor profile. Regardless of the strategy used. Regardless of the market. Regardless of the period. Below are the twelve insights common to virtually all investors. Know your own investment rhythm. Know your strengths and weaknesses. Consider the risks, not the potential. Be prepared to change your strategy if the market changes. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=346))

- Don’t invest on the basis of tips. Don’t let your emotions cloud your judgement. Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. Be disciplined and work hard. Only do business with reputable companies and guard your reputation. Don’t underestimate the efficiency of the market, but don’t overestimate its perfection. It’s not wrong to make mistakes, but it is wrong to fail to learn from them. Patience is a virtue, in investing as in all else. It is far more important to embrace this general advice than to attempt to copy a successful investor’s strategy to the letter. The world of investing is not that simple. If a given strategy is successful, it will eventually become overcrowded and stop working. This was always the case in the past. The difference now is that methods become obsolete faster.

- Seen from another perspective it is possible to make another observation – that almost one third of the investors in this book are of Jewish descent. Without claiming to have any scientific proof it is tempting to make historical connections. For many centuries Jews were forbidden to own real property in Europe.This excluded them from being freeholders and from acquiring land and property, both of which were the greatest investment objects of the time. Jews were simply forced to find other ways of making a living, preferably ones that they could practise even when they needed to move around, since pogroms were common. Thus trading proved to be a suitable occupation for them. It is possibly in the light of these skills passed on from generation to generation that today’s over-representation of Jewish investors is to be seen.

- Now to the core issue. What works best, and which investors are considered to be the best? To begin with, it’s interesting to see which types of assets are held by the investors in this book – a ranking perhaps best understood from the table below.

- partly historical. For the past century, shares have yielded an average annual return of about 10 %, while bonds have only managed half that. But it is not the whole truth. For the last 30 years (1981–2011), bonds have enjoyed better returns than equities, and this despite the stock market rally at the end of the twentieth century. Instead, it mostly comes down to the fact that it is easier to make a difference in the stock market than in the bond or currency markets. Since this book only considers absolute returns (as the saying goes, you can’t eat relative performance), it is understandable that more than 80 % of the investors concentrate partially or solely on the stock market. In terms of the size of the types of assets, however, the stock market is not the obvious choice. Despite there being some 46,000 quoted shares traded worldwide to the tune of a market value of some $50 trillion, the stock… ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=461))

- When it comes to investment strategies, there is no doubt that, among those included in this book, value investors are in a clear majority. In setting out all the investor profiles as a table, it should be noted that boundaries are not hard and fast: an investor can have several different styles, while the various strategies to some extent overlap. Value 52 % Contrarian 25 % Quality 22 % Growth 20 % Quantitative 13 % Trader 12 % In an article from 1984 in the Columbia Business School Magazine, Warren Buffett took up cudgels for value investing, arguing that it is the best investment strategy. He wrote that ‘If a substantial share of these long-term winners belong to a group of value investing adherents, and they operate independently of each other, then their success is more than a lottery win; it is a triumph of the right strategy.’ This… ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=471))

- lower, unless they have highly leveraged assets, which is rare. Value investing calls for the manager to invest in a company at a price that is lower than the intrinsic value – the origin of the American expression ‘Pay 50 cents for a dollar’. Over time, this strategy has proved to offer the most enduring, highest long-term returns. Yet, even so, there have been long periods when it has not done well; between 1990 and 2000, for example, when growth stocks, especially in technology companies, were the rage. After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the value-based approach to investing came back into vogue again. And the question is whether it has ever been as popular as it is now. Every year the best part of 40,000 shareholders make the pilgrimage to the annual shareholders’ meetings of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the small city of Omaha to listen to the foremost – and most successful – representative of value investing. That said, it should be noted that most of the value investors in this book have developed their own versions of value investing, different from the basic model coined… ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=480))

- strategy is not sufficient to get the winning ticket. History is full of less successful value investors. In the stock market, two popular strategies – value and growth – tend to overlap. One surprise finding here is that not more growth investors qualified for my list: only one in five of the 99 spend all or part of their time investing in growth companies. That proportion would probably be greater if I had been writing this in the spring of 2000, just before the dot-com bubble burst. In a historical perspective, however, value investing has beaten growth investing by about 30 % over the past century. The second commonest is contrarian investing, the strategy used by one in four investors in the book. Put simply, the strategy is based on investing in the things no one else wants. That’s the moment to buy, for their valuations are depressed, while the chance of sentiment changing in your favour is greater than if you were to invest in sought-after stocks where valuations are high. The majority of the world’s investors are almost pathologically obsessed with what other investors are up to. The result is an elaborate game of follow-my-leader through the financial markets. This leads to market prices being driven above or below their justified value – and that is what contrarian investors exploit. However, it is easier in theory than in practice, and for a very good reason. The nightmare scenario for most investors is to be alone in making a mistake. It’s not easy to swim against the current. Strength of character, conviction, and perseverance are just a few of the qualities required for success. Sometimes it can take years before the reward comes in the form of a revaluation. It is undoubtedly a risky strategy, and not for the timid. Probably its most famous name is the American investor David Dreman, author of the book Contrarian investment strategies. He went against the consensus and invested in bank shares in early 2008 – a large reason why he is not in this book. Two other strategies – quantitative and quality – are in principle opposed to each other. The quantitative investor, for example, purchases the ‘cheapest’ shares measured in terms of price–earnings ratio, dividend yield, or asset pricing, regardless of the management of the company, market share, or other ‘soft’ factors. The qualitative investor… ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=491))

- The traders’ strategies demand an approach and skills that are the very opposite of those of value investors, yet, as this book shows, they can be just as successful. What is crucial, however, that they are applied by an investor with the right mindset. Possibly it’s also a little easier to absorb the necessary knowledge for a successful trading strategy than it is to fully understand the theories of value investing, but, again, you still have to have the right mentality. Traders have a soft spot for trends, they take their losses in time, and they let their profits run, but few of them are notably successful at speculating on market direction, regardless of which type of asset they are interested in – a somewhat surprising finding. For example, virtually all the studies show that fully 60 % of the return on a share depends on how the stock market as a whole fares. By rights, it ought to be more profitable and more important to be correct about the market’s direction than to spend time identifying the right shares to buy. In reality, the opposite is true. If we assume that the market is rational, the simple explanation is then that it is incredibly difficult to judge how the market will develop.

- However, it is not only hard facts and strategies that distinguish between or unite investors. Attitude is just as important. One feature that I have found to be common to all the investors considered here is a general awareness of the problems that can arise. Several of them see problems at every turn and are constantly worried. Some, like Philip Fisher, are always worried about their investments. For some, the uncertainty and turmoil is a source of even greater satisfaction when things go ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=553))

- right. It gives them a humble attitude to work. Ultimately, it is an anxiety born of critical thinking. A healthy fear. Another form of behaviour that stands out is their set routines. Every day, year after year: the same train to work, the same evening activities, the same holiday destinations. Some even eat the same dinner every night. Impulsivity is not high on the list of the attributes of the men in this book. But it may well be the attitude needed to perform to the utmost of one’s powers in a changing world. Again, traders are the odd ones out. The most obvious area is probably in their weakness for extravagance. For traders, it is more the rule than the exception to spend their wealth, preferably in as conspicuous a manner as possible, while value investors seem to prefer a more restrained approach to their money. What unites all investors, however, is self-control and discipline. They are not swept along by emotional investments. They separate the facts and analyses from the expectations and hopes.

All the three major continents are represented in the table: America’s best (Livermore), Asia’s best (Jhunjhunwala), and Europe’s best (Szombatfalvy). One objection to this particular ranking is that all of them started out with nothing – it’s always easier to recoup a smaller sum than a large. On the other hand, I have not adjusted for expenses and extravagances along the way. Jesse Livermore was known for his ostentatious lifestyle, and his three divorces must have left quite a dent in his wallet. It is worth noting that all five investors in the table managed their own capital. The stock market was very much their province. Two of the investors were typical traders (Livermore and Wilson), while the other three are best understood as value investors. Pole position goes to the investors who occasionally leveraged their assets to the fullest, something synonymous with higher risk. Unless Rakesh Jhunjhunwala starts losing hand over fist or decides to retire, he will soon top the rankings. He is only 54 years old.

- Some of the investors’ counsel over the years has become obsolete because the market has changed. Many times it was a question of a once unique investment idea becoming so widespread that opportunities dried up. Philip Fisher, for example, never bought into a company if the price–earnings to growth ratio was higher than half the growth (PEG <0.5). At the time of writing it is hard to find any company that has such a low valuation. Those who are tempted to try to repeat Ed Seykota’s and Michael Marcus’ feats using trend-following strategies will find that the market is behaving differently now.

It is underrated, or as Albert Einstein once said, ‘Simplicity is the highest form of intellect.’ By far the most frequent recommendation by the investors in the book is to invest only in what you understand. Successful investors have usually identified the areas where they show particular aptitude. They are not tempted to explore unknown territory, but instead focus on using their comparative advantages. Stay focused, stay sharp. Find out what type of investor you are, think about what you’re good at, and then stick to it.

But he has also said the following “I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don’t believe in just sitting there and trying to dream it up all yourself. Nobody’s that smart.” By way of conclusion, I want to share with you the advice that helped me most over the years.

- When evaluating a potential investment, I look at three variables. First, I consider the sustainability of the firm’s business model. Any business can be described by a simple equation, or sales less expenses. As an example, when analysing a firm’s future sales, growth is defined by whether the unit price can be increased and more units can be sold. Secondly, it is important to evaluate the general industry outlook and its potential size to determine the company’s edge and ability to maintain its profit margin. Naturally, a strong company in a growing market would make an attractive investment candidate, but in Japan, I have observed cases where a company is still able to grow in a shrinking market. And finally, who is the person that decides the future course of the firm. Is he or she trustworthy? Is he or she creative and innovative? Does he or she have a track record or the potential to build a scalable business? Focusing on these three variables alone, I believe you are able to identify whether the company has a real edge or not. In my view, this approach makes it easier to make an investment decision rather than trying to consider all potential variables.

- The best investments are those which we refer to as ‘compounding machines’. Our process is guided by the framework we call the ‘three-legged stool.’ The first leg we describe as the business model, helping us to identify businesses which have enduring high returns on capital and pricing power in excess of input cost. The second leg we call the people model. This helps us identify managers who operate in the best interests of all shareholders. The third leg we call the reinvestment model. This allows us to identify those businesses with extensive reinvestment opportunities combined with a history of disciplined reinvestment results. When we identify one of these ‘compounding machines’ we are stingy with the purchase price, knowing that ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LI5FGNW&location=695))
