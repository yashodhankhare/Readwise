## Highlights
- Whatever qualities the rich may have, they can be acquired by anyone with the tenacity to become rich. The key, I think, is confidence. Confidence and an unshakable belief it can be done and that you are the one to do it. Tunnel vision helps. Being a bit of a shit helps. A thick skin helps. Stamina is crucial, as is a capacity to work so hard that your best friends mock you, your lovers despair and the rest of your acquaintances watch furtively from the sidelines, half in awe and half in contempt. Luck helps—but only if you don’t seek it. The answer to the question, then, is perhaps this: not those who want to and not those who need to, but those who are utterly determined to—whatever the cost.

- The follow-through, the execution, is a thousand times more important than a “great idea.” In fact, if the execution is perfect, it sometimes barely matters what the idea is.

- Still, let me repeat it one more time. Becoming rich does not guarantee happiness. In fact, it is almost certain to impose the opposite condition—if not from the stresses and strains of protecting wealth, then from the guilt that inevitably accompanies its arrival. Even leaving any moral dimension—heaven, camels and the eyes of needles—out of the equation, consider at least the wise sentiments of the author James Baldwin in his book Nobody Knows My Name, in which he concluded: Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex. You thought of nothing else if you didn’t have it, and thought of other things if you did. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=344))

- Money is one of the most neutral substances on earth. Others may conspire against you obtaining it through bigotry or prejudice. But they can only succeed if you permit them to. The object of your goal, in and of itself, is non-sentient. If you truly believe that your race, sex or upbringing can keep you from becoming rich, then you had best give up here. Either return this book to the shelf or, if you have already bought it, return it to the bookstore for a refund or give it to a friend. You may obtain the refund or please your friend. But you will never get rich. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=391))

- Never trust the vast mountain of conventional wisdom. It contains great nuggets of wisdom, it is true. But they lie alongside rivers of fool’s gold. Conventional wisdom daunts initiative and offers far too many convenient reasons for inaction, especially for those with a great deal to lose. Fortunately for you, you do not have anything to lose and can afford to ignore the “jobsworths” and Jeremiahs who have lived upon the mountain for so long that they have come to worship it.

- Anyone not busy learning is busy dying. For as long as you foster a willingness to learn, you will ward off sclerosis of the brain and hardening of the mental arteries. Curiosity has led many a man and women into the valley of serious wealth. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=434))

- But is fear really the father of cowardice? Let’s leave that to the philosophers. In business, in the accumulation of wealth, it is an impediment, for sure. But then, so is recklessness. No, I believe that it is the fear of failure which looms largest here. And fear of failure is definitely something that can be dealt with, and will be dealt with at length in this book. (See Chapter 3: Harnessing the Fear of Failure.) Outsiders are sometimes surprised at my reaction when people in this category, the Slightly Better Off and On the Way Up, decide to leave one of my own companies and set up on their own. I always wish them well. Not only outwardly, but in my heart, too. Often I throw a party for them. Or write glowing testimonials. Once or twice I have even underwritten their office lease or introduced them to a banker or a lawyer I trust. Why do I react that way? ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=463))

- Three reasons. Firstly, I’m proud of them. Proud that those who work for me are brave enough, motivated enough and trained sufficiently well to go for it on their own. Boldness attracts applause, as the writer and philosopher Goethe once remarked in doggerel: Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it! Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Secondly, it’s win-win. If they fail, they may well return to our company, especially if they remember that my senior colleagues and I sincerely wished them success in their new venture. Thus, if they fail, the company will be enhanced by their return. While if they should succeed—then we will be all richer for having an old alumnus as a friendly rival in the industry, rather than having created an enemy who wishes us anything but well. Lastly, it’s because I fear them. I fear they may have spotted something we have missed, some gap in the market. I fear we may have failed to listen to them. I fear that their new venture will grow at our expense while it poaches our personnel and our market share. And the only way to deal with fear is to cozy up to it.

- “Dare not” is one thing. “Cannot” is another. Not everyone can be rich. But anyone can dare to. Somebody has to. Let’s take a look at the arithmetic relating to the odds. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=529))

- To sum up then, if you wish to be rich, you must grow a carapace. A mental armor. Not so thick as to blind you to well-constructed criticism and advice, especially from those you trust. Nor so thick as to cut you off from friends and family. But thick enough to shrug off the inevitable sniggering and malicious mockery that will follow your inevitable failures, not to mention the poorly hidden ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=757))

- envy that will accompany your eventual success. Few things in life are certain except death and being taxed. But sniggering and mockery prior to any attempt to better yourself financially, followed by envy later, or gloating during your initial failures—these are three certainties in life. It hurts. It’s mindless. And it doesn’t mean anything. But it will happen. Be prepared to shrug it off. The Germans have a superb word for the (secret) pleasure humans obtain from the misfortunes of others. It is schadenfreude—from schaden meaning “harm” (from which we get the word “shadow”), and freude meaning “joy.” Those of you who are definitely going to be rich will recognize it often enough in the faces and body language of idiots around you. It is the price you must learn to pay for any attempt to raise yourself in the world. And I suspect that was as true ten thousand years ago as it is today. Now comes the hard part. Before we really get started on getting started, I ask you to consider carefully the short list below. It is by no means comprehensive, nor will it be the last list in this book, but should you find yourself unable to measure up to even one of these initial demands (and I mean just one), then my suggestion is that you close this book and give it to a friend.

- If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand very little chance of ever getting rich. • If you care what the neighbors think, you will never get rich. • If you cannot bear the thought of causing worry to your family, spouse or lover while you plow a lonely, dangerous road rather than taking the safe option of a regular job, you will never get rich. • If you have artistic inclinations and fear that the search for wealth will coarsen such talents or degrade them, you will never get rich. (Because your fear, in this instance, is well justified.) • If you are not prepared to work longer hours than almost anyone you know, despite the jibes of colleagues and friends, you are unlikely to get rich. • If you cannot convince yourself that you are “good enough” to be rich, you will never get rich. • If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game, you will never be rich. • If you cannot face up to your fear of failure, you will never be rich. The truth is that getting rich means sacrifice. And the worst of it is, it isn’t always you… ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=771))

- Just at the very time hormonal chaos, acne, drugs, alcohol, sport, fashion, gadgets, cars, music, body piercing, partying and sex are emerging as matters of compelling interest, we find ourselves faced with an eternal mantra about earning a crust. All of this is irritating in the extreme, mostly because it harps upon what is patently obvious—that one day we are going to have to make a living.

- And yet, there is a kernel of wisdom buried in the pulp of these parental and family concerns. The truth is that the vast majority of people doing the asking did not choose their own career. Either they stumbled into it or they were pushed. Knowing this, adults are often subconsciously seeking, however clumsily, to nag the young into confronting as early as possible the biggest decision over which any of us is likely to exercise real control. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our nationality. We do not choose who we fall in love with. We do not even choose the personality or character of the children we bring into the world or our own personal characteristics—random configurations of DNA do it for us.

- But we do get to choose, if we are determined enough, what it is we want to do for a living. Most of us flunk this test. Me, for instance. My career as an entrepreneur magazine publisher came about entirely by accident. If you had asked me when I was eighteen years old what I would be doing for the next thirty years, I would have told you I was going to be one of the biggest R&B singers in the world. That didn’t happen, and if I’m honest about it, I’m still a little disgusted with myself that I quit the dream so early. But, hey, I was getting tired of stealing food and bumming other people’s cigarettes and not having the rent money. It was no fun shinning down a drain-pipe to ensure I avoided meeting my landlady in the hall. And in any case, I had an appointment. It wasn’t one of my own choosing, but it came along all the same.

So is it such a terrible thing that the vast majority of us settle for what comes along rather than making a career plan and sticking with it? And how do you get to decide what career you might excel at anyway? ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=821))

- Most parents and teachers reading this are not going to like my answer. It’s this: none of it matters a damn if you want to get rich. This is not to say that “the Search” is not important to young people. It’s important and it’s scary and it’s fun and infuriatingly confusing. For most people, it occurs in their twenties or very early thirties. For a small number, the Search is over by their teens, either because they have a shriekingly obvious talent or because they have already spent too many hours hanging out in the wrong company.

- an ugly thing to say, but unless you realize and accept that you cannot be “one of the boys,” that your bosses and you are not “in this thing together,” that only those who refuse to be conned by the idea of “team spirit” in the workplace can succeed—unless you come to fully comprehend and understand all this, then you will only make other people rich. You will receive their heartfelt thanks and maybe a gold watch when you retire. But you will not get the money! It’s the same with close friends and family members. Consciously and outwardly they may want you to succeed beyond your wildest dreams. But subconsciously, often without being aware of it themselves, they might be far happier if you failed or only succeeded to a limited degree.

- New or rapidly developing industries, whether glamorous or not, very often provide more opportunities to get rich than established sectors. The three reasons for this are availability of risk capital, ignorance and the power of a rising tide. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=935))

- As a general rule of thumb, then, growing industries with relatively low start-up costs offer more opportunities for those who want to get rich than declining industries, or those that require huge start-up investment. This is not an iron-clad rule, however. While magazine and newspaper sales have been in slow decline in the Western world for decades, this “declining” industry is where I made a great deal of my own money.

- More important than any particular industry are the sectors within each industry. A sizable fish in a growing sector, however small, is more attractive to prospective purchasers and investors than the same size fish in a diminishing or static pond. This is one of the factors in stock-market bubbles—all growth is good (as far as investors are concerned), while all decline is fatal. I happen to believe that such sentiments are flawed. But what I believe is immaterial. It’s what the providers of capital believe that counts, no matter how illogical. After all, what are banks and venture capitalists but usurers who offer you an umbrella when the sun is shining and snatch it ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=962))

- away the instant a few rain clouds appear? (Ah, the old jokes are the best jokes.) I do know of a few examples of self-made multimillionaires from static industries, especially in commodities, publishing and precious metals, who were lucky enough to persuade banks and venture capitalists to back them with millions of dollars. Of course, this means that they rarely remain in control of their own destiny. Capitalism demands that whoever takes the most financial risk calls the piper’s tune. The biggest rewards go not to those individuals who came up with the idea, nor to those individuals who built the empire. They go to those entities or individuals who funded the enterprise and own the most stock. Always bear this in mind during the Search. This is the system you are pledged to both join and beat. To join because you need to get rich. And to beat because you have insufficient capital. Either by appearing to join those who will financially back you (while holding on grimly to every piece of stock you can), or by piecing together just enough success to borrow… ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=967))

- matter what promises or verbal guarantees you receive from investors during the Search, the issue will eventually come down to control. And control, even by a single percent of the shares of a business, the fabled 51-49 percent split, is often the be-all and end-all of the game. (See Chapter 6: Obtaining Capital.) Whoever controls a business can force its sale. Whoever controls a business can implement a merger. Whoever controls a business can fire you. Whoever controls a business, even by a pitiful 1 percent, is likely to take a great deal more money out of it than the minority shareholders. Remember, too, that in both private and public companies, not all shares are… ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=977))

- So how do you judge your own aptitudes? Trial and error is the only way I ever heard of. The problem is that we create an image of ourselves in our childhood and youth (often at the urging of parents, siblings or friends), and subsequently attempt to graft reality onto this image. More often than not, the graft doesn’t take and the result is bewilderment and disappointment. Far better to ruthlessly analyze what your particular aptitudes are and act upon them rather than attempt to graft an oak tree onto a dandelion. If you are still young, here is where the advice of a godparent, a trusted teacher or lecturer, or even a career counselor can prove useful, bearing in mind that impartiality is a better guide than parental pride. Your parents, likely as not, will be of little use here. Their love for you may well blind them to the harsher ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1025))

- realities of your true abilities and potential. There are a great many doctors and lawyers who apprenticed themselves to their profession solely to please an ambitious parent—only later to regret their acquiescence at leisure. If you do decide to ask for advice concerning your true aptitudes, then preparation shows you are serious and will be more likely to effect a serious response. As a godparent, I am always willing to discuss the matter, but only if my godchild has prepared a list of questions and suggestions, and only in private. Casual conversations around a family living room, with others sticking their oar in or trying to show off with banter and smart remarks, are tedious and counterproductive. For ambitious young people this is a serious matter and deserves to be taken seriously. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1031))

- I’d gotten to know John when he invited a bunch of us to cut a single with him, released as “God Save OZ” on Apple Records. Months later, I stayed at John’s house in Surrey while he was laying down base tracks for his album Imagine. During a break, I persuaded a few of the musicians in the studio to back me while I belted out a couple of R&B songs. John and Yoko were amused at my efforts. Phil Spector, the producer, was not; he sat glowering from behind the glass of the studio control room, his huge Koss headphones and tinted shades making him look like an alien from outer space. John signaled for Phil to press the record button while I was singing, and Phil reluctantly complied. Eventually, John stopped our impromptu jam session and ushered me into the control room. Then he played back the tape, urging me to listen carefully. I sat and listened, nervous and embarrassed. “Well?” he asked when it was over. “What do you hear?” “At least I was in tune . .… ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1042))

- but it isn’t your voice. Now do one using your own voice.” I traipsed back into the studio and tried. What followed was a catastrophe: I had no voice of my own. I’d been singing R&B on stage since I was thirteen—I’d even earned a living doing it—but I had never developed my own voice. I’d always imitated the voice of the original artist. Late that night, sitting around his kitchen table scoffing sandwiches, John grinned over his plate and delivered some devastating advice: “It won’t do, man. It’s not that you can’t sing . . . sure you can do a fair imitation of Chuck Berry or whatever, but people don’t pay for imitations. You gotta find your own voice or stick to editing your magazines.” “Mick Jagger does it,” I protested. “Yeah, but Mick always sounds like Mick, no matter what he sings. You just sound like a copycat. Your voice changes with each song.” It wasn’t what I wanted to hear at twenty-four, especially from a guy like John Lennon. But it was so demonstrably true that after a few more hopeless shots at “finding my own voice,” I did the only sensible thing and quit any pretense that I was going to make it in the music business. Lennon was being cruel-to-be-kind to a young man in his twenties—which is exactly what a mentor must be to anyone of that age. (If you want to hear my imitations of famous blues and R&B singers, go to www.basils-mustique.com or www.dana-gillespie.com and download them. You’ll see that Lennon was right on the money.) If you are older, and by older I mean in your thirties, then the matter becomes far more difficult. I would say almost impossible, as far as advice is concerned. How many of us at that age know somebody to whom we can say: “What do you truly believe my strong points to be?” and expect a meaningful answer? And even if we can find someone we feel comfortable discussing such a subject with, how many of us know anyone whose opinion is worth the potential embarrassment? Blind faith and trial and error are just about all that’s left, unfortunately. There ought to be a better way, but no one I know has ever stumbled across it. Inclinations are easy to list. Aptitude is far less so. Trial and error, combined with fierce determination and a willingness to discard cherished perceptions about ourselves, is the best that I can suggest. It is highly unsatisfactory and frustrating that the most important decision we are likely… ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1054))

If the influence of luck is a delusion, then all I can say is that the delusion is virtually universal. The filthy rich are not gods. They are men and women who put on their underwear in the morning pretty much as you do. It is true that they were in the right place at the right time and did the right thing. The difference is that in some way they placed themselves in fate’s way, then grasped her by the forelock as she sprinted past. (“Lady Luck is bald behind,” says the old proverb.) To put it less fancifully, they were lucky in the Search and skillful in their follow-up. Boldness helped. Conquering fear of failure helped. Persistence helped. But, without some luck, no one can get anywhere in the search to discover the exact arena in which to do battle, the arena that suits an individual’s aptitudes and inclinations. Boldness? The most successful generals or admirals in military history shared one characteristic: they were willing to ignore orders and risk… ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1090))

- Chances come to everyone in life, in all shapes and sizes, often disguised, and more often radiating risk and potential humiliation. Those who are prepared to analyze the risk, to bear the humiliation and to act in deadly earnest—these are the “lucky” ones who will find themselves, when the music stops, holding a potful of money. But then, in reality, they made their own luck. They never stopped searching. Perhaps they spent months or even years searching in the wrong place. Or possibly they hit upon the object of their search at the first attempt. No matter. Having found what they needed where they needed it, and having done what they judged needed doing, their search is over. And it is they who will become rich.

- Having a great idea is simply not enough. The eventual goal is vastly more important than any idea. It is how ideas are implemented that counts in the long run. Good ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate an athlete who possesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an overpriced pair of sneakers. Specially adapted sneakers may be a good idea. But the goal is still to win, and sports shoes don’t win. Athletes do. And yet I have lost count of the number of men and women who have approached me with their “great idea,” as if this, in and of itself, was some passport to instant wealth. The idea is not a passport. At most, it is the means of obtaining one. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1159))

- The lesson is clear. Despite the words of the old rock ’n’ roll song, the original is not the greatest. Not always. If you want to be rich, then watch your rivals closely and never be ashamed to emulate a winning strategy. They may josh you a little for doing it, but that’s a price well worth paying. The problem with the great idea is that it concentrates the mind on the idea itself. This is fine as far as it goes. But unless the idea is executed efficiently and with panache and originality, then it doesn’t matter how great the idea is, the enterprise will fail. Ideas are certainly of immense importance, but I have seen so many people attempting to create a start-up company become obsessed with proving that their idea is “right” rather than obsessed with making money. And I have watched them wasting years doing it. Nobody really cares if an idea is “right,” except the person who came up with it.

- Apple’s products were innovative, slick, cool and far, far superior in every way to any other personal computer available at that time. In fact, they were so cool their users often spent a great deal of time proselytizing for the Apple cause. Users like me, for instance. So why is Apple such a small part of the personal computer market today? The answer is Steve Jobs. Steve comes up with or encourages brilliant ideas. He has the guts to back them and to see them through. He is smart, passionate and a great man. But he will not admit he is wrong and he would, apparently, rather go broke than make such an admission. It was Steve, I am told, who insisted that the early Macintosh computers should be “closed boxes” and that the Mac operating system would never be shared or licensed to other manufacturers. A description used by Apple marketeers at the time was that the Mac was like a Cuisinart—a food blender—and did not need to connect to the rest of the world. A Mac could do for you whatever you wanted to do with a computer. It would not compromise itself by sharing the opportunity to communicate with lesser machines or devices. The hardware would be Apple, the accessories would be Apple, the software would be Apple. No open ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1260))

- architecture. No compromise with the “jerks” running the big old-style computing companies who were flexing their muscles and salivating at this burgeoning new market. Steve Jobs would not share his operating system, as IBM and others subsequently did. His attitude toward all rivals (and I have witnessed this at first hand) was astonishingly arrogant. I’ll bet it still is. There is a story from the early days of Apple, which I like to believe is true, of Jobs being invited to the CEO’s office of a huge rival computer corporation. Steve parked his bum on the corner of the great man’s massive desk, leaned over and told him: “I am going to bury you. Apple is going to bury your company.” No he didn’t. They buried him. This arrogance, and belief that only his (or his company’s) ideas are right, is the dark side of the fire that has driven Apple up and down a financial roller coaster for nearly thirty years. Jobs is the savior of the company. Jobs is also a man who appears to be in thrall to what he sees in a mirror. It is not true that there is a large sign on Steve Jobs’s desk at Apple which reads, “My Way or the Highway”—but the fact that so many people believe there is such a sign tells its own story. Apple’s innovations and ideas (as well as its corporate arrogance) are a legend in the computer industry. Those ideas, and their eventual execution, are often world-beaters.

- But an idea is not enough. It is never enough. And even its successful execution as a piece of technology is not enough if the company refuses to join with the rest of the world and its own customers in cooperative exploitation. I predict that, just as he did two decades ago, Steve Jobs will take his company to the top of the share-price mountain and then race downhill with them under an avalanche of “lesser” rivals and mortals who will conspire to connect with each other and thieve Apple’s customers. If it wasn’t so tragic, it would be hilarious. The story of Apple is a morality tale, a tale of the great idea wrapped in the passion of one man (once Steve Wozniak had departed), wrapped in a ball of arrogance, wrapped again in a shell of marketing genius. It’s great theater. It makes for wonderful stories in financial newspapers and technology websites. It is a joy to behold for those who know the historical context. But it is not smart business, except in the short term, before “lesser” men have caught up. And except for Steve Jobs.

- Steve Jobs is not a monster. He is an all-American maverick and a world-class marketing genius. But until a man or woman as powerful as he is arrives at Apple (over his dead body), who is determined to break the cycle he has indulged in for so many years, Apple will remain merely an icon of awe. It will not become a company of the size that truly could (and should) “bury” monsters like IBM. So if I believe all this, why do I use Apple computers? I use them because they are better computers. Far better than any other personal computer available on the planet. And because I was in at the beginning and still feel in myself the incredible excitement that Wozniak and Jobs stirred in what they called “the rest of us.” I am still one of “the rest of us” and will remain loyal to Apple products. In my heart of hearts, too, I wish Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had buried their corporate rivals. But then, I was always a sucker for the underdog.

The first four of these are beyond the compass of this book. All I will say about “winning it,” presumably by gambling, is that the odds are very bad indeed. It’s no way to get rich. It is true that certain people exhibit incredible ability in games of skill like poker. But in the end, the losing streaks always seem to become longer and the winning streaks shorter. Gambling, even for those at near-genius level, is time-consuming and totally exhausting. As for games of chance, I will not insult your intelligence by discussing them.

- ever met who got insanely rich from a hedge fund operation were (you guessed it!) the managers of hedge funds. So how come it’s so difficult to locate capital if there’s so much of it about? The simple answer is that the amounts of money you probably have in mind are way too small. And “small” can work on many levels. In 2004 my company did the rounds of New York City banks and institutions. We were looking for a measly $20 million at a reasonable rate of interest spread over five or six years for a specific purpose. No dice. We were offered $100 million dollars, no sweat—but only if the providers could cut themselves in for “a piece of the action.” This seemed crazy to me. I had plenty of security and was merely looking to borrow a little money, not lumber my company with an “end-game partner.” Eventually, we found what we needed, but we had to come back to Europe to do it. So what had happened? Many US providers of capital of any stripe now only wish to play ball in return for “a piece of the action”—not to mention the guaranteed return of the capital and interest if no action materializes! (In that sense, we were probably the victims of recent low interest rates, which have forced traditional bankers into a game of Darwinian evolution.

- maybe “a piece of the action” will. Banks, like everyone else, have to evolve or die.) This, of course, is the premise upon which venture capitalists have always operated. Venture capital companies are one way to raise capital, for sure. But the price they demand is nearly always that you hand over a huge chunk of equity. More often than not, they also insist on a date by which your new venture must be sold, either back to yourself or to outsiders. Why? Because their own funds usually come from wealthy individuals who demand a high return within a limited time frame. This, in turn, leads many venture capitalists to move from an advisory to an operational role in any business in which they invest, cramping your style and scaring the pants out of everyone who works for you. Those wealthy investors in their own funds are unforgiving and merciless, and venture capitalists will therefore do anything it takes to protect and maximize short-term returns from your business.

- Venture capital money, dolphin money, is not for the faint-hearted. Too often, it is only for the desperate—unless building a business for a quick(ish) return and a small piece of the action is your goal. And there is nothing wrong with such a goal in the short term. If that is the case, then it’s worth remembering that the best of the dolphins can certainly boast a ton of managerial talent and experience. They tend to know what they are talking about in the abstract, if not in your particular niche. Dolphins can afford to hire such talent for the simple reason that they absolutely have to. Your successful venture-capital-funded business must also pay for the failures that the same venture capitalist invested in last year.

But a great many other original owners or creators are squeezed out long before the fabled “big pay day.” If you fail to grow your businesses swiftly enough, then flipper becomes agitated and noses in. His very survival (or at least his annual bonus) depends upon your performance that year. Flipper doesn’t care about long-term prospects. He doesn’t even care about long-term shareholder value. He only cares about growth—and he cares about it now. As with his co-denizen of the deep, the shark, he either keeps moving forward or he drowns—and you have no choice but to move forward or drown with him.

More often, you will start up underfunded, on your own or with the fishes (we are coming to that), and only turn to the dolphins for the injection of capital you believe will propel you to the next level.

- Today, I have at least a rudimentary understanding of depreciation and suchlike on a balance sheet. But as far as cash flow is concerned, I have little to learn from any qualified accountant. Cash flow is something that any entrepreneur must fully comprehend from the get-go. Balance sheets are a matter for accountants, banks and auditors. But cash flow is the heartbeat of your company. If cash flow is good, then no matter how badly run or poorly managed a company is, there is always a decent chance of turning its fortunes around. At the very least, there is time enough to be able to do so. But if a business’s cash flow is weak or failing, then the chances are that it must shut down or be sold in the not-too-distant future and its assets disposed of to satisfy creditors. Why is it that cash flow is so often the cause of business failure? Most often, either the business is not a viable one, or it has expanded beyond its capacity to support its rate of expansion.

You can delegate many tasks when creating a new business, but monitoring and forecasting cash flow is not one of them. It’s your responsibility and your task. Nobody else’s. You can improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a start-up’s early days: • Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two legs. • Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space. • Never indulge in fancy office or reception furniture, unless your particular business demands that you make such an impression on clients. • Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to. You can show off later. • Pay yourself just enough to eat. • Do not be shy to call customers who owe you money personally . It works.

Stick to it. • Always meet payroll, even at the expense of starving yourself that week. • Issuing staff credit cards, company cell phones or cars is the road to ruin. • Leaving lights, computers, printers and copiers on overnight is just stupid. • A vase of beautiful flowers in reception every week creates a better impression than £100,000 worth of fancy Italian furniture. • Get used to groveling. Groveling is an effective tool in a start-up’s cash flow. • They want your business. Play one supplier off against another. Ruthlessly. • Only enter a factoring deal in absolute extremity. Exit it fast. • Keep your chin up. It could be worse. You could be working for them. Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. But just as presidents and prime ministers learn to plan for war and hope for peace, you must plan for the worst and hope for the best in all matters relating to the cash flowing in and out of your start-up company.

- Probably the two easiest words to write and the hardest error to avoid in this entire book. We all do it. Even the best of us. And we never stop doing it all our business lives. This is a disease curable only by iron willpower or 20/20 hindsight. Reinforcing failure sounds so easy to avoid. If something fails, stop doing it and start doing something else, right? Er, right. Except, just when do you decide that you have a “failure” on your hands? Too late, is the answer—always too late. Let’s examine the nature of success and failure for a moment. We know that success has a thousand fathers while failure is famously always an orphan. Not to mention a bastard. Then again, success has been described as the ability to go from one failure to another, unrepentant and with no loss of enthusiasm. All very well. But how the devil can we judge when a failure has occurred so that we can safely cease to reinforce it and move on?

Five million dollars was a lot of chump change for an individual entrepreneur back in the 1990s. Come to think of it, it still is. Blender wasn’t even a part of my core publishing business. That meant I was investing money personally. My five million had come from after-tax dollars! Just how dumb can one guy be? I had forgotten John Dryden’s advice. Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow; He who would search for pearls must dive below. I had forgotten to “dive below.” I was in awe at the pretty patterns the straw made on the surface. And because I would not give in, my stubbornness turned into a jujitsu master and slammed me to the mat again and again.

- When I had my first real financial success in 1974 publishing Kung-Fu Monthly, a one-shot poster-magazine about the martial-artist film star Bruce Lee, I had already begun thinking big. There’s nothing wrong with thinking big. The fact that this teeny-weeny one-shot had Monthly in the title caused a certain amount of mirth ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1832))

- in the British magazine business. One-shots are not unknown by any means, but calling them month-lies is coming at it a trifle high. Anyway, just how much could hippie journalists who knew nothing about kung fu publish about one man twelve times a year? Even my friendly distributors only gave KFM a year before it folded. To everyone’s surprise, not least my own, KFM continued to be published for ten years, and each issue was dedicated almost exclusively to extolling the virtues of Bruce Lee. It has to be said that we had one or two things in our favor. Firstly, Bruce Lee had lived fast and died young, always a great career move for any movie star. Secondly, it is impossible to libel a dead man, legally speaking. Thirdly, he was popular in virtually every country in the world, including the Third World. Fourthly, I had obtained a huge stash of Bruce Lee photographs by sending my friend, Don Atyeo, to Hong Kong at the time of Bruce Lee’s funeral. Don is a great journalist. He set about interviewing everyone who had ever known Bruce Lee. Those interviews served as the basis for my magazine for more than a decade. How else was I thinking big? As soon as Kung-Fu Monthly No. 1 was published (it sold over 100,000 copies right off the bat), I got on airplanes. Dozens of airplanes. In country after country after country, together with an Australian lawyer friend, Andrew Fisher, I licensed Kung-Fu Monthly to numerous foreign publishing companies. Eventually, there was even a Chinese edition of Kung-Fu Monthly, along with German, French, Italian, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish and Arabic editions. Then I flew to America. Economy class. I will never forget the two weeks I spent trudging the streets of the Big Apple looking for a partner to publish Kung-Fu Monthly in the States. My hair was still halfway down my back. My high-heeled snakeskin boots, Mr. Fish tie and Tommy Nutter knock-off suit were not exactly what American businessmen were used to. One of my heroes was Stan Lee and his Marvel comic empire, which published The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man and my personal favorite The Silver Surfer. To cut a painful ten minutes short, Mr Lee had me tossed out of their midtown offices. One publisher after another took one look at me and my puny little product and showed me the door. Nobody was even remotely interested. In desperation I went to visit a British ex-pat whose name had been given to me by my friend Tony Elliott of Time Out magazine in London. His name was Peter. Together with his partner, Bob, Peter was just starting up his own magazine company in New York City. His office was shared, more of a cubicle really, but respectable. His demeanor inscrutable. But he had two things ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1835))

- going for him—he had capital and he had the contacts to make publishing KFM possible over there. Slowly and methodically Peter examined my sample issues of Kung-Fu Monthly and began asking me questions relating to costs, sales and the unusual format of a poster-magazine. “Let me get this straight,” he said. “This thing is really an uncut sixteen-page signature from a normal magazine and yet you charge the price of a whole magazines to the reader.” “You’ve got it,” I replied. “You can charge that kind of money,” I went on breathlessly, “because when they finish reading it, kids can hang it on the wall as a cheap poster.” Peter looked up at me and smiled. “I’ll try it. I have to try it. What can we lose?” Peter and Robert are still my American partners thirty years later. KFM was a success in America. And one magazine led to another. Over the years, Peter, Bob and I have risked hundreds of millions of dollars together. We have created jobs for thousands of Americans. We have become rich. Thinking big. That’s the secret. Of the dozens of independent magazine publishers in Britain back in the 1970s, hardly one of them dared to think big enough to get on an airplane and hawk their wares in the biggest market in the world. Those few that did so, licensed their magazines in America. They never thought to create a partnership and risk their own capital. Not even the largest British magazine publishers, conglomerates like IPC thought to risk it. Perhaps… ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1856))

- Most of the worst errors I have made in my life came from forgetting to act small. It’s hard to do when you’re rolling around in coin and everything is going your way. But acting big leads to complacency, and complacency is the reason that many successful start-ups falter. Every day you have to hit the ground running, putting in more hours than even your most dedicated member of staff. You have to stay flexible. You have to be willing to listen and to learn and to emulate success elsewhere. If you don’t, if you think you have already made the cut, if you’re thinking “game over: time to party,” then bad stuff begins to happen very quickly. I know all this because in the late 1980s and early 1990s I forgot to remember to act small. I spent millions of dollars on drinking, taking drugs and running around with whores. I lost all respect for money and for the blood, sweat and treasure I had expended to acquire it. I was acting big. In a single decade I got through more than a hundred million dollars living high on the hog. At one time, there were no less than fourteen “mistresses” depending on a regular stipend from my personal bank account. A single evening’s entertainment could come to thirty or forty thousand in the Big Apple, London or Hong Kong. There was nothing I could not do—I was king of the world. Acting big.

- Even though I was not so foolish as to use company money for this idiocy, my business still suffered and my health suffered. Some good people I trusted stopped working with me. It was absolutely the stupidest thing I have ever done. And it very nearly killed me. Eventually, I was hospitalized. When the doctors there heard how much cocaine and booze I had been imbibing over the past few years, they went ballistic. In brutal words of one syllable at a time, they warned me that either I was through with drugs and booze or they were through with me. One of them, a young doctor with a stutter, summed it all up: “M-M-Mr. Dennis, you are ac-ac-acting as if you ha-ha-have a one-way ticket to ja-ja-jail or the mo-mor-morgue. Wh-wh -which do you wa-wa-want it to be?” He’d got that right. Acting big. Eventually I wised up and began to straighten out my life. I escaped by the skin of my teeth from the consequences of acting big. Almost as if by magic, the business began to make progress again. I hurled myself back into the fray, gave up all narcotics (probably the hardest thing I have ever done), stuck to wine as far as the booze went and told the whores to take a hike. And I have been a far, far happier man ever since. And probably a nicer man. The scars are still there and the damage is done, no getting away from that.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you are determined to be rich, there is only one talent you require. Can you think what it is before your eyes skim down to the next paragraph? Right. You need the talent to identify, hire and nurture others with talent. “There is no substitute for talent. Industry and all the virtues are of no avail,” wrote the novelist Aldous Huxley. I have never been much of a fan of his as far as literature is concerned, but in this Huxley is correct. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1909))

- that it would have been as much fun. And I doubt, too, that we would have succeeded to the degree we did. Talent is usually conscious of its own value. But the currency of that value is not necessarily a million-dollar salary. The opportunity to prove themselves, and sometimes the chance to run the show on a day-to-day basis, will often do the trick just as well. This holds true even if talent is placed in the driver’s seat of a small division within an existing operation. What talent seeks, as often as not, is the chance to prove itself and the opportunity to excel. My advice on this subject was contained in the second paragraph of this section. You must identify talent. Then you must move heaven and earth to hire it. You must nurture it, reward it properly and protect it from being poached. If necessary, dream up a new project. Better still, get the talent to dream it up. Youth is a further factor. By the time talent is in its mid-to-late forties or early fifties, it will have become very, very expensive. Young talent can be found and underpaid for a short while, providing the work is challenging enough. Then it will be paid at the market rate. Finally, it will reach a stage where it is being paid based on past reputation alone. That is when you must part company with it. The French impressionist Degas once said: “Everybody has talent at twenty-five. The difficult thing is to have it at fifty.” True enough. Most talent does not survive undiminished through its middle forties, although there are some stunning exceptions to this rule of thumb. Anybody wishing to become rich cannot do so without talent. Either their own, or far more likely, on the back of the talent of others. Talent is indispensable, although it is always replaceable. Just remember the simple rules concerning talent: identify it, hire it, nurture it, reward it, protect it. And, when the time comes, fire it. If you can do all these things with talent in the context of building your own company, I would be truly astonished if you did not become rich. Because the truth is, talent does most of the work for you. Just as it has done since the beginning of recorded history. After all, who built the pyramids? The pharaohs or the engineers? Think about it. Then go hire some talent—just like they did. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=1948))

That with just a little further effort, the veil of failure will be torn away to reveal success. And the difference is...?

- The difference between the two is as crucial and as intangible as the dotted line on a map across a desert separating one country from another. These lines appear to be of little importance. They are of no importance to the living creatures that inhabit the landscape. A desert gerbil does not think to itself, “So now I am crossing from the United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.” But at some time in the future, that dotted line that looked so pitiful to us a moment ago compared with the harsh realities of nature, may become terribly important. It may represent billions of dollars in oil revenues. It may mean the difference between wealth and mere subsistence. “Never give in” is a useful catchphrase. But don’t take it too literally. We must all surrender at some time, to love or desire or death. You will be forced into the last of these, and a fool if you never surrender to the first. But never give in easily. If you can, attempt one step farther along the road than appears sensible before giving in. “Persistence” is a vital attribute for those who wish to become rich, or who wish to achieve anything worthwhile for that matter. As is the ability to acknowledge that one has made a mistake and that a new plan of action must now be made. Any such acknowledgement is not a weakness, it is a sign of clear thinking.

- of wealth. I will leave you with two thoughts on the subject. Firstly, if you have ever escaped from very serious trouble indeed, or have been at the point of death, then you will know that one of two things happens. Either you become cautious to an absurd degree, or you are liberated from many ordinary fears. With liberation comes the knowledge that nothing is really very important in the lives of men; nothing is as terrifying as the fear itself. And from that, paradoxically, comes self-belief—a belief that anything is possible. Secondly, you should remember that you are unique. Any scientist will tell you so. No other human was ever born, or will ever be born, with the same combination of upbringing, flaws and qualities that you possess. Why should you not believe in yourself?

After that, managers and bean-counters and financial advisors take over. But only afterward. I had the money and I had the “feeling.” The “feeling” is when the hair rises slightly on the back of your arms and neck and you know you are on the scent of something you shouldn’t be doing— but you’re going to do anyway.

You can only do it by becoming a predator, by waiting patiently, by remaining alert and constantly sniffing the air and by bringing massive, murderous force to bear upon your prey when you pounce. You can share the kill later, by all means. But if you want to get rich, trust your own judgment when it calls—and leave those whose job it is to manage your business to pick up the pieces.

- Strangling your own baby, in order to grow, is far more common than you might think. If you have a successful monthly magazine, for instance, and then launch a weekly in the same category, you will inevitably weaken sales of your original title. This will follow as surely as night follows day. So should you launch the weekly magazine? Yes! A thousand times yes! Why? Because if you do not launch the weekly edition, even though you know it is a good idea, then your rivals will do it for you. You will then be left with a damaged monthly and no weekly. This is called the “Barbarians at the Gate” principle. Let’s imagine you have a herd of sacred cows inside a fortress. The barbarians are at the gate and you are under siege. Killing sacred cows is a horrible crime, even though your defenders are running short of food. If the barbarians overrun the fortress, the sacred cows will die anyway. If you kill some of the cows, you will be stronger and possibly able to turn back the barbarian attack. Ergo, you eat one or two sacred cows—even if those same cows were the meaning of life last week. Learning to evolve or die is a cardinal virtue.

- Ideas, by the way, cannot be “owned” by anyone. You cannot trademark or patent or copyright any idea. You can only protect the execution of the idea and trademark the name. This is an important thing to know in any business and is often misunderstood by people who come to you with an idea. Such people often request you sign an NDA (a Non-Disclosure Agreement), and I am usually happy to do so. Why? Because the force in law of most NDAs is limited and they do not work in the way most people think they do. For example, the idea for 3M’s Post-it Note could be described as follows: “Paper of any size, one edge of which will attach itself by way of gum to most surfaces, especially paper, and which can be detached, without leaving a residue or mark.” A lawyer would shorten that to “paper with a repositionable adhesive.” No matter. If you had tried taking that description to the patent office after 3M’s research scientist, Dr. Spencer Silver, discovered the adhesive but before ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2333))

- Art Fry, a 3M new-product researcher, hit upon a use for it—it would have availed you nothing. Why? Because 3M owned the formula for the gum. The formula was a way of executing the idea. If you had come up with an even better gum and had created your own name for such notes and marketed them, then 3M would have had a devil of a job to stop you, because no one can copyright or patent an idea. You can only protect the execution of the idea, which must be unique. If your gum really was unique, you would be in business. And what a business! Similarly, the Walt Disney Corporation does not own the rights to all imaginary talking mice. Talking animals existed in the minds of writers and artists long before Walt Disney himself was born. The Disney Corporation only owns the “look and feel” (and a host of other attributes) of two particular talking mice, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. If you are in the business of executing ideas to make money, then this is something you are going to have to come to grips with and become a minor expert on. There are many books to help you out there. ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2341))

- Like a modern-day version of that tormented biblical figure, misfortune dogs him. No sooner has he struck gold than it crumbles into dross. No sooner has he dug another mine than it fills with water nobody guessed was there. Nothing will work. Nothing has ever really worked for him. It must be absolutely galling. His personality has changed for the worse in recent years. He now exhibits, perhaps not unnaturally, a degree of resentment toward those who have done so much better with so much less talent and less determination. I notice I have begun to avoid his company. And so have others. Is it because I feel guilty? Is it because I wish to avoid his flashes of bitterness and dark humor? Is it because I am leery of vile, involuntary gloating? Or is it because in some pagan corner of my heart, I believe that bad luck might be contagious? I don’t know the answer to that. But I do know that he ought to be rich. At least as rich as I am, and perhaps a great deal richer. So what is it that separates us? Perhaps a dispassionate analysis will help to us to peer dimly into the murky world of what we humans call “luck” and “misfortune.” ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2496))

- Is luck just “a dividend of sweat”? How many times can one person “dust themselves down, pick themselves up and start all over again” before they lose heart? I have already mentioned Winston Churchill’s “If you’re going through hell, keep going.” All very well if you are a cigar-smoking, aging hero at the nadir of his career, who is nevertheless certain he is destined for greatness. But what about the rest of us? The only truth about luck, good or bad, is that it will change. The law of averages virtually guarantees it. And here, I think, is one difference that separates me from my “unlucky” friend, whom I shall call Albert. Albert is so close to the cross currents of the market that his antennae lead him astray. When he hits yet another bump on the road, or has a head-on collision, he attempts to change his luck by changing direction. It’s not that he lacks stamina. Albert has tons of energy and stamina. But he doesn’t, as Churchill put it, “keep going.” Instead, he keeps looking for pastures new—the golden sunlit uplands, the philosopher Leibniz’s “best of all possible worlds.” Perhaps there, in a new place, he will find his fortune and change his luck? Instead, he immediately encounters the evils of an unfamiliar and perilous country, without the benefit of the road maps he so painstakingly put together in his last adventure. He does not “Keep on truckin’ ” as the cartoonist, Robert Crumb, would have it. This “flight not fight” behavioral trait is the sign of a prey animal, not a predator. Despite what you will read in many self-improvement tomes, “partnering” and “symbiotic evolution” are no way to get rich. They may be a way to a better world. They may make you a happier person and a better manager. But they will not make you rich— except, perhaps, in spirit. To become rich you must behave as a predator. I will go further, you must become a predator. Albert is not a predator. By moving so adroitly and so swiftly from one thing to the next, Albert does not place himself in the way of luck. He does not draw luck to him. He does not make his own luck. He is much too much in love with the green, green grass just over the next hill. Then again, Albert is more intelligent than I am. He had a grand education and read all the right books at university. He is not a self-taught scholar, as I am.

- My advice concerning luck is to laugh in the face of the Lady when she presents herself. Take what you will of her bounty and act swiftly to take advantage of good fortune. But never thank her for it. And forget her the moment she leaves to seek another victim. In modern, sexist parlance: “Treat her mean to keep her keen.” Pimp her, don’t court her. And don’t go looking for her or make inquiries about her. It isn’t exactly the act of a gentleman, but then you didn’t ask me to teach you to be a gentleman. You asked me to show you how to get rich. So here are my last thoughts on this vexing and baffling phenomenon. • Prepare yourself for luck, but don’t seek her out. Let her come to you. • Make your own luck • Don’t whine or ever describe yourself as “unlucky.” (You’re alive, aren’t you?) • Be bold. Be brave. Don’t thank your lucky stars. The stars can’t hear you. • Stay the course. Stop looking for the green grass over the hill. • Don’t try to do it all yourself. Delegate and teach others to delegate. • Remember that most predators are lucky most of their lives, unlike their prey. • Whiners and cowards die a hundred times a day. Be a hero to yourself. • If being a hero isn’t your style, then fake it. Reality will catch up eventually. ([Location 2586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2586))

- During John F. Kennedy’s portentous inaugural speech, the new president exhorted his fellow countrymen: “Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.” This is typically muddled thinking from one of the most overrated presidents in US history. A good-looker, but a bad egg. If you “negotiate out of fear” you are not “negotiating.” You are surrendering in all but name. As to the second half of his pronouncement, he is saying that it’s always worth listening to the other side in the search for mutually beneficial agreements. Did we need the world’s most powerful man to tell us that? It’s just common sense. ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2612))

- Serious negotiations, however, have everything to do with getting rich. This is both because a great negotiator can make a real difference in some situations and because many people, astonishingly, believe themselves to be great negotiators. In my experience, the reality is somewhat more prosaic: • Most of us are rather poor negotiators. • Most negotiations are unnecessary. • “The other side” is often just as smart (or stupid) as you are. • In the end, “the balance of weakness” almost always decides the issue. • In Greed vs. Need, the former usually “wins.” All negotiations arise from weakness, unless you are one of that strange tribe who finds themselves intoxicated with the process of bargaining and negotiating itself. Sure, haggling can be fun, but it’s only a means to an end as far as this book is concerned. ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2620))

- Whatever you decide to do, you are not involved in “negotiating”— you are problem solving. The same applies to mid-level salary negotiations, most human-resource issues, job-title dickering, job-performance reviews and the price of wet fish. Serious negotiations are like falling in love. You may have fooled around a few times and been strongly attracted to one or two lovers. But when you fall in love, brothers and sisters, you will know all about it. Right off the bat. Boom! That’s what serious negotiations are like. It’s probably happened once or twice, right? ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2641))

- Or take the attitude of banks toward start-up or small companies. If you need a loan because you cannot meet payroll, you almost certainly won’t get one. (Er, make that “you absolutely, definitely won’t get one.”) The balance of weakness is so obvious and utterly immediate, nobody will want to waste time listening to your entreaties. But if you need a loan, say, because you wish to take a private company public with a reasonable chance of success in the not-too-distant future (in other words, you don’t really need a loan, it would merely be convenient to be offered one), then loans will shower upon you like confetti. After all, banks need to make money by selling professional services as well as charging interest, and you are now a potentially important customer, a customer who may well require those professional services—not a supplicant groveling on his knees with a dog-eared business plan.

- A Few Tips on Negotiating • Remember that few of us are any good at detailed negotiations. That includes your opponent, by the way. • If you are a poor negotiator, like me, then set a limit on what you will pay or accept and on any conditions attached. Do not deviate. Your first thought is your best thought. • Most negotiations are unnecessary. Don’t enter into them. Remember that “the fortress that parleys is already half taken.” Save serious negotiations for serious occasions. • Do your homework. And do it rigorously. What you don’t know or haven’t bothered to find out can kill you in any type of serious negotiation. • Despite my jungle book examples above, the devil really is in the detail in serious negotiations. Get all the professional help you can trust. But do not surrender control of the negotiations or the agenda to such professionals. They are not the ones who will ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2895))

- have to live with the consequences—you are. Professional advisors are there to explain and advise, not to decide. • If your advisors are leading you down a path you don’t approve of during your negotiations, call a “time-out” and tell them privately that if they continue along that route you will get yourself some new advisors. The world is full of them. • Never fall in love with the deal. A deal is just a deal. There will always be other deals and other opportunities. • Avoid auctions in business like the plague—unless you are selling something, that is. You will nearly always pay more than is wise if you are the “winner” of an auction process. • The negotiator opposite you is not your new best friend. He is not your partner. He is not your confidant. You have no obligation, outside of ordinary courtesy, to please him or satisfy his demands. He is the enemy. If you do not understand that real winners and real losers emerge from serious negotiations, then you will be robbed, whatever the circumstances. • Take no notice of management manuals that tell you to leave passion and emotion out of the negotiating room. If you are emotional or passionate about something, then let it show. But leaven emotion with courtesy, and, if possible, with wit. If you’re not the witty type, then flattery and self-deprecation are good substitutes. • Listen when engaged in serious negotiations. Then listen some more. You are in no hurry. Nobody ever got poor listening. Also, use silence as a weapon. Silences are disconcerting. People tend to fill silences with jabber, often weakening their bargaining position as they do so. • Choose a rogue element to your advantage and bring it into the negotiation at a late stage. You’ll be amazed at how often this tactic produces results. • The British created the largest geophysical empire in the world with one tactic: divide and rule. It always works. It never fails if you can get to exploit it. Get to know the other side. There may be slight differences in the individual approaches of their senior managers and, possibly, in their goals. Drive a wedge and keep hammering. • Permit no such weaknesses in your own camp. I have often banned senior executives from taking part in negotiations simply to avoid this trap.

- outmaneuvered, than to have two or three of you silently squabbling. • Everyone thinks they are a great negotiator, but most of us simply are not. If it’s your company, then, for better or worse, you are the final arbiter. That remains true whether you are a good negotiator or a bad one. • If you suspect you perform badly on such occasions, do not attend, even if you are the 100 percent owner. Get someone else to do it after setting out your response to every conceivable option that might arise. This tactic can be devastating to the other side, and Peter, Bob and I have used it on many occasions in the past. You have to trust your nominee completely, though. • Above all, establish where the balance of weakness lies in any serious negotiation. Most strengths are self-evident, especially strengths like cash and infrastructure. Weaknesses are usually hidden.

- “Never break a covenant, whether you make it with a false man or a just man of good conscience. The covenant holds for both, the false and the just alike.” Aye, that it does. I will leave you on this subject with the words of Britain’s closest rival to Machiavelli: Francis Bacon. Bacon “negotiated” his way from relative poverty to the very pinnacle of wealth and power in England under King James I. Then lost it all, and spent his last years writing and studying. His Essays are among the wisest, most thought-provoking (and meanest) set of instructions ever published in English. I sleep with them by my bedside. This is from a short essay (short even by Bacon’s standards) entitled “Of Negotiating,” published in 1625, nearly four hundred years ago. Every word of it is true today: If you would work [negotiate with] any man, you must either know his nature and fashions, and so lead him; or his ends, and so persuade him; or his weakness or disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have an interest in him, and so govern him. In dealing with cunning persons, we must ever consider their ends to interpret their speeches; and it is good to say little to them, and that which they least look… ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=2934))

- This is not a book about philosophy, sociology or the history of human law, but I believe it is worth remembering that ownership of any kind is nonsensical. It is absurd and defies reason because we are all mortal and we cannot (as yet) take it with us. So what’s this got to do with getting rich? I could say, “Nothing, but thank you for letting me get it off my chest”; but I won’t say that, because my amateurish musings illustrate very nicely just how idiotic the getting of wealth, as a goal in and of itself, really is. “Ah,” but you could argue, “that’s all very well for you. You have already made your pile. It’s easy to be philosophical when you’ve already amassed a fortune.” And my reply would be that there is truth in that, but there is also truth in the assertion that I may well have been only able to put a few hundred million dollars in the bank because I recognized that this getting rich malarkey is just a game. A delusion, if you will. Being rich is fine, and at the very least is better than being poor. But it shouldn’t be the be-all and end-all of your life, or anyone’s life. If you can laugh in the midst of early poverty and in the face of real adversity, and if you can still laugh when you’re coining it in, then you will almost certainly continue to coin it in. But if you chase money desperately in the earnest belief that you can never be happy without it and seriously think that the chase is a meaningful occupation, I doubt very much you will succeed. You have to be fiercely determined, true. But an appreciation of the absurdity of the chase helps enormously. As the author G. K. Chesterton puts it in one of his Father Brown stories: “To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.” Mind you, Chesterton wasn’t exactly averse to fine food and wine himself. OK, OK, enough musing. Now we’ll get on with the job of stimulating your accumulation of money as quickly as possible. But don’t say your Uncle Felix didn’t warn you.

A good salary and a company car and health plan and pension don’t count. Most share options (usually nothing more than the promise of chickenfeed to salaried employees, and a promise broken half the time, too), don’t count. The gratitude of colleagues doesn’t count. Nothing counts but what you own in the race to get rich. If you haven’t much skill, or much wit, or much talent, or much luck, and yet you insist on owning more than your fair share of any start-up or acquisition, then you can become rich.

Once, I owned 80 percent and they owned 10 percent each. On another occasion, we owned 33.3 percent each. On more than one occasion I have been a minority shareholder. It never mattered.

- worried ourselves to death. We were rich men by then, but not rich enough to fund what became a $2 billion corporation. That’s the best part of a true partnership. You always have a brother to help carry the load. And if things go wrong, you have a built-in drinking buddy with whom to drown your sorrows! And you have a built-in conscience, too. No bad thing. So if this is the case, why am I so insistent upon outright ownership, or, at the very least, as much as you can wangle? It’s simple. I could always walk away from the partnership with Peter and Bob if we fell out. I had my own company doing my own thing under my own control three thousand miles away. And I believe the same has been true for them. Despite our close friendship and real affection for each other, this knowledge, that any one of us could walk away from the others if he wished, that illusion of freedom—if illusion it was—made it possible to compromise with each other when things got tough in our partnership business. If Peter and Bob had represented every iron I had in the fire, if our partnership had been the only hope I had of making real money, then I believe it might well have disintegrated almost before it began— never mind lasting for three decades. A partnership is not a marriage. In a marriage, you should be willing to die for your partner. To share everything. To kill for them, if you have to.

I hope that you, too, dear reader, will one day be lucky enough to find such partners and enjoy similar success.

But, boy, was I glad to sell those shares a few years later and get the hell out of there. Now don’t get the wrong idea. Going public made me a fortune. And unlike a private business, it seemed that the more we divested (sold off) our shares, the richer we became, because more people bought them and the more those shares we still had left were worth. That sounds weird, but it’s exactly what happened. In a private company I would virtually have to be pried away from my shareholding with a crowbar—until I was ready to sell the whole shooting match, anyway. But with a public company, everything seemed to be topsy-turvy. And that included selling shares. Just as directors of a public company cannot use their inside knowledge to enrich their lunch buddies, even inadvertently, so they must not use that knowledge to enrich themselves. By selling shares when things are going badly, for instance. Not unless everyone knows things are going badly. Got it?

This quarter’s results, this quarter’s growth, were the only things that mattered to them. It almost seemed, at times, as if profit was a dirty word. If we were making “profits,” asked the “analysts,” weren’t we in danger of “wasting” money that could have been invested to produce more "growth”? Huh? Madness! But it made me very rich.

All was well that ended well. And how did it end? It ended when we engineered the sale of MicroWarehouse back into the private sector via a huge investment consortium. Suddenly, our services were no longer required. The “professionals” had taken over. As far as I was concerned, they were welcome to it. I think even Peter was glad it was finally over.

Even today, I wonder how the three of us ever found our way out of that nightmare labyrinth. That’s all I know, and all I want to know, about public companies. From my perspective, they are not sane places and their share prices are not decided by sane people. Perhaps it’s different when a company has been public for many years.

That’s when I delegate. Automatically and without thinking. I have people who work for me who are patient, who listen better than I do, and who are quietly determined to get the best deal they can with a potential partner while not scaring them off. They are willing to compromise, but not to surrender. Long after I would have lost interest and wandered away to find something more interesting to do, they will still be patiently negotiating until an agreement is reached. These are not people I would ask into the room to negotiate the sale of a large asset. They have too much empathy with the other side. But for the majority of symbiotic deals and arrangements a company needs to make, their skills far surpass mine. What else do I delegate? Almost everything now. I do not run my companies and have not done so for many, many years. Rivals do not believe this. They smile knowingly when I tell them that. Perhaps because many of them are not good delegators.

I use the power of veto instead. By making myself the chairman of all my companies, I can choose to attend or not attend senior management or board meetings as it suits me. On average, I will attend four to six such meetings a year for each company. The chair is usually taken in my absence by the MD, the president or the CEO. Verbatim minutes are taken. (I do read all the minutes of these meetings very carefully, and I can get a mite cross if they are not produced promptly and accurately. For me, they are not a memorandum of past events.

- So am I just an ingrate? Is this “the unacceptable face of capitalism”? I don’t believe so. Employees work for a salary. That salary is guaranteed. They are also awarded pension contributions from their company and, in some instances, health care and other perks. They risked nothing but a small potential embarrassment when they applied for the job in the first place. They are not owners. The financier John Paul Getty put it best half a century ago: The meek shall inherit the earth, but not the mineral rights. Exactly. Risk equals reward. “An honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay” is not risk-taking. If you work in my mine, I’ll pay you fairly, try to make it a great mine to work in, incentivize you if it makes sense for the company to do so, contribute to your pension, perhaps contribute to your health care and the health care of your family, teach you to grow your skills and thereby improve your personal net worth, ensure you have paid vacations, ensure you are not bullied or in any way discriminated against, and concern myself with your personal safety at work. I will do all these wonderful things in a thoughtful and consistent manner. But I will not share out the pie with you when I sell the mine and its mineral rights. Fair enough? If you don’t think it’s fair, please take a job somewhere else. I accept that that is why I am rich and you are not. But that is how the system under which we labor is constructed. If you want to change it, go into politics. (You won’t change it there, either, but that’s another story.) There are exceptions, of course. Important exceptions. Very senior managers who turned down attractive offers from elsewhere to stay with the company and grow it, perhaps. Very long-term employees. Key employees who made a crucial difference to the viability and growth of the particular asset about to be sold. They should certainly be considered for a piece of the asset-sale pie, but generosity should be tempered with the facts set out above concerning risks and rewards. And they are facts, you know.

They want to put you out of business. What to do? First let’s take a look at the nature of rivalry and competition in a capitalist society. Competition is all that makes capitalism bearable. Without rigorous competition, all forms of Western-based societies would soon be ruled, not by parliaments or their equivalent, but by fat, bloated and impregnable monopolies. (Some would argue they already are.) You wouldn’t like it much. People of my age and older have personal experience of it. You think I’m joking? Obviously you’re not old enough to remember the days before rationing ended. Or the days before Freddie Laker introduced the concept of cheap air travel. British Airways and their American cousins ruled the roost at the time, and charged whatever the hell they wanted to charge for you to fly. They had virtually no competition. You paid up, or you stayed grounded. Or perhaps you cannot recall when the GPO (the General Post Office) was in charge of telephone communications—which were then hived off to British Telecom in a ([Location 3531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=3531))

Britain in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and much of the 1980s was ruled by a combination of monopolistic, undemocratic unions who spent all day arm-wrestling with a bunch of monopolistic, undemocratic nationalized industries. British citizens never got a look in. The word “customer” was alien to almost everyone involved, except what was left of “private industry.” Around the world, by friend and foe alike, the UK was called the “Sick Man of Europe,” and that’s exactly what we were.

But Capone, who would have become one of America’s greatest businessmen if he had stayed on the straight and narrow, knew better. He knew that rotten beer makes rotten business. He refused to have his name associated with rubbish. He expected Prohibition to be lifted eventually, and hoped to be the legal beer king of America. Of course, he never did because he didn’t pay his taxes and because he was a murderer and a vicious, brutal killer. Even so, I am ashamed to say that if the above story is true, then I admire Capone for the sentiment, if not for his business methods. He was right about the beer.

It is a foolish practice, but it is ubiquitous. ([Location 4048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=4048))

- Even if the magazine’s “subs” price is a reasonable one, there have been numerous cases of a form of petty “bribery” where potential subscribers are wooed by publishers to subscribe with the offer of a free clock radio or reduced memberships to health clubs, etc. These cheap prices and “free gifts” create a massive liability in the publisher’s balance sheet—which is fine as long as advertising continues to pour in. But when the magazine is no longer flavor-of-the-month and advertising is falling off, the misery begins. Let us say a dying magazine has a million subscribers. Most of them are not “real” subscribers, but, even so, they have paid their dollar per copy and are owed, on average, six more issues. This means the cost of reimbursing the subscribers alone will exceed $6 million in refunds. (It will exceed it, by the way, because of the huge cost of collating and mailing the refunds to a million people.) Of course, the publisher will also face other closure costs, including redundancy payments to magazine staff, rebates to advertisers and possibly to printers and paper merchants and a host of other creepy-crawlies that will come slithering out of the woodwork when news that the ship is sinking spreads abroad. In all, sudden-death ([Location 4051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=4051))

- death closure costs might be as high as $8 million. The publisher’s only hope is to cut costs to the bone, cease soliciting any discounted subscriptions, fulfill the subscriptions with very thin, very cheap editions of the magazine—now a shadow of its former self in quality and number of pages—and thereby reduce what, in the jargon, we call the “subs liability.” This can only be done if the poor beast is still technically alive. In the meantime, the publishers hope that many staff will not wait to be fired but will seek other jobs and reduce closure costs by reducing redundancy payments. It took one of the largest magazine-publishing corporations in America over five years to bring about the closure of what was then still one of the best-known magazines in the world. It lost money for every one of those five years. Let’s take a look at why. ([Location 4061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=4061))

Of course, you can’t stay in a panic, but a dose of panic in a private place, with a bottle of malt whisky on one hand and a bean-counter on the other, can be a very motivational experience. Motivational and salutary. But never despair. We are not engaged upon a serious business here. We are only talking about the getting of money, and, occasionally, the losing of money. You may despair when you have broken your neck; you may despair when your only child has predeceased you; you may despair when terrible wars, famines or plagues afflict millions of innocents.

Would more capital help, or would that be throwing good money after bad? Your analysis must be ruthless. If there is anyone with business savvy in the world you trust, now is the time to seek them out, tell your story and listen. Should you determine that the beast is worthless, both to you or anybody else, still do not give up. At least try to sell it.

I had not looked to see if the leopard could change its spots, and I had not instructed my managers at Dennis Publishing to quietly sound out the chances of selling Stuff. So just before you dump your dream into the gutter, ensure you do the rounds of other companies in your neck of the woods. It only takes two of them to become interested and you have the chance of getting an auction going. That has to be better than throwing your toys out of the cot in a tantrum, as I did with Stuff. But only a bit better. Failure is always a bitch. ([Location 4154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=4154))

- Screwing up isn’t criminal or deliberate or malevolent. But covering up is, if you get caught. And you will get caught—ask the shade of Richard Nixon. Closing down a business or going into bankruptcy is a miserable affair at any time. My advice is not to make it worse by omitting to apologize and shoulder the responsibility squarely. But don’t take it too much to heart. There’s always the chance of a comeback. That sounds easy for me to say. But I came very, very close to having to declare bankruptcy back in the Kung-Fu Monthly days due to overtrading, and I went through many of the procedures I’ve just discussed. It’s a rotten job, so get it done as fairly and as responsibly as you can. Experience is only a name we give to our failures. You are now a more experienced person. And next time around you’ll ensure that you do not duplicate your earlier mistakes. As old lags tell new inmates in the nick: “You’ve done the crime, now do the time. No whining.” It’s good advice.

- How to sum all this up? I’m not an accountant, but it goes like this, I think. If your company can afford to pay you money, then that’s fine, as long as you declare that it has been paid and get ready to pay the tax on that payment. If you find other ways of moving the company’s money into your own pocket without reporting the movement or using a company asset for your personal life, you’re almost certainly milking the cow in a way that is not permitted. It’s that simple. And my advice is to keep it simple, and to hire competent tax advisors just as soon as you begin earning money over and above your salary.

- To be rich, if that is still your desire, you must somehow learn to harness fear to your own advantage. Is that what I have done in my own life? Was all that rage and fierceness and drive and stamina rooted in my own fear? Have I used fear as a fuel in the getting of money? Perhaps I have, although I never thought of it that way before. In any case, I’m not certain I want to know. I have never trusted armchair psychiatry. But I do know that you must make an accommodation with your fears if you are to succeed. At least, I know that to be true in my own case. As to how such a trick is to be accomplished, I cannot help you. We each, in turn, must face down our secret demons, if we can, whether we wish to be rich or not. To succeed in the game of piling up material wealth, it becomes a necessity.

It wasn’t important enough for him to change his travel plans. Naturally enough, this angered the young man attempting to sell his prized asset. It was disrespectful. By the time that managing director returned from abroad, a majority interest in the magazine was mine, signed, sealed and delivered to Dennis Publishing. My rival deserved to lose out. He prevaricated. He wasted his opportunity to purchase a magazine that has since generated way over $100,000,000 in gross revenues. You can forgive yourself for not doing something if you honestly got it wrong. But it is harder to forgive yourself when lack of impetus allows it to slip through your fingers.

- If you wish to get rich, there are no reasons why you should not get rich. None at all. For they are not “reasons”; they are excuses. For the most part they are pitiful alibis, half truths and self-serving evasions you have erected to spare yourself from the quiet terror of taking your own financial life in your hands and making your dreams concrete reality. They are the children of fear and the parents of a thousand “if onlys.” It may well be true, should you succeed, that you will discover you are not as happy as you once believed wealth might make you. But is that a reason for not beginning? Perhaps I will be proved wrong and you will become rich and as happy as a lark in spring. Who knows?

- The only three valid reasons for not attempting to become rich are: “I do not wish to be rich.” Or, “I wish to be rich but I have other priorities.” Or, “I am too stupid to try to get rich.” These are valid reasons, especially the last. As for the second, what kind of a world would we live in if Vincent van Gogh had never painted, if Beethoven had had no time to compose symphonies, if Emily Dickinson had never written a poem or if Narcis Monturiol had not perfected the world’s first, fully fledged, double-hulled submarine? All of them died relatively poor or flat broke. Nor have I ever read that giants of thought and philosophy fared much better. And what of your family? Ah, yes; what kind of a childhood would you have had if your mother and father had abandoned you to a wet, dark cot while they scrabbled day and night to become wealthy? So, yes, there are valid reasons. But not many of us can lay claim to them. Most of us are ordinary Joes. We will never compose a symphony or invent the modern submarine. And a great many of us will not have children. Which leads me to what, I suspect, will prove a controversial take on the subject of having children and getting rich. No one who has not had a child can know the depths of anguish and joy that parents endure. I accept that as a childless man. But so often, children are used as a bogus trump card in any debate on the central theme of this book. “It’s OK for you, but I have responsibilities. My family comes first.” Yes, yes, yes. I am sure you feel better having got that off your chest. But how much real truth is there in it? I have many godchildren. I have watched, closely in some cases, as newborn babes become toddlers, as young tykes shoot through school and college and as body-pierced immortals launch themselves like demons of the pit upon an unsuspecting world. And I have seen the relationship between children and their parents alter. Close-up and personal. It is my belief that children do not care if parents are rich or poor, providing there is enough money for basic essentials like food, clothing and shelter. What they care about is unconditional love. That is the only key, the only true priority, although ([Location 4602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0017SUYY6&location=4602))

You ain’t never made ten dollars yet, Yet you say you can balance the national debt, If you’re so smart, How come you ain’t rich?
