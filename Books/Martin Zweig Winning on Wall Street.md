## Highlights
- The stock market can only throw off a return that is reasonably commensurate with economic growth. In the short run, an undervalued market can yield a higher than normal return. But when returns become excessive for several years, it means that the market has outgrown economic growth and we would probably see a few years of below normal or even negative returns. Winning on Wall Street can be even more helpful under these circumstances than if we are in a prosperous period. If the market were to go up every year, you don’t need me and you don’t need this book. Just buy your stocks and hold them. If you had done just that in the 1980s, you probably would have done well despite some uncomfortable moments in 1987 and a few other times. But I think this is a particularly poor strategy for the late-1990s and beyond. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=142))

- How should you, the reader of this book, react to the constantly changing circumstances? Basically, I think you should shun the idea of buy-and-hold. I consider it a fallacious strategy. In the coming decade we are likely to see more bear markets and deeper ones. To lower risk, there will be periods when you should peel back your investments in the stock and bond markets. It’s a matter of degree. You don’t have to go 100% to cash but you should cut back as risk rises and invest as risk recedes. I believe my market-timing methods in this book will help you do just that. There is a frequently heard saying on Wall Street that “this time it is different.” If you believe this, it is at your own peril. Yes, each time is slightly different but there always are a lot of similarities. As Yogi Berra might have said, the similarities are different. But you learn from history—and history has a way of repeating itself with subtle differences. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=148))

- For example, as you will find in this book, when the Federal Reserve tightens and interest rates rise, stock markets tend to perform poorly—and vice versa. By following my indicators, you will be flexible, buying when conditions are favorable and selling when prospects darken. Don’t fight yourself and don’t be stubborn. When the fundamentals deteriorate for a particular stock, you should get out whether you have a profit or a loss. Don’t refuse to take a loss because of your ego. That lesson is important enough to repeat for emphasis. Don’t cling to a stock because you can’t afford to bruise your ego by selling at a loss. Remember, no one wins all the time. In baseball, a .300 hitter is terrific and a .330 hitter may make the Hall of Fame. That means that a player who makes outs two-thirds of the time is Hall of Fame material. So don’t expect to bat .1000 in the stock market. It’s impossible—mistakes are part of the game. Accept your mistakes, deal with them, and learn from them.

- If I were a genius—and there aren’t any in this business—I would have sold everything before the break, bought even more puts, held them all right up to the bottom day and made zillions. But that’s not reality. Reality is cutting risk to the bone when the indicators weaken, hoping that you can make a few bucks when conditions are good, and praying that you’ll survive crashes, plagues, and earthquakes long enough so that someday you’ll see the pleasant light of another bull market and have some money left to play it.

- Patience is one of the most valuable attributes in investing. I liken it to a great baseball hitter such as Wade Boggs nowadays or Ted Williams in my youth. The key to their success is to wait for the fat pitch to hit and not to swing from the heels at just anything. The idea is to work the pitcher into a hole and get the count to 2-and-0 or to 3-and-l. That forces the pitcher to throw strikes … often fastballs. In other words, if the hitter is patient, he tries to work the odds into his favor. Then, and only then, does he take a real rip at the ball. It’s about the same in the stock market. I try to “work the count” in my favor by waiting for the indicators to get very one-sided before “swinging from the heels” with an aggressive strategy. If I don’t find the indicators producing very good odds in one direction or the other, I’m content to play defensively and just bide my time. In the following pages, I describe and document how you can profit from this investment philosophy. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=249))

- The job of selecting stocks should never be taken lightly. It’s tough to be a consistent winner. Although Wall Street spends millions each year analyzing stocks, the best available research indicates (1) that analysts cannot consistently predict earnings—which makes such strategies as buying growth stocks at any price multiple rather risky (as many institutions have found in recent years); (2) that mutual funds and other institutions as a group have failed to beat the broad market averages over the years regardless of their methods; (3) that such technical tools as charting and relative strength don’t predict any better than pure chance; and (4) that expensive and lengthy research reports from ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=286))

- The major direction of the market is dominated by monetary considerations, primarily Federal Reserve policy and the movement of interest rates. To monitor these and other vital trends, I have devised several simple indicators, described fully later in the book, that I have found very reliable. My guidelines include purely technical indicators. I refer to this factor as the tape action, or momentum, in the market. Here I combine various price and volume indicators to measure the actual behavior of an individual stock or the overall market. To appreciate the role of momentum, think about a rocket ship being launched to the moon. If it takes off with a lot of thrust, it has a chance of making it out of the earth’s atmosphere. If it doesn’t, it will turn around and flop back. Broadly speaking, the market behaves in a similar fashion. To me, the “tape “ is the final arbiter of any investment decision. I have a cardinal rule: “Never fight the tape.” If you buy aggressively into a bear market or into individual stocks that are performing badly, it is akin to trying to catch a falling safe. Investors are sometimes so eager for its valuable contents that they will ignore the laws of physics and attempt to snatch the safe from the ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=300))

- air as if it were a pop fly. You can get hurt doing this: witness the records of the bottom pickers on the Street. Not only is this game dangerous, it is pointless as well. It is easier, safer, and, in almost all cases, just as rewarding to wait for the safe to hit the pavement and take a little bounce before grabbing the contents. I also follow closely the degree of optimism and pessimism in the marketplace and will share with you my key sentiment indicators, which provide an early-warning system to detect market trends. I believe you’ll be surprised at how wrong so-called expert opinion can be. Last but not least, I monitor what I call the fundamentals—the actual value of a particular stock. That includes analyzing earnings, dividends, and balance sheets. Fundamental analysis doesn’t do much for forecasting the broad market direction but is very important for individual stocks. I use fundamentals for probably 90 percent of my input on stock selection but for not more than 10 percent of the weight in predicting the market as a whole. Big money is made in the stock market by being on the right side of the major moves. I don’t believe in swimming against the tide.

- In addition to describing my various indicators and how you can use them, I will discuss my criteria for choosing individual stocks. Here I look at two main areas. One covers the earnings and the relationship of the price to the earnings (the P/E ratio), the earnings trend, and a few balance sheet items. I don’t get that much involved in the product being produced. If a company can show nice… ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=324))

- The second factor I examine is the action of the stock itself, to see whether it is performing well. If the stock is going to climb, I’d rather let somebody else buy it at the bottom. I want to see if the stock acts well relative to the market before I buy it. I find that buying on strength gives you an edge. You must pay a premium, but you increase the probability of being right. People somehow think you must buy at the bottom and sell at the top to be successful in the market. That’s nonsense. The idea is to buy when the probability is greatest that the market is going to advance. If a bear market were to bottom at 4000 on the Dow, and eventually go to 6000, you don’t have to buy at 4000. You can buy at 4300 if the probability were, say, 90 percent that it would go higher. And you don’t have to sell at the peak. You might sell after the top or maybe a little before. Let’s say you get out at 5700 when the probability is very good that the market will decline. There’s nothing wrong with buying at 4300 and selling at 5700 and… ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=328))

I want to protect myself and the people who follow my advice. But there are times when you have to be aggressive. The problem with most people who play the market is that they are not flexible.

- Summing up, to succeed in the market you must have discipline, flexibility—and patience. You have to wait for the tape to give its message before you buy or sell. That means you must forget about trying to catch the exact tops or bottoms, which no one can consistently do anyhow. But success in the market doesn’t require catching those tops and bottoms. Success means making profits and avoiding losses. By using the indicators in this book and waiting for a trend to develop, you can make money, stay in tune with the tape and interest rates, and, best of all, sleep better at night.

- Crooks was an old-timer who, early in his career, was the youngest member of the New York Stock Exchange at the time of the 1929 crash. He loved to talk about the old days, and I was his best listener. Of the many stock market stories Crooks told me, I found most fascinating his descriptions of what it was like working for Jesse Livermore, one of the most fabulous traders of all time. Later I read a great deal about Livermore, and if there is anyone who is even close to being my hero in market lore, it is Livermore. His emphasis on letting your profits run and cutting your losses has always stood me in good stead. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=519))

- Securities and Exchange Commission going back to World War II and found that when options investors got too optimistic—buying lots of calls and shunning puts—the stock market was generally heading for trouble. The reverse was also true. When the options players were very bearish on the market—favoring puts and selling or avoiding calls—the market usually was near a bottom. It also became apparent to me that when options players were extremely active, it was a negative sign, and when they shunned the market and options volume dropped off, it was frequently a good time to buy stock. In other words, it was the old game of contrary opinion—don’t follow the “crowd.” My studies also indicated that most speculators were not very successful. Because they invariably lost money on balance, it followed that they weren’t right very often, regardless of whether, as a group, they were bullish or bearish. It was shortly after finishing my dissertation that I invented the puts/calls ratio, which is now a widely used technical benchmark, especially because there are so many new options markets against which to apply this ratio. This discovery was important to me not so much because of that particular indicator, but because I began to integrate various numbers that ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=554))

- You can, however, be right more often than you are wrong. If you are right 60 percent of the time, ride your profits, and rein in your losses, you’ll find that when you’re right you’re very right, and when you’re wrong you’re only moderately wrong. In the long run, a 60 percent success rate translates into huge gains, a 50 percent rate into solid gains, and even a 40 percent rate can beat the market. In playing the market, remember you must deal with probabilities, employ sensible strategies to limit risk, and get aggressive only when conditions warrant.

- Graph C (pp. 34–35) shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average plotted monthly since 1921. It’s similar to the Dow in graph A except that it goes back much further. Also note that the price scale is in percentages. Thus, a rise in the Dow from 100 to 200 is a gain of 100% and would run the same vertical distance on the graph as a move from 500 to 1000, which is also a gain of 100%. The problem with using nominal prices (prices as they appeared at the time) to construct the market average is that over time they are distorted by the effects of inflation or extreme deflation. On a short-term basis this usually doesn’t matter too much, say over a period of a few days or a few weeks. Or, if the inflation rate is “normal,” say in the 2%-to-4% range, even over a period of one to two years, the effects are not that significant. But if inflation gets up to 10% or so, as it did during a part of the 1970s, or if you have extreme deflation as seen in the early 1930s, it causes a tremendous distortion in the nominal price averages.

- For example, assume that you invested money in the Dow Industrials when the Dow Average stood at 1000. Suppose that over the next five years the cumulative ravages of inflation doubled the consumer price index, a compounded inflation rate of about 15% a year. Consequently, you would need $2000 to purchase what $1000 ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=739))

- would have bought five years earlier. Now, suppose that while inflation doubled, the Dow remained at 1000. To conclude that your investment was even at the end of that period is nonsense. Your net worth had actually declined by 50%. The greater the inflation rate, the greater the adjustment necessary in the stock price averages. Graph D (pp. 38–39) shows the Dow Jones Industrials plotted monthly from 1921, adjusted for the effects of inflation and deflation. It is properly called “Deflated Dow Jones Industrials.” This shows how the Dow performed in “real” dollars, the actual buying power of the dollars that you might have invested in the market. Thus, using the example above, had the Dow in nominal terms remained unchanged over a five-year span while the inflation rate doubled, a graph of the deflated Dow would show a gradual decline from 1000 down to 500 during that period, losing one-half in real terms from its beginning point.

True, stocks did collapse that day, with the Dow closing at 230.07, down a hefty 11.7%, but the drop was somewhat less severe than the prior day’s loss. Volume hit an all-time-record 16.4 million shares, an amount not seen again on the exchange for another 3½ decades! Actually, on October 29, stocks put ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=757))

- on one of their greatest rallies ever during the last hour of trading. The next day, on October 30, the Dow soared 12.3% to 258.47. But the rally was short-lived, and by mid-November the Dow closed at about 199, down by nearly one-half from its September 3 high of above 381. That so-called 1929 crash encompassed far more than just October 29 and represented the greatest decline ever in a fairly short period. But the major damage really occurred between 1930 and 1932. From mid-November of 1929 the Dow rallied smartly to a top of 294 in April 1930. That move represented a bull market with a gain of some 48%. (A similar move in mid-1996 would have taken the Dow up about 2700 points in five months.) After that, though, the Depression began, and it was all downhill. By July of 1932 the Dow closed at 41, down an incredible 86% from the spring highs of 1930, and off an amazing 89% from the 1929 peak. After the devastation of the early thirties, stocks reversed course and a mighty bull market persisted until 1937. The Depression picked up steam once again and prices fell anew, not bottoming on a real basis until April 1942, a few months after Pearl Harbor. Then the great bull market commenced, carrying the Dow up to ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=759))

- Here is the point I want to emphasize. In nominal terms, the Dow struck 995 in 1966, about the time the Vietnam War was heating up. With that war came the beginning of heavy inflation that distorted most economic factors, including stock averages. When the bear market bottomed in August of 1982, at 777 on the Dow, it represented about a 22% nominal decline over a sixteen-year span. However, during that interval the inflation rate roughly tripled. Indeed, between January 1966 and August 1982, the consumer price index rose… ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=772))

- level, when the Dow Industrials were trading at 777 in August 1982, it was the equivalent of only 240. In other words, the Dow had lost roughly three-quarters of its value over a sixteen-year period, and that, in my book, is a real bear market. Graph D clearly shows this long-term bear trend from 1966 to 1982. Of course, there were interim bull markets within this extensive down cycle. These bull markets occurred in 1967–68, 1970–73, 1974–76, and, to a lesser degree, in 1980. But in all cases the bull market highs came at real prices below the previous bull market peaks, and the subsequent bear market lows came at lower real levels than the previous bear market bottoms. The succession of lower highs and lower lows was part of the ongoing long-term bear market. This cycle was broken after the 1982 bottom. In the huge bull advance that followed to 1983, the “real” Dow Jones bettered its 1980–81 peak, the first time in about two decades that it surpassed a prior high. The sell-off that followed into 1984… ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=776))

- The worst thing about inflation, as far as the stock market is concerned, is that the cure is more damaging than the disease. When inflation gets too intense, the Federal Reserve starts acting to reduce the growth in the money supply, thereby increasing interest rates. This slows economic activity and hurts corporate profits. The result is often a bear market. When Paul Volcker became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1979, he called inflation the number one enemy and took restrictive monetary steps to do battle. By 1981 his war was won and the inflation rate was nose-diving. By 1982 stocks had stopped going down on a major-trend basis. With the disinflationary period at hand, stocks began to rise in a very-long-term bull market which carried the Dow to 2722 prior to the 1987 crash, up 250% from the 1982 low. By mid-1996, the Dow had climbed to around 5600, up 435% since 1982. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=794))

- Second, when interest rates fall, it costs corporations less to borrow. That reduces a major expense, especially for companies that are heavy borrowers such as airlines, public utilities, or savings and loans. As expenses fall, profits rise. Wall Street loves the idea that future earnings will go up. So, as interest rates drop, investors tend to bid prices higher, partly on the expectation of better earnings. The opposite effect occurs when interest rates rise. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=817))

- ratios, volume figures, and other indicators, I have found that strength does indeed tend to lead to greater strength. Every single bull market that I’ve seen has started with a tremendous rally. The rally doesn’t necessarily come the first day after the bear market ends. Occasionally you have a period of weeks or even months during which the market backs and fills and bounces around in what technicians call a basing action. If conditions are right, a rally eventually ensues. For a raging bull market, you need falling interest rates, probably an economic recession (that helps the Fed to loosen up and rates to fall), lots of cash on the sidelines, good values in the market—namely, low price/earnings ratios—and a great deal of pessimism because, as we’ll see later, pessimism means there’s an abundance of cash. If all these conditions converge, the market should rally very, very strongly, and the first rally of the bull market should be the best one. When that rally blasts off, prices should go through the roof. Remember my analogy about launching a rocket to the moon? The rocket must have sufficient thrust to get through the atmosphere and into outer space. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=1986))

- The market works similarly. The first rally must have a tremendous surge for a major market advance. If it does, it generates more buying enthusiasm and brings in people who missed the first move. It prevents a large correction because that first rally reverses the market psychology. People who missed it are sitting there loaded with cash and eager to get aboard. So, after the smallest setback, new buyers enter and there is no sharp correction. One of the frustrating things for people who miss the first rally in a bull market is that they wait for the big correction and it never comes. The market just keeps climbing and climbing. It feeds on itself in frenzied fashion and propels prices considerably higher for six months or so, and sometimes longer.

- The Four Percent Model for the stock market was developed by my close friend and colleague Ned Davis. It works as follows. First, it uses the Value Line Composite Index, which is quoted regularly on Quotron machines and is found in your daily newspaper or in Barron’s. You’ll recall that the Value Line Index, as calculated by Arnold Bernhard & Co., is an unweighted price index of approximately seventeen hundred stocks and is very similar to my Zweig Unweighted Price Index. In fact, over long stretches the two give nearly identical results. One could just as easily apply this Four Percent Model ([Location 2218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=2218))

- to my ZUPI. However, the Value Line data are more readily available and easier to follow. All you need to construct this model is the weekly close of the Value Line Composite. You can ignore the daily numbers if you wish. Just look in the Saturday or Sunday newspaper to find the weekly close, or in Barron’s, which hits the newsstands on Saturdays. This trend-following model gives a buy signal when the weekly Value Line Index rallies 4% or more from any weekly close. It then gives a sell signal when the weekly close of the Value Line Composite drops by 4% or more from any weekly peak. Note: I mean 4% of change, not four points.

These are all common rationalizations among those who err. The fact is, I was just plain wrong. In the weeks that followed I sensed that I was wrong, I knew deep in my bones I was wrong, but my ego got the best of me and I was convinced that the bottom was close at hand anyhow. Instead of staying in gear with the tape and flipping back to the bearish side, I searched out indicators that backed my bullish stance. There were many of them at that time, and I was hooked on them. But the weight of the evidence was still bearish and I blew it.

- and the worst results for corporate earnings usually lie ahead. Even if Wall Street is correct in anticipating these lower profits, it can hardly equate them with higher stock prices. There seems to be some inborn reasoning in Wall Street that better profits mean higher stock prices, but this simply is not true in the aggregate. The best gains made in bull markets, as seen in chapter 5, tend to come in the first six months of a fresh bull market, when profits are usually declining. So, it’s difficult for investors to be optimistic when they’re staring at a terrible outlook for corporate earnings. At this point investors and speculators have built up extraordinary cash reserves on the sidelines, partly because of the higher interest rates during a bear cycle and partly because the outlook is so gloomy that they prefer to hold cash rather than stock. Individuals and institutions have high levels of cash and little or no willingness to purchase stocks. Pessimism reigns. But when rates start to decline, that acts as a catalyst in generating buying power because cash coupled with lower rates is not as attractive as cash coupled with higher rates. Moreover, the sharp drop in interest rates will usually stimulate the economy six to twelve months down the road. The stock market is a discounting mechanism, always looking ahead. So the current profit scene is not nearly as important as that anticipated. With declining rates the usual stimulus, prices begin to rally as a new bull market is born. Not only is there tremendous pessimism before this initial rally, but that first rally traditionally is not believed. During the previous bear market, several rallies started, only to bite the dust, leading to lower and lower prices later. So why trust the new rally in the new bull market, especially since it tends to be the most vigorous rally seen in the cycle? The thinking is that if prices rally even more than usual in a short period, they have that much more to fall back. So, the shrewd investor, going against crowd behavior,… ([Location 3269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=3269))

- sell. The crowd tends to be wrong at exactly the wrong time. As a bull market proceeds and the rally fails to give way to a major decline, many investors find themselves shut out. Slowly they begin to believe that the move might be for real, and the thinking is, “I’ll buy on the next decline.” The problem is that the declines are never large enough to make people feel comfortable about buying. That’s because there are too many bears on the sidelines eager to get in. When prices back off just a couple of percent, several of these bears begin to buy, prematurely ending the decline and not allowing the bulk of the bears the opportunity to buy at lower prices. This trend continues as the market goes higher and higher with only small sell-offs. Eventually, the number of bulls becomes greater than the number of bears and, to some people studying the behavior of crowds, that becomes a signal to sell. The idea is that if you use contrary opinion, you should go against the majority. But that’s an oversimplification and certainly not true in… ([Location 3287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YEEY&location=3287))

- Some people call the idea of monitoring the crowd and going against it the art of contrary opinion. It’s okay to use that term, but just remember that you don’t always want to go contrary to the crowd—you only want to do so when the crowd is extremely onesided. It’s not easy to define extremely. There are many ways to measure the sentiment of a crowd, but the exact percentage of bulls or bears on any one indicator needed to give a buy or sell signal varies considerably from cycle to cycle.

- The main thing to remember about measuring sentiment is to use several measures and not to value it too much when the numbers are relatively neutral. But when so many of your indicators show excessive pessimism that your index rises toward a high extreme, it’s probably a pretty good sign that the pessimism is overdone and that prices are near a bottom. Likewise, when too many folks are optimists and most of your readings indicate this, it’s time to start thinking about selling stocks. It’s quite useful to know when the crowd is extremely one-sided in its opinion. It is not as helpful to know that 55% are bulls, 45% are bears. The extremes are what really matter.

- The big money is made or lost in stocks during the most violent bull and bear markets. The bad news for those who crave action is that the market does not behave dynamically all that often. Even within the great bull market advances, there are periods of lull. I would estimate that stocks spend only about 20% of the time in the most active phases of the bull trend and only about 10% in the severe downward periods of major bear markets. Roughly 70% of the time stocks either meander in a neutral trading range or undergo minor rallies or declines within their various bull and bear cycles. During that 70% span—let’s call it the neutral area—your overall market strategy doesn’t matter all that much. You could be fully invested, partially invested, or all in cash. If you have a broadly diversified portfolio while the market hovers in these neutral ranges, you are not likely to make or lose a lot of money. The other 30% of the time, when dynamic phases of major bull and bear markets are in progress, is another story—and it’s worthwhile to examine the chief characteristics of these periods. The good news is that you can watch for a few key signals that offer exceedingly high probabilities of catching the best portion of the great bull markets while avoiding the devastation of the worst phases of major bear markets. The first part of this chapter will focus on the bull market signals, and the last part on the bearish indications.

For example, there is a misconception that if you were to sell short a $50 stock, the most you could earn is $50, or 100% on your investment, if the company were to go bankrupt. Conversely, people believe that if you guess wrong there is no theoretical limit to how much you can lose.

- go to 1000, in which case you’re out twentyfold on your money. Such thinking is faulty to say the least. In the first place, when you sell short you put up collateral with a broker, which can be in the form of Treasury bills if you want to continue earning interest on the money. The minimum collateral is 50% of the transaction. So, if you were to sell short 100 shares of a $50 stock, that’s $5,000, and you’d have to put up at least $2,500 in collateral. To simplify it, let’s say you put up the whole amount. You place $5,000 in T-bills with a broker. If that stock were to go up, he would eventually call you for more money. By the time the stock rose to $80, you would have a $3,000 loss. Your equity would be down to $2,000. Before that point, the broker would have requested more collateral. If you didn’t put it up, he would cover the sale by buying the stock and you would be out. The only way you can lose an infinite amount is to keep advancing more and more money, which is like pyramiding your loss. Remember the golden rule, “The trend is your friend. Don’t fight the tape.” If you have a loss like that, get out. Nobody’s holding a gun to your head for more money. Only a fool would keep putting up money on a losing short sale like that.

- On the brighter side, your profit potential in a short sale is not limited to 100% profit. It is virtually unlimited. For example, you short 100 shares at $50 and the stock falls to $25. That’s a $2,500 profit for you. If you started with $5,000 in equity, your total equity in the account is now $7,500. At this point the stock is trading at $25, which is $2,500 per 100 shares. To maintain 100% equity behind your position, you only need $2,500 in the account. You then pyramid (without using margin as such), selling short an additional 200 shares. You now have 300 shares short, which would require the $7,500 backing. If that stock were to go to zero, you’d make an additional $7,500 in profit. So your total profit would be $10,000 on a $5,000 investment, which is 200 percent. But it doesn’t have to stop there. Suppose the stock then drops from $25 to $10. Now you have 300 shares of a $10 stock. The total capital you need in the account without margin is $3,000. Remember, you have $7,500 in capital.

You’re shorting more as the stock drops. Now suppose the company goes bankrupt. The stock falls from $10 to zero. You’ve made $12,000 on the drop, but you had an additional $12,000 in the account when the stock was $10. So your total ending equity is $24,000 when the stock is at zero. Since you started at $5,000, you have made almost a fivefold profit. If you want to, you can pyramid a lot more on the way down than in the example. You could short more at $5 or at any other price. So your profit on the downside is virtually unlimited. Remember, if the stock goes down and you don’t short any more, you have excess equity in the account. If a $50 stock falls to $25, you’ve got $7,500 of equity in the account. Since you need only $2,500, you could take out the extra $5,000 and earn interest on it or do something else with it.

It really isn’t if you know what you’re doing. If the company is going to go broke, it doesn’t really matter where you short. You’d make just as much money shorting at $5 as you could at $25. Stocks that are already down from $100 to $10 are still pretty good shorts if the stock is going lower. If the stock eventually dips to $2, you can make 80% by shorting at 10, even without pyramiding. If you short it at $100, you’d make 98%. Returns of 80% and 98% are not all that different. That’s one reason I find shorting very reasonable.
