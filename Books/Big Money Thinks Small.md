- Investing in stocks is not easy, but it should not be painful. Plain and simple, it requires work and an understanding that stock prices tend to follow company earnings over time. There is an incredible correlation here. For example, Ross Stores’ corporate earnings are up seventy-one-fold over the past twenty-four years, and not surprisingly, its stock price is up ninety-six-fold over that same period. And Monster Beverage’s corporate earnings are up 119-fold over the past fifteen years; not surprisingly, its stock price is up 495-fold over ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=150))

The organizing framework of this book, in five parts, is that we will reap pleasing investment rewards if we (1) make decisions rationally, (2) invest in what we know, (3) work with honest and ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=192))

While the stories in this book about my mistakes will be most readily grasped by readers who have made their own investment mistakes, I hope this book offers a wider audience an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of others and provides some entertainment value.

- “What Happens Next?” and “What’s It Worth?” Most investors seek to answer two questions: “What happens next?” and “What’s it worth?” Our minds ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=203))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- naturally leap to reply to the first question, often before we realize that it was even posed. The stock price has been going up, so what happens next is that it will go up some more—unless, of course, it goes down. A company reports catastrophic financial results. Then earnings forecasts get slashed. The stock price dives—that is, unless the market knew it was going to be a bloodbath and is relieved that management’s guidance wasn’t more dismal. Unavoidably after whatever happens next, something else will happen, and you may not be ready for it. The question of what happens next is an endless treadmill of, “And then what?” Many of those answers will be wrong.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “What’s it worth?” is an even more involved question. Many ignore the question of value because they think it’s too tough to answer. Others don’t ask it because they assume a stock’s price and value are the same. They suppose a stock is worth exactly what it can be sold (or bought) for. If you must sell in a hurry, you will receive market price, not value. However, the central idea of value investing—of which I am an advocate—is that price and value are not always equal, yet should be at some date in the future. Because the date is unknown, patience is mandatory. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=216))

- French polymath Gustave Le Bon wrote The Crowd in 1895 as a rant on French politics, but his observations also describe how stock market manias occur. Under the influence of crowds, individuals act bizarrely, in ways they never would alone. Le Bon’s key theme is that crowds are mentally unified at the lowest, most barbaric, common denominator of their ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=255))

- collective unconscious—instincts, passions, and feelings—never reason. Being unable to reason, crowds can’t separate fact from fiction. Crowds are impressed by spectacle, images, and myths. Misinformation and exaggeration become contagious. Prestige attaches to true believers who reaffirm shared beliefs. Crowds will chase a delusion until it is destroyed by experience.

- The madness of crowds explains some of the misjudgments in the South Sea Bubble, but not all of them. On their own, people are perfectly capable of not knowing what they don’t know. As investors, we’re trying to assess the decisions and durability of organizations, which isn’t quite crowd psychology. The process of estimating a stock’s value requires reasoning with probability and statistics, and here we need a different sort of psychological knowledge.

- System 2 would have nothing to work with if the lizard brain wasn’t constantly suggesting cause-and-effect relationships and inferring intentions, even though many hints turn out to be bogus. Because our intuition generates feelings and predispositions so effortlessly, it often provides the illusion of truth and unjustified comfort in its beliefs. Confidence comes more often from ignorance than from knowledge. System 1 ignores ambiguity and muffles doubt with a tunnel-vision focus on the evidence that is immediately visible. Kahneman calls it What You See Is All There Is, or WYSIATI. Often, instead of answering a difficult question, our minds will answer an easier one using heuristics, or shortcuts. System 1 is more attentive to surprises and changes than to what’s normal, average and recurring. It overweights low probabilities, frames decisions narrowly, and is more sensitive to losses than to gains. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=316))

- Whether you invest in individual stocks, an actively managed fund, or an index fund, the sources of your regrets are likely to fall into our five inverted (mistake) buckets, which we explore in this book:       1.    Allowing emotions, not reason, to guide decisions       2.    Thinking you know more than you actually do       3.    Trusting capital to the wrong people       4.    Choosing businesses prone to failure because of obsolescence, competition, or excessive debt       5.    Overpaying for stocks, most frequently those with vivid, striking stories ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=385))

- In contrast, concentrated stock-pickers can be blown up on any of these fronts: emotional decisions, gaps in understanding, working with bad dudes, unexpected disruption, too much debt, or just paying too much. Although they would love to minimize all of these risks simultaneously, they can’t. The good news is that stock-pickers can outperform simply by cutting out the stuff ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=434))

- How to Think About Investing In investing, everything begins with decisions. There’s a hall-of-mirrors quality to it as we are assessing the decisions of others. We’re dealing with the unknown future, and the facts are not in evidence. So, as social animals, we seek other opinions, which can be wrong, sometimes dramatically. As individuals, the best we can do is make decisions mindfully, using our System 2 (thinking slowly), aiming for fewer but better choices. Most directly, this means avoiding excessive turnover and trying to invest based on “What’s it worth?” rather than “What happens next?” It also means choosing a format for investing that works for you—whether stocks, index funds, actively managed funds, or something else altogether.

- What You See Is All There Is. This WYSIATI means that it’s the recent, dramatic, unexpected, and personally relevant images that jump to mind. What doesn’t come to mind is historical, statistical, theoretical, and average. Even with work, a stock’s value is opaque. Instead, the shortcut is: today’s news is good, so buy the stock. Such investors blow with the wind, claiming their actions are “data dependent.” Every reasoned decision is based on data. Which data? Why? ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=457))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Instead, shine a spotlight on the evidence that is silent. Lurking in the background are unexamined assumptions about society and institutions. To fix recency bias, study history—the longer and broader, the better. To envision the future, investors need some idea of the normal baseline. Discover which things change and which endure. Statistics, probability, and the outside view are key. History is especially important because people repeat what works, but in the stock market we don’t get timely feedback on our decisions—and what we do get is mostly noise. The downside of history is the narrative fallacy. In The Black Swan (2010), Nassim Taleb wrote: The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon them. Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding. In other words, a problem arises when we see causation where there is none. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=468))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One outgrowth of the narrative fallacy is hindsight bias, the revisionist history tendency to think that an outcome was inevitable and predictable all along. But, really, the needed information wasn’t available. Personally, I combat hindsight bias by keeping company files, intermittently noting reasons for my trades. Others keep an investment diary.

- Because stories are appealing, we often begin with the wrong (statistical) reference point, which is called misplaced anchoring. Sometimes people are highly suggestible and, when prompted with an irrelevant number, anchor on it. For example, investors often can’t bring themselves to sell a stock for less than their cost, hoping to get back to even. (Instead, they should decide based on the intrinsic value of the stock today.) For stocks that have rallied sharply from an absurdly undervalued price, Fidelity fund manager Peter Lynch advised “mental whiteout” of the gains you have missed, in order to focus on today’s opportunity for further gains. Any single number can be a misplaced anchor—be it a stock’s previous highs, a historical valuation ratio, or estimated earnings. It usually isn’t relevant to compare today’s price/earnings ratio (P/E) for a small-cap or growth stock to its five-year average, because its growth profile and market conditions may have shifted radically. Instead, care about what its P/E should be today, based on what you know, perhaps by comparing it to similar opportunities. It also helps to ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=492))

- ignore refuting facts. The lizard brain makes quick decisions about urgent physical dangers. But when we invest, we need an independent, accurate answer—not a quick one. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=511))

- Confidence becomes overconfidence when you seriously miscalculate the odds and take risks that leave you uncomfortable. To believe that your analysis is right and the market wrong, you need confidence, which, without a valid reason, is arrogance. You should be confident in proportion to your own skill, knowledge, consistency, and patience, even if that’s not the signal that the market is giving you today. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=540))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Decisions can also be affected by whether trade-offs are framed as losses or gains. For example, framed as a recurring, certain loss of a premium, no one would buy insurance. Instead, it’s sold as gaining certainty that policyholders will not suffer from a catastrophic loss. When something is presented as a gain, people usually choose the guaranteed or safer option. When presented as a loss, they pick the riskier option, which in this case would be going uninsured for a devastating event. Investing is all about trade-offs between risk and return, and among diverse risks, such as fiduciary dishonesty, mismanagement, obsolescence, and financial failure. Unless you really are getting something for nothing, comparisons shouldn’t be framed as losses or gains, but as trade-offs.

- Almost by definition, the biggest mispricing will involve a glaring, hideous defect that popular opinion thinks cannot be overcome. That’s when your lonely, preferably well-researched conclusion that it either can be resolved, or isn’t so bad, will be rewarded. In principle, we would always buy understandable, well-run, durable franchises at bargain prices, but in practice the market must think that some element is missing. On average, you are paid for being a nerd and sorting out the true situation. Even more, you are rewarded for the courage to act on an unpopular opinion that made you look like an idiot, provided it turns out to be correct. Before then, there’s endless pain and worry that, indeed, the crowd is right. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=625))

- IN THE PUBLIC EYE, it all looks like gambling, and sometimes it is. Wall Street confuses things further by calling all of its customers “investors.” Awkwardly, every investment involves some form of speculation about future events.

- The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second. —JOHN STEINBECK ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=824))

- In business, every personality type has a way to make money. But in successful investors, two traits stand out: what psychologists label as thinking and intuitive, or rational analysts. (Note that intuitive is not used here in the popular sense of “trust your gut.” Intuitive is defined as attuned to pattern recognition, meaning, abstract theory, and the invisible, including the future.) Thinking people tend to make decisions based on logic (that is using their System 2), as opposed to feeling people, who decide based on people and feelings. Everything about the stock market is abstract—trying to guess what the future will bring, and what it means. Without theory, you’ll get nowhere. I would call the combination of thinking and intuitive—grappling with the invisible in a logically consistent way—trained intuition.

- Stoic detachment combined with emotional awareness is the perfect combination for stocks. Feel the fear, but let reason decide. The most frequent blunders come from those who believe everything their gut tells them. The biggest catastrophes come from people who are emotionally unaware when their gut is growling out a correct warning of something amiss. Worrying can be a good thing, if you don’t stress out or feel too intensely. As a value investor, I like to worry when things aren’t going wrong, because the emotional cost is lower. Most importantly, worry only if it will help you to work through the alternatives and find a better path. When the sky is predicted to fall and you can’t save it, relax. Reduce news intake. Be happy.

- Every skilled investor I’ve met has been curious and a lifelong learner. They read broadly and constantly. For anticipating the future, it’s more important to understand why things happen than what happened. By studying historical examples, I often find that some factors exert more, or less, influence than I would otherwise have thought. And when things happen that have never happened before, I study how others have handled unprecedented events in the past.

Fidelity’s Peter Lynch famously suggested that observing his wife Carolyn’s shopping habits provided a good starting point for stock research. Carolyn knew why L’eggs stockings were superior to competitive brands of panty hose. She would also know if and when a competitor launched a much better product.

- Any investor, big-picture or not, needs some concept of fair value to serve as his or her guide star. The idea of fair value not only indicates which trades are most attractive but also helps calibrate the weight of new information and aids in deciding whether to add to a position or reverse course. Arguably George Soros’s theory of reflexivity explains why the British pound became grossly overvalued relative to purchasing power parity, and then stopped becoming more so. Beyond that point, Soros’s most powerful tool was the notion of fair value. ([Location 1587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1587))

- “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down”; so goes the Japanese proverb. If making too much money would make them stick out, they won’t do it. CEOs in Japan are paid much smaller multiples of the average employee’s pay than CEOs in America. Employees probably do feel greater loyalty to their company when everyone is more nearly in the same boat. This might explain why politics is less polarized in Japan. But today the “salaryman” system of lifetime employment really exists only at larger companies. Many companies try to prevent being hammered down by holding large cash balances and avoiding debt.

- Foreigners are not allowed to own certain Chinese technology or communications firms. Although you can invest in a whizzy Chinese Internet stock like Alibaba, Baidu, or Ctrip, what you own is a variable interest entity. All of the licenses and permits to operate in sensitive industries are legally held by a Chinese company. Foreigners buy shares in a holding company, which can be domiciled outside of China and receive fees and royalties from the Chinese company but doesn’t own it. Exactly what that means is up to the Communist Party. ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1744))

- Before you invest internationally, you should consider your own comfort zone and appetite for learning. For most investors, the developed countries of the former British Empire are the best places to start—and stop. In these countries, the rule of law applies. The language, legal systems, business customs, and accounting standards are similar enough that, given a set of facts, the investment conclusion is the same as it would be in the United States. Investors who are willing to study foreign cultures should still stick to countries with rule of law unless they have extensive research support. They also need to understand that in many parts of the world, social position is not always linked to the profitability of an enterprise and matters more to business decisions than profits.

- THE VALUE OF A BUSINESS DEPENDS ON the quality of its management, and good managers are skillful and honest. If they are not skillful, they’ll squander your capital. If they lack integrity, they’ll steal it. So how do you test for skill? At the risk of ignoring critical skills like leadership, I hone in on two markers: distinctive capability and capital allocation. In this chapter, I assert that companies are not well run if they are not constantly striving to be ever more uniquely valuable to customers. Unless customers would miss a company if it went away, it eventually will. Companies need products distinctive enough to justify high-profit margins, plus a barrier to entry (or “moat”) to protect those high profits. Without distinctiveness, businesses have fewer opportunities to deploy capital profitably. As a value investor, I’m looking for companies that are increasing the amount by ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1803))

Relative to the capital invested, they make high profits. If they acquire businesses, they find like-minded people and don’t overpay. When they are short of great uses for capital, they return it by paying dividends or buying back shares. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1810))

- When I set out to understand a company’s character, I pretend that I’m a potential customer. I check out the marketing website or sales flyers or visit a store. Any forum will do, as long as the business is trying to convince prospects that it offers better merchandise, or at least a cheaper price. Occasionally, annual reports and basic research reports from brokerages help with this task, but I ignore everything about quarterly reporting during my examination of a company’s character. To me, Apple seems smart, elegant, and occasionally quirky but otherwise easy to get along with. GEICO is honest, thrifty, and good-natured. Many companies have a bland character. If after an hour of study you are still baffled, don’t sweat it. Move on to the company’s strategy. The secret of success in business and investing is to do something useful that no one else is doing. The job of skilled managers is to protect and extend that distinctiveness. Once others imitate it, the bloom is off the rose. Some businesses have unique and innovative products, other companies are organized distinctively, and still others have brands that resonate with customers. Competitors will copy what they ([Location 1822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1822))

While I think there is great value to studying the best manufacturing or financial practices of competitors, the point of strategy is to do well something those competitors are not doing or are doing badly. Character provides clues about what that uniqueness might be. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1831))

- According to strategy guru Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School, successful business strategies are at the opposite poles of each of two choices: (1) aim to dominate the entire industry or, alternately, target only the few segments in which it can excel; (2) choose between winning by marketing superior products or, alternately, by offering bargain prices. Companies run into trouble when they are not clear about whether they are serving the whole market or just focusing on specific niches. Also, quality products and low prices can’t be equally important objectives, or a company will be stuck in the middle.

Even robust enterprises have limitations; the market leader can’t grow much faster than the industry. Many of my investments are in small companies with finite resources. There’s no way they could offer all of the best products in every single segment and geography. Nor could they be the lowest-cost producer of everything that an industry offers. Instead, they must pick their spots. They focus on a regional market area or find a niche. Cement, for example, is expensive to ship, so the competitors that matter are usually local. Lululemon Athletica sells only yoga-themed clothes, serving a not-so-small market that major apparel companies had previously neglected. In commodity-like businesses, the products are all pretty much identical, so the only way to compete is with low prices. Some industries have major economies of scale, which implies that the biggest companies will have the lowest costs.

- low prices, so quality is the better way to go if a company has a choice. Staying a step ahead of competitors creates an endless rat race, though, especially in rapidly evolving industries. If successful strategies aim at either the total industry or specific segments, and at either quality or price, there are four possible combinations of strategy. Let’s consider each of them, starting with a superior product for the whole industry. The most exciting way for a business to be distinctive is to create an innovation that is totally new to the world. In the 2004 initial public offering prospectus for an Internet company, I read, “We believed we could provide a great service to the world—instantly delivering relevant information on any topic.” Few companies would make such a bold statement, and even fewer should. The company was, of course, Google. Google didn’t invent the search engine; its innovation was the power of its algorithms. Any company that talks about service to the world will not be content with niches; it is shooting for global domination. Google is the best search engine because it treats some categories of search as… ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1852))

- Google had only thirty-eight patents by the end of 2006, but in 2016, for example, Google filed 2,835 additional patents. Patents might no longer even be necessary, given Google’s brand and constant innovation. The Google name—like Xerox and Clorox—has become synonymous with its category. (In 2015, Google created a holding company, Alphabet Inc., for Google and its moonshot ventures.) Walmart is an example of a company with a well-executed strategy of selling to a very broad market at low prices. Currently, it has more than 11,000 stores in more than two dozen countries. Other than entire houses, cars, and gasoline, Walmart carries just about every product that a moderate-income family would buy. Until the 1980s, though, you might have called Walmart a niche player. It didn’t introduce groceries until 1988, and nearly all of its stores were in the southern United States. Measured by return on equity, profits peaked in the 1980s, but in dollars, profits reached new highs almost every year until 2013. Over time, Walmart’s character hasn’t changed; it is still frugal, efficient, dependable, and… ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1863))

- are even lower. Like its initial customers, Walmart was frugal because it had to be. As an undifferentiated general store, it’s tough to make money from people who don’t have much. Vendors go to Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, knowing they will be squeezed. On the other hand, suppliers benefit from volumes that can be enormous and from Walmart’s suggestions for cost reductions. To get rock-bottom costs, manufacturers standardize on products without frills or whimsy. With bar coding and just-in-time purchasing, Walmart keeps inventories at appropriate levels, as do vendors. As Walmart expands, administrative costs get spread over a larger volume of sales. Walmart rarely locates stores in high-rent districts; most of its employees are nonunion. GEICO is an example of competing on price by focusing on a niche of customers who don’t need or want certain services. It was founded as Government Employees Insurance Company because it initially provided coverage only to government employees, who were statistically safer drivers than average. Most car insurance is sold through sales agents, and sales agents are costly, but they help insurance companies assign risk categories to customers and they provide advice, especially when an accident occurs. GEICO didn’t have a large agency sales force and, being of thrifty character, wasn’t eager to pay up to recruit sales personnel. Instead, GEICO management organized themselves differently; they sold insurance directly to policyholders. By eliminating sales agents, GEICO cut out a service that, for safe drivers, costs more than it’s worth. If you really don’t know which insurance coverage is appropriate, or you anticipate that you will be in an accident, an agent could be helpful. But if you know what you want and never file any claims, you have no need for a relationship with your auto insurance agent. Not everyone is an above-average driver, so this niche isn’t for everyone. For its part, GEICO doesn’t want to cover you if you don’t fit a low-risk profile. Good drivers have accidents too, and GEICO doesn’t skimp on claims… ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1874))

- tumbling back to earth. Thirsty and drooping a bit, I was delighted to see an investor booth and free beverage bar for a company called Hansen Naturals. The fruit drinks they served were all natural with no artificial flavors or colors or sodium, similar to Snapple. Other than maybe its distribution system, though, Hansen didn’t want to knock off Snapple; it catered to edgier, more adventurous Californian tastes. Hansen had started by selling fresh natural juices to Hollywood film studios. Later it added zing with spices and other natural ingredients. New Age teas and sodas fit in with Hansen’s heritage, but Snapple had a powerful brand and better distribution. Instead, Hansen focused on “functional” drinks—drinks sold on their benefits, such as energy, vitamins, or antioxidants, rather than flavors. Not that Hansen could ignore taste, especially for its original juice beverages. At the time, this focus was so distinctive that it seemed to be out in left field. Hansen’s Monster energy drink tasted even better than Red Bull, the leading alternative, which had been introduced in the United States in 1997. Most people wouldn’t want a beverage with the bracing tastes of ginseng, guarana, and taurine, but I would have when I was a student. I figured there might be an unserved market of engineers, party animals, truckers, night shift employees, and extreme sports players. But how big was the market really? Whenever basic ingredients like water, caffeine, and sugar are sold by the serving, the key to success is branding and marketing. But the Hansen brand was all about pure, natural, relaxing, and refreshing, which didn’t fit with the energy drink. Ginseng and guarana are plants, so Monster was arguably more natural than Gatorade, but the idea of an energizing concoction seemed incompatible with the “natural” identity that Hansen had created. Monster had to create its image from scratch. The jagged neon green logo M on a black background stands out on store shelves. Hansen was a tiny company, but its sales had grown rapidly, it didn’t have much debt, and its stock traded at ten times earnings. I bought some shares for around $4. Since then the shares have split many times; each share has become forty-eight shares so the current… ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1895))

Some Monster drinkers are zealous fans, which you don’t often find with commodity-like businesses. Even as colas slip, sales of energy drinks are continuing to grow rapidly. When you do find a company that is truly one-of-a-kind, even in a small niche, it is a mistake to casually swap out of it for something run-of-the-mill. One of the ways I know that a management team is talented is that it develops a business with a distinctive character and unique capabilities. The best managers are product enthusiasts who bring to market products that they would personally buy but can’t find elsewhere.

- something more numerical that I can get from readily available sources. Capital allocation is a clunky term, but a useful concept meaning: follow the money. Is it going to the right places? Have the managers directed the capital at their disposal to the highest and best use possible given the situation? There are two related statistical ways to measure success—rate of return and present value—but both involve somewhat tenuous forecasts of the future. The first method compares the projected rate of return on capital improvements with a hurdle rate. Usually, this hurdle rate is tied to the “cost of equity,” or the lowest rate of return that long-term shareholders would find acceptable. If investors require a return of no less than 8 percent, the company should reject capital projects that return any less. Assuming that a company with an 8 percent cost of equity invested in something that would return 13 percent over the next year, it would have invested one dollar to create roughly $1.05 (1.13/1.08) of present value. The goal is to add the largest possible amount of value.

- defendants in lawsuits related to black lung disease and lung cancer. It was foreseeable that as verdicts for damages were rendered, companies would grudgingly settle claims, using capital in ways that offered no prospect of return. Cigarette companies at least had a positive offset to these anticipated liabilities in the form of powerful brand names. One subtlety was that the Surgeon General’s warning issued in 1964 acted as a partial legal shield thereafter. Cigarette companies’ exposure was proportionate to their market share in 1964. This favored Philip Morris, which had grown dramatically since then. The other challenge was in determining the value of intangible assets such as brands. Marlboro and other powerful brands were on the books at nominal amounts but had tremendous customer loyalty, suggesting huge economic goodwill. Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco had acquired food companies with leading brands like Maxwell House and Oreo, and here the intangible acquisition cost was shown in their accounts as trademarks or goodwill.

- price/earnings ratio. This, while useful as an investing guide, says nothing about the quality of management’s decisions. I decided to forge ahead and use the accounting numbers despite their defects. The ratio of a company’s earnings to its stockholder equity is called its return on equity (ROE). A high ROE suggests that a company is maximizing the profit per dollar of capital that shareholders put into the company. At the time, 12 percent was considered an average ROE. Almost the entire tobacco industry seemed to be head and shoulders better. U.S. Tobacco, which makes moist snuff, had an ROE approaching 50 percent, Philip Morris nearly 30 percent, and so on. RJR Nabisco, British American Tobacco (BAT), and American Brands all earned ROEs topping 20 percent. In retrospect, the relative rankings of ROEs of companies in the late 1980s were a powerful indicator of their future returns. I also wanted to know the reasons for the high ROEs. U.S. Tobacco and Philip Morris had the highest returns and the… ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1960))

- Expanding the Business or Building Value? For potential growth projects, everything is considered on an incremental basis. The increases in sales and profits are compared with the added capital required. For tobacco companies, the profit on increased sales from an existing plant is surreal. In 2016, the cost of goods sold for Altria (parent of Philip Morris USA and U.S. Tobacco) was 30 percent of sales. Tobacco leaf, paper, filter, and packaging were less than half of the cost of goods, with legal settlements accounting for the majority. Marketing, research, administration, and corporate took another 10 percent of sales. Even after excise taxes of 25 percent of sales, an operating profit margin of 34 percent remained. (The operating profit margin for the S&P500 was about 12 percent in 2016.) If a company has spare capacity and can make and sell more products, it can spread its fixed costs. The incremental rate of profit will be even higher than the already spectacular average. Even though returns on fixed assets are out of this world in the tobacco business, that math doesn’t apply to building new capacity.… ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=1971))

Altria logged $25.7 billion in sales in 2014 using property, plant, and equipment with a depreciated cost of just under $2 billion. Yearly operating profits were more than 400 percent of the value of its physical plant. Obviously, that return soars above any normal hurdle rate, which might be closer to 10 percent. Distinctive businesses can grow at only a certain rate and keep their character and profitability. Around the world, cigarette consumption has fallen in wealthier countries (figure 10.1). By contrast, in the poorer places, rising incomes brought more smoking. In those countries, investments to expand production paid off handsomely, even though selling prices were lower.

- Managements themselves often can’t know. Unless future sales are under contract, accountants expense the whole cost. Apple, Nestlé, Louis Vuitton, and Walt Disney spend and charge off billions in marketing costs each year. Generally, their brands become more valuable over time, increasing economic goodwill. RJR was in a tough spot, supporting many smaller brands while Philip Morris had a blockbuster in Marlboro. For Philip Morris, spending marketing dollars on a single powerhouse brand carried more potential benefits than RJR’s spending on a multitude of brands. RJR splashed out hundreds of millions on sports marketing, keeping thirty athletes on retainer. It bought billboards in stadiums so that they would be seen during televised games. Packaging was restyled. Joe Camel, a new cartoon brand mascot, drew the attention of youthful smokers and regulators. RJR maintained a stable share in a shrinking market.

- to hide lipstick stains, was later switched to a manly cork brown. Decades after the rebranding, Philip Morris was still reaping the benefits of an iconic package and mascot. Over a quarter of a century, the company catapulted from an also-ran to the market leader. Price discounting suggests that either prices are too high or product features don’t matter much. Around 1984, RJR repositioned Doral as a branded discount cigarette. At sharply reduced prices, the margins on cheap smokes were lower but still attractive. By 1992, RJR’s fastest growing segments were Doral and its generic cigarettes. To gain market share, RJR dropped wholesale prices of discount cigarettes by 20 percent. It worked; the next year, 42 percent of RJR’s volume was discounted. Marlboro sales eroded, so Philip Morris slashed prices as well. My suspicion is that, having weaker brands, RJR let its marketing strategy be led by its superior manufacturing capacity. In the 1990s, R. J. Reynolds made a controversial investment in a smokeless cigarette called Premier. Research and development for Premier cost at least $300 million, and the all-in costs may have topped $800 million. Smokers become habituated to tobacco by the nicotine, but the real health risks come from inhaling burning tar. The Premier cigarette heated tobacco and delivered nicotine vapors to smokers. Around launch time, RJR sent me a carton of Premier cigarettes. Not being a smoker myself, I turned to Beth, a portfolio manager who both smoked and invested in tobacco stocks. She pulled out her lighter and after half a dozen attempts was able to inhale a few puffs. “Jesus!” she bellowed, “It takes a fucking blowtorch to light this thing and then it tastes like shit.” Apparently, many others agreed.

- RJR generated far more cash than it invested. Unless a business is growing exponentially, I expect it to be financially self-sufficient with internally generated funds (including retained profits) more than enough to cover all of its growth. To check this, I look to the statement of cash flows in a company’s financial report. Cash flows from operations are the sum of net income, depreciation, amortization, changes in working capital, and other items. Then I sum up all the categories of capital spending needed to maintain and expand the business. These include purchases of property, plant, and equipment and investment in software, but not purchases of investments or other businesses. My definition of “free cash flow” is “cash flows from operating activities” minus all of the cash paid out for the investing activities listed above. Then and now, tobacco firms reinvested tiny fractions of their cash flows in the business. In 2014, Altria had $4.663 billion of cash from operations. Capital spending was $163 million, a bit under depreciation. This left $4.5 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow is available to buy businesses and investments, pay off debt, or return to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. We’ll soon come back to those alternatives. Most companies that run negative free cash flow are trying to grow faster… ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=2028))

- and gas, home building, and airlines. To tell whether negative free cash flow is worrisome or not, I check a company’s ratio of profits to capital invested—that is, its return on capital employed (ROCE). This is defined as operating profits as a percent of total capital, including both debt and equity. I’m much more impressed by an ROE of 13 percent based on a 13 percent ROCE with no debt than by the same ROE built on a 7 percent ROCE and a lot of debt. In a downturn, the profits of the levered company usually fall harder. A low or falling ROCE might signal that management is taking on some mediocre projects. When low or falling returns persist for years, I’m especially wary of negative free cash flow and rising debt. Acquisitions and Spin-Offs: Bigger or Better? Most studies say something like two-thirds of acquisitions miss the financial targets used to justify their purchase price. Acquisitions rarely happen without the buyer paying a control premium. To earn back the premium, a buyer must do something with a company that wasn’t already being done. Profits have to be improved somehow. That could happen by increasing sales or cutting costs or at least avoiding taxes. Some deals are… ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=2041))

- and premiums and combine similar businesses. The specter of antitrust litigation prevented takeovers in the tobacco industry until the mid-1990s; then there was a deluge. In 1994, American Brands sold its American Tobacco Company to BAT’s Brown & Williamson division and changed its name to Fortune Brands. In 2003, BAT’s Brown & Williamson was merged into Reynolds American, giving BAT a 42 percent stake in the combined company. RJR sold its international operations to Japan Tobacco and bought Conwood, a moist snuff producer. U.S. Tobacco was purchased by Altria in 2009. In 2014, Reynolds agreed to acquire Lorillard. As far as I know, none of these deals has disappointed. They were done at reasonable prices and were of businesses the managers understood well enough to know where to find cost savings. RJR Nabisco returned to the public market in 1991, two years after its mostly debt-financed buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). RJR set about selling bits and pieces of businesses and carved out Nabisco as a separate food company. In 1995, 19 percent of Nabisco was sold in a public offering. Before the buyout, RJR’s powerful brands gave it a large amount of economic goodwill, but after the buyout, their value was fully (maybe overly) reflected on its balance sheet as intangible assets of more than $20 billion. Both RJR Nabisco and Nabisco limped through the 1990s with single-digit ROEs in most years. Acquirers must do something different with a business to justify paying a takeover premium, so it’s not surprising that results were generally best in somewhat-related businesses. Packaged food and cigarettes are mass-market perishable consumer goods made with agricultural inputs. RJR’s tobacco executives probably understood Nabisco’s marketing and distribution strategies far better than they understood anything about shipping or oil. Likewise, Philip Morris was happier with General Foods and Kraft than with Mission Viejo, the home builder. When a buyout is announced, historical operating profits and the price are usually disclosed as well, so an analyst can estimate a ROCE. It will, of course, be a low estimate as it doesn’t reflect the profit improvements yet to come. The RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout had a $31 billion enterprise value—cash price plus debt assumed—and $2.8 billion in operating profit, for a ROCE of 9 percent.

Usually dividends reflect those profits, but paying a dividend doesn’t itself create wealth—it just distributes the wealth that was created. In the twentieth century, most companies paid out half or more of their earnings in dividends. Currently, most companies issue dividends of less than half their profits. There are several reasons for this, including tax policy, the institutionalization of investing, and the rising popularity of stock options. Dividends are taxed as received, whereas the tax on the capital gain resulting from share buybacks is deferred until the investor sells.

Berkshire Hathaway has not paid a dividend since Warren Buffett arrived; share repurchases have been rare as well. This profile proclaims supreme confidence in Berkshire’s ability to allocate capital better than its investors. For most CEOs other than Buffett, I would infer hubris or low standards for returns. Tobacco companies have the opposite approach. They pay out roughly three-quarters of profits as dividends and top that off with share repurchases. Statisticians say that stocks with healthy dividends slightly outperform the market averages, especially on a risk-adjusted basis. On average, high-yielding stocks have lower price/earnings ratios and skew toward relatively stable industries. Stripping out these factors, generous dividends alone don’t seem to help performance. So, if you need or like income, I’d say go for it. Invest in a company that pays high dividends. Just be sure that you are favoring stocks with low P/Es in stable industries. For good measure, look for earnings in excess of dividends, ample free cash flow, and stable proportions of debt and equity. Also look for companies in which the number of shares outstanding isn’t rising rapidly. To put a finer point on income stocks to skip, reverse those criteria. I wouldn’t buy a stock for its dividend if the payout wasn’t well covered by earnings and free cash flow. Real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships, and royalty trusts often trade on their yield rather than their asset value. In some of those cases, analysts disagree about the economic meaning of depreciation and depletion—in particular, whether those items are akin to earnings or not. Without looking at the specific situation, I couldn’t judge whether the per share asset base was shrinking over time or whether generally accepted accounting principles accounting was too conservative. If I see a high-yielder with swiftly rising share counts and debt levels, I assume the worst.

Without an estimate, though, one can’t judge whether management is adding to per share value by buying back stock. To understand the transfer of wealth, consider a corporation with 100 shares, whose only asset consists of $10,000 in cash with no ongoing business. The intrinsic value of each share is equal to the proportional share of the cash, or $100.

Conversely, when a company buys back shares at a discount to intrinsic value, the loyal shareholders gain a proportionate share of that discount.

This amount would be reflected in the profit and loss, although shareholders would be urged to ignore it as a noncash charge. Suppose the stock then leaped to $160, all of the options were exercised, and the fifty new shares were repurchased. The company would collect $5,000 from the options exercise and shell out $8,000 to buy them back, leaving its cash balance at $7,000. Although the share count is steady, shareholders are out $3,000, or $30 per share. Another reason why buybacks peak along with the stock market might be that a company’s profits are topping out then. Perhaps cash should be returned to shareholders. But there’s no law that requires this to be done immediately.

- debt to buy back stock. If it is late in the economic cycle, and profit growth is slowing, per share earnings growth can be sustained by borrowing money to repurchase stock. All of the tobacco companies consistently repurchase stock and have usually added value in doing so. The exception was RJR during the 1990s. Restrained by a large debt burden, it not only didn’t buy back stock, but it also had to issue equity. I was glad that by this time I was no longer the tobacco analyst. RJR stock had fallen from its initial launch price, went sideways for years, popped, and slumped, leaving it lower at the end of the decade.

Reynolds was better than the overall market, but Philip Morris was far ahead. The same was true in the 1980s, if you take out the run-up to RJR’s buyout in 1988. KKR’s investors did not make money on the RJR deal, so again Philip Morris was in the lead. The pattern continued through the 1990s, but reversed in the new millennium. One indicator of superior capital allocation is high and stable ROCE. Philip Morris’s returns were higher and more stable over several decades. In some industries, an outsider can use rules of thumb to estimate incremental returns on growth projects and advertising, but not in tobacco. My sense is that Philip Morris did a more effective job. Mergers and acquisitions can be very good or very bad but, on average, disappoint. The odds are best for combinations of related businesses done at reasonable prices. Philip Morris had more success with its acquisitions than Reynolds, which may be why it continued to diversify even as Reynolds was going back to basics.

Philosopher Hannah Arendt had it right that “most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.” Watch for when massive option grants or hefty fees compel people to try too hard. Pride can be a dominant motive when an audience believes in someone’s magical powers. Charismatic promoters often suppress the boards of directors, auditors, and other naysayers that might prevent them from doing what they want. They cluster in industries and geographies where capital is abundantly available with little scrutiny or accountability. Lax accounting standards are also a draw. Don’t buy anything someone is pushing hard. By avoiding the bad-guy stocks—and it’s a short list—I slash the possibility of a disastrous outcome but scarcely reduce my opportunity set.

In buoyant markets, the stories are all about demand, but investors watch the supply side. The producer with the lowest costs will have the highest profit margins, which could allow it to be the fastest grower. If prices were stable, I would (and do, anyway) search for undervalued assets and lower production costs.

- low-cost producer will be the last to die, but the costs of competitors shift at differing rates. Sustaining low costs is difficult. Asset values can become shockingly ephemeral. The cost to discover and produce a barrel of oil, for example, can’t be precisely known in advance. Accountants classify the costs of energy companies into three groups: (1) finding reserves, (2) developing reserves, and (3) lifting and producing the oil or gas. Finding oil is a mixed game of luck and skill. In any single instance, drilling results are unpredictable; even the best explorers drill dry holes. Measures of finding costs will leap around and so must be considered as a historical average cost of all exploration activity in a geographic area. To explain why a company’s costs are low, I look to geology, technology, and social institutions. Development costs are tied to a particular field or project, so explorers budget costs proportionate to the estimated value of the resource. Some reserves are cheap to find but expensive to develop or lift, and vice versa. One rule of thumb for maintaining profitability is that development costs shouldn’t be more than one-third of the selling price—for example, costs of $15 a barrel when oil is selling at $45 a barrel. Lifting costs are more predictable than development costs, partly because they include taxes and royalties, which are often determined by law or contract as a percentage of revenues. The costs of physically lifting hydrocarbons from deep offshore wells are higher than from prolific, shallow land wells. Even in a specific field, the first oil lifted is the easiest and cheapest, with costs rising over time. Fiscal terms and geology vary all around the world. Therefore, not all barrels are equal. Prices constantly bounce around in anticipation of future supply and demand. Rising prices signal that more of a commodity is wanted, but new supplies of mineral resources take years to develop. The lags are sometimes so spread out that one wonders whether there is any link between price and supply response at all. Oil prices touched a peak of $145 a barrel in July 2008, but American oil production was still rising in 2015. Unlike other minerals, oil cannot be recovered and reused.

- decks. (A price deck is a series of price forecasts over time, usually quarterly or annual.) While I generally avoid commodity businesses, if you must invest in one, go with oil, because of the limit on supply and relatively inelastic demand. When a resource can be renewed, the cost is to find, produce, and replace it. Individual oil companies may be able to replace reserves, but globally, the resource endowment is irreplaceable and depleting. Hubbert’s Peak occurs after half of the global oil endowment has been produced; it’s possible that it has already occurred. Through improved technology, more oil can be located and extracted, but eventually, Earth’s resources are finite. For now, demand is stable to increasing. In the ten years up to 2015, world crude oil production fell 1.6 percent in its weakest year and rose 2.7 percent in the strongest. Until automotive and alternative energy technologies improve further—and there’s a lot of progress happening with that—there are no good substitutes for oil as transportation fuel.

- Because hydrocarbons occur naturally and are depleting, most governments stake a social claim on them. In many countries, national oil companies have a monopoly on ownership. Abroad, oil and gas sales are heavily burdened with taxes and royalties. At the same time, some costs related to energy production and consumption—like Middle Eastern wars, environmental damages, and road building—are also borne socially. Consider the hundreds of thousands who died in the unending series of Middle Eastern wars. When wars flare up in the Middle East, oil prices tend to jump. Higher oil prices help governments of producing nations fund their wars, but more directly, wars disrupt oil supply lines. After years of intermittent study of Sunnis and Shiites, and of the locations of oil fields, pipelines, and ports, I’ve not concluded anything very useful for making investments. One could spend a lifetime examining Arab culture and history and never turn up a winning stock. My conclusion is not to invest in war zones.

- get nothing. However, they accept reality at different speeds. Between 1980 and 2003, energy prices were flat to down while broad price levels doubled, so oil and gas producers had to slash costs. Since 2008, energy companies again have been forced to cut expenses. All the buckets of costs must be considered together. A project with low finding costs may have high development or lifting costs. “Step out” and “extension” wells, which are adjacent to existing fields, have high hit rates, while high-risk wildcat wells are often dry holes. Many companies dropped traditional exploration in favor of programs with better odds. New techniques have improved recovery rates and reduced finding costs. In the early 1980s, drillers generally expected to recover 20 percent of the oil in the ground, and 50 percent recovery rates were rare. Now, through secondary recovery methods, 60 percent of the oil in place can often be lifted. More oil can be extracted (with less water and gas by-product) by drilling horizontally while using measurement while drilling.

Many shale wells are relatively short lived, producing the majority of their oil or gas in two or three years. Shale producers will see cash coming in from product sales, but the wells’ short lives mean that constant upkeep is needed and new resources must be located. Any shale producer that tries to get off this treadmill will see its output dwindle. Oil explorers are drawn to regions with promising geology and attractive tax and royalty (“fiscal”) terms. They prefer to avoid regions that are corrupt and war torn. Over time, the basins with the most activity become tapped out, even with new drilling technologies.

Looking around the globe in 2000 (and still today), all of the cheapest energy stocks were in Russia, no matter whether you looked at price/earnings ratios (P/Es), price per barrel of reserves, or estimates of the present value of assets. In Russia it’s not clear who legitimately owns anything, least of all the oil industry. When Russia returned businesses to private hands, influential government officials often wound up as owners. Effectively, Yukos was sold to Bank Menatep and Mikhail Khodorkovsky for $309 million under loans for shares, despite a higher bid.

- Yukos had proven reserves of 5.9 billion barrels of oil that could be recovered before its licenses expired, more than ten barrels per ADR. About two-thirds of the proven reserves had been developed. And if Yukos could get its licenses renewed after they expired, another 4.6 billion proven barrels could be recovered. In addition, it had 4.6 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves. Even after Yukos’s ADR septupled to $68 by October 2003, the stock market value of its proven reserves was $6 a barrel. For comparison, ExxonMobil shares were trading around $40 and were backed by reserves of 1.7 barrels of oil per share and 8.5 thousand cubic feet of gas. Converting the gas to equivalent barrels at a 1:6 energy-equivalent ratio, Exxon had about three equivalent barrels of reserves per share, implying a price of $13 a barrel. What were Yukos’s assets worth? In their U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated 10K or 20F annual reports, oil and gas production companies provide an estimate of the value of their reserves, called the “standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.” This is the most important table in an oil company… ([Location 2945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=2945))

- have dropped, downward revisions to reserve estimates from previous years hint at a lack of reporting integrity. Following SEC standards, Yukos assumed that the 2002 year-end product prices, costs, and tax regime would stay constant indefinitely. Crude oil was trading at $28 a barrel in December 2002. Yukos also assumed certain trends in the economic recoverability of hydrocarbons. Based on that, Yukos calculated the after-tax cash that it would receive by producing out its reserves. These amounts were discounted back at a 10 percent rate of return. This worked out to be $54 per Yukos ADR before its license expiry, and $62 if the license was extended. Arguably, this was a conservative estimate; it included no value for Yukos’s cash, refineries, service stations, or probable and possible reserves. In Russia, bad things happen to those who don’t support the siloviki, or politicians who were formerly with the KGB or military.

In nations like Russia, where oil is the primary export, there is a real “oil curse.” Governments that can be totally funded with oil revenues do not need popular support and are often repressive and undemocratic.

It was as close to a growth stock as you could find among major oils. On paper, Brazil’s tax and royalty regime was competitive with North America’s. I pegged Petrobras’s finding and development costs for newly discovered oil at about $4 a barrel (remember that costs jump around). In 2003, Petrobras’s lifting costs, excluding the government take, were $3.48 per equivalent barrel. For coming years, Petrobras had set a goal of trimming lifting costs to $3.00 a barrel. The government take amounted to $5.14 a barrel, or about one-fifth of the selling price. With world oil prices at around $25 a barrel, Petrobras earned an operating profit margin of just over 50 percent on its exploration and production business. Perhaps because the government owns a majority of the voting stock, Petrobras did little to avoid or defer taxes… ([Location 2988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=2988))

- fourth grade, and he worked for labor unions before he became a politician in the Worker’s Party. That was scary stuff, but his Minister of Energy, Dilma Rousseff, was mostly market-oriented. She later became Lula’s chief of staff. Petrobras was clearly an instrument of economic policy, with Ms. Rousseff serving as its board chairwoman. Petrobras sold some of its products at controlled prices, even though by law prices were largely decontrolled in 2002. But if the country raised taxes and royalties, one arm of the government would take money from another. In August 2000, Petrobras ADRs were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as part of a privatization policy that had been implemented under Brazilian president Fernando H. Cardoso. Investors feared that Lula would roll back privatization and other market-oriented reforms. An analyst quipped, “Brazil is the country of the future, and always will be.” Consequently, despite all the positives, Petrobras stock was seemingly undervalued, with a P/E of between five and six in 2003 and 2004. By comparison, at its low point, ExxonMobil was at thirteen times 2004… ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=2999))

Brazil seemed to be the only place on earth where drillers could find new fields in the super-giant (over 1 billion barrel) class. Lula became one of the most popular Brazilian presidents ever. Petrobras stock was unstoppable. Its share price doubled again in 2005, then again in two years to 2007, yet again by year-end 2007, and still further in the first half of 2008. Between 2004 and June 2008, Petrobras stock multiplied tenfold, far outstripping most major oil companies. Petrobras became the largest holding in my fund, even though it had not started that way. Selling Petrobras shares at this point might look like a mistake, but the stock really wasn’t visibly undervalued anymore. In June 2008, with the ADRs at $71, Petrobras had a stock market value topping a quarter of a trillion dollars and a P/E over thirty, both of which exceeded Microsoft’s.

- To justify continuing to hold Petrobras stock then, I would have had to make ambitious forecasts about probable and possible reserves and future luck. Later events show that exuberance was indeed warranted. In 2010, the Libra field was discovered. At 8 billion barrels of reserves, it was even larger than Tupi. Simultaneously, the Franco field with 4.5 billion barrels was also discovered near the Libra field. There were several other billion-barrel pre-salt fields (meaning they were trapped offshore below a shifting layer of salt and rock a mile deep). Brazil might become an oil exporter, perhaps of great size. The financial media doted on Brazil. When commodity prices are rising, low-cost producers will miss out on profit opportunities if they do not bring on capacity at increasing costs. An oil well that had all-in costs of $20 a barrel when crude was selling for $25 should gush cash when oil prices hit $145 a barrel, even allowing that royalties and taxes rise in tandem. At $145 a barrel, any well with all-in costs lower than $145 would be profitable. Adding a well with costs of, say, $100 might reduce a company’s profit margin but add to dollars of profit. Petrobras and OGX—a highly leveraged Brazilian driller established in 2007—were both eagerly grabbing higher-cost opportunities. The 6-billion-barrel Tupi field was the largest of these, but there were scores of promising (if costly) prospects in Brazil’s offshore basins.

- In 2009, two Petrobras economists (Rafael R. Pertusier and Mileno T. Cavalcante) presented a startling report titled “Are Oil Prices and Oil Costs Related?” Their answer was a resounding “Yes!” In 2002, when the price of Brent crude oil was around $25 a barrel, the all-in break-even price for Brent crude was about $20 a barrel. Finding and development costs for the major international oil companies averaged $5.40 per barrel. In 2008, Brent crude spiked to well over $100, but averaged around $97 a barrel. The industry’s break-even price was $86 a barrel, as finding and development costs had quintupled to $25.52 a barrel. Oil service contractors hoisted their day rates for using rigs, but at higher oil prices, it was still profitable to spend more to find a barrel of oil. Petrobras had discovered billions of barrels of oil in the Campos and Santos basins, which faced even greater cost pressures. Some wells were 20,000 feet deep before they struck oil. With well locations two hundred miles offshore, it would take years and great coordination to get the drilling equipment in place. There were no precedents for the scale and scope of the Tupi (Lula) field, and other gigantic projects were anticipated. The Brazilian government wanted to keep the oil windfall in Brazil and passed a series of laws with that intent. Brazilian content requirements were expanded for equipment used offshore.

- the rigs used in the Brazilian offshore had been Brazilian, which was increased to three-fifths. High-tech international oil service contractors had to find a local partner or finagle a way around the rules. Petrobras would be the operator of any new fields in Brazil and would own at least a 30 percent interest. Brazil would be assured that “the oil is ours,” but the implication was that Petrobras would be borrowing billions of dollars every year for years to come. Net debt exceeded $100 billion by 2015. Petrobras’s slogan is O petróleo é nosso, or “the oil is ours,” but I kept wondering who was included in the “us.” Did the oil belong to the citizens of Brazil, the shareholders of Petrobras, or top government bureaucrats? Were frequent repetition of the slogan and the new laws omens of nationalization? Nor was this an idle fear. Bolivia had nationalized its oil industry in 2006. The next year, Venezuela partly expropriated Orinoco basin wells from foreigners, including Petrobras. I didn’t know it in 2009, but Argentina would renationalize YPF in 2012.

- businesses like oil, there will be major cyclical swings. The companies that go bust during a down cycle have either high costs or excessive debt, or both. I bailed out of all of the Petrobras in my funds. As I gradually exited shares later at much lower prices, I thought wistfully of the peak price of $72 per ADR in 2008. In retrospect, I regret nothing. Oil field development was behind schedule with overruns adding up to tens of billions of dollars. Brazil remains a net oil importer. Dilma Rousseff was elected President of Brazil when Lula’s term was up. Plans to build four new refineries were announced, including three in Brazil’s poor and less-populated northeast; two of these were partially built and later scrapped. Petrobras’s refining operations hemorrhaged billions, as oil had to be purchased on the world market while the gasoline products sold at controlled prices. Today, Petrobras still has more employees than ExxonMobil and less than half the revenues, suggesting overstaffing. After oil prices crashed in late 2014 and Dilma Rousseff was reelected, Petrobras announced multibillion-dollar… ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=3056))

- no contract in Brazil’s oil sector could be secured without a bribe. Dozens of the country’s senators, contractors, and prominent officials were indicted, including former president Fernando Collor de Mello, who had been impeached (and acquitted) on corruption charges. President Rousseff was impeached and removed from office in 2016. From a financial analyst’s viewpoint, corruption, mismanagement, steep taxes and royalties, bad geology, and bad luck are all paths to high costs. Corruption is problematic, not only ethically but also because analysts presumably don’t know about it and can’t gauge how it might change. I can detect mismanagement only with simplistic ratios like revenues per employee. The stable costs of taxes and royalties can shift even in countries with rule of law, as rising prices can make landowners and governments greedier. Surveys of oil industry finding costs can tell you about the past but should be combined with a forward-looking view of geological opportunity, the stability of fiscal terms, and a company’s technological skills.

- At the top of most lists of major corporate failures, you’ll find asset-heavy industries, led by banks and other financial firms. The capital-intensive industries favored by highly leveraged billionaires turn out to be disproportionately disaster prone. Other asset-heavy industries like autos, airlines, shipping, steel, and coal have recently produced numerous bankruptcies but few billionaires. In these industries, it is practically impossible to offer anything that competitors won’t quickly knock off. The only way to win is to be really, really superb at capital allocation, which includes investing when competitors are not—and vice versa. In commodity industries, failures tend to cluster together in waves. Businesses are all suffering the same pricing or cost pressures at the same time, and losing money. They’re all being pressured by creditors to sell capital assets, depressing their value. Real estate can be repurposed and so is usually more resilient, while highly specialized equipment is devastated. The prices of used dry bulk carriers and oil tankers lurch around between a ceiling of the cost of a newly built vessel and a floor set by scrap metal value. A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) purchased for $137 million in 2008 was sold for $28 million four years later. At any given time, either many shipping lines will be in dire straits, or none will.

- For investors interested in corporate longevity, Japan is the place to study. According to Arie De Geus, there are 967 businesses worldwide that were established before 1700, with more than half of them in Japan. Today’s high-tech marvels are absent from this list, which is dominated by traditional, slow-changing, but not completely commoditized industries like sake, confectioneries, tea, food, restaurants, pubs, and religious artifacts. Change makes life exciting, but companies that must change constantly are destined to make wrong decisions at some point and succumb. If you view businesses as very long-term assets, and as risky assets, as the Japanese apparently do, it’s appropriate to finance them almost entirely with equity. Half of the listed stocks in Japan carry more cash than debt, something you will not find anywhere else in the developed world. On their balance sheets, you’ll also find proportionately less reported goodwill than elsewhere, though the Japanese also have their own famous brands and indestructible franchises. Corporate life span depends on following the two matching principles, but there’s also a social explanation: Businesses are communities of people. The companies that survive are communities that customers, employees, and suppliers want to be a part of. They adapted but kept a distinctive character and mission. Nor did they diversify extensively. Most of the businesses that were around in 1700 were family owned, so most of the survivors were also family controlled, making them a very specific form of community. Closer to home, American academics have found that stocks of companies with controlling shareholders, including families, outperform those with dispersed ownership. For investors, nirvana is a profitable, growing enterprise that is certain to endure. Financial leverage does not destroy companies, but it does create vulnerability. Look for businesses that respect the matching principles: Match borrowings with safe (not risky) assets, and match long-term assets with long-term (not short-term) debt. Businesses that are susceptible to commodity cycles, obsolescence, or shifting consumer preferences should tread lightly. If trouble is foreseeable, look for uncollateralized debt with deferred, staggered repayment dates, few covenants, and friendly lenders. A cash cushion and access to undrawn credit lines also help companies to make it through. ([Location 3555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=3555))

- THE QUESTION OF WHAT STOCKS will return, and their implied discount rate—either as an asset class or for individual securities—is both reasonable and ridiculous. An estimate of value is only as reasonable as the discount rate used. A perpetual annuity is worth one-third more if the discount rate is 6 percent rather than 8, and this variance might create, or destroy, a margin of safety. Investors can’t duck the question. They need some basis for decisions to put money into stocks rather than bonds, real estate, or whatever. They also need a way to rank and choose among hundreds of possible opportunities. Returns on stocks depend critically on the price paid, but as time passes, they look more like the returns of the underlying business. Active investors will always seek a return that beats the odds, but they can’t deduce the odds without fathoming the market discount rate. They also must be wary of using a low discount rate to justify a high ([Location 3583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=3583))

Later we’ll touch on some ways to sharpen this estimate. If at any point this chapter seems too geeky, just remember: Tilt toward low P/E stocks, and veer away from high P/Es. Earnings yield, expected return, and the discount rate all point toward more attractive securities, times to invest, industries, and national markets. Of these numbers, earnings yield is the only one that can be readily observed. Expected return and discount rate require guesswork and calculation, and the extra effort is not always repaid with superior results.

- The low P/E effect is linked to the small-cap stock effect. In table 17.1, value weighting means that if the aggregate market value of U.S. stocks is $20 trillion, the High 10 decile would consist of the $2 trillion worth of stocks with the highest earnings yields. Equal weighting means that if three thousand companies were surveyed, the High 10 decile would consist of the three hundred names with the highest earnings yield. Most of the stocks with extremely high earnings yields are small caps. The equal-weighted high earnings yield portfolio visibly outperforms the value-weighted portfolio by holding portfolios of obscure shares that few investors have heard of. Few institutions are willing to own equal amounts of General Motors and Strattec Security, for instance. But even the value-weighted earnings yield portfolios vastly outperform the averages. For both methods, cheaper deciles nearly always return more than more expensive deciles. ([Location 3626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=3626))

- Seeking Low P/Es with Good Growth To recap: When choosing value investments, first eliminate stocks that won’t turn reported into realized returns. If earnings don’t convert into owner earnings sooner or later, a company’s accounting must be overstated, which sets the stage for negative surprises. When cash flows do not correspond to the increase in present value, you have a wasting asset. Local newspapers were an example of this. We will see it more and more as brands and intellectual property become more important. Value can also be lost when firms squander capital on idiotic boondoggles. Present value might not be reflected in realized returns because management channels the gains to themselves. Next, earnings should be considered as an average using a period with conditions resembling those one imagines will prevail in the future. The Shiller formula takes an average of ten years of reported earnings, which usually covers a couple of business cycles. For specific stocks, an average of reported earnings will make fast growers look overly expensive. Instead, I prefer to estimate normal earnings by taking a ten-year average of profit margins or return on equity; multiply this by current sales or shareholder equity. Beware of using this approach with deep cyclicals—like autos or steel—as sales may be currently high or low. Also, look for a competitive moat that will protect the business against the ravages of time. ([Location 3853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0743JNFBZ&location=3853))

- Third, check to see whether it’s foreseeable that in a few years, a company will grow enough to justify an apparently demanding valuation. Walmart didn’t pass this test, but others do. In those cases, the discount rate is generally a better indicator of future returns than the initial earnings yield. Indeed, if there will be plenty of runway after the crossover point, expected returns might be much nicer. This method can also be inverted to assess whether the cash flows of a melting ice cube will shrink so fast that in a few years the cash flows no longer justify the purchase price. For those who fantasize that they can predict cash flows from here to eternity, a precise rate of return can be calculated using a full-blown discounted cash flow model. Knock yourself out! Finally, I group stocks with similar averaged earnings yields that I can trust and discard the ones with intolerable risks. My risk tolerance is not the same as yours. Your risk tolerance may reflect special knowledge if, for instance, you are Russian, or a venture capitalist. Risk tolerance is also tied in with concentration and diversification. Concentrated portfolios will always produce the best—and worst—performance. But risks that may be worthwhile in small doses can be scary in a focused portfolio. I also try to spot risks that come with a silver lining—for example, slow-growing markets don’t attract competitors. Most investors care about future rates of return as a yardstick for comparing opportunities, and for that purpose, earnings yield is a fair proxy. You can refine that estimate by cutting out stocks whose earnings may not convert to shareholder return, by averaging earnings, by looking for moats that will protect earnings, by factoring in the value of growth, and by avoiding situations in which you know there will eventually be damaging bolts from the blue. Crisply put, you want low P/E stocks that are also high quality and growing, with a high degree of certainty about the long-term outlook.

- Value Traps in Elements of Value “Value trap” is a common epithet for stocks that disappoint or are expected to disappoint. It implies that some investing shortcut has indicated that a security is undervalued, yet it hasn’t performed well.

- Whether your path more closely resembles Bogle’s or Buffett’s, you will reduce your regrets by seeking a margin of safety in five steps. (1) Be clear about your motives, and don’t allow emotions to guide your financial decisions. (2) Recognize that some things can’t be understood and that you don’t understand others. Focus on those that you understand best. (3) Invest with people who are honest and trustworthy, and who are doing something unique and valuable.
