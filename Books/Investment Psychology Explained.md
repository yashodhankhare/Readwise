## Highlights
- For most of us, the task of beating the market is not difficult, it is the job of beating ourselves that proves to be overwhelming. ([Location 30](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=30))

- We spend too much time trying to beat the market and too little time trying to overcome our frailties. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=37))

- It is therefore vitally important to review both your progress and your mistakes on a continuous basis because no two market situations are ever the same. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=44))

- Markets are a zero-sum game: For every item bought, one is sold. If newcomers as a group expect to profit, it follows that they must battle successfully against these same people with decades of experience. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=46))

- At this point, clarification of some important matters seems appropriate. Throughout the book, I have referred to traders and investors with the male pronoun. This is not in any way intended to disparage the valuable and expanding contribution of women to the investment community but merely to avoid "he or she" constructions and other clumsy references.

- All markets essentially reflect the attitude and expectations of market participants in response to the emerging financial and economic environment. People tend to be universally greedy when they think the price will rise, whether they are buying gold, cotton, deutsche marks, stocks, or bonds. Conversely, theirmood can easily swing to fear or panic if they are sufficiently persuaded that prices will decline. Human nature is the same in all markets the world over.

- Speculators have a longer time horizon that can stretch up to six months. In his classic book, The ABC of Stock Speculation, Samuel Nelson defined speculation as "a venture based on calculation." This definition could just as easily apply to traders. He distinguished between speculation and gambling by concluding that gambling is a venture that is not based on calculation.

- While each set of rules is unique, you will see that a common thread runs through all of them. This theme may be summarized as follows: Adopt a methodology, master your emotions, think independently, establish and follow a plan, and continually review your progress.

- Garfield Drew, the noted market commentator and technician, wrote in the 1940s, "Stocks do not sell for what they are worth but for what people think they are worth." How else can we explain that any market, stock, commodity, or currency can fluctuate a great deal in terms of its underlying value from one day tothe next? Market prices are essentially a reflection of the hopes, fears, and expectations of the various participants. History tells us that human nature is more or less constant, but it also tells us that each situation is unique.Let us assume, for example, that three people own 100% of a particular security we will call ABC Company. Shareholder A is investing for the long term and is not influenced by day-to-day news. Shareholder B has bought the stock because he thinks the company's prospects are quite promising over the next six months. Shareholder C has purchased the stock because it is temporarily depressed due to some bad news. Shareholder C plans to hold it for only a couple of weeks at most. He is a trader and can change his mind at a moment's notice.A given news event such as the resignation of ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=102))

- the company's president or a better-than-anticipated profit report will affect each shareholder in a different way. Shareholder A is unlikely to be influenced by either good or bad news, because he is taking the long view. Shareholder B could go either way, but shareholder C is almost bound to react, since he has a very short-term time horizon.

Because of this, it is very difficult to see how anyone could ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=116))

- create a system or develop a philosophy or approach that would call every market turning point in a perfect manner. This is not to say that you can't develop an approach that consistently delivers more profits than losses. It means merely that there is no perfect system or Holy Grail. We shall learn that forecasting market trends is an art and not a science. As such, it cannot be reduced to a convenient formula.

- An alternative to using a single guide is to follow a number of different experts simultaneously. This solution is even worse because experts as a group are almost always wrong. Figure 1-2 compares Standard and Poor's (S&P) Composite Index with the percentage of those writers of market letters who are bullish. The data were collected by Investor's Intelligence* and have been adjusted to iron out week-to-week fluctuations. (A more up-to-date version appears in Chapter 8.) Even a cursory glance at the chart demonstrates quite clearly that most advisors are bullish at major market peaks and bearish at troughs. If this exercise were conducted for other investments such as bonds, currencies, or commodities, the results would be similar. At first glance, it mayappear that you could use these data from a contrary point of view, buying when the experts are bearish and selling when they are bullish. Unfortunately, even this approach fails to deliver the Holy Grail, because the data do not always reach an extreme at all market turning points. At a major peak in 1980, for example, the Index couldn't even rally above 60%. In late 1981, on the other hand, the Index did reach an extreme, but this was well before the final low in prices in the summer of 1982. While the Advisory Sentiment Indicator does forecast some major peaks and troughs, it is by no means perfect and certainly lacks the consistency needed to qualify as the Holy Grail.

History tells us that it is not possible to accumulate a significant amount of money in a brief time unless you are extremely lucky.

- into a situation where the markets act in perfect harmony with the system or approach that you have adopted, you are likely to attribute your success to hidden talents just discovered. Instead of walking away from the table, you will continue to be lulled back into the market, not realizing the true reason for your good fortune.… ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=170))

- Another flaw with these systems is that data are usually back tested for a specific time, and special rules are introduced so that the method fits the data retroactively solely to demonstrate huge paper profits. If you invent enough rules, it is relatively easy to show that a system has worked in the past. However, if rules are developed purely to justify profits in these specific periods, the chances are that these same rules will impede future success.To ensure that a system is likely to work in the future, when it counts, the rules should be simple and kept to a minimum, and the testing period should cover many markets over many years. The problem with most of these advertised ventures is that they give you the results… ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=188))

- Changes in the character of a market are not just limited to changes in trend volatility. Any method that uses the past to forecast the future assumes that past behavior will repeat.Systems constructed from assumptions concerning basic economic fundamentals are also subject to failure.… ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=197))

- sooner or later rally in the face of falling interest rates and begin to fall sometime after rates have begun to rise. The lags fall into a fairly predictable range most of the time but on occasion can be unduly long. These exceptions can result in missed opportunities or devastating losses. This problem occurred at the beginning of the Depression. Interest rates peaked in the fall of 1929, yet the stock market declined by about 75% over the next three years. In this instance, the knowledge that rates lead equity prices could have led to devastating losses. Timing is everything. In a similar vein, short-term interest rates bottomed out in December 1976 at 4.74% and almost quadrupled to a cyclical peak of 16.5% in March 1980. Yet stock prices in the same period as measured by the S&P Composite were unchanged.While the inverse relationship of interest rates to equity prices works well as an indicator of market direction most of the time, these examples show that it is far from perfect and certainly no Holy Grail. The reason for this is that once a certain indicator or investment approach works for a while, word of its money-making capabilities spreads like wildfire. Then, when everyone is aware of its potential, it becomes factored into the price and the relationship breaks down.This concept works just as well in reverse, where fear rather than greed is the motivator. People, it seems, tend to repeat past mistakes but not those of the most recent past. Once-bitten-twice-shy applies as much to trading and investing as to any other form of human activity. In the 1973-1974 bear market, for example, equity investors were clobbered principally due to rising interest rates. In virtually every business cycle throughout history, investors have waited to sell stocks after interest rates started to rise. In the cycle that followed the 1973-1974 market debacle, however, investors sold stocks in anticipation of risingrates. Since rising interest rates were already factored into equity prices, the stock market actually rallied along with rates in the 1978-1979 period.In New Methods for Profit in the Stock Market, Garfield Drew tells us that the mind generally harks back to its last experience in the market and judges the market by that encounter. He shows that stung investors hold postmortems after each unforeseen collapse in prices to get a better grip on the… ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=199))

- In his book Money and Investment Profits, Hamilton Bolton, the founder of the Bank Credit Analyst, a monthly newsletter, commented, "It is perhaps ironic that to be of value an indicator must be far from ideal, subject to considerable controversy, and subject also to considerable vagaries in timing. The perfect indicator would be useless; the imperfect one may be of investment value" (p. 201). Until his untimely death in the late 1960s, he probably worked on more indicators in his investment career than any other person. Thus, a creative genius such as Bolton, who was a master at developing indicators and at forecasting markets,… ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=234))

- As soon as money is committed to a financial asset, so too is emotion. Any biases that were present before the money was placed on the table are greatly increased once the investment has actually been made. If none were present before, they certainly will appear now.

- markets are determined by the attitude of investors to the emerging economic and financial environment rather than by the environment itself.

- Figure 2-1 shows that the target of objectivity or mental balance lies approximately in the middle between the two destructive mental forces of fear and greed. Fear is a complex emotion taking many forms such as worry, fright, alarm, and panic. When fear is given free rein, it typically combines with other negative emotions such as hatred, hostility, anger, and revenge, thereby attaining even greater destructive power.Aspects of Fear… ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=279))

- A Threat to National Security Triggers Fear. Any threat of war, declared or rumored, dampens stock prices. The outbreak of war isusually treated as an excuse for a rally, hence the expression: "Buy on the sound of cannon, sell on the sound of trumpets." This maxim is derived from the fact that the outbreak of war can usually be anticipated. Consequently, the possibility is quickly discounted by the stock market, and, therefore, the market, with a sigh of relief, begins to rally when hostilities begin. As it becomes more and more obvious that victory is assured, the event is factored into the price structure and is fully discounted by the time… ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=283))

- selling in response to bad news, the more believable the story becomes, and the more realistic the situation appears. As a result, it becomes very difficult to distance ourselves from the beliefs and fears of the crowd, so we also are motivated to sell. By contrast, if the same breaking news story received less prominence, we would not be drawn into this mass psychological trap and would be less likely to make the wrong decision.Fear of a Never-Ending Bear Market Is a Persistent Myth. Once a sizable downtrend has gotten underway, the dread that it will never end becomes deeply entrenched in the minds of investors. Almost all equity bull markets are preceded by declining interest rates and an easy-money policy that sow the seeds for the next recovery. This trend would be obvious to any rational personwho is able to think independently. However, the sight of sharply declining prices in the face of such an improving background… ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=291))

- or subconsciously, or both. If you have made an investment that resulted in devastating losses, you will be much more nervous the next time you venture into the market. As a result, your judgment will be adversely affected by even the slightest, often imagined, hint of trouble. That intimation will encourage you to sell so that you can avoid the psychological pain of losing yet again.This phenomenon also affects the investment community as a whole. Prior to 1929, the collective psyche lived in dread of another "Black Friday." In 1869, a group of speculators tried to corner the gold market. When the gold price plummeted, they were forced to liquidate. This resulted in margin calls, the effect of which also spilled over into the stock market causing a terrible crash. Even though few of today's investors experienced the "Black Thursday" crash of 1929, this event still casts a shadow over the minds of most investors. As a consequence, even the mere hint of such a… ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=298))

- are often measured on a relative basis either against the market itself or against a universe of their peers. If they are underin- vested as a sharp rally begins, the perception of missing out on a price move and of subsequent underperformance is so great that the fear of missing the boat forces them to get in.This form of fear can also affect individuals. Often, an investor will judge, quite correctly, that a major bull market in a specific financial asset is about to get underway. Then when thebig move develops, he does not participate for some reason. It might be because he was waiting for lower prices, or more likely because he had already got in but had then been psyched out due to some unexpected bad news. Regardless of the reason, such "sold out bulls" suddenly feel left out and feel compelled to get back into the market. Ironically, this usually occurs somewhere close to the top. Consequently, the strong belief in the bull market case coupled with the contagion of seeing prices explode results in the… ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=305))

- fill, a lost order, and so on. Inevitably, I have found this burst of emotion to be associated with a major, often dramatic turning point in the market. This experience tells me two things. First, I have obviously lost my sense of objectivity as the need to participate at all costs overrides every other emotion. My decision is therefore likely to be wrong. Second, the very nature of the situation-a lengthy period of rising prices culminating in total frustration-symbolizes an overextended market. It is reasonable to expect that others are also affected by the same sense of frustration, which implies that all the buying potential has already been realized.When you find yourself in this kind of situation it is almost always wise to stand aside. A client once said to me, "There is always another train." By this, he meant that even if you do miss the current opportunity, however wonderful it may appear, patience and discipline will always reward you with another. If you ever find yourself in this… ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=313))

- Fear of losing can also take other forms. For instance, occasionally we play mental games by refusing to acknowledge theexistence of ominous developments. This could take the form of concentrating on the good news, because we want the market to rally, and downplaying the bad news, although the latter may be more significant. Needless to say, this kind of denial can lead to some devastating losses.Alternately, an investor may get into the market in the belief that prices are headed significantly higher, say by 30%, over the course of the next year. After a couple of weeks, the stock may have already advanced 15%. It then undergoes a minor correction that has absolutely no relevance so far as the long-term potential is concerned. Nevertheless, the investor's fear of losing comes to the surface as he mentally relives experiences of previous setbacks. The reasoning may be, "Why don't I get out now? The short-term correction that is likely to take place may well push the price below… ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000R9QN7I&location=320))

One way of solving this dilemma would be to take profits on part of the position. This would relieve some of the pressure but would also leave him free to participate in the next stage of the rally.A more permanent and viable solution is first to recognize that you have a problem in this area. Next, establish a plan that sets realistic goals ahead of time and also permits the taking of partial profits under certain predetermined conditions. This approach would stand a far greater chance of being successful than knee-jerk trading or investment decisions caused by character weakness.
