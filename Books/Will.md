## Highlights
- “Stop thinking about the damn wall!” he said. “There is no wall. There are only bricks. Your job is to lay this brick perfectly. Then move on to the next brick. Then lay that brick perfectly. Then the next one. Don’t be worrying about no wall. Your only concern is one brick.” ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=107))

- The days dragged on, and as much as I hated to admit it, I started to see what he was talking about. When I focused on the wall, the job felt impossible. Never-ending. But when I focused on one brick, everything got easy—I knew I could lay one damn brick well. . . . As the weeks passed, the bricks mounted, and the hole got just a little bit smaller. I started to see that the difference between a task that feels impossible and a task that feels doable is merely a matter of perspective. Are you paying attention to the wall? Or are you paying attention to the brick? Whether it was acing the tests to get accepted into college, hitting it big as one of the first global hip-hop artists, or constructing one of the most successful careers in Hollywood history, in all cases, what appeared to be impossibly large goals could be broken down into individually manageable tasks—insurmountable walls comprised of a series of conceivably layable bricks.

- No matter what you’re going through, there is always another brick sitting right there in front of you, waiting to be laid. The only question is, are you going to get up and lay it? ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=125))

- In many ways, Mom-Mom is the total opposite of my father. Whereas Daddio was the boisterous, charismatic center of attention, Mom-Mom is quiet and reserved; not because she’s shy or intimidated, but because she “only speaks when it improves on silence.” She loves words and always chooses them carefully—she speaks with an academic sophistication. Daddio, on the other hand, was loud, spewing the lingo of a 1950s North Philly hood rat. He loved the poetry of his profanity—I once heard him call a man a “dirty rat, cocksuckin’, low-down, mangy pig fucker.” Mom-Mom doesn’t use profanity.

- My full name is Willard Carroll Smith II—not Junior. Daddio would always correct people: “Hey! He ain’t no mutherfuckin’ Junior.” He felt like calling me “Junior” diminished both of us. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=231))

- In Daddio’s mind, everything was life or death. He was preparing his children to thrive in a harsh world—a world that he saw as chaotic and brutal. The instilling of fear was—and still is to a large degree—a cultural parenting tactic in the Black community. Fear is embraced as a survival necessity. It is a widely held belief that in order to protect Black children, they must fear parental authority. The instilling of fear is viewed as an offering of love.

- As much as we all suffered under Daddio’s militaristic views of love and family, nobody suffered more than my mother. If two people being in charge meant everybody dies, then that meant my mother could never be in charge. The problem was that my mother wasn’t the type of woman to be commanded. She was educated, proud, and stubborn, and as much as we begged her to please be quiet, she refused. Once, when Daddio slapped her, she egged him on. “Oh, you’re such a man! You think that hitting a woman makes you a man, huh?” ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=337))

- He hit her again, knocking her to the ground. She stood right back up, looked him in the eye, and calmly said, “Hit me all you want, but you can never hurt me.” I have never forgotten that. The idea that he could hit her body but somehow she was in control of what “hurt” her? I wanted to be strong like that.

- In acting, understanding a character’s fears is a critical part of understanding his or her psyche. The fears create desires and the desires precipitate actions. These repetitive actions and predictable responses are the building blocks of great cinematic characters. It’s pretty much the same in real life. Something bad happens to us, and we decide we’re never going to let that happen again. But in order to prevent it, we have to be a certain way. We choose the behaviors that we believe will deliver safety, stability, and love. And we repeat them, over and over again. In the movies, we call it a character; in real life, we call it personality. How we decide to respond to our fears, that is the person we become. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=356))

- My imagination is my gift, and when it merges with my work ethic, I can make money rain from the heavens. My imagination has always been the part of me that Mom-Mom loved the most. (Well, that and when I got good grades.) It’s a weird mix of love that she has for me. She loves my silly side, but she needs me to be smart. At some point in her life, she decided that she was only allowed to talk about important stuff: educational reform, generational wealth, the new misleading national health guidelines. She doesn’t “entertain foolishness.” Her and Daddio debated everything. “Integration is the worst thing that ever happened to Black folks,” Daddio said emphatically. “You don’t believe that, Will—you’re just sayin’ it to pluck my nerves,” Mom-Mom said dismissively. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=440))

- “Listen to me, Car’lyn! Before integration, we had our own. Black businesses were thriving because niggas had to patronize niggas. The cleaners, the restaurant, the hardware store—everybody needed everybody. As soon as Black folks was allowed to eat at McDonald’s, our entire economic infrastructure collapsed.” “So are you suggesting that you’d prefer to be raising these children in slavery, or in Jim Crow?” Mom-Mom said. “I’m suggestin’ that if there was a nigga water fountain, niggas would be gettin’ hired to fix it.” Mom-Mom would never say it to Daddio, but she would repeat all the time, “Never argue with a fool, because from a distance, people can’t tell who’s who.” So when she would stop arguing with you, you knew what she thought of your position.

- But it didn’t matter what they thought, because to me, I was hot. That’s one of the things about having an overactive imagination: I could make my mind believe anything. I was able to cultivate an almost delusional level of confidence. And while this somewhat skewed perception of myself would often end in ridicule or getting my ass kicked when I was young, on many occasions throughout my life it served as a superpower. When you are unaware that you shouldn’t be able to do something, then you just do it. When my parents told me I couldn’t be a rapper ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=522))

- because there were no careers in hip-hop, it didn’t deter me, because I knew parents just don’t understand. When television producers asked me if I could act, I said, “Of course,” even though I had never acted a day in my life—I thought, How hard can it be? When movie studios said they couldn’t cast me because African American leads don’t sell to international audiences, I wasn’t necessarily offended, I just couldn’t understand how a motherfucker that wrong could have this job. It wasn’t just the racism that bothered me, it was the stupidity. People would tell me how I was supposed to be, and it just didn’t make any sense. I felt like their rules didn’t apply to me. Living in your own little world with your own rules can be an advantage sometimes, but you have to be careful. You can’t get too detached from reality. Because there are consequences.

- The bigger the fantasy you live, the more painful the inevitable collision with reality. If you cultivate the fantasy that your marriage will be forever joyful and effortless, then reality is going to pay you back in equal proportion to your delusion. If you live the fantasy that making money will earn you love, then the universe will slap you awake, in the tune of a thousand angry voices.

- Make-believe is a normal part of psychological development. But as we grow up, we start to let go of our fantasy life simply because we discover that living in the real world is more valuable to us than clinging to our fantasies. We have to learn how to deal with others, how to succeed at school and at work, how to survive in the material world. And it’s hard to do that if you’re unable to perceive reality accurately.

- After about two weeks, Daddio started commenting that this was the longest period in his life that he’d gone without seeing any Black people. (Apart from us, of course—we’re Black.)

- cause us to feel abandoned, unsafe, and unloved. The behaviors and attitudes that win us affection often come to define what we understand as love. Daddio appreciated when I worked hard and performed his directed orders with intensity and precision. He applauded when I was disciplined in laying a perfect brick toward the construction of a perfect wall. Mom-Mom loved when I used my brain—she applauded the thinker within me, when my wit and intellect were most on display. My mom is my prototype: patient, brilliant, formidable, nurturing. She’d prefer to do things together, but she’s going to be fine with or without you. Mom-Mom can carry it all for a while if you need to take a break.

- The thing I’ve learned over the years about advice is that no one can accurately predict the future, but we all think we can. So advice at its best is one person’s limited perspective of the infinite possibilities before you. People’s advice is based on their fears, their experiences, their prejudices, and at the end of the day, their advice is just that: it’s theirs, not yours. When people give you advice, they’re basing it on what they would do, what they can perceive, on what they think you can do. But the bottom line is, while yes, it is true that we are all subject to a series of universal laws, patterns, tides, and currents—all of which are somewhat predictable—you are the first time you’ve ever happened. YOU and NOW are a unique occurrence, of which you are the most reliable measure of all the possibilities. ([Location 1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=1720))

We’re gonna help you and support you to do anything you think you need to do to succeed. But in one year, if it ain’t happenin’, you’re going to go to whichever one of them school’s your mother choose. That work for you?” In my mind a year was forever. I was ecstatic.

That was how a father was supposed to be. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=1754))

But in pure Charlie Mack form, on February 22, 1989, Bobby McFerrin won Record of the Year for “Don’t Worry, Be Happy;” Album of the Year was George Michael’s Faith; Tracy Chapman won Best New Artist; and the winner for Best Rap Performance was DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince for “Parents Just Don’t Understand,” making us the first rappers ever to receive a Grammy Award.

- Our shows were getting bigger, the crowds were getting louder. One night in Detroit, at the Joe Louis Arena, I got overexcited and forgot the words to “Parents Just Don’t Understand.” This had never happened to me before. My heart dropped into my stomach. There are few things more embarrassing than forgetting the words to the one song that eighteen thousand people spent their hard-earned money to come and hear. But something miraculous happened: The entire crowd began to sing the lyrics back to me. Every person knew every word. I held the mic out to the crowd, and they finished the song. It took everything I had not to burst into tears. Thousands of people saying my words back to me. I felt loved, protected, and cradled by a crowd of strangers. We were red-hot, and unstoppable. At twenty years old, I was a world-famous rapper, a Grammy Award winner, and a Freshly minted millionaire (pun intended).

- dealt. The capacity to adjust and improvise is arguably the single most critical human ability. There’s a Buddhist parable that has guided me through many a perilous transition: A man is standing on the banks of a treacherous, raging river. It’s rainy season—if he can’t get to the other side, he’s done. He quickly builds a raft and uses it to safely cross the river. In joyous relief, he high-fives himself, lifts the raft, and heads toward the forest. But as he attempts to make his way through the dense tree cover, the raft is banging and knocking into trees and becoming entangled in vines, preventing him from moving forward. He only has one chance for survival: He must leave the raft behind—the vessel that saved his life yesterday is the same one that will kill him today if he does not let it go. The raft represents our outmoded ideas and old ways of thinking that no longer serve us. For example, the same angry, aggressive persona you cultivated as a child to protect yourself from bullies and predators will now destroy every relationship you have if you’re unwilling to let it go. Things can be perfectly useful and absolutely necessary during certain periods of our lives. But a time will come when we must put them aside or die. Simply put, if we don’t adapt, we become extinct. I saw JL’s and Jeff’s choice to stay in Philly as a death sentence for both of them. But I also knew that I wouldn’t allow it.

- professional crash and burn had taught me a harsh, universal lesson: Nothing lasts forever. Everything rises and falls—no matter how hot the summer gets, the winter is inevitable. I promised myself I would never get caught sleeping again. That during the good times, I would plant and nurture the seeds of the “next thing.” And if I was truly wise, and attuned to the movements of the industry, I would be able to time the harvest of the next thing impeccably, just before the death of the old thing. In the same way that my music career was scorching hot, then icy cold, I knew the same thing would one day happen in TV. I was about to be on blaze—but one day, I knew I’d be cold again. I asked myself: After television, what would be my next thing? There was only one answer: movies. But I also made a deeper, more problematic conclusion: that love and relationships were also subject to the universal law of impermanence. I vowed to never get caught without my eye on my next love. My heart had been crushed, and I was certain that it would happen again. I knew there would be a blissful, springtime meeting; a hot summer whirlwind; a melancholy fall; and then an icy winter death. I decided that my only emotional defense against this brutal cosmic certainty was to outcreate the cycle of destruction. In my mind, I knew I had to be like Tarzan: catching the next vine just as I let go of the old one. If I could grab the new thing, while simultaneously releasing the dying thing, I could avoid and escape the harshest elements of winter and indefinitely sustain the vibrance of springtime bliss.

- The war between desire and obstacle is the heart and soul of dramatic storytelling (sometimes, the obstacles are internal—those are the fun ones). In filmmaking circles, there is a simple axiom that describes the structure of a great character journey: somebody wants something badly, and goes for it, against all odds. (Another variation is, a person falls into a hole, and tries to get out.) If you think about any movie you’ve ever liked, any character you’ve ever rooted for, it’s because they wanted something you could relate to and they struggled, risking life and limb, to achieve it. What’s true about movies is also true about life: You tell me what you want, and I’ll tell you who you are. ([Location 3486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=3486))

- what you want, but not knowing how to get it; and (2) not knowing what you want. Clarity of mission is a powerful cornerstone of success. Knowing what you want gives direction to your life—every word, every action, every association, can be accurately chosen and harnessed to precipitate your desired outcome. What you eat, when you sleep, where you go, who you talk to, what you allow them to say to you, who your friends are, can all be corralled and launched toward your wildest dreams. (Desire, however, is a double-edged sword. But that’s for later—I didn’t know that back then.) ([Location 3522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=3522))

- We tend to think of our personalities as fixed and solid. We think of our likes and our dislikes, our beliefs, our nationalities, our political affiliations and religious convictions, our mannerisms, our sexual predilections, et cetera, as set, as us. But the reality is, most of the things that we think of as us are learned habits and patterns, and entirely malleable, and the danger when actors venture out to the far ends of our consciousness is that sometimes we lose the bread crumbs marking our way home. We realize that the characters we play in a film are no different than the characters we play in life. Will Smith is no more “real” than Paul—they’re both characters that were invented, practiced, and performed, reinforced, and refined by friends, loved ones, and the external world. What you think of as your “self” is a fragile construct. ([Location 3736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=3736))

- imperfect mind can be forced to achieve is by removing all of its other options. To me, the heart of all successful human interactions is we look at each other and we know we’re about to attempt something that is difficult/impossible. And we look in each other’s eyes, and we shake hands, and we both vow to die before we quit. And that’s what I thought we did. This is such a simple idea to me. The vows are “til death do us part”—God agrees with me. The vow is not to your partner—the vow is to the weakest part of yourself. How could you not quit if that’s one of the options? The reason you say you’re gonna do it or die is because death is what happens when you don’t do it. Your mind is trying to protect you from hard things, to defend you from pain. The problem is, all of your dreams are on the other side of pain and difficulty. So, a mind that tries to seek pleasure and comfort and the easy way inadvertently poisons its dreams—your mind becomes a barrier to your dreams, an internal enemy. If it was easy, everybody would do it. The reason we make vows is because we know we’re about to do a hell walk. You don’t have to vow to do easy things.

I dipped out to take the call, and in the ten yards from the studio to the phone, I got real unswole, real fast. “Hello, Mr. Spielberg, sir,” I said, in a least swole tone of voice I could muster.

Think about Whitney Houston’s The Bodyguard and “I Will Always Love You”; Prince’s “Purple Rain”; Rocky and “Eye of the Tiger”; Saturday Night Fever; Footloose; Grease . . . Y’all get it. The alchemy of the story and the soundtrack together is like a self-perpetuating tornado sucking all the cash out of the weekend. The symbiotic relationship between movie, song, and music video was a perfect promotional storm. The song works as massive radio promotion for the movie that is essentially free. The music video acts like a trailer for the movie, and the movie sends fans to buy the album and request the song and video. We were now locked and loaded.

- One of the greatest disagreements Jada and I ever had was in a therapy session around priorities. Jada and I were both given a sheet of paper and a pen, and the exercise was to list our priorities, ordered from most important to least. Jada and I feverishly scribbled away, and after a few minutes, we were instructed to hand our sheets of paper to each other. Surprisingly, we’d both only written four priorities each. As I read Jada’s, a look of confusion spread across my face. And as she read mine, her eyes swam with tears. In the twenty-five years we’ve been together I’ve never felt her more injured than in that moment. Jada had listed her priorities as: The children Will Myself Extended family and friends.

- “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” was released in January 1998, to a decent response. Then it labored a bit through February—that month I received my third Grammy, for “Men in Black,” so we were sort of OK with “Jiggy” not being a hit. Then, the wheels of serendipity began to turn: In an episode of Seinfeld, Jerry is attempting to woo a woman who is not feeling him at all. He asks her, “What is the problem?” To which she responds, “What do you want from me, Jerry?” “I’m trying to get jiggy with you,” Jerry says emphatically. Fans appreciated Seinfeld’s risqué redefinition of the word “jiggy.” That next week, Stuart Scott, on ESPN, over the countdown for NBA shots of the week, yelled out, “And he is gettin’ jiggy with it!” over the top dunk. Immediately, we saw a spike in single and album sales, and by March, “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” was #1. I was embarrassed. But I was just warming up. Oh, by the way, during this time, Jim Carrey became the first actor to earn $20 million per movie, setting the A-list fee for the top of Hollywood. So, it was obvious that if Jim was worth twenty, the conversations with me started at . . . twenty-one. ([Location 4686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=4686))

- These conflicting parenting and worldviews landed us in a custody battle. Trey was about nine years old, and now his parents were both demanding full custody. The emotion of these types of disputes is so extreme that very little sanity prevails. It becomes a strange game of chicken, with the child in the middle. How aggressive are you willing to be against your ex with the risk of injuring your child if you miss? And the answer is tainted with the delusion that your behavior is strictly and only for the protection of the child, so you feel justified in higher levels of emotional violence because after all, it’s your ex’s fault anyway—they are causing the whole thing. It’s obvious, and everyone can see it’s their fault, except them. I called Daddio. He listened calmly, patiently, a veteran of a very similar petty war. “Hey, man, look,” Daddio said, with an uncharacteristic delicacy. He understood where my mind was, and he knew he had to be careful. “You can’t win. You can’t fight with a kid’s mother. The kid will hate you forever.” Daddio had hit a bull’s-eye in my heart. I knew that to be true firsthand. “So, what am I supposed to do?” I asked. “Just let her mess up my son?” “You have to wait. When he turns thirteen years old, she ain’t gonna be able to do nuthin’ with him. He’s gonna reach for you. It’ll be your turn then. But for now, let her do whatever she gonna do.

- Desire is personal, narrow, and pointed, and tends toward self-preservation, self-gratification, and short-term gains and pleasures. Purpose is wider, broader, a longer-term vision encompassing the benefit of others—something outside of yourself you’re willing to fight for. There have been many times in my life where I was acting from a place of desire but I’d fully convinced myself that it was purpose. Desire is what you want; purpose is the flowering of what you are. Desire tends to weaken over time, whereas purpose strengthens the more you lean into it. Desire can be depleting because it’s insatiable; purpose is empowering—it’s a stronger engine. Purpose has a way of contextualizing life’s unavoidable sufferings and making them meaningful and worthwhile. As Viktor Frankl wrote, “In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” A noble aim engenders positive feelings. When we pursue what we believe to be a profound and valuable goal, it stirs the best parts of ourselves and others.

- The Pursuit of Happyness came out in 2006 and was a critical success and box office smash, and garnered my second Academy Award nomination. If I felt invincible before, now I really felt it. I just made a movie about a homeless Black guy who gets a job in the eighties, and still crushed every other movie at the box office that season. I couldn’t miss. The streak continued: I Am Legend roared out the first weekend with the largest-ever box office gross for a movie in December. It was a movie that featured me, on-screen alone—with a dog—and it grossed around $600 million. Then Hancock, written by Vince Gilligan of Breaking Bad fame, about an alcoholic superhero, came out and grossed another $600 million plus within six months of I Am Legend. I was unstoppable. It was the greatest streak of smash hits of any movie actor in Hollywood history. I became the highest-grossing film actor ever. And I still wasn’t even forty years old. The problem was, I’d conflated being successful with being loved and being happy. These are three separate things. And since I’d conflated them, I ended up suffering from an even more insidious version of the “subtle sickness,” which I can best describe as “more, more, more, more.” If I am more successful, I’ll be happier, and people will love me more. I was trying to fill an internal emotional hole with external, material achievements. Ultimately, this kind of obsession is insatiable. The more you get, the more you want, all the time never quite scratching the itch. You end up with a mind consumed by what it doesn’t have and what it didn’t get, and in a spiraling inability to enjoy what it has. I Am Legend had opened to the biggest December opening ever. When JL called to give me the weekend grosses, he was uncharacteristically ecstatic. “The three-day was $77,211,321 in 3,600 theaters. That’s over $21,000 per venue. Nobody’s ever done that, ever.” I was quiet for a moment and then I recognized a subtle dissatisfaction. “Why do you think we missed eighty?” I asked. “What?” JL said. “I’m sayin’, do you think it was the ending? I feel like if we had made the adjustment to the final moment, you know, if we could have made it feel more like Gladiator at the end. . . .” “Are you fuckin’ serious right now?” JL said. “It’s the biggest opening ever. Ever.” “I get that, J, I’m just asking you a question,” I said. ([Location 5456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=5456))

It was just an innocent question from a daughter to her father, but somehow, I knew that it was more than that: What she was really asking me was, “Don’t you care how I feel?” It was the deepest, existential human question. It may be the most important question that we as humans ever ask each other. Does it matter to you how I feel? Even though she was only ten years old, and my choice to abandon the conquest had sufficiently answered her question in the affirmative, I asked myself What is my honest answer? I took a deep, hard, self-reflective look at my belief systems around feelings. And my truth startled me. I would have never said this out loud, but a truthful answer to “Does it matter to you how I feel?” would have sounded something like this: Not exactly, sweetheart—feelings are seventh on my list.

- I started noticing feelings everywhere. I’d be sitting in a business meeting, and someone would say, “It’s nothing personal . . . it’s just business.” And I realized, Oh, shit, there’s no such thing as “just business”—everything is personal. People get furious, excited, frustrated, hopeful, hopeless, disappointed, fearful, embarrassed, all in the confines of “business” meetings. Everybody is caught up in their feelings, making all their decisions all the time based only on how they feel. Even my aversion to extreme feelings . . . is based on how I feel about feelings. I felt like Christopher Columbus who had discovered this “new” place where people was already at (sorry about that preposition, Mom-Mom). All of politics, all of religion, all of sports, culture, marketing, eating, shopping, sex—everything is centered on how people feel. Then the truth hit me like a 90 mph fastball: Nobody gives a shit about anything except how they feel. Feeling good is the most… ([Location 5629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=5629))

- not you love them by how well they feel you honor their feelings. This has been a precarious conundrum in most of my adult relationships. I have always been less concerned about someone’s immediate feelings than I have been about their overall well-being. People in my life have consistently complained about feeling unconsidered by me, and when left unaddressed, this has sometimes festered into their feeling unloved. I would walk through fire for the people I love. I am fully prepared to die for my family. But no—I haven’t always focused on their feelings. I don’t trust feelings; feelings come and go and change like the weather. You can’t plan anything around them. And just because somebody feels something, doesn’t make it true; just because your feelings are extreme, doesn’t mean that you’re right—in fact, the more extreme your feelings are, the more likely it is that they’re skewed. People care less about facts, truth, probabilities, or intentions than they do about how they feel and how well you have displayed that you care about those feelings. So, when we open sentences with “The fact of the matter is,” the other person is thinking, I just talked for ten minutes—I told you what my fact of the matter is. Or if… ([Location 5639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=5639))

They care what they think and what they feel. That’s why they said it. There are other inherent questions attached to Does it matter to you how I feel? If the answer is yes, then the next unspoken question is How much? And then, What behavior alterations are you willing to make to show me how much? And what parts of your personal agenda are you willing to let go of in order to apply that energy to my agenda? Are you willing to put your thoughts and feelings aside in order… ([Location 5651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=5651))

- Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart. Jada sent me this quote from Kahlil Gibran and repeated over and over, “What’s true will remain.” We had concluded that no one can make a person happy. You can make a person smile; you can compose a moment that helps a person to feel good; you can deliver a joke that makes a person laugh; you can create an environment where a person feels safe. We can and must be helpful and kind and loving, but whether a person is happy or not is utterly out of your control. Every person must wage a solitary internal war for their own contentment.

- We arrived at the art show—two steps out of the car, and it was a massive, chaotic mob scene. A couple of hundred people cheering, pushing, grabbing, screaming. It was all love, but as the saying goes, sometimes, love hurts. Excited crowds can be dangerous. Scoty is now in full security mode, trying to get me through the electrified crowd of “his folks.” It was the first time that I had ever had “security” who was wearing flip-flops. It was also the first time since I had become famous that I didn’t have backup. No security, no one to call; I didn’t know where I was, where the exits were, where the US embassy was. Nothing. It even felt like I didn’t speak the language. It’s what a baby must feel like being expelled from the safety of the womb. I was a forty-two-year-old newborn. We make our way through the gallery. Safe now in the artist’s VIP, I meet Che and his family: his younger sister, Asha “Lulu” Lovelace; Che’s son, Roscoe; and Lulu’s daughters, Ila and Eva. There is something about the Trini sun that bakes children to perfection—these were the most beautiful kids you can imagine.

- “Are you spending the night?” Ila asked, in her six-year-old innocence. I laughed that adult laugh that adults laugh when they’re not really laughing. Well, Ila, apart from one night in the Lincoln Bedroom after Bill Clinton’s inauguration, I haven’t stayed over at anyone’s house since I was twelve years old. I don’t even stay at my parents’ spots when I go back to Philly. I know you’re only six, Ila, but you need to understand that there are significant logistical difficulties to safely transporting a “global icon” around the world. For starters, I travel with a minimum of ten people, meaning we need a minimum of eleven rooms. And if it’s at all possible, for security purposes, my entourage will take a whole floor of the finest hotels in the world. Of course, my room is always the one all the way at the end of the hallway; the room with the double doors. . . . Not to mention, I don’t really know any of you; I barely know Scoty. I’m here alone, and I’ve never been alone. So, the thought of staying over with strangers—even strangers as kind and as beautiful as your family—scares the livings daylights out of me. So, yes, Ila, yes, I’m spending the night. “So, where’s my room?” I asked her. ([Location 5947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=5947))

- We set sail at about 9:00 a.m.—me, Scoty, Che, Lulu, Roscoe, Ila, Eva, and Jonathan. After about forty minutes, we tucked into a secluded cove, off Chacachacare Island. Scoty, Che, and Jonathan are in the water before the anchor hits the sea floor. I was trying to stay awake, but either the soothing sway of the Bertram or my gluttonous assault on Ila’s leftovers sent me back into the land of nod. Two hours later, I awake to find the boat empty. Everyone’s in the water now except Roscoe, Che’s five-year-old son. He’s eating a ripe mango, or, more accurately, it looks like he’s wearing it, or it’s eating him—he’s drenched in the flesh and the juice. I yelled to Scoty and crew, “Yooooo! What’s the plan?” “Whatcha mean, man?” “I’m saying, the plan, for today—what we doing?” “We here,” Scoty said, gesturing to the horizon. “I know, but what are we doing?” They all kind of look at one another. What does he mean? “I’m sayin’, y’all got some Jet Skis or something?” I say. “Like, what’s around here? What we gettin’ into?” “Look around, man,” Scoty called from the water, “we reconnectin’ and limin’.” What the fuck is “reconnectin’ ” and “limin’ ”?

- Roscoe and his mango had been watching the whole exchange. I went back inside, lay down on the couch, closed my eyes for another thirty minutes. These jokas are really about to sit around and do nothing, all day. I was dying. There was no service on my phone, so no texts or calls. We were an hour from land, and ninety minutes from an airport. I was trapped; I felt like a caged animal. I was getting . . . angry. How dare they waste my valuable time like this? I stand up and head back out on deck. They’re still in the same spots, just floatin’ and yappin’. I couldn’t understand what they were doing. I was jittery, I was pacing, checking the time on my phone. And then I caught myself: I noticed the turbulence of my thoughts and feelings, which stood in stark contradistinction to my surroundings, and I thought, Oh shit, this is crackhead behavior. I could not sit still. My mind was agitated—I needed an activity, a target, a mission, an adventure. Something, anything, to do. I caught eyes with Roscoe, peeking over the curvature of yet another mango—this one’s bigger than his head. He was just looking at me sweetly, as if to say, “You know you look crazy, right?” It all slowly drifted into focus: Am I an addict? I don’t do drugs, I don’t really drink, I’m not hooked on sex like some ghetto hyena. But I did not know how to stop, or be still, or be quiet, or alone. I’m addicted to the approval of others, and to secure their approval, I became addicted to winning.

- of massive victories, I became addicted to working, to grinding, and obsessively pursuing perfection. But there was a deeper issue at play. I saw downtime as the enemy, a place where you lose things. When I had left space between Melanie and me, she had cheated. Daddio saw the space between tasks at the shop as laziness. Darrell never wanted me to sit down in the gym—he saw downtime as the crack where the pleasure principle would poison all our hard work. I never wanted Jeff to put interludes on our albums because I saw the lull between tracks as the empty space for the audience to stop listening. I didn’t want to leave space between my TV show, the next movie, and my next record, because I didn’t want to give people an opportunity to fall in love with The Rock during my absence. But the most perturbing aspect of my need to fill every second was that it kept me from having to feel. My mind drifted to my I Am Legend phone call with JL. The film had broken global box office records, but still I was dissatisfied. The subtle sickness was becoming a whole lot less subtle. I asked myself, How much did I Am Legend need to make for me to be happy? How much would have been enough?

I started to recognize the game, the trick, the insanity, the carrot on the stick. I had never liked vampire movies, but I suddenly understood their mythology—they are a metaphor for insatiable human hunger, unquenchable thirsts, and chronic dissatisfaction—the attempt to fill a spiritual hole with external things. If unparalleled winning and achieving everything I’ve ever dreamed of does not secure perfect happiness and ultimate bliss, then what does? I looked at Roscoe. As far as he was concerned, the key to life was mango. •   •   • Come on in! The water warm!” Lulu shouted. “I don’t know how to swim,” I said.

I remember being at the Grand Canyon and Mom-Mom saying, “This entire canyon was created by water.” That was a terrifying proposition to me. The ocean and water—we just didn’t vibe. One of my most traumatic childhood memories was of nearly drowning in a public swimming pool. I can still see myself underwater, disoriented—I couldn’t figure out which way was up. I’m choking and I know I’m dying. Mom-Mom leaps from her deck chair and dives into the pool. I can see her hand coming toward my face. She grabs me under my arms and lifts me out of the pool onto the side. Years later, as I recount to one of Mom-Mom’s friends my harrowing brush with death, Mom-Mom’s face contorts into confusion. She’s trying to read me.

And then it hits me: If I was under the water, disoriented, how did I see Mom-Mom jump into the pool? Then my cinematic experience kicks in: I realize that the angles of my visual recollection are not from my point of view. In my mind’s eye, I’m seeing the incident as if I were on the side of the pool. The two-shot of me and Mom-Mom in my mind is impossible—this is a false memory.

- over time. Sometimes you add colors to a memory that weren’t there a year ago, or five years ago, or even collapse multiple memories and paint them into one. The problem is that most of us trust our memories implicitly. Our memories are the basis for our perception of reality. We then commit to these conclusions, unlocking the requisite emotions and the corresponding actions and behaviors. We move into the world clinging to our flawed assumptions, unleashing upon ourselves the cosmic consequences of wrong ideas. I trust the memory that I nearly drowned—in fact, I’m fully committed to the truth of that story. Water is dangerous, and it tried to kill me when I was little. So, when my brother and sisters are playing in the ocean, I’m by myself halfway up the beach. As an adult, I don’t let my kids go in the ocean by themselves.

I take a deep breath, and I sit. The sea is almost translucent, and as warm as bathwater. The waves are knocking and jolting and tossing me around. “Don’t fight it, man,” Scoty says. “It’s a flow. It’ll carry yuh out, but it’ll bring you back.” Scoty is calmly floating in complete harmony with the rhythm of the sea, and I’m bangin’ around like a monkey fuckin’ a football. And while I never got fully comfortable, I began to understand the human relationship with the ocean. Reconnectin’ and limin’. The ebb and flow of the tide is the heartbeat of the planet.

- in conflict with the truth of what I was actually thinking and feeling. But Uncle Fluffy did some beautiful things. He built Her Lake. He let Willow stop whipping her hair when she was done. He begged Jeff and JL to move to LA. He doubled Sheree’s child support when Trey moved in with Will. He auditioned at Quincy Jones’s house when Will was too scared and he wanted to leave. Uncle Fluffy was swayed by his admiration for Muhammad Ali to make a movie that Will was too afraid to make. “Uncle Fluffy has been a wonderful friend,” Michaela said. “He just needs to work for you, not the other way around.” Uncle Fluffy was created based on a lie, designed on the false premise that something was wrong with me, that I was a coward. His job was to perpetually apologize for my shortcomings and guarantee that I was always safe and loved. And even as the awareness dawned that perhaps he had outlived his usefulness, the fact still remained: Uncle Fluffy paid the bills. •   •   • Fluffy was further complicated by his shadow counterpart, whom… ([Location 6205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6205))

Basically, when I had suppressed my real needs so thoroughly for so long, and still didn’t get the adoration and approval I’d sought, my anguish would express itself as the General. Because Uncle Fluffy is masking my true feelings (which I’m not even in touch with), when the General shows up, people are shocked and confused. It was sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, and then sour, sour, sourness. “These personas weave a universe in which you are trapped,” Michaela said, “a spiderweb of demands, obligations, and expectations.

But its falsity was so obvious it opened me up to reevaluating and reexamining all of my assumptions. If 99 percent is not the same as zero, what is 72 percent, or 23 percent, or 84.69 percent? Hell, what’s zero? Rather than seeing every situation as binary, all of a sudden, the possibilities became infinite.

If you can understand her, you’ll understand us all. The ocean holds all the chaotic glory of Mother Nature, and no amount of power or intellect will ever be able to control or manipulate her. She doesn’t care how you’re feeling, or how you want her to be. All of the things that happen in a woman’s psyche and body are analogous to the ocean. The beauty, the storms, the nourishment, the danger, the moods and weather patterns, birth and death. The Big She will not be conquered or subdued; your only hope to truly enjoy her is to love her, respect her, and surrender. “I really like this for you because you will be forced to have a beginner’s mind.

- I had never heard of it before. I’ve never smoked weed, never done cocaine or taken any pills, and other than a vodka and cranberry once in a while, I will pass a piss test at the Tour de France. So when my friend Veronica suggested it, I laughed politely, and said, “Thank you, but no thank you. I don’t mess with drugs.” “Neither do I,” she said. “Ayahuasca is not drugs. It’s medicine.” I’ve known Veronica for years. We never had sex, but we argued like we did. We disagreed about everything; I was incensed by her pessimism, and she, in turn, scorned my optimism. It never dawned on either of us to just talk to other people. I guess we kinda used each other to crash-test our theories about life. We knew the other would never easily agree, so when an idea got past, we knew it was a keeper. But something was new. Her eyes were different, her energy was nonresistant, flexible. She’d had a rough childhood, which I’m sure contributed to her combative disposition. But now, she was calm, stable—there was an undeniable joy about her. She was filled with fresh insight and the passion of someone who’d been somewhere extraordinary and had been utterly transformed. I found myself hanging on her every word. She embodied a new wisdom. Her heart had always felt closed and impenetrable, but now she was open, warm, reachable. In the past, I’d always felt like her parent trying to wrestle a hardheaded child into reality. Today, I felt like Matt Damon listening to Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting. I was riveted. I was intrigued. I was curious. “Well, whatever you did, I wanna do that,” I said. Veronica laughed the laugh of the initiated to the uninitiated. She paused, and then began to try to explain the inexplicable. “Ayahuasca changed my life,” she said. “So how does it work?” “Well, it’s a ceremony that goes from sunset to sunrise. It traditionally takes place in the jungles of South America—mostly Peru, now. But wherever you do it, it’s led by a shaman. It begins with drinking the most disgusting tea you can possibly imagine. After about an hour it kicks in and then . . .” She shakes her head and shivers, like she’s seen things she’ll never be able to unsee. “And then . . . what?” I said. “Well, it traps you with your mind.” “That doesn’t sound fun at all,” I said. “Any issues you may be struggling with, the medicine goes right to them,” she said, “and brings them to the surface, making you look at them, experience them, and ultimately heal them. I never told you this before, but when I was a teenager, I had an abortion. It was the most devastating choice I ever made. I’ve been haunted and crippled—I’ve done therapy for decades but have never been able to shake the shame. ([Location 6323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6323))

- “In my ayahuasca ceremony, I met my child. He was in heaven. He was so happy, so sweet, so beautiful. I wailed and purged for hours. He forgave me—he even asked me to name him. I named him Zion. And in one night, I got free from a lifetime of guilt.” I could sense her yearning to share the fruits of her journey, but there was a hesitation. “It’s fucking brutal,” she said. “It ultimately ends in revelation and healing, but the bus trip winds through the darkest parts of your mind. It’s rough, but it’ll help you find what you’re looking for.” •   •   • Ayahuasca is a “sacred brew.” It has been used for millennia by the indigenous tribes of the Amazonian jungle during spiritual ceremonies and shamanic rituals. It’s a kind of tea made from the bark and stems of a tropical South American vine, sometimes mixed with other psychotropic plants. The name comes from the Quechua language, where aya means “soul” and huasca (wasca) is “vine” (translation: “vine of the soul”). Ayahuasca contains a mind-altering compound called dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and is considered a sacred medicine, employed by serious spiritual seekers, not for recreational use. Ayahuasca’s healing properties are currently being used in the treatment of PTSD, drug addiction, depression, and anxiety, among many other physical and ([Location 6347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6347))

I struggled with the decision of whether to even share my journey with ayahuasca in this book—the only reason I’m writing about it here is because it’s the truth of my experience.) •   •   • The room was dark. A small cabin—one room and a bathroom. Ancient Peruvian tribal chants and sacred melodies drone ethereally from a small speaker in the corner. Images of deities cover the walls. Handmade instruments are strewn around a wooden altar. Blankets, cushions, mats, pillows, cover the floor. The shaman lives here. Her name is Beata; mid-forties. She reminds me of Meryl Streep (if Meryl had moved to Peru on her twenty-first birthday to study botany and spiritual healing). She hands me a bucket and a small clay cup. The smell of the ayahuasca preempts my inquiry about the bucket. Beata takes her seat in front of the altar.

- p.m. Arrive at seven thirty, in loose-fitting clothes, and ceremony at eight. But it seemed like she needed to be talking more. This feels too big for her to be just setting shit up casually. Hey, lady, I’m a little shook over here. “I don’t really know much about ayahuasca,” I said. “I did some personal research, but is there an orientation of the process or procedure . . . ?” Beata smiled the smile of the initiated to the uninitiated. “No,” she said sweetly. To put it mildly, that answer left me somewhat unsatisfied. “I just wanna be clear about how . . . and what I’m supposed to expect,” I stumbled. “The vine will lead you,” Beata said reassuringly. “Just surrender. Let yourself be guided. I’m only here to help you navigate the journey.” “I get that,” I said, totally not getting it. “So, what’s my next thing?”… ([Location 6369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6369))

- At an hour, the novelty of waiting had worn off—I figured I was immune. It was 9:00 p.m., and I realized I had agreed to do this stupid shit till sunrise. My little mat on the floor was comfortable, so I said fuck it, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I was floating deep in outer space. As I regained my bearings, I realized that I was trillions of light-years away from earth. I was so far away that I knew I would never see anything, or anyone I loved, ever again. This is where I would be for eternity. As I digest the magnitude of my predicament, I begin to glide through the infinity of stars. I notice that they are not stars, as we know them. It is as if Picasso had painted outer space. Colors and cubes and angles—I am suddenly overwhelmed by the majesty of my surroundings. This is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been in my life. As I am distracted in awe, I can sense a presence behind me. It’s a woman. I turn to see her, but she is unseeable. I can feel the warmth of her energy, close behind me, as close as she could be without touching. She’s happy I’m here, and I can tell she will never leave me. Somehow, I know she’s been waiting for me. Her voice centers directly behind my right ear as if her lips were only millimeters away. I turn again, craving just a glimpse of this beatific goddess, but as I move, she moves—I can tell I’m not meant to see her. But I’m OK with that, because every second with her quenches my lifelong thirsts. ([Location 6382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6382))

- She is everything: lover, teacher, mother, protector, guide. She is all I’ve ever dreamed of, and everything I’ve ever wanted. I can tell she knows everything I need to know and how to get everywhere I want to go. She is my goal, my solution, my answer. She is the top of the mountain, and the sky beyond. “Where are we?” I say to her softly. “What do you mean, silly?” she says, in a tone that melts away everything but bliss. “This place is beautiful!” I say. “This is not a place, silly.” She kept endearingly calling me silly. “I’ve never seen anywhere more beautiful than this,” I said. She laughs. “Why does that make you laugh?” I ask. “This is you, silly!” she said. “Huh? What do you mean?” “This is not a place, this is you.” My heart begins to race as I look around, bearing witness to the grandeur of this infinite paradise. “Wait a minute,” I say. “All of this is me?” “Yes, silly.” “I’m this beautiful?” “Of course you are,” she says. Her words unlock the emotional floodgates within me.

If I’m this beautiful, I don’t need hit records to feel worthy of love. If I’m this beautiful, I don’t need Jada or anybody else to validate me. If I’m this beautiful, and I have this internal sanctuary I can always return to, then I don’t need anyone to approve of me. I approve of me. I am enough.” This was my first tiny taste of freedom. An invisible yoke had been lifted from my neck. All of my needing and grasping and clinging and lusting and demanding and maneuvering and reaching and craving—all of the insatiable desires that had kept me on my hamster wheel of misery were falling away. I no longer needed to chase the proverbial carrot on the stick. I wasn’t starving anymore. In my fifty-plus years on this planet, this is the unparalleled greatest feeling I’ve ever had. •   •   • In the following two years, I did… ([Location 6406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6406))

- In my second ceremony, Mother repeated, for what felt like five hours straight, “Stop talking.” She said it so many times I wanted to bang my head on the floor. She was referring to the constant inner chatter that runs incessantly in my head—planning, strategizing, debating, assessing, critiquing, self-judging, questioning, doubting. She pummeled me with the phrase, thousands of times: “Stop talking.” And at some point, just before sunrise, I noticed it: silence. My inner roommates had stopped talking. It was euphoric. Mother let me bathe in the peace of my inner quietude for about forty minutes. Then, without words she conveyed why I needed to stop talking: In essence, she told me I should be still, and I should be quiet, in order to better observe and understand the people and circumstances around me. She had watched me batter myself for so many years trying to impose my Will on the world. Her point was, if I stopped talking and thinking so much, I could see and sense the universal tides and I could align my energies to them and achieve twice as much with half as much effort.

- have the sense that you are going to be OK without them. This can create horrific and painful final days. In order for our loved one to let go and die peacefully, they need to be explicitly reassured that we’re going to be OK after they are gone, that they did a great job with their life, and that we can handle it from here. Similarly, Rinpoche states, “A dying person most needs to be shown as unconditional a love as possible, released from all expectations.” These concepts crystalized the mission in my mind. I was going to put aside all of my agendas, traumas, questions, and direct my full energies toward the most compassionate and merciful transition that I could tender. Around week three, I arrived; standard head kiss. I took my seat on the floor. Chris Cuomo was muted today. Daddio’s ability to eat was deteriorating. He had macaroni and cheese, braised beef, and broccoli, untouched in front of him. If Daddio isn’t eating his mac and cheese, he must really not be feeling well. “Hey, Dad,” I said nervously. “You did good.” “What you mean?” he asked. “With your life.” I don’t think he was expecting to hear that. He took a pull of his Tareyton 100, turned his eyes back to the TV. He didn’t seem like he was ready to go there just yet. But I was. “I’m sayin’ you did great with your life.

- Daddio had been given six weeks, and he ended up living for three months. I remember on week nine I made my trip to see him. Our meetings had been joyful and poignant, but today he is in an uncharacteristically despondent mood. Shirt off; Tareyton 100 in hand; hunched over his brown wooden folding tray; food untouched. Standard bald-head kiss. “Daddio, what’s goin’ on?” He puts his cigarette down, pensively gazed out at the Ben Franklin Bridge arcing over the Schuylkill River. “Man,” Daddio said, “you tell motherfuckas you gon’ be dead in six weeks, and nine weeks later you still hangin’ around. This shit is embarrassing.” This was probably the second biggest laugh Daddio and I ever shared. •   •   • CUT!” About ten days later, I was on the set of Bright, a Netflix fantasy-action cop film directed by David Ayer.

David Ayer approaches the window. “Bro, you need to call your father immediately,” he says softly. “It’s an emergency.” Even when you’re expecting these phone calls, it doesn’t make it less jarring. My heart was racing. I dialed Daddio’s cell. He answered. “Hey, man.” “Hey, Daddio, what’s up?” “I think it’s tonight,” he said. His words hit me like a thousand volts. “OK,” I said calmly. The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying had stressed the importance of making a calm space for the transition of loved ones. “Do you want to FaceTime?” I asked. “Yeah. But shit, I don’t know how to do that . . .” “I got you—I’ll FaceTime you,” I said. “You just have to answer.” “Ellen, come do this FaceTime thing, Will about to call . . . ,” he yelled to my sister who had just arrived. My cousin Ricky, a Philadelphia fireman who had been caring for Daddio, is holding the phone. It’s 2:00 a.m. in an empty downtown LA parking lot. I stand under the brightest streetlight I can find. I want him to be able to see me. We simply look at each other. Twenty minutes of silence. ([Location 6508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B096LPZXCH&location=6508))

He slowly shakes his head, a final surrender. “Shit, anything I ain’t told this muthafucka already, he sure ain’t gonna get it from me tonight.” We shared a final laugh, we said goodbye, and forty-five minutes later, Daddio was gone.

- succeed my way to love and happiness. Eight consecutive number one hit movies, thirty million records, four Grammys, and hundreds of millions of dollars makes you happy, right? Makes people love you, right? The fundamental flaw of this theory is the belief that “the Smile” comes from outside, that it is acquired or achieved from external sources or conditions. That someone will love you so much, they will adore you so deeply and thoroughly, that they will fill you with the bliss of “the Smile.” Spoiler alert: There are no relationships, careers, or houses with a name that can fill the hole. There is nothing that you can receive from the material world that will create inner peace or fulfilment. The truth is, “the Smile” is generated through output. It’s not something you get, it’s something you cultivate through giving. In the end, it will not matter one single bit how well they loved you—you will only gain “the Smile” based on how well you loved them. The physics of love and happiness are counterintuitive. As long as we are stuck in the need to receive—in the cycle of grasping and clinging and demanding that people and the world around us meet our needs—we will be locked into disappointment, anger, and misery. The sweet paradox is being fulfilled by giving, that your output precipitates the input—giving and receiving become simultaneous. To love and to be loved is the highest human reward and ecstasy.

- to serve and unleash the best within others is the most intense of human pleasures. When I say “love,” I mean discovering, cultivating, and sharing your unique gifts for the purpose of uplifting and empowering your loved ones. “The Smile” is a combination of the recognition of the unique treasure within yourself and the realization that the treasure is multiplied through giving it away. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is having a hard time. Life can be brutal, chaotic, confusing, and excruciating. Our hearts are starving. Loving, giving, helping, serving, protecting, nourishing, empowering, and forgiving are the secrets of “the Smile.” Can you imagine what it would feel like if someone loved you, gave you all you needed, helped you, served you, protected you, nourished you, empowered you, and forgave you? For many of us, the answer to that question is no. But what Gigi knew, and what Nelson Mandela knew, what Muhammad Ali knew—and what Daddio knew in his final moments—is that you must give it to receive it. Daddio had poured all of his gifts into me.

- Births, weddings, and funerals have a way of sifting the gold out of the dirt and the rocks. Daddio’s death served as a wake-up call for me. As Jada and I sat at his funeral, I became chillingly aware of the fact that one day, one of us would be saying goodbye to the other, and I questioned: What did I want our ending to be? Our time apart had helped us both to discover the power of loving in freedom. We are simultaneously one hundred percent bound together, and one hundred percent free. We agreed that we were both imperfect people, doing our best to figure out how to be in this world joyfully. What we needed from each other was unconditional love and support—not judgment, not punishment, but total, unbending devotion to each other’s growth and well-being. We came to see our marriage as a spiritual discipline—what Bhakti Tirtha Swami called the ultimate “school of love.” This relationship is our classroom—we are learning to cultivate care, concern, and compassion in the most intimate and difficult of circumstances.
