## Highlights
- In the process I discovered that successful stock market investing is not about being right per se – far from it. Success in investing is down to how great ideas are executed. I have come to understand that if successful property investing is all about ‘location, location, location’, success in equity investing is all about ‘execution, execution, execution’.

- Likewise, legendary billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II – a man who made his fortune from investing – is reported to have said that “the reason for all the Wall Street success stories he knew was down to: money management, money management, money management”.2 And George Soros – a similar self-made billionaire trader – once pointed out that: ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=112))

- My findings show that the key to successfully executing great ideas and making lots of money comes down to the actions you take after you have invested in an idea and find yourself losing or winning. For that reason, I have split this book into those two scenarios. Part I is called ‘I’m Losing – What Should I Do?’ The chapters in this part deal with being in a situation where you have invested in a great idea and now find yourself losing money.

- Part II is called ‘I’m Winning – What Should I Do?’ and, unsurprisingly, deals with being in the situation of having invested in a great idea and finding yourself sitting on a paper profit. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=137))

- It is important to note that the only reason the shares were sold was because I was putting pressure on the investor to either buy more or to sell. The investor did not want to do anything but could not justify why. If I had not intervened, I am pretty sure he would still be holding the stock today.

- The Rabbits often dug tunnels that were so deep, they never saw the light of day again. Why did they make this mistake so many times? “The future may be made up of many factors but where it truly lies is in the hearts and minds of men.” – Li Ka Shing I’ve used a slightly jokey name for this investing tribe, but the fact is their flaws were very human. I went over all their investments, and it broke down into ten key factors – a range of biases and influences to which every investor is more or less prone, but which the Rabbits failed to control or circumvent through better habits. By giving in to these factors, they too often ended up caught in the ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=224))

- investors I know are, deep down, the same. Whenever a Rabbit defended a losing investment it reminded me of Warren Buffett’s famous saying: “forecasts tell you little about the future but a lot about the forecaster.” The Rabbits all carried false passports – they actually originated from that fictitious country that Nassim Taleb calls Extremistan. They were never going to accept their views were wrong. The fact is, the greatest minds on the planet can be wrong. My findings suggest you should expect to be wrong at least half of the time. The very best investment minds are! ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=317))

- Investing is all about probabilities. Whether you invest should depend on the odds and the edge you think you have. Given the odds and your edge you should know exactly what you are going to do if the stock you are investing in falls or rises by 20%, 50% and so on. When faced with a painful loss-making position, most people do nothing. They turn into a Rabbit and procrastinate, letting all their biases play havoc with their decision-making, hoping time will resolve their issues so they don’t have to. The best way round this is to draw up a plan of precisely what actions you will take when your investments ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=375))

- The only solution to a losing situation is to sell out or significantly increase your stake. You have to materially adapt if you hope to survive and prosper. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=387))

- “If I had a blank piece of paper and were looking to invest today, would I buy into that stock given what I now know?” If your answer to the question above is “No”, or “Maybe, but…” then you should sell. If you conclude that you would not buy the shares today but find that you cannot push the sell button, be aware that this is because of endowment bias and not a logical investment thesis. Sell. Legendary investor Peter Lynch adopted a similar approach: “[E]very few months I checked the story just as if I were hearing it for the first time … [and I would] get out of situations where the fundamentals are worse and the price had increased … and into situations where the fundamentals are better but the price is down … a price stop is any opportunity to load up on bargains from among your worst performers … if you can’t convince yourself when I’m down ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=393))

- 25% I’m a buyer then you’ll never make a decent profit in stocks.”9 Doing nothing when you are losing is never an option because if the stock price rises from here you should have put more money to work. If it falls further you should have cut your position. The Rabbits weren’t terrible investors just because they refused to accept they were wrong. The real giveaway was that they refused to do anything when they found themselves in a losing situation. DATA POINT: Losers stay losers because they fail to materially adapt Out of 941 investments that lost money, when measured from the moment the investor bought the stock to the moment they sold, only 32 (3%) made money thanks to the trading activity of the managers whilst they were invested (by trading activity I mean buying shares in that company after the initial purchase and before the final sale). It is important to realise that many of these losing investments could have been profitable had the investor materially adapted having concluded they were sticking with that investment.

- 3. Don’t go all in A corollary of the previous point is to never put yourself in a position where you find you are still convinced by your original investment idea but are not able to invest more money when the share price falls. That is poor money management. Keep some powder dry. This also helps neutralise the denomination type of effect – of feeling an investment is too big to be changed. “In my own portfolios at Pabrai Funds, I adjust for this [getting the odds wrong] by simply… ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=418))

- 4. Don’t be hasty to jump in, do be hasty to jump out We should all remember the following wise words: “It is easier to get into something than to get out of it.”11 Ned Davis in his book Being Right or Making Money, using the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1929 to 1998, showed that the bulk of investors’ losses in bear markets come in the final third of the fall.12 This suggests that cutting your losers early is difficult – but makes a lot of sense. Not least because selling out of a stock helps clear your head and enables you to assess a situation more objectively. It’s like taking a decongestion pill when suffering from a cold. And buying slowly over time (known as dollar or… ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=429))

- “[W]hat separates the winners from the losers? The answer is simple – the winners make small mistakes while the losers make big mistakes.”13 5. Remember there is a difference between ‘being right’ and ‘making money’ Even if you are convinced you are right, remember the saying, “There is nothing like an idea whose time has come.” In investing, a lot of success can be attributed to being in the right place at the right time – otherwise known as luck. A classic example of this is Laker Airways, which was founded in 1966 by Sir Freddie Laker. In 1977 this firm introduced the world’s first budget airline and operated low-cost flights between London Gatwick Airport and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Due to a combination of recession, high oil prices, changes in currency and simply being ahead of its time, it went bankrupt in 1982.… ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=440))

- want to be told they are wrong. They want reassurance – the same way people sometimes visit a doctor to be told everything is fine. What you should really do is to speak to someone with an opposing view. Ideally you should also sell out of the stock while you do that, so that you have removed the emotional attachment of a vested interest. This mitigates endowment bias and you can always buy the stock back later. If you would not put money to work in a particular share today, knowing what you now know, then you have to concede that the investment is dead – and if you haven’t already sold, you absolutely should now. 7.

Many of them had MBAs, CFAs and other letters after their name that suggested they had an analytical advantage over the rest of the market.

- will be. Second, ‘knowing more’ often leads to a person not seeing the wood for the trees. Throughout history there have been many examples that demonstrate this. My favourites are Harry Warner, of Warner Bros., who in 1927 said, “Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?”, and Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, who in 1943 said, “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” Experts are surprisingly bad at forecasting. Falling for your own hype can also often lead to mistakes that the least intelligent person in the world would not be capable of. Warren Buffett, when talking about the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, marvelled at “10 or 15 guys with an average IQ of maybe 170 getting themselves into a position where they can lose all their money”.14 And crowds are often surprisingly wise – the market can be right even when everyone who makes it up is individually… ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=462))

- What is more surprising is that despite the guesses varying massively from one student to the next, the average number taken from all those wrong numbers was only 2.5% off the actual number of 850. Only one student guessed a number closer to the actual number than the average. Michael Mauboussin repeated this experiment in 2007 with 73 of his Columbia Business School students and his findings corroborated Treynor’s.15 While the actual number of jelly beans in the jar was 1,116 and the guesses ranged from 250 to 4,100, the average guess from all these ‘wrong’ guesses was 1,151. That’s just 3% off the mark and only two students gave guesses that were closer to the real number of beans than the average of all the wrong guesses. Remember this the next time you pound the table shouting, “I am right and the market is wrong.” My findings show that, on average, only 49% of great ideas… ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=472))

- Reflexivity: Why the future is never certain George Soros’s reflexivity theory suggests that markets cannot possibly discount the future correctly because they do not merely discount the future; they also help to shape it. Reflexivity is, in effect, a two-way feedback mechanism in which reality helps shape the participants’ thinking and the participants’ thinking helps shape reality in an unending process.

- One of the reasons that the Rabbits held on to losing investments was fear of the unknown: if they sold out, the shares might rally, and they would miss out. It was better to stick with a current loss than worry about that double-whammy. This is known as ambiguity aversion, and describes why people prefer to stick with intolerable situations merely because a hypothetical alternative might be worse. Better the devil you know. When it comes to losing investments, the facts basically never justify this, and the Rabbits should have used this to fortify themselves against inaction.

- To make money you need to have money. In other words, to maximise profits you have to minimise losses. You must preserve your capital. When you are losing you have to materially adapt to mitigate the situation, as you will see when we come to the Assassins and the Hunters. Permanent impairment of capital destroys wealth.

- Stock market returns over time show kurtosis, which means fat tails are larger than would be expected from a normal distribution curve.44 This means that a few big winners and losers distort the overall market return – and an investor’s return. If you are not invested in those big winners your returns are drastically reduced.45 ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=1421))

- Raiders are often Rabbits when they’re losing – and the combination is fatal. If you combine the urge to sell winners too soon with the reluctance to sell losers, the net result is losing a lot more than you win: you have effectively got an investment style that combines significant downside risk with insignificant upside potential. As Peter Lynch put it: “Some people automatically sell the winners and hold on to their losers … which is about as sensible as pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds.”47 ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=1430))

- I also believe that a key reason it was easier for him to stick with a winning short was that, as it got more profitable, his weight in that stock reduced. The net result being less and less capital was at risk as the short worked. It’s clear that what affected him most profoundly is upside and downside risk. In shorting, the upside is capped at 100% (a stock cannot fall lower than 0) but the downside is potentially infinite (a stock can keep on rising and rising). In investing, the downside is capped at 100% but the upside is potentially infinite. The former scenario encouraged him to be ruthless with losses and greedy with winners. The latter encouraged ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=1532))

- that over-diversification is another thing to blame for poor performance by professional investors. “The poor overall performance of mutual fund managers in the past is not due to a lack of stock-picking ability, but rather to institutional factors that encourage them to over diversify, i.e. pick more stocks than their best alpha-generating ideas.” Phrased differently: “the organization of the money management industry appears to make it optimal for managers to introduce stocks into their portfolios that are not outperformers … [in other words] managers attempt to maximise profits by maximizing assets under management … while investors benefit from concentration … managers under most commonly-used fee structures are better off with a more diversified portfolio.”56 ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=1754))

However, if someone yells fire in a theatre with very few people, the people can get up, look for signs of fire, and walk out in an orderly manner. This is another reason that the Connoisseurs’ approach of taking some profit over the years is a good idea. It’s like inching towards the fire exit.

- I realise that some readers might be disappointed that the winning habits I have uncovered are too simple, too basic – nothing new. No doubt some readers will feel I am oversimplifying things, and that to become a good executor of ideas is an art that takes decades to master. The truth is often disappointing when you discover it. Successful investors want you to think that success in investing is beyond the abilities of the average person. They want you to believe that returns are driven by managers and teams possessing special gifts. This is propaganda. Success in investing is open to anyone, whatever their level of education or background, whether old or young, experienced or inexperienced. You simply need to materially adapt when losing and remain faithful when winning. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0153LKGFE&location=1887))
