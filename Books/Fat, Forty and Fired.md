## Highlights
- I’d recently read a book called Manhood, by a chap called Steven Biddulph, that argued every man should be forced to take his fortieth year off. His theory was that the vast majority of men don’t have a life – they pretend to have one. In reality they are lonely, emotionally timid, and miserably, compulsively competitive. One of the main reasons they never get out of this tragic state is that they are ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=138))

- enslaved by soulless jobs and careers that lead them to put their lives on hold until retirement. Of course, when this arrives it is too late. While they work they are too busy to think and therefore they have empty lives where they never develop a rich and sustaining inner life. As Biddulph himself puts it, ‘Our marriages fail, our kids hate us, we die of stress and on the way we destroy the world.’ I wasn’t sure if it was the effects of ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=141))

- Apparently most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in ten. I don’t know about the ten-year bit, but I can testify to suffering from chronic self-delusion in the twelve-months part. My list started with the usual weight-loss and ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=240))

- fitness goals. After a couple of beers I’d added learning to speak Russian and drawing regularly. A couple more and I was educating the kids at home and running for mayor. By the time I had finished the sixpack I’d moved on to world peace and a cure for cancer. I only realised I was in la-la land when ‘winning Wimbledon for Britain’ appeared on the list. After all, there are some things that are never going to happen. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=242))

- There are no guarantees in life. Fear of the uncertain can, and does, hold millions back from pursuing their dreams. I’m not saying I wasn’t scared – I was – just that I didn’t want the fear to stop me. I determined I was going to look back at the end of my life and know that at least I had tried a different path – however disastrously it turned out.

I had spent all my time either agonising about whether to leave the workplace or constructing entirely unrealistic blue-sky dreams about all the earth-shattering achievements I would rattle off once I’d left the world of office work behind. No time at all had gone into thinking how we were going to live day to day. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=496))

The issue is totally within each individual’s control. It isn’t that people don’t know what to do, it’s just that they are, by and large, incapable of doing it. The whole weight-loss industry was focused in the wrong direction. New methods of eating differently weren’t what was required.

Basically, in an increasingly spoilt and soft society, people had lost the ability to delay gratification for any prolonged period of time. The moment they felt hungry, or sad, or in a need of a reward or whatever, their willpower crumbled and they behaved in a way they knew was contradictory to ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005XBUALK&location=681))

It was called Tomorrow I’ll be Different and it was written by a man called Beauchamp Colclough.

Not ‘get uproariously pissed with your mates and hotwire a car’ pissed but ‘come back from work every night and grimly drink six beers’ pissed. I was constantly struggling with my drinking and once again made the monumental (to me anyway) decision to give up for a month – from 11 October 2002. Again this was precisely what I did.
