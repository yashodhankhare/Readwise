- The most illuminating response to The Halo Effect came from India, where I was contacted by ICICI Bank, the county’s largest private bank. ICICI Bank had grown tremendously over the previous decade, leading to many complimentary articles in the business press. Journalists in India, like their cousins the world over, were quick to lavish praise. A few of the bank’s executives had the good sense to be concerned. As one of them explained to me: “We don’t mind if others put a halo on us, but we never want to be fooled by our success. We need to understand what drives our success, and strive to do better.” ICICI’s leaders wanted to focus on the real drivers of performance for a financial institution ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=158))

- and not merely infer that they were doing well at execution or customer service just because the overall results were strong. They didn’t want to be taken in by the Halo of their own success. The story doesn’t end there. In 2009, after the banking industry suffered a sharp downturn, the largest Indian banks—including ICICI Bank—came in for criticism. As company executives widely understood, it had been important not to be taken in by excessive praise during good times, and now it was equally vital not to take criticism to heart when times were bad. For all the tumult and anguish in capital markets, and for all the fickle responses by investors, ICICI Bank’s ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=163))

- fundamental business model remained sound. Once again, observers were quick to make extreme attributions based on current performance, whether favorable or unfavorable. As Warren Buffett observed about investors, there’s a tendency to overshoot in both directions, on the high side and also on the low side. I was impressed by the clear thinking of executives at ICICI Bank, and I have been equally gratified by the attitudes of managers in many other companies. I admire their desire to understand the real drivers of performance, rather than be fooled by a mirage. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=168))

- If you select companies on the basis of outcomes—whether success or failure—and then gather data that are biased by those outcomes, you’ll never know what drives performance.

- inferences based on overall impressions. The way they do so seems entirely logical. It makes for a coherent story and helps us make sense of the world around us. When we allow an overall impression to color our thinking, however, we’re on a slippery slope. Criminal behavior isn’t necessary for us to fall for the Halo Effect. As soon as we pick our examples based on outcomes, and then make inferences based on those overall results, we’re asking for trouble.

- More recently, cognitive psychologists have identified biases that affect the way individuals make decisions under uncertainty. This book is about a different set of delusions, the ones that distort our understanding of company performance, that make it difficult to know why one company succeeds and another fails. These errors of thinking pervade much that we read about business, whether in leading magazines or scholarly journals or management bestsellers. They cloud our ability to think clearly and critically about the nature of success in business. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=228))

I want you to challenge what I write rather than accept it. One of my role models here is the late Herbert Simon, father of artificial intelligence, Nobel Prize winner in economics for his work on decision making, and professor at Carnegie Mellon University from the late 1940s until his death in 2001.

- described how his service on several foreign fact-finding missions in the 1960s, often time-consuming and very costly, led him to formulate his Travel Theorem, which goes like this: Anything that can be learned by a normal American adult on a trip to a foreign country (of less than one year’s duration) can be learned more quickly, cheaply, and easily by visiting the San Diego Public Library. The response? Simon wrote: “People react almost violently to my Travel Theorem. I try to explain that it has nothing to do with the pleasures of travel, but only with the efficiency of travel for learning. They don’t seem to hear my explanation; they remain ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=253))

It takes a long time to calm their passion with reason—and usually it isn’t extinguished, but temporarily subdued. Why, they think, argue with a madman?” Well, I think the Travel Theorem is wonderful—not because I agree with it, but because it makes me think. It forces me to ask: What is the real purpose of this trip? Is it for enjoyment or for learning? If the latter, exactly what am I trying to learn, and what’s the best way to learn it?

- available sources rather than running off to the ends of the earth? Disagree with Simon’s Travel Theorem if you wish, but that’s not the point.

- disastrous holiday season, Lego, the Danish toy company, fired its chief operating officer. No one doubted that Poul Plougmann had to go. Miserable Christmas sales were the last straw at the end of a terrible year—Lego’s revenues were down by 25 percent, and the company lost $230 million for the year, the worst in its history. What went so badly wrong? Chief executive Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the founder, explained it simply: Lego had “strayed too far from its roots and relied too heavily on merchandising spin-offs, such as Harry Potter figures, which proved unpopular this season despite the continuing success of J. K. Rowling’s books.” The solution? Lego announced that it would “return to ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=292))

- The main explanation for Lego’s losses? Lego had strayed from its core. It lost sight of its roots. That’s what Lego’s chief executive said, and that’s what the media reported, including the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, Nordic Business Report, Danish News Digest, Plastics News, and about a dozen others. Depending on the source, Poul Plougmann was variously sacked, fired, axed, ousted, removed, dismissed, replaced, or simply relieved of his duties. But aside from the verb used to describe his departure, not much ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=308))

- differed among the articles. Lego’s big blunder was straying from the core. Consider for a moment the word stray. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines to stray as “to wander beyond established limits,” “to deviate from a course that is regarded as right,” and “to become lost.” A guided missile can stray off course and hit the wrong target. A dog that runs away from home is called a stray. A company can stray, too, if it goes off on a foolish adventure, if it wanders off course, if it gets lost. Apparently that’s what Lego did—it chased merchandising spin-offs when it should have been focusing on its core product line. It strayed. Chris Zook at Bain & Company ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=312))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- argued in his 2001 book, Profit from the Core, that companies often do best when they focus on relatively few products for a clear segment of customers. When companies get into very different products or go after very different sets of customers, the results often aren’t pretty. But here’s the catch: Exactly how do we define a company’s core? Zook identifies no fewer than six dimensions along which a company can reasonably expand its activities—into new geographies, new channels, new customer segments, new value chain steps, new businesses, and new products. Any one of them might be a sensible step into an adjacent area, radiating out from the core and bringing success. It’s also possible that any one of them might be fraught with danger and lead to disaster. So how do we know which path to take? Where does the core end and where does straying off course begin? Of course, it’s easy to know in retrospect—but how can we know in advance? ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=318))

- Unfortunately, nothing in the business world stands still—customer preferences change and technology marches on and new competitors appear. The market for traditional toys stagnated as kids shifted to electronic games at an earlier and earlier age. By the 1990s, simple plastic building blocks were a mature product and, in a world of video games and electronic toys, well, a bit boring. If Lego wanted to grow, or even if it wanted to stay the same size, it would have to try some new things—the question was what. Of all the things Lego might try, what would make the most sense? If Lego decided to expand into, say, financial services, that would be straying from its core. No one would be surprised if the venture flopped—“What’s a toy company doing trying to become a bank? What do they know about banking?”—and the responsible manager would have been removed without a second thought. What if Lego launched a line of children’s clothing? That one’s not so clear—Lego knows a lot about kids, and it understands consumer products. It has plenty of power over retail distribution, just not in clothing, at least not yet. Maybe it could succeed, ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=330))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- maybe not. What about electronic toys? Again, debatable—maybe Lego could build on its experience in toys, and with all the growth in video games, why not? And in fact, Lego had developed Bionicle CD-ROM games and Mindstorm robots made of building blocks controlled by personal computers. But Harry Potter figures? Little toys with little plastic parts that snap together? That should be smack inside Lego’s core. If Harry Potter figures are outside Lego’s core, we ought to ask exactly how broad Lego’s core really is. Because if Lego’s core is nothing but traditional blocks, we’d have to wonder how it could possibly provide sufficient growth opportunities for a company with revenues of $2 billion. In fact, Plougmann had been brought in from Bang & Olufsen, a Danish maker of high-quality audio equipment, in part to go after new opportunities. His hiring was seen as a coup, symptomatic of Lego’s commitment to new avenues of growth after the company posted its first loss ever in 1998. Under his guidance, Lego began to branch out into electronic toys and merchandising spin-offs, and the initial response was good. At the time, no one said Lego was moving outside its core. But when sales fell sharply in 2003, Kristiansen lost patience and pulled the plug on Poul Plougmann. “We have been pursuing a strategy based on growth by focusing on totally ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=338))

- new products. This strategy did not give the expected results.” So in 2004, Lego decided to “return to its core” and “focus on profitability.” Strange, because profitable growth was presumably what Lego had in mind when it went after those new opportunities in the first place. Imagine, if we could turn the clock back to 1999, that Lego had decided to stick to plastic building blocks, nothing more. Nope, we’re not interested in a tie-in to Harry Potter, which was only the most popular children’s book of all time, whose first two movies racked up box office receipts of $1.2 billion worldwide. Next year’s headline? Probably something like this: EXECUTIVE SACKED AS LEGO SALES FLAT. And the story line? Something like this: “Danish family firm stays too long with a mature product line and misses out on growth opportunities to more innovative rivals.” Analysts will comment that Lego failed to go boldly forward. It lacked vision. It was inward looking. Its managers were timid and complacent—or maybe even arrogant. Of course, some ventures outside the core are spectacularly successful.

In fact, GE was ranked at the top of Fortune magazine’s 2005 survey of Global Most Admired Companies, ahead of Wal-Mart, Dell, Microsoft, and Toyota, and was ranked second in the Financial Times’s 2005 World’s Most Respected Companies survey, down… ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=358))

- A nice set of advice! Every one of these industry experts wants Lego to have it both ways: on the one hand to remember its heritage and focus on what it’s known for, and on the other hand to be innovative and achieve a wow factor. (Remember, pursuit of the wow factor was exactly what Lego had tried to do—and it got creamed for losing sight of its core. Guess that was the wrong wow factor!) Not a single expert suggested that Lego make a clear choice and follow a definitive direction—they all want Lego to have the best of everything. You can bet that if Lego returned to profitability, every one of these experts would say, See, Lego followed my advice, and if Lego ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=375))

- Note the word: drifting. According to the Times, WH Smith didn’t expand or diversify, it drifted. The American Heritage Dictionary defines to drift as “to move from place to place with no particular goal,” “to be carried along by currents of air or water,” “to wander from a set course or point of attention; to stray.” A raft can be cast adrift, left to move with the currents. Wood that flows in and out with the tides is driftwood. A person with no direction or aims is a drifter. (At the start of The Magnificent Seven, the rootlessness—and availability for hire—of the gunfighters is conveyed in this exchange between Steve McQueen and Yul Brynner. “Where are you heading?” asks McQueen. Brynner answers: “I’m drifting south, more or less. And you?” McQueen shrugs. “Just drifting.”) Well, who says that WH Smith ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=400))

WH Smith didn’t add products that call for explanations by salespeople, like electronic equipment, or products that might involve returns. All it did was add a few other fast-moving consumables. It expanded the range of products on its shelves, nothing more. Isn’t that exactly what WH Smith should be doing—identify adjacent areas that draw on its existing capabilities and that appeal to its core customers?

It could well be that given the circumstances, adding music and office supplies was the best move it could have made. Maybe WH Smith was unable to execute its new format for some reason—bad inventory management or poor logistics—or maybe it simply couldn’t match the buying power of Wal-Mart and Safeway. But that’s very different from saying WH Smith drifted. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=412))

- These accounts about Lego, WH Smith, and Nokia are all variants of the most basic question in the business world: What leads to high performance? It’s the mother of all business questions, a Wall Street equivalent of the Holy Grail. Why does one company achieve great success, turning its shareholders into millionaires, while another company just muddles through, earning a modest profit but never catching fire or, even worse, failing altogether? The fact is, it’s often hard to know exactly why one company succeeds and another fails. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=434))

- Or consider a little discount retailer, founded in a small Arkansas town in 1962. How did Wal-Mart grow up to be the biggest company in the world, spinning its cash registers to the tune of $1 billion per day, so big that it accounts for 30 percent of the sales of Procter & Gamble, that it sells 25 percent of all disposable diapers and 20 percent of all magazines sold in the United States, so powerful that it can censor magazines and CDs by threatening not to carry them? How did Wal-Mart become such a success? There’s no shortage of theories: Perhaps it was a strategy of “everyday low prices,” or a relentless obsession with detail, or a culture that gets ordinary people to do their best, or a sophisticated use of information technology in supply chain management, or maybe a bare-knuckled approach to squeezing its suppliers. Are some of these explanations right? Are all of them right? Which are most important? Do some work only in combination with others? Some explanations, like Wal-Mart’s use of its sheer scale to get the lowest input costs, help explain high performance today but don’t tell us how the company got so big in the first place. These questions are important because if we want to learn from Wal-Mart, if we want some of Wal-Mart’s success to rub off on our companies, which lessons should we learn? The fact is, it’s hard to be sure. As Frank Sinatra, the Chairman of the Board, used to sing: “How little we know, how much to discover.” Of course, we don’t like to admit how little we know. The social psychologist Eliot Aronson observed that people are not rational beings so much as rationalizing beings. We want explanations. We want the world around us to make sense.

Or take the stock market, whose daily fluctuations, edging higher one day and a bit lower the next, resemble Brownian motion, the jittery movement of pollen particles in water or of gas molecules bouncing off one another.

- In other fields, from medicine to chemistry to aeronautical engineering, knowledge seems to march ahead relentlessly. What do these fields have in common? In a word, these fields move forward thanks to a form of inquiry we call science. Richard Feynman once defined science as “a method for trying to answer questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen?” Science isn’t about beauty or truth or justice or wisdom or ethics. It’s eminently practical. It asks, If I do something over here, what will happen over there? If I apply this much force, or that much heat, or if I mix these chemicals, what will happen? By this definition, What leads to sustained profitable growth? is a scientific question. It asks, If a company does this or that, what will happen to its revenues or profits or share price? How should we answer a scientific question? Feynman explained: “The technique of it, fundamentally, is: Try it and see. Then you put together a large amount of information from such experiences.” In other words, you conduct experiments and put together information in systematic ways to deduce rules that govern the phenomena and that can lead to accurate predictions. The great thing about sciences like physics and chemistry is that we can run experiments—try it and see—in carefully constructed laboratory settings that let us control the settings, adjust the inputs, and observe the results. Then we can tinker with a few variables, alter some settings, and try again. Scientific progress owes a great deal to the careful and incremental refinement of experiments.

One explanation of Wal-Mart’s success is that it was among the first retailers to apply scientific rigor to merchandising, studying the patterns of consumption and understanding the behavioral traits of its customers, then applying its findings to everything from logistics management to store layout. Likewise, some of the best Internet companies, such as Amazon.com and eBay, use highly sophisticated techniques to track customer clicks and understand their choices.

- Morgridge and Chief Technology Officer Ed Kozel, Chambers decided that Cisco would put together a broad product line and become a one-stop shop for the wired world, dominating the market for Internet infrastructure. There was only one hitch. The market was growing so fast, and new technologies were so unpredictable, that Cisco couldn’t hope to grow on its own. Drawing up a grid that showed the full range of products, Chambers suggested that Cisco fill in the blanks by acquiring small companies. Over the next weeks, Cisco scouted for start-ups, identifying hot new technologies and clever engineers. Soon it made a first acquisition, buying Crescendo Communications, a LAN-switching company, for $97 million. That was just an appetizer—over the next three years, Cisco would acquire two dozen companies. In 1995, John Morgridge retired and John Chambers became Cisco’s CEO. Under his guidance, Cisco soon morphed into a New Economy juggernaut. It bought thirteen more companies in 1996, almost all of them small, but one “really big fish,” StrataCom, a maker of frame relay devices and switches with 1,200 employees and revenues of $400 million.

- As Cisco’s fortunes soared in the late 1990s, two professors at Stanford Business School, Charles O’Reilly III and Jeffrey Pfeffer, were at work on a book, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People. They included a chapter about Cisco, in their view an exemplar when it came to managing people. The authors spent a few pages recounting Cisco’s history and discussing its strategy, and offered a standard profile of John Chambers, the humble supersalesman with the West Virginia drawl. They referred to Cisco’s management of acquisitions and noted its ability to retain talent. Yet none of these seemed adequate to explain Cisco’s phenomenal success. “So the question remains,” wrote O’Reilly and Pfeffer, “What accounts for Cisco’s competitive advantage?” And the answer? “Think about it deductively,” they urged. If Cisco was more successful than other companies, that must mean it “has been more adept than its competitors at providing customers with the technology and equipment they want.” And that meant two things: Cisco had “the strong belief in having no technology religion, and listening carefully to the customer.” According to O’Reilly and Pfeffer, that’s what Cisco really did well—it had no technology of its own but listened intently to customers. It observed where the market was going, then acquired the necessary technology and retained the people who developed it. In the last analysis, the key to Cisco’s success had everything to do with its ability to tap the talent and energy of its workforce.

- During World War I, an American psychologist named Edward Thorndike was conducting research into the ways that superiors rate their subordinates. In one study, he asked army officers to rate their soldiers on a variety of features: intelligence, physique, leadership, character, and so on. He was struck by the results. Some men were thought to be “superior soldiers” and were rated highly at just about everything, while others were thought to be subpar across the board. It was as if officers figured that a soldier who was handsome and had good posture should also be able to shoot straight, polish his shoes well, and play the harmonica, too.

One refers to what Thorndike observed, a tendency to make inferences about specific traits on the basis of a general impression.

The Halo Effect is a way for the mind to create and maintain a coherent and consistent picture, to reduce cognitive dissonance.

- But the Halo Effect is not just a way to reduce cognitive dissonance. It’s also a heuristic, a sort of rule of thumb that people use to make guesses about things that are hard to assess directly.

For example, we may not know if a new product is good, but if it comes from a well-known company with an excellent reputation, we might reasonably infer it should be of good quality. That’s what brand building is about: creating Halos so that consumers are more likely to think favorably of a product or service.

- We think we know what good leadership is all about—clarity of vision, communication skills, good judgment, and more—but in fact a wide range of behaviors can be said to fit these criteria. Show me a company that delivers high performance, and I can always find something positive to say about the person in charge—about the clarity of his or her vision, about good communication skills, sound judgment, and integrity. Show me a company that has fallen on hard times, and I can always find some reason to explain why the leader failed. All of which brings to mind a 1964 Supreme Court case about free speech and pornography, in which Justice Potter Stewart memorably wrote that while he could not provide a good definition of hard-core pornography, “I know it when I see it.” Since good leadership is usually difficult to identify in the absence of data about performance, it seems that leadership is even more difficult to recognize than is hard-core pornography—which at least Justice Stewart knew when he saw it. For all the books written about leadership, most people don’t recognize good leadership when they see it unless they also have clues about company performance from other things that can be assessed more clearly—namely, financial performance. And once they have evidence that a company is performing well, they confidently make attributions about a company’s leadership, as well as its culture, its customer focus, and the quality of its people.

- Halos in our Surveys The Halo Effect shapes how individuals think about decision processes, an organization’s people, and leadership—and it doesn’t go away when we conduct large-scale surveys, either. Quite the contrary. If we’re not careful, surveys might be little more than large collections of Halos, much as we saw regarding the assessments of President Bush. Consider Fortune magazine’s annual ranking of the World’s Most Admired Companies, the one mentioned earlier that named IBM as Most Admired in 1983 and 1984. Every year, Fortune asks thousands of business executives and industry analysts to evaluate hundreds of companies in eight categories: quality of management, quality of products and services, value as a long-term investment, innovativeness, soundness of financial position, ability to attract, develop, and retain talented people, responsibility to the community and environment, and wise use of corporate assets. Mix the answers together and you get the World’s Most Admired Companies in each of these categories—as well as the overall winner. It’s an impressive effort, and it produces an eye-catching cover story every year. Over the years, Fortune has named not just IBM, but luminaries like General Electric, Wal-Mart, and Dell—a very impressive bunch. But when some researchers took a closer look, they found that Fortune’s Most Admired ratings were heavily influenced by a Halo Effect. The scores on the eight different factors for a given company turn out to be highly correlated—much more than should be the case given variance within each category. Furthermore, many of the scores were very much driven by the company’s financial performance, just what we would expect given the salient and tangible nature of financial results. Two different studies showed that a company’s financial performance explained between 42 percent and 53 percent of the variance of the overall rating. In other words, when a company posts high profits and its stock price is moving upward, the people who fill out Fortune’s survey tend to infer that its products and services are of a high quality, that it is innovative and well managed, that it is good at retaining people, and so forth. Cisco offers a case in point. In 1997, the same year Cisco leapt onto the cover of leading business magazines, it made its first appearance on Fortune’s Most Admired list, entering the… ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1208))

- Delusion One: The Halo Effect In chapter 1, we asked why we know so little about company performance. For all the attention devoted to the question, why is it so hard to understand why some companies succeed and others fail? In fact, our thinking about business is shaped by a number of delusions, the first of which is the Halo Effect. So many of the things that we—managers, journalists, professors, and consultants—commonly think contribute to company performance are often attributions based on performance. And even when we try to gather data in large-scale samples, like the Fortune survey or the Great Place to Work study, we often do little more than multiply the Halo Effect. The Halo Effect isn’t the only delusion that distorts our thinking about business. In the following chapters, we’ll come across several more. But in many ways the Halo Effect is the most basic delusion of them all. It is a flaw—sometimes compounded by other errors—that turns up again and again, weakening the quality of our data and often diminishing our ability to think clearly about the factors that shape company performance.

- Halo Effect shapes how we commonly talk about so many topics in business, from decision processes to people to leadership and more. It shows up in our everyday conversations and in newspaper and magazine articles. It affects case studies and large-sample surveys. It’s not so much the result of conscious distortion as it is a natural human tendency to make judgments about things that are abstract and ambiguous on the basis of other things that are salient and seemingly objective. The Halo Effect is just too strong, the desire to tell a coherent story too great, the tendency to jump on bandwagons too appealing. The Halo Effect shapes much of the way we think about business, yes, but by no means all of it. There’s nothing inevitable about the Halo Effect. If we’re aware of the tendency to bestow Halos, we can take corrective measures. For example, we know that one way to evaluate a job candidate more accurately is to insist that some assessments are made without any knowledge of the applicant’s school—to use standardized tests or to conduct some interviews blind. Similarly, we might expect that careful research conducted by serious scholars trained in scientific methods can avoid the Halo Effect. Maybe then we can find a satisfactory answer to the most fundamental of all business questions—What leads to high performance?

- he Halo Effect shapes how we commonly talk about so many topics in business, from decision processes to people to leadership and more. It shows up in our everyday conversations and in newspaper and magazine articles. It affects case studies and large-sample surveys. It’s not so much the result of conscious distortion as it is a natural human tendency to make judgments about things that are abstract and ambiguous on the basis of other things that are salient and seemingly objective. The Halo Effect is just too strong, the desire to tell a coherent story too great, the tendency to jump on bandwagons too appealing. The Halo Effect shapes much of the way we think about business, yes, but by no means all of it. There’s nothing inevitable about the Halo Effect. If we’re aware of the tendency to bestow Halos, we can take corrective measures. For example, we know that one way to evaluate a job candidate more accurately is to insist that some assessments are made without any knowledge of the applicant’s school—to use standardized tests or to conduct some interviews blind. Similarly, we might expect that careful research conducted by serious scholars trained in scientific methods can avoid the Halo Effect. Maybe then we can find a satisfactory answer to the most fundamental of all business questions—What leads to high performance?

- If you want to measure customer orientation, you have to rely on measures that are independent of performance. The same holds for corporate culture. It stands to reason that when employees share common values and don’t need to be told what to do, decisions are made more quickly and people collaborate more easily. But you don’t measure the strength or the fit or the adaptability of a corporate culture just by asking people who already have an opinion about company performance. Instead, you have to look for specific actions or policies or behaviors that are not shaped by perceptions of performance.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If we want to answer the mother of all business questions—What leads to high performance?—one thing is already clear: We have to avoid the Halo Effect. We have to gather data in ways that are unaffected by performance, so that independent variables are measured separately from the thing we’re trying to explain. And the good news is that there are plenty of smart people who think deeply about problems of data independence and work very hard to conduct careful, disciplined research. Yet even if researchers avoid the Halo Effect, they may still not be able to say much about the drivers of high performance. Why? The example from Stephen Jay Gould at the start of the chapter gives the main idea: Arrests for public drunkenness and the number of Baptist preachers in nineteenth-century America may have been closely correlated, but we can’t say much about whether one caused the other. Did the level of drunkenness lead to greater attention about morality in society and… ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1382))

- Inferring causality from correlation trips up many studies about business. Take something as basic as, say, the relationship between employee satisfaction and company performance. It’s logical to think that having satisfied employees ought to lead to high performance. After all, satisfied employees might be willing to work harder and longer, and might care more about keeping their customers happy. It sounds right. We know not to measure employee satisfaction simply by asking employees, “Are you satisfied?” since the answers will likely be colored by the Halo Effect. But suppose we look at a measure that is not tainted by Halos—say, the rate of employee turnover—and we find a high correlation with performance. Now the challenge is to untangle the direction of causality. Does lower employee turnover lead to higher company performance? Perhaps, since a company with a stable workforce might be able to provide more dependable customer service, spend less on hiring and training, and so forth. Or does higher company performance lead to lower employee turnover? That could be true as well, since a profitable and growing company might offer a more stimulating and rewarding environment as well as greater opportunities for advancement. Knowing which leads to which is critical if managers want to know what to do—how much they should invest in greater levels of satisfaction versus other objectives. Or suppose we want to capture the impact of executive education on company performance. As a first step, we have to avoid the Halo Effect by measuring executive education in ways that are not shaped by perceptions of performance, like total spending on education, number of days of education per employee, range of educational opportunities available, and so forth. Suppose we find that companies that spend more on executive education also tend to be high performers. How do we interpret the results? Can we say that investing in executive education leads to high performance? No, because it could be that profitable companies have the funds to afford a greater investment in education. As long as we gather data at one point in time—cross-sectionally—we won’t know. Psychologist Edwin Locke made the point emphatically: “While the method of correlation may be useful for the purposes of suggesting causal hypotheses, it is not a method of scientific proof.

- One way to improve our ability to explain causality is to gather data at different points of time, so that the impact of one variable on some subsequent outcome can be more clearly isolated. This approach, called a longitudinal design, is more time-consuming and expensive to carry out, but it stands a better chance of avoiding mistaken inferences from simple correlation. That way we could, for example, tell whether the advice given by a consulting company in one time period led to better performance in subsequent periods.

It seems that being on a winning team is a stronger cause of employee satisfaction; satisfied employees don’t have as much of an effect on company performance.

- To understand what made these companies so successful, Peters and Waterman talked to lots of people and gathered plenty of data. And then, as they described: “When we finished our interviews and research, we began to sift and codify our results. It was roughly six months after we had started, that we reached the conclusions which are the backbone of this book.” The process was careful, systematic, logical, and objective. No fudging, no cutting corners. Well, that’s what they wrote in the preface of their 1982 book. Almost twenty years later, Peters told the tale a bit differently. In a 2001 article for Fast Company, titled “Tom Peters’ True Confessions,” he wrote: There’s an official way that I tell the story now—and it’s total bullshit. The way I tell it now is, “Americans were under attack by the Japanese, who were making good automobiles. So Bob Waterman and I set out to discover the real secrets of management.” Usually when I tell that version of the story, I try to use my imitation voice-of-God way of speaking to convey the impression that what we set out to do was Very Important.

Staying close to the customer—learning his preferences and catering to them. Autonomy and entrepreneurship—breaking the corporation into small companies and encouraging them to think independently and competitively. Productivity through people—creating in all employees the awareness that their best efforts are essential and that they will share in the rewards of the company’s success. Hands-on, value-driven—insisting that executives keep in touch with the firm’s essential business. Stick to the knitting—remaining with the business the company knows best. Simple form, lean staff—few administrative layers, few people at the upper levels. Simultaneous loose-tight properties—fostering a climate where there is dedication to the central values of the company combined with a tolerance for all employees who accept those values.

- The best companies don’t do one or two of these things, they do them all together! The secret to success isn’t rocket science but follows from a thorough attention to the basic elements of good management. Peters and Waterman observed: “Far too many managers have lost sight of the basics, in our opinion: quick action, service to customers, practical innovation, and the fact that you can’t get any of these without virtually everyone’s commitment.” In Search of Excellence was nothing less than an affirmation of basic principles of good management.

He explained: “Because McKinsey is McKinsey, we felt that we had to come up with some quantitative measures of performance.” And how did they reach their conclusions? Did they sift and codify, reducing pages and pages of interview notes into these eight principles? No, said Peters: “I confess, we faked the data.” Well, I’m not exactly sure what Peters meant by faking the data, because I suspect he didn’t need to fabricate anything.

- then the data were likely to be compromised by the Halo Effect from the beginning. It’s no surprise that Excellent companies were thought to be good at managing people and listening to customers, or were said to have strong values or a good corporate culture. We’ve seen all that before. If you start by identifying a group of forty-three high-performing companies, it’s hardly surprising that you’ll find these sorts of results. Successful companies will almost always be described in terms of a clear strategy, good organization, strong corporate culture, and customer focus. But whether these things drive company performance, or whether they’re mainly attributions based on performance, is a different matter. Peters and Waterman went searching for excellence, but they found a handful of Halos. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1617))

- We can always say they did something wrong to deserve their punishment. It makes the world seem fair and just. Of course, it’s possible that some companies fit this description, but it’s not a good general explanation, because it would be stunning to find that so many of these Excellent companies so quickly lost their groove after doing so well—that two-thirds slumped in market performance and thirty out of thirty-five declined in profitability. It’s unlikely that so many companies, selected precisely because of their strong values and discipline and culture and focus, could all falter so quickly. Contagious complacency? An epidemic of entropy? Probably not. (We could even—a dreadful idea—suggest these companies became self-satisfied because they were listed as Excellent. Hmm, maybe Peters and Waterman were to blame.) Rather, it’s more likely that these Excellent companies carried on doing much the same things as before, but those things weren’t enough to ensure success—because their success had been due to more than these eight principles in the first place. It’s also possible that these eight principles reflect attributions made about successful companies, and in fact the drivers of success lie somewhere else. It’s hard to know, since Peters and Waterman selected companies precisely for their success and gathered data by talking to managers at those companies, collecting perceptions and testimonials that were biased by the Halo Effect.

There’s no need to fake the analysis—because the data are suspect from the start. But compounding the Halo Effect was a second mistake: Peters and Waterman studied a sample made up entirely of outstanding companies. The scientific term for this is sample selection based on the dependent variable—that is, based on outcomes. It’s a classic error. Suppose we want to find out what leads to high blood pressure. We’ll never find out if we only examine patients who suffer from high blood pressure; we’ll only know if we compare them to a sample of people who don’t have high blood pressure. The same applies to companies: By looking only at companies that perform well, we can never hope to show what makes them different from companies that perform less well.

- The Quest for Corporate El Dorado One of the McKinsey consultants who worked with Peters and Waterman, Jim Collins, later joined the Stanford Business School faculty and teamed up with a Stanford professor, Jerry Porras, on a new study about firm performance. Rather than focus on today’s successful companies—many of which might soon falter—Collins and Porras turned their attention to companies that had been successful over the long term, that had stood the test of time. They hoped to find the “underlying timeless, fundamental principles and patterns that… ([Location 1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1720))

- Collins and Porras knew that In Search of Excellence had made a critical error in simply looking for commonality among successful companies—it had connected only winning dots. As they noted, if you look at a group of successful companies and try to find what they have in common, you might conclude that they all reside in buildings. Very true—but hardly something that distinguishes successful companies from less successful ones or that might conceivably lead to success. So Collins and Porras went a next step: For each of their Visionary companies, they identified a Comparison company from the same industry, of about the same vintage, and that was a good performer—not a “dog.” Boeing was paired with McDonnell Douglas, Citicorp with Chase Manhattan, General Electric with Westinghouse, Hewlett-Packard with Texas Instruments, Procter & Gamble with Colgate-Palmolive, and so forth. This way, Collins and Porras might be able to isolate what made the most successful and enduring companies ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1733))

One dollar invested in the eighteen Comparison companies in 1926 would have grown to $955 by 1990, twice the growth of the overall market, although nowhere near as good as the Visionary companies.

- “The Timeless Principles of Enduring Greatness” The next step was to study these eighteen matched pairs. Collins and Porras recognized the special challenges of social science research. As they explained: “We cannot perform controlled, repeatable experiments where we hold all but one critical variable constant and assess various outcomes from tweaking that variable. We would love to make petri dishes of corporations, but we can’t; we have to take what history gives us and make the best of it.” And so, supported by a team of researchers, Collins and Porras undertook a long and arduous process of data gathering and analysis. They described it under the title “Crates of Data, Months of Coding, and ‘Tortoise Hunting.’ ” First they devised a “… ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1743))

- articles to company publications to video footage. They read Harvard and Stanford case studies. They performed “extensive literature searches” from sources including Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, Nation’s Business, The New York Times, and so on. All together, the material filled three “shoulder-height storage cabinets, four bookshelves, and twenty megabytes of computer storage.” The impression was clear: We were very, very thorough. At the end of their research process, Collins and Porras distilled their findings into a series of “timeless principles.” Here they are, the keys to enduring greatness, the things that set the eighteen Visionary companies apart from the eighteen Comparison companies: • Having a strong core ideology that guides the company’s decisions and behavior • Building a strong corporate culture • Setting audacious goals that can inspire and stretch people—so-called big hairy audacious goals, or BHAGs • Developing people and promoting them from within • Creating a spirit of experimentation and risk taking • Driving for excellence It’s a nice list with a strong commonsense appeal. In fact, it’s not very different from the list put forth by Peters and Waterman, as Collins and Porras themselves recognized. Many of the same major themes are present—people, values, culture, action, focus. The sample of companies may have been different, and the research methodology may have been different, but the findings were largely similar. Built to Last was published in 1994 and became an immediate hit. Inc. magazine gushed: “The In Search of Excellence for the 1990s has arrived. It is Built to Last.” Managers loved the book, and why not? It was immensely readable. It was filled with memorable anecdotes. And it claimed to offer the keys to lasting success. In its own words, Built to Last provided “a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the future.” Collins and Porras didn’t shy away from bold promises: “Just about anyone can be a key protagonist in building an extraordinary business institution.… ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1750))

- Yet for all their promises of exhaustive research, Collins and Porras didn’t address a basic problem: the Halo Effect. Much of the data they gathered came from the business press, from books, and from company documents, all sources that are likely to contain Halos. They also conducted interviews with managers, who were asked to look back on their experience and explain the reasons for success, a method likely to be tinged by Halos. And if your data contain Halos, it really doesn’t matter how many cartons you fill. Pick any group of highly successful companies and look backward, relying either on self-reporting or on articles in the business press, and you may well find that they’re said to have strong cultures, solid values, and a commitment to excellence. It would be remarkable if they weren’t described in these terms. Pick a group of comparison companies that are good but not outstanding, and they’re likely to be described in somewhat lesser terms. But unless the data were gathered in a way that was truly independent of performance—that is, unless Collins… ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1772))

- Built to Last? Not So Fast! Collins and Porras urge us not to “blindly and unquestioningly accept” their findings but ask that we subject their analysis to careful scrutiny. “Let the evidence speak for itself,” they implore. So let’s check the evidence. We may not be able to put companies in petri dishes and run experiments, but we can check how they fare over time. If the principles of Built to Last are indeed timeless and enduring explanations of performance, then we should expect these same companies to continue to perform well after the study ended. Conversely, if they can’t keep up their high performance, well, that would lend support to the view that these so-called timeless principles were due mostly to the Halo Effect—a glow cast by high performance rather than the cause of high performance. So how well did the eighteen Visionary companies fare in the years after the study ended on December 31, 1990? All eighteen were still up and running in 2000, so at least they were built to last for another ten years. But as for performance, the record wasn’t so good. Using data from Compustat, I looked at total shareholder return for each company for the five years after the study ended, 1991–1995. The results? Out of seventeen companies, chosen specifically because they had outperformed the market by a factor of 15 for more than sixty-four years, only eight outperformed the S&P 500 market average; the other nine didn’t even keep up. (One company, Marriott, was privately held and not included in the Compustat data set.) If we go out another five years, the picture is no better. In the ten years from 1991 to 2000, only six out of sixteen Visionary companies kept pace with the S&P 500; the other ten didn’t even match the market. You would have been better off investing randomly than putting your money on Collins and Porras’s Visionary companies. (Full results by company are shown in the appendix, table 2A.) Again, it’s possible that this decline mainly reflects a failure to meet exaggerated market expectations, not a decline in operating performance. Stock prices are a good indicator of performance in the long run but may be a poor measure in a shorter time frame. Yet if we look at company profitability, once again… ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1782))

The 1997 edition of Built to Last, written at the height of the book’s success, promised that the study would soon be replicated in Europe, where Collins and Porras had already identified “eighteen European visionary companies: ABB, BMW, Carrefour, DaimlerBenz, Deutsche Bank, Ericsson, Fiat, Glaxo, ING, L’Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Nestlé, Nokia, Philips, Roche, Shell, Siemens, and Unilever.” Quite a list, that.

Then we have some whopping ethical problems: Roche was convicted of illegal price fixing in 1999, and Shell was exposed for exaggerating petroleum reserves in 2004. Strong values and culture indeed. It really shouldn’t surprise us that outstanding companies experience some regression in performance. As companies grow, they find it more difficult to sustain the same percentage growth (witness the current troubles of some of America’s most successful companies, including General Electric, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart). The fact that some Visionary companies fell back would not by itself invalidate the overall findings. But the sheer amount of decline, so quick and so extensive, suggests that there’s more going on here than Collins and Porras would have us believe. More likely, the very things Collins and Porras claimed to be drivers of enduring performance—strong culture, commitment to excellence, and more—were attributions based on performance. As for the Comparison companies, the picture is a bit cloudier since some were privately held, others were subsequently acquired, and a few went out of business. Of the twelve we can track from 1991 to 1995, seven outperformed the market while five trailed; and after ten years, the split was six above the market and three below. For profit performance, eight of twelve improved their profitability while four declined. (See the appendix, tables 3A and 3B.) These figures are somewhat better than those for the Visionary companies,… ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1808))

- Delusion Five: The Delusion of Rigorous Research Built to Last made a good effort to avoid the Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots by including Comparison companies, but it didn’t shake off the basic problem we encounter again and again: the Halo Effect. We can do our best to select samples of high performers and low performers, but if the data are colored by the Halo Effect, we’ll never know what drives high or low performance; instead, we’ll merely find out how high and low performers are described. Of course, we don’t see how problematic the research really is, thanks to another delusion: the Delusion of Rigorous Research. Early in the book, Collins and Porras spent ten pages describing their research method, recounting how methodically they collected their data, how many cartons they filled, and how tirelessly they worked to code the data. Later, Collins and Porras devoted more than fifty pages to three separate appendixes, in which they set out their findings in a number of tables and summaries. Throughout the book there were repeated references to the sheer amount of data gathered—hundreds of books and thousands of articles, a database so extensive that it filled entire bookshelves and required vast computer storage. The effect of all this was to present Built to Last as Very Serious Research, carefully designed and meticulously conducted. The message came through clearly: We were thorough. We were exhaustive. We speak with authority. It all serves to intimidate the reader, for if you haven’t done an equal amount of work, you don’t dare question the findings. No wonder the Chicago Tribune gushed about a revolution in understanding—the study was presented with all the trappings of careful science.

- Delusion Six: The Delusion of Lasting Success There’s another delusion at work in Built to Last, and it calls into question the very premise of the study—that of finding the keys to enduring greatness. When two-thirds of Peters and Waterman’s Excellent companies faded within just a few years, we might have been tempted to explain it as just a hiccup, a fluke. These companies were, after all, the cream of American business—surely so many couldn’t go sour so soon. But when more than half of Collins and Porras’s Visionary companies failed to match the S&P 500 over the next five years, after collectively outperforming the market by a factor of 15 over more than sixty years, we should have… ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=1840))

- But companies that last longest usually aren’t the best performers. Enduring greatness is neither very likely, nor, when we find it, does it tend to be associated with high performance. How can this be, especially after Collins and Porras told us their eighteen Visionary companies had far outperformed the S&P 500? Well, sure, if we look for companies that have performed well over several decades, we’ll find a few—and then if we gather data retrospectively, we can weave together enough Halos to tell a wonderful story about why they did so well. But that’s an exercise in ex post facto selection—the Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots coupled with the Halo Effect.

- But that’s no way to understand the business world. What’s missing is the flux and the dynamism of performance, the ebb and flow. We can tell ourselves that our handful of companies, selected by a rigorous and objective process, are a breed apart, somehow better than the rest (and the more rigorous the selection process appears to be, the more we can persuade ourselves these companies are somehow really better than the rest). But it’s a delusion. We’re kidding ourselves. If we start with the full data set and look objectively at many years of company performance, we find the dominant pattern is not one of enduring performance at all, but one of rise and fall, of growth and decline. Foster and Kaplan conclude: “McKinsey’s long-term studies of corporate birth, survival, and death in America clearly show that the corporate equivalent of El Dorado, the golden company that continually performs better than the markets, has never existed. It is a myth. Managing for survival, even among the best and most revered corporations, does not guarantee strong long-term performance for shareholders. In fact, just the opposite is true. In the long run, the markets always win” (Italics in the original). Looking for those few golden companies that succeed decade after decade may be a delusion, but it’s one that managers are eager to grasp. After all, showing how companies tend to rise and fall over time doesn’t make for a very compelling story. We prefer to read about Excellent and Visionary companies; we want to know the secrets of their success so we can try to do likewise. We yearn to find out how we can avoid the seemingly inevitable fate of decline and death. It’s a far more appealing story than the one suggested by the facts: that success is largely transitory and that most companies that have done well in the past won’t outperform the average in the future.

- Does this mean that all company performance is just a matter of luck? Is it roughly equivalent to someone who flips a coin and gets heads ten times in a row, but stands no greater chance to flip heads on the eleventh try than anyone else? Not at all. Success is not random—but it is fleeting. Why? Because as described by the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, the basic force at work in capitalism is that of competition through innovation—whether of new products, or new services, or new ways of doing business. Where most economists of his day assumed that companies competed by offering lower prices for similar goods and services, Schumpeter’s 1942 book, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, described the forces of competition in terms of innovation. He wrote: The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers, goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates. Every piece of business strategy acquires its true significance only against the background of that process and within the situation created by it. It must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood irrespective of it or, in fact, on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull. . . .

- These studies, and others like them, all point to the basic nature of competition in a market economy. Competitive advantage is hard to sustain. Sure, if you want to, you can look back over seventy years of business history and pick out a handful of companies that have endured, but that’s selection based on outcomes. On the whole, if we look at the full population of companies over time, there’s a strong tendency for extreme performance in one time period to be followed by less extreme performance in the next. To revise a well-known phrase, Nothing recedes like success. Suggesting that companies can follow a blueprint to lasting success may be appealing, but it’s not supported by the evidence.

- In addition to presenting tables of data, What Really Works painted vivid portraits of two companies, one Winner and one Loser. The Winner, Dollar General, sounded like many of the successful companies we’ve read about: It had a clearly stated and laser-focused strategy, deep concern about its customers, a great company culture, plus an effective organization and outstanding leadership. The Loser, Kmart, was a company that seemingly got it all wrong: The strategy kept changing, the culture was miserable, execution was weak, and the organization was in disarray. Kmart made a wonderful whipping boy—imagine getting all four elements wrong at once! Think of the stunning incompetence that must have been present in such a company! What could be wrong with this thinking? Well, two things. First is the Delusion of Single Explanations, which we talked about in chapter 5. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2000))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Second, and more important, the example of Kmart shows up a delusion that is implicit in many of the studies we’ve seen so far, one that’s very basic but often overlooked—indeed, a 2005 Harvard Business Review article that compared several studies of company performance missed the point entirely. I call it the Delusion of Absolute Performance. Companies are often described as succeeding or failing on the merits of their actions alone, as if performance were absolute. But in a competitive market economy, the performance of one company is always affected by the performance of other companies. Part of the problem is that we often think in terms of images from laboratory scientific research. Put a beaker on a stove and you’ll find that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, a bit less at high altitude. Line up a hundred beakers on a hundred stoves and you’ll still find that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. One beaker isn’t affected by any other. But that’s not the way it is in business. To show how company performance is intrinsically relative, I’ll present some data about a major U.S.-based retailer, a well-known company with hundreds of stores nationwide. I’ve made an effort to include only things that seem objectively verifiable and not shaped by the Halo Effect. To disguise the identity of this company, I’ll give it a fictitious name: “Qual-Mart.” According to the report of an independent industry analyst, Alex. Brown & Sons, during the early 1990s, “Qual-Mart” did these things: • Installed point-of-sale terminals in its stores, which provided better information on sales by item and improved the inventory planning process. • Expanded central buying to 75 percent of its merchandise, helping to reduce the costs of procurement. • Modernized its inventory management and thereby significantly improved its “in-stock position.” One result: better management of seasonal inventory, boosting Christmas and Halloween sales by 60 percent. • Conducted physical inventory counts more frequently, not just once at year-end, resulting in greater accuracy and efficiency. • Reduced its expense levels as a percentage of sales. • Improved its merchandise assortment to match current demand trends, helping to raise sales. • Installed a toll-free customer service number, which led to a sharp improvement in customer satisfaction. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2016))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- • Implemented a sophisticated client/server technology that led to better merchandise management and savings of $240 million. Thanks to these many steps, “Qual-Mart” saw an improvement in inventory turns—that is, how many times in a year it sold its inventory, a key measure of retailing efficiently—from 3.45 in 1994 all the way to 4.56 in 2002. That’s a jump of 32 percent, not bad at all. ([Location 2035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2035))

- presentation,” but its major rivals also got better—in fact, much better. It went on: “Both Wal-Mart and Target, by our estimate, continue to enjoy significant advantages on the expense ratio front—allowing them to be quite assertive on price and to post still higher financial returns than Kmart.” And that wasn’t all. By the early 1990s, while Kmart raised the amount of centrally purchased inventory to 75 percent, Wal-Mart reached 80 percent. Kmart installed point-of-sale scanning in its stores by 1990, but Wal-Mart had done the same two years earlier. No wonder Kmart was scrambling. Its rivals were driving down costs and improving logistics at an even faster rate. By 2002—just as its inventory turns were reaching an all-time high!—Kmart hoisted the white flag and shuffled off to bankruptcy court. It’s irresistible to infer that a bankrupt company must have been poor at execution, but the evidence doesn’t support that view at all, at least not if we’re talking about execution in an absolute sense. The difference between absolute and relative performance can be seen at other companies as well. Consider General Motors, another company with slumping sales and a falling share price. In 2005, GM’s debt was reduced to junk bond status, hardly a vote of confidence from financial markets. Yet compared with the automobiles it produced in the 1980s, GM’s cars are ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2064))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- much better in so many respects: better quality, additional features, superior comfort, and improved safety. Owing to a myriad of factors, its share of the U.S. market keeps slipping, from 35 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 1999 to 25 percent in 2005, as Japanese and Korean automakers continue to gain share. GM’s declining performance has to be understood in relative terms. In fact, the rigors of competition from Asian automakers are precisely what stimulated GM to improve. Is GM a better automaker than it was a generation ago? Sure, by absolute measures. But try telling that to its employees or shareholders. The Delusion of Absolute Performance is hugely important because it suggests that companies can achieve high performance by following a simple formula, regardless of the actions of competitors. If left unchecked, managers may pay attention to a misleading set of issues. The Evergreen Project wasn’t alone in this basic misconception—the same delusion was implicit in Built to Last, where Collins and Porras claimed that following a handful of steps provided a “blueprint for enduring success” without any mention of rivals or any appreciation of the dynamics of industry competition. Yet once we see that performance is relative, it becomes obvious that companies can never achieve success simply by following a given set of steps, no matter how well intended; their success will always be affected by what rivals do. The greater the number of rivals, and the easier for new competitors to enter the market, and the more rapidly technology changes, the more difficult it is to sustain success. That’s an uncomfortable truth, because it admits that some elements of business performance are outside of our control. It’s far more appealing to downplay the relative nature of performance or ignore it completely. Telling a company it can achieve high performance, regardless of what competitors do, makes for a more attractive story.

- The Grand Delusions of Good to Great At the same time the Evergreen Project was under way, one of the authors of Built to Last, Jim Collins, embarked on a new study of company performance. Whereas Built to Last looked at companies that had been, for the most part, always successful (well, at least until the study ended), most companies tend to muddle along, doing reasonably well but never achieving great success. What could be said to them? Collins’s next project addressed this point directly. How, he wondered, did ordinary companies make the shift to outstanding performance? Why did some companies make the leap from Good to Great while others didn’t? ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2095))

- Collins and his team of researchers began with a large sample—all the companies on the Fortune 500 between 1965 and 1995, 1,435 in all. To find those that had gone from mediocre to magnificent, they undertook what they described as a “death march of financial analysis.” Their objective was to find those companies that fit a specific pattern: fifteen years of stock market returns near the general average, “punctuated by a transition point,” then followed by fifteen years of stock market returns well above the ([Location 2100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2100))

It’s well-known in the business world, as in: “Things aren’t so good today, but don’t worry, we’re going to do great things in the future.” Everyone in the business world wants to deliver a hockey stick, whether to their boss or to their investors.

- having excellent leadership, better people, more persistence, and greater courage? Given the way the data were gathered, and given the widespread tendency to make attributions based on performance, the latter seems more likely than the former. Collins claimed to explain why some companies made the leap while others didn’t, but in fact he did nothing of the kind. Good to Great documented what was written and said about companies that had made the leap versus those that had not—which is completely different. At the start of his book, Collins urges his readers to be honest, to “confront the brutal facts.” Well, here’s a brutal fact we may wish to consider: If you start by selecting companies based on outcome, and then gather data by conducting retrospective interviews and collecting articles from the business press, you’re not likely to discover what led some companies to become Great. You’ll mainly catch the glow from the Halo Effect. Yet no one seemed to look closely at these shortcomings, because Good to Great had such an encouraging message: You, too, can transform your good company into a Great one. Collins was explicit on this point. He wrote: “Greatness is not a matter of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice.” It’s a compelling story. People want to believe their good efforts will be rewarded, that good things come to those who wait, and that’s exactly what Collins was saying: With vision and humility, by caring about people, through persistence and focus, you can become Great. As a tale of inspiration, there’s hardly a better one than Good to Great. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2154))

- Delusion Eight: The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick The reliance on flawed data in Good to Great raises serious questions about the validity of its findings. But even if we set aside those questions and accept the data, we have a further problem, this one about the interpretation of findings. One of the central images in Good to Great is the Hedgehog Concept, drawn from Isaiah Berlin’s famous essay “The Hedgehog and the Fox.” Berlin wrote that many people fall into one of two basic categories. Foxes know many things—they are fleet and cunning, and they pursue many aims. Hedgehogs know one big thing—they look to be slow and methodical, but they stay focused on a single unifying vision. And this distinction, wrote Collins, has everything to do with achieving high performance, because the eleven Great companies were all Hedgehogs. They had a narrow focus and pursued it with great discipline. Foxlike companies, by contrast, scattered their attention and energy, often changed directions, but never became Great. There is, of course, a possibility that our classification is shaped by the Halo Effect—when viewed in retrospect, successful companies may tend to be described as more focused and persistent than less successful companies. But let’s suppose that Collins got it right and the eleven Great companies really were more focused on a narrow core vision than the Comparison group. What then? Does it follow that companies perform better when they behave like Hedgehogs? Not quite. The story is a bit more complicated. To see why, consider a somewhat different example. Imagine that a thousand people spend the day betting at the racetrack, and at the end of the day we select the ten bettors with the highest winnings—we’ll call them our Great bettors. When we look closely at these most successful bettors, we’re likely to find that all of them placed big bets on long shots—that’s how they came out ahead of the other 990. They were Hedgehogs, focusing on a few big things. Very few Foxes will be among the top ten, because Foxes tend to diversify their positions. Yet even if the top ten bettors were all Hedgehogs, it does not follow that Hedgehogs, on average, outperformed Foxes, because some Hedgehogs may have done very well but many more may have gone home broke. In fact, overall Foxes probably did better than Hedgehogs—they took more prudent risks and avoided… ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2167))

- could lead to glory but even more likely lead to the gutter. Collins urges managers to be Hedgehogs by pointing out the upside while overlooking the attendant risks. Which is dangerous, because you can’t have it both ways. These errors aren’t too surprising, given that Collins’s understanding of the Fox-Hedgehog parable is questionable from the start. He suggests that people who have had the greatest impact on humanity—including Darwin, Marx, and Einstein—were Hedgehogs, consumed with a single and simple idea, then pursuing it with dogged focus. But Isaiah Berlin made no such claim, observing only that Foxes and Hedgehogs were two different ways of looking at human experience. There have been great people in both categories. According to Berlin, Plato was a Hedgehog but Aristotle a Fox; Dante a Hedgehog but Shakespeare a Fox; Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche were Hedgehogs while Goethe and Joyce were Foxes. Collins’s assertion about Darwin is also doubtful: After all, Charles Darwin was raised as a conventional Christian and arrived at his revolutionary ideas about natural selection after decades of careful observation and reflection—challenging conventional… ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2210))

- While the practices of engineering continually evolve and change, the laws of physics remain relatively fixed. I like to think of our work as a search for timeless principles—the enduring physics of great organizations—that will remain true and relevant no matter how the world changes around us. Yes, the specific application will change (the engineering), but certain immutable laws of organized human performance (the physics) will endure. The reference to physics is no accident. Of all the sciences, physics is the most elegant, the most sublime feat of pure intellect, the most able to reduce the workings of the universe to simple yet precise mathematical equations. As physicist-turned-finance-expert Emanuel Derman explains: “Theoretical physicists are accustomed to the success of mathematics in formulating the laws of the universe and elaborating their consequences. The universe does indeed seem to run like some splendid Swiss clockwork: We can predict the orbits of planets and the frequency of light emitted by atoms to eight or ten decimal places.” The prestige of physics is such that lesser mortals in biology and chemistry are said to suffer from “physics envy.” Comparing the study of business with the study of physics flatters both the writer and the reader. If the business world really did run with clocklike precision, then perhaps the promise of Good to Great would be reasonable. We can predict the movements of the planets, so why not the performance of companies, too? Perhaps there really are universal principles of good management that can be applied by any company, at any time, in any industry. Small company or large? The laws of gravity surely apply to them all. Incumbent or challenger? The same principles govern their motion. Growing rapidly or steady in size? Companies are all made of the same atoms. It’s an appealing image. In the words of Fortune’s resident wit, Stanley Bing, at the start of this chapter, we find the stately image of science to be reassuring. We like to believe that some cosmic order makes the business world a just and predictable place, ruled by precise laws.

- But as we know by now, a successful company can always be described as disciplined while the same company, in times of trouble, can be seen as inept; companies that change successfully can always be described as adaptive while those that don’t will naturally be seen as rigid. Unless those terms are defined in ways that aren’t shaped by performance, all we’re doing is stacking Halos. We’re collecting attributions about successful and unsuccessful companies but not identifying the drivers of success or failure. The effect, once again, is to tell managers that companies can succeed by following a simple formula, never mind what other companies do. Nowhere is there an appreciation of the relative nature of performance, of the need for managers to take calculated risks if they hope to outdo their rivals. The years of study may change, and the companies examined may be different, but the delusions remain the same.

- Perhaps the most interesting finding in Big Winners and Big Losers is mentioned as a brief aside but not examined closely: Marcus points out that large companies show up more frequently among the Big Losers, while almost all the Big Winners are small or midsize companies. This observation ought to spark one’s curiosity, because large companies got that way in the first place by doing things well—they didn’t grow by being Losers—yet something seemed to prevent them from maintaining that high performance. Did they abandon their winning ways? Did they suffer from hubris? Or did they continue to do largely the same things but, quite naturally, regressed to the mean as they got bigger, due mainly to the erosive effects of competitive pressures? Extreme performance, for better and for worse, is more common among small companies. One company, in particular, might have caught Marcus’s eye. One of the Losers, a low performer for the ten-year period of 1992–2002, was Campbell Soup. Guess where Campbell Soup figured in What Really Works, the ten-year study by the Evergreen Project? For the years 1986–1996, it was listed among the Winners, having racked up strong performance in both five-year blocks. Did Campbell Soup so quickly change its winning ways—did it foolishly venture into new markets or change the formula for its famous tomato soup? Or was its performance eroded by market forces, improved competition, or changing customer tastes? What drove the lower performance of Campbell Soup isn’t carefully explored; we’re given only a collection of attributions based on its lower performance, with predictable results. Regrettably, for all its claims to be new and improved, this latest effort to crack the code of business success has many of the same flaws as its predecessors and comes no closer to offering a satisfying explanation of company performance.

- primarily at the level of storytelling. Many studies of company performance try hard to avoid the Halo Effect and other delusions. They’re carefully designed and well executed. One such study, by Marianne Bertrand at the University of Chicago and Antoinette Schoar at MIT, investigated whether company performance was affected by the chief executive’s personal managerial style. It’s easy to find anecdotal evidence that CEOs of successful companies have effective personal styles—given the Halo Effect, that much is almost inevitable. But Bertrand and Schoar knew better than to gather cartons of magazine articles or to ask managers to rate the style of their chief executives—methods that would do little more than capture Halos. Instead, they defined “managerial style” in terms of two specific policies: investment policies (captured by levels of capital expenditures and administrative costs, and the frequency of mergers and acquisitions) and financial policies (captured by levels of debt and of dividends). These policies were objective and measurable, not ambiguous and hard to define. Next, they gathered data from audited financial statements so there could be little chance of a Halo Effect. As additional steps, they controlled for a number of other variables, and they also looked at the actions of specific managers over time, examining their tenure at more than one company. This was good, solid social science research. And the results? Bertrand and Schoar found that individual managers indeed have preferred personal styles when it comes to investment and financial policies, and that these preferences explain about 4 percent of the variance of company performance.

- Here’s a second example. Nick Bloom at the London School of Economics and Stephen Dorgan at McKinsey set out to test the association between specific management practices and company performance. It’s similar to the question Peters and Waterman asked—What leads to excellent performance?—and it’s also close to the Evergreen Project’s question—What really works? But Bloom and Dorgan took a very different approach. Did they begin by selecting a list of high performers, then look backward to see what they had in common? No, they began by selecting a wide sample of more than 700 medium-size manufacturing companies in Europe and the United States, a mix of high performers and low performers. Did they ask respondents to evaluate things like corporate culture or management quality or customer orientation, all of which are likely to be shaped by performance? No, they asked managers to describe specific practices, wording their questions in such a way as to ensure the answers were not colored by the Halo Effect. To further improve the validity of their data, they used a “double blind” method of gathering and coding the data: Respondents were told only that the research was about practices, not that it was concerned with company performance; and the person who gathered the data did not know the performance of the company, removing a potential source of bias. Finally, since the study gathered data at a single point in time—it was cross-sectional, not longitudinal—the authors were careful to point out they had found correlation only, not causality. They even suggested that causality could run in the opposite direction—that is, high-performing companies might have the funds or resources to adopt certain management practices. They deliberately understated their findings. So after all that, what did Bloom and Dorgan find? Their study showed that specific management practices were indeed associated with differences in performance and explained about 10 percent of the total variance in firm performance. That is… ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2358))

- Two separate worlds operating on their own logic would be complicated enough, but what’s going on is even more troublesome than that. Stories about company performance appear to be all the more persuasive when they’re dressed up to look like science, when they’re said to be based on exhaustive research, backed up by cartons of documents and gigabytes of data, blessed by a roster of experts from well-known universities, and claiming to reveal underlying principles with the accuracy of science. We’re back to the Delusion of Rigorous Research. The bestsellers we’ve reviewed spent considerable time discussing their methodology and data analysis, and reviewers and readers alike were hugely impressed by how extensive and exhaustive the research appeared to be. By now, of course, we know that the data were flawed and that explanations of improved performance were highly questionable. Yet the rewards for an appealing story, made all the more impressive by claiming to be science, are considerable. According to The Economist, Tom Peters can charge corporate clients up to $85,000 for a single appearance, and Jim Collins commands a fee of $150,000. There’s a lucrative market for spinning stories of corporate success. Will anyone hire Bertrand and Schoar at $85,000 or $150,000 a pop to talk about a statistically significant 4 percent difference in performance? Somehow it seems doubtful.

Maybe the last lines of the song are the most revealing ones: “How little it matters, how little we know.” ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2399))

- The test of a good story is not whether it is entirely, fully, scientifically accurate—by definition it won’t be. Rather, the test of a good story is whether it leads us toward valuable insights, if it inspires us toward helpful action, at least most of the time. By that yardstick, perhaps we should be more charitable about the popular business books we’ve reviewed here, because most return again and again to the same fundamentals. From Tom Peters through Jim Collins, the same themes are sounded: Companies do well when managers live by deeply held values, pursue a clear vision, care about their employees, focus on their customers, and strive for excellence. Surely it can’t be such a bad thing if a manager navigates by those few basic principles, can it? Surely a dose of Norman Rockwell optimism can’t be harmful, can it? And truth be told, I find a lot of good in these basic principles. In the 1980s, I worked for six years at Hewlett-Packard, a company that was featured prominently in In Search of Excellence and Built to Last. Strongly shared values, empowered people, a culture of innovation—those were all bedrock principles at Hewlett-Packard, one of the most progressive and successful companies in American business history. Furthermore, the chief executive I’ve admired most in my career is David Packard—a wise and pragmatic man, direct and unpretentious, committed to his company but also willing to serve in government—indeed, an exemplar of what Jim Collins calls Level Five Leadership. So overall, I’m sympathetic to much of what these bestsellers have to say. Most companies can benefit from their basic principles—and if the authors have been able to present them in a way that’s accessible and vivid, so that millions of managers read these ideas and take them to heart, perhaps that’s not such a bad thing. Yet there’s a bit more to it. Our desire to tell stories, to provide a coherent direction to events, may also cause us to see trends that do not exist or infer causes incorrectly. We may ignore facts because they don’t fit into our story. ([Location 2412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2412))

- So is there reason to believe that the delusions we’ve encountered in the previous chapters can be harmful? I suspect the answer is yes. Here’s why. The Delusion of Lasting Success promises that building an enduring company is not only achievable but a worthwhile objective. Yet companies that have outperformed the market for long periods of time are not just rare, they are statistical artifacts that are observable only in retrospect. Companies that achieved lasting success may be best understood as having strung together many short-term successes. Pursuing a dream of enduring greatness may divert attention from the pressing need to win immediate battles. The Delusion of Absolute Performance diverts our attention from the fact that success and failure always take place in a competitive environment. It may be comforting to believe that our success is entirely up to us, but as the example of Kmart demonstrated, a company can improve in absolute terms and still fall further behind in relative terms. Success in business means doing things better than rivals, not just doing things well. Believing that performance is absolute can cause us to take our eye off rivals and to avoid decisions that, while risky, may be essential for survival given the particular context of our industry and its competitive dynamics. The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick lets us confuse causes and effects, actions and outcomes. We may look at a handful of extraordinarily successful companies and imagine that doing what they did can lead to success—when it might in fact lead mainly to higher volatility and a lower overall chance of success. Unless we start with the full population of companies and examine what they all did—and how they all fared—we have an incomplete and indeed biased set of information. The Delusion of Organizational Physics implies that the business world offers predictable results, that it conforms to precise laws. It fuels a belief that a given set of actions can work in all settings and ignores the need to adapt to different conditions: intensity of competition, rate of growth, size of competitors, market concentration, regulation, global dispersion of activities, and much more. Claiming that one approach can work everywhere, at all times, for all companies, has a simplistic appeal but doesn’t do justice to the complexities of business. These points, taken together, expose the principal fiction at the heart of so many business books—that a company can choose to be great, that following a few key steps will predictably lead to greatness, that its success is entirely of its own making and not dependent on factors outside its control. We’re not far off from self-help books that tell people they can be millionaires in five easy steps, or lose twenty pounds in two weeks, or awaken the power of greatness in them. Furthermore, if one accepts all of this, then the converse holds, too: If a company never becomes great, its managers must have failed somewhere… ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2432))

- Exposing delusions that cloud our thinking about company performance is essential for discerning managers, but it’s not entirely satisfying, because it doesn’t answer the mother of all business questions: What leads to high performance? In fact, it may seem as if we’ve been going backward. We may seem to know even less than we did at the start of this book. Does employee satisfaction lead to high performance? Probably, but it’s hard to say how much, and it turns out the reverse effect is stronger: Company performance is a more important determinant of employee satisfaction. Well then, a strong corporate culture leads to high performance, right? Managers should strive to build strong values that are shared by all, shouldn’t they? Perhaps, but just how much culture affects performance is hard to say, and once again the reverse effect may be greater, as successful companies are usually said to have strong cultures. What about customer focus? Isn’t it vital for companies to be close to their customers? Yes, but if we’re not careful, just about any high-performing company can be said to have good customer focus, and any company with sluggish sales or falling margins can be said to have lost its way with customers. Leadership isn’t a more satisfying explanation, either, because we can always claim that successful companies have effective leaders, who seem to be endowed with clear vision and good communication skills; and we can always say that the leader of a failing company somehow lost the plot. But all of this begs a deeper question: If so many of the things we observe are not drivers of performance but attributions based on performance, then what brought about high performance in the first place? We may agree with George Bernard Shaw that the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn’t how she acts but how she’s treated, but that doesn’t explain how she came to be a lady to begin with. To say she was born into a wealthy family only pushes the question back a generation—how, we should want to know, did her family become wealthy while another did not? So we have to return to the question that started it all: What leads to high performance? If we believe management gurus and consultants and many business school professors, high performance can be achieved with enough care and attention to a precise set of elements—these four factors or those six steps or these eight principles. Do those things, and success is just around the corner. But to paraphrase Christopher Hitchens, all the emphasis on steps and formulas may obscure a more simple truth. It may further the fiction that a specific set of steps will lead, predictably, to success. And if you never achieve greatness, well, the problem isn’t with our formula—which was, after all, the product of rigorous research, of extensive data exhaustively analyzed—but with you and your failure to follow the formula. But in fact, the truth may be considerably simpler than these formulas suggest. They may… ([Location 2484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2484))

- Neither of these books recognized a central fact: Strategy always involves risk because we don’t know for sure how our choices will turn out. There are several reasons why strategic decisions are so uncertain. A first reason has to do with customers. Will customers embrace or reject a new product or service? How much will they be willing to pay? It’s hard to tell for sure. Market research is often useful, and as we said with regard to Harrah’s in chapter 1, some businesses lend themselves to scientific experimentation—they offer natural laboratories where variations can be tested in carefully controlled settings. But many major initiatives, like the launch of a new product or a new business model, don’t easily lend themselves to experiments. There are, in fact, legendary examples where mountains of market research didn’t help at all. Sam Phillips, the legendary Sun Records producer, once cautioned: “Any time you think you know what the public’s going to want, that’s when you know you’re looking at a damn fool when you’re looking in the mirror.” Market reaction is always uncertain, and smart strategists know it.

- A second source of risk has to do with competitors. Even if we can accurately predict what customers will do, we still have to contend with rivals, some of whom have made equally good predictions about customers and may pursue a similar set of choices—or may leapfrog us entirely with a revolutionary product or service. Predicting a rival’s moves is hardly an exact science—especially when that rival is also trying to predict our behavior. An entire branch of economics, game theory, has grown up around a simple form of competitive intelligence that involves just two players, called the Prisoner’s Dilemma.

- resources and capabilities and risk preferences, and the complexity of the game grows in exponential leaps. A third source of risk comes from technological change. Some industries are relatively stable, with products that don’t change much and customer demand that remains steady for long periods of time. If you’re Kellogg’s and you sell cornflakes, you might be able to crank out a steady profit year after year. People still need to eat breakfast, no one has invented a much better cornflake, and you have a well-known brand, all of which may translate into steady… ([Location 2553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2553))

- profits—nothing is forever, as Schumpeter would tell us). But in other industries, technology changes rapidly and strategic choices can come one after another with life-and-death consequences. In his groundbreaking research, Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School showed that in a wide range of industries, from earth-moving equipment to disk drives to steel, successful companies were repeatedly dislodged by new technologies. They didn’t fail because they were badly managed—the problem was more insidious than that. Rather, it was because they kept doing everything right—they focused on the needs of their customers and invested in new products that had a high likelihood of success—that they became vulnerable to new technologies. These so-called disruptive technologies at first didn’t look attractive to established players—they didn’t meet the needs of existing customers and didn’t promise substantial sales—and therefore tended to be ignored, yet they improved over time and eventually displaced the existing technology, spelling disaster for market leaders. It is, after all, very hard to know which new technologies will lead nowhere and can be safely ignored, and which will transform the industry and pose a mortal threat. Add together these three factors—uncertain customer demand, unpredictable competitors, and changing technology—and it becomes clear why strategic choice is inherently risky. And nowhere have the risks been higher than in high-technology industries. Remember in chapter 7 when Jim Collins expressed surprise that the eleven Great companies came from ordinary, unspectacular industries like consumer retailing, consumer products, financial services, and steel? He offered a powerful implication: You don’t have to be a glossy high-tech or biotech company to become Great. If these run-of-the-mill companies can become Great, well, then so can you! But I suspect a different interpretation is more accurate. These industries can be described as dowdy, but a better word might be stable. They were less subject to radical changes in technology, were less susceptible to shifts in customer demand, and may have had less intense competition. All of which meant that companies in these industries had a better chance of racking up consistent performance, year after year, than did companies in more turbulent industries.

- . . . And the Uncertainties of Execution In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the second pillar of company performance, execution. A few prominent business leaders have trumpeted its importance. In the view of Larry Bossidy, former head of Honeywell and before that a senior executive at General Electric, execution isn’t merely one of the important elements of company performance, but ranks right at the top. “Execution,” he wrote, “is the great unaddressed issue in the business world today. Its absence is the single biggest obstacle to success and the cause of the disappointments that are mistakenly attributed to other causes. No strategy can deliver results unless it’s converted into specific actions—and those specific actions are the stuff of execution.” That might seem like good news, because if execution is not only very important, but also involves less uncertainty than strategic choice, then perhaps managers can make predictable improvements to company performance after all. And it is true that execution isn’t as risky as strategic choice, and for an obvious reason. Strategic choice depends on customer preferences and the actions of competitors and the prospects of some new technology—all of which are in the messy world outside. By contrast, execution takes place entirely within the company. It happens on our premises, with our people, working together to achieve an agreed-upon strategy that we formulated. There are fewer unknowns. Yet execution still involves a number of uncertainties. After all, an organization isn’t a system of mechanical parts, interchangeable and replaceable. It’s better understood as a sociotechnical system, a combination of men and machines, of people and things, of hardware and software, but also of ideas and attitudes. Some technical elements can often be copied and applied with predictable results. For example, manufacturing methods, production formulas, inventory management, and computer systems can often be shared across business units with similar effect. But when we begin to examine how those technical systems interact with social systems, with people and values and attitudes and expectations, the results are harder to predict. Take, as an example, human resources management practices. Mark Huselid and Brian Becker, authors of a study we read about in chapter 5, found that human resource management… ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2620))

- All of this ought to be a good thing—not just to recognize the importance of operational effectiveness, but to set the target high, to talk about flawless execution. Yet in my experience, good intentions about execution are often undermined by a few basic errors. Let me explain. Recently I attended a presentation by a senior executive of a well-known multinational company who spoke to forty of his managers from around the world. The company is a high performer, a leader in its industry, not a troubled firm. At the beginning of his talk, as he described the challenges facing the company, the executive said emphatically: “We have the right strategy. We just need to execute better.” Everyone in the room nodded in agreement, and the discussion moved on, covering a wide range of topics over the next hour. What could be wrong with that? Only this: There are dozens of dimensions of execution, and the forty people in the room may well have been thinking about forty different things. When the session ended, they had no greater understanding of the most difficult challenges facing their company, nor were they any closer to agreement on specific actions that they should take—which made it unlikely that much would change for the better. Saying, “We need to execute better,” is about as helpful as saying, “Let’s all do a better job.” It’s just motherhood and apple pie.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Rather than merely state the importance of flawless execution—after all, who could be against flawless execution?—managers would do better to identify those few elements of execution that are most important to deliver on the chosen strategy. For one company, it could be the reduction of manufacturing cycle time. Or lowering defect levels. For another, it could be improving speed to market for new products. Or achieving higher levels of customer retention. Or improving the rate of on-time delivery. Of course, it’s tempting to say that everything is important, but that’s too easy. The key is to ask: For our company, at this time, competing against our rivals, which of the many dimensions of execution are most important? Which ones are most vital for us at this time? That’s a tougher question, but it’s necessary if we want to develop a shared sense of priorities. And it can be done.

- There’s another reason I question the value of broad pronouncements about flawless execution—which is that it can divert attention from strategy. Remember when all forty managers nodded in agreement at the importance of execution? Of course they did—who could disagree? But by putting the attention on execution, the topic of strategic choice was neatly sidestepped. This happens all the time. When my old company, Hewlett-Packard, announced disappointing results in August 2004, CEO Carly Fiorina stated, “The strategy is the right one. What we failed to do is execute the strategy.” Her explanation sounded reasonable, and no one questioned her when she swiftly replaced a few key executives—it looked like an appropriate step to improve execution and raise company performance. Curiously, when Fiorina herself was fired just six months later in February 2005, a company spokesperson repeated the same line: HP was following the right strategy, but the chief executive was replaced because the board of directors wanted better execution! Again, it all sounded reasonable, and no alarms were raised about the company’s basic choices. Six weeks later, when Mark Hurd was hired as the new CEO, Hewlett-Packard stuck to its message, announcing that it had “picked Mr. Hurd because of his execution skills.” And therein lies the problem: It’s always easier to bang the drum about execution than to address fundamental questions of strategy. It’s always easier to insist we’re going in the right direction but just need to run a little faster; it’s far more painful to admit that the direction may be flawed, because the remedies are much more ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2683))

- It’s far simpler to point the finger at execution. Which leads to an observation: Whenever someone says, “We have the right strategy, we just need to execute better,” I make sure to take an extra-close look at the strategy. And that brings us to the best answer I can provide to the question What leads to high performance? If we set aside the usual suspects of leadership and culture and focus and so on—which are perhaps better understood as attributions based on performance rather than causes of performance—we’re left with two broad categories: strategic choice and execution. The former is inherently risky since it’s based on our best guesses about customers, about competitors, and technology, as well as about our internal capabilities. The latter is uncertain because practices that work well in one company may not have the same effect in another. In spite of our desire for simple steps, the reality of management is much more ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2702))

- uncertain than we would often like to admit—and much more so than our comforting stories would have us believe. Wise managers know that business is about finding ways to improve the odds of success—but never imagine that success is certain. If a company makes strategic choices that are shrewd, works hard to operate effectively, and is favored by Lady Luck, it may put some distance between itself and its rivals, at least for a time. But even those profits will tend to erode over time. Success at one moment doesn’t ensure success in the next moment, because success invites new challengers, some of them willing to take greater risks than the incumbents. All of which helps explain why, seductive stories notwithstanding, there’s simply no formula that can guarantee success. As Tom Peters observed: “To be excellent, you have to be consistent. When you’re consistent, you’re vulnerable to attack. Yes, it’s a paradox. Now deal with it.” ([Location 2709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2709))

- Unfortunately for Ballmer and every other manager, there’s no magic formula, no way to crack the code, no genie in the bottle holding the secrets to success. The answer to the question What really works? is simple: Nothing really works, at least not all the time. That’s not the nature of the business world. But that insight, however accurate, isn’t of much comfort. Management is about taking action, about doing things. So what can be done? A first step is to set aside the delusions that color so much of our thinking about business performance. To recognize that stories of inspiration may give us comfort but have little more predictive power than a pair of coconut headsets on a tropical island. Instead, managers would do better to understand that business success is relative, not absolute, and that competitive advantage demands calculated risks. To accept that few companies achieve lasting success, and that those that do are perhaps best understood as having strung together several short-term successes rather than having consciously pursued enduring greatness. To admit that, as Tom Lester of the Financial Times so neatly put it, “the margin between success and failure is often very narrow, and never quite as distinct or as enduring as it appears at a distance.” By extension, to recognize that good decisions don’t always lead to favorable outcomes, that unfavorable outcomes are not always the result of mistakes, and therefore to resist the natural tendency to make attributions based solely on outcomes. And finally, to acknowledge that luck often plays a role in company success. Successful companies aren’t “just lucky”—high performance is not purely random—but good fortune does play a role, and sometimes a pivotal one.

- If all of this seems discouraging, it need not. The fact that business performance depends on so many things outside our control is no cause for despair. And fortunately, there are several good examples of managers who see the world clearly, accurately, without delusions. They don’t write self-congratulatory accounts of their victorious careers or offer platitudes about authenticity and integrity and humility, as if those things—important though they may be—were sufficient to guarantee success. They don’t cling to an idealized view of the business world. Rather, they are thoughtful managers who recognize that success comes about from a combination of shrewd judgment and hard work with a dose of good luck mixed in, and they’re well aware that if the breaks of the game had gone just a bit differently, the results could have been vastly different. The executives we’ll look at—Robert Rubin, Andy Grove, and Guerrino de Luca—have all been very successful, so it may seem that I’m selecting my sample based on outcomes, and to some extent that’s true.

- uncertain than we would often like to admit—and much more so than our comforting stories would have us believe. Wise managers know that business is about finding ways to improve the odds of success—but never imagine that success is certain. If a company makes strategic choices that are shrewd, works hard to operate effectively, and is favored by Lady Luck, it may put some distance between itself and its rivals, at least for a time. But even those profits will tend to erode over time. Success at one moment doesn’t ensure success in the next moment, because success invites new challengers, some of them willing to take greater risks than the incumbents. All of which helps explain why, seductive stories notwithstanding, there’s simply no formula that can guarantee success. As Tom Peters observed: “To be excellent, you have to be consistent. When you’re consistent, you’re vulnerable to attack. Yes, it’s a paradox. Now deal with it. ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2779))

- The central idea in this book has been that our thinking about business is shaped by a number of delusions. My hope is that managers will read business books a bit more critically, free from delusions, their deepest fantasies and fondest hopes tempered by a bit of realism. I would hope in particular that managers would remember: • If independent variables aren’t measured independently, we may find ourselves standing hip-deep in Halos.

- • If the data are full of Halos, it doesn’t matter how much we’ve gathered or how sophisticated our analysis appears to be. • Success rarely lasts as long as we’d like—for the most part, long-term success is a delusion based on selection after the fact. • Company performance is relative, not absolute. A company can get better and fall further behind at the same time. • It may be true that many successful companies bet on long shots, but betting on long shots does not often lead to success. • Anyone who claims to have found laws of business physics either understands little about business, or little about physics, or both. • Searching for the secrets of success reveals little about the world of business but speaks volumes about the searchers—their aspirations and their desire for certainty. Once we’ve swept away these delusions, what then? When it comes to managing a company for high performance, a wise manager knows: • Any good strategy involves risk. If you think your strategy is foolproof, the fool may well be you. • Execution, too, is uncertain—what works in one company with one workforce may have different results elsewhere. • Chance often plays a greater role than we think, or than successful managers usually like to admit. • The link between inputs and outcomes is tenuous. Bad outcomes don’t always mean that managers made mistakes; and good outcomes don’t always mean they acted brilliantly. • But when the die is cast, the best managers act as if chance is irrelevant—persistence and tenacity are everything. Will all of this guarantee success? Of course not. But I suspect it will improve your chances of success, which is a more sensible goal to pursue. And you won’t find yourself on the shore of a tropical island, wondering why, despite all your earnest efforts to follow the formula of success, the cargo planes still haven’t landed.

- When The Halo Effect was published in 2007, it wasn’t obvious that we were heading into tough times. The economy seemed to be humming on all cylinders. The Internet bubble of 2000 had receded in memory, and a new generation of companies were leading the charge. Google went public in 2004 and was posting impressive results. Apple was riding high on the strength of its iPod; the iPhone was new; and the iPad had not yet been released. Twitter, created in 2006, was rapidly gaining attention. The stock market set new records in the summer of 2007, and the S&P 500 went on to an all-time high of 1,576 on October 11. The most common example of the Halo Effect in 2007?

- At first, the search for blame focused on arcane financial instruments like credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and synthetic products backed by subprime mortgages. Of course, most people had little understanding of what those instruments did or how they could cause such damage. Plus, complex instruments were as much a symptom of the financial crisis as a cause. Even if swaps and debt obligations were partly to blame, that only pushed the question back one step. What had given rise to these sorts of mind-numbing instruments in the first place? A better explanation was needed, and one that was simpler and more satisfying. Soon the answer appeared. The real problem was greed ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=2993))

- Gordon Gekko may have had something else in mind when he said “Greed is good,” but for book titles, at least, it seems to be true. Yet it’s interesting to note that although greed appeared in the titles, it appeared less frequently in the subsequent text. Gillian Tett mentioned greed in the title of her book, but not once in 253 pages of text. Exactly what she meant by greed, and how it corrupted a dream and led to catastrophe, was never explained. Even so, blaming the financial collapse on greed made for a satisfying explanation, and soon it caught on. In late 2011, when the Occupy Wall Street ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=3017))

- movement was in full swing in Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park, one claim was heard above all others. A woman dressed in a blue hospital smock held a sign that read: “This R.N. is sickened by Wall Street greed.” Another sign read: “Where Did My Future Go? Greed Took It.” It’s tempting to see evidence of greed once something has gone wrong, but if we’re not careful, it’s just another example of the Halo Effect, this time linked to failure rather than used to explain success. Looking back, of course, we can always find evidence of greed. In his book, CNBC’s Charles Gasparino claimed that as early as the 1970s, Wall Street had been taking on excessive risk.

- clearly present at the time, why did reporters need three decades to notice it? Why would they not have exposed rampant greed had they perceived it, and saved us the grief of a recession? The answer should be obvious: as long as profits rolled in, very few people thought anything was wrong. Bankers and financiers were hailed for their contribution to economic growth. They were praised for helping the economy function smoothly. They contributed to our high standard of living. They created wealth. We may have envied their success, but we applauded their ingenuity—and as individual investors we benefitted from the rising value of our portfolios. Few wanted to call time while the music was playing. ([Location 3026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=3026))

- Some observers did warn us about a looming disaster, including Nouriel Roubini of New York University. Yet as long as the economy seemed healthy, such voices were dismissed as alarmists who didn’t understand the marvels of the marketplace. Of course, when financial markets crashed and burned—the S&P 500 hit a low of 683.38 in March 2009, a staggering loss of 46 percent in six months and 56 percent since the high in October 2007, just a year and a half before—we changed our minds. Now we saw things differently. All along, what seemed to be prosperity had been nothing more than greed—perhaps, in the words of Michiko Kakutani, layered and frosted.

- The profit motive is always present in private enterprise, and if seeking profit is a sign of greed, then greed is always present, too. The roots of the financial crisis are due less to a sudden surge of greed, but rather to a decline in our willingness to keep the profit motive in check. If modern day authors struggle with the concept of greed, we shouldn’t be surprised. In Plato’s Hipparchus, Socrates’ friend believes he understands the concept clearly: Greed is “an insatiable desire to profit.” But as Socrates points out, reasonable people seek profit, and no reasonable person seeks a loss. If greed is a desire for profit, it follows that reasonable people can be deemed as greedy. By the end of the dialogue, Socrates has turned the argument on its head by demonstrating to his friend that “it is those who love the good whom you call greedy.” In ancient Greece, just as today, greed is a slippery concept. We’re quick to affix the label after the fact, once we know how things turned out, but we have trouble seeing it in the present. Dictionaries aren’t much help, either. Webster’s Dictionary defines greed as “the state of excessive or reprehensible acquisitiveness.” Are human beings acquisitive? Many of us are. So when exactly does the urge to acquire become ([Location 3058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=3058))

- “excessive” or “reprehensible”? That’s harder to know. What’s reasonable for one person, in one economic climate, may be excessive for another. Greed is a convenient explanation with satisfying moral overtones, but as a sound explanation of the financial crisis, it falls short.

- hubris. With origins in Greek mythology, hubris refers to excessive pride that’s punished by the gods. It’s irresistible to think of hubris when something goes massively wrong. Why do executives pay large sums of money to acquire other companies, when empirical evidence suggests that most acquisitions fail? A convenient answer is hubris, the misplaced belief that whatever they undertake can be made to succeed. ([Location 3127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000NY128M&location=3127))

- By now, we know there are two problems here. First, if greed and hubris are to have any validity, they can’t just be inferred after the fact. We have to know them when we see them, and as we’ve seen already, that turns out to be problematic. Second, when we blame failure on the sins of greed and hubris, we imagine that we’ll avoid the misfortunes that have befallen others. After all, we think that greed and hubris describe other people, not us. Was the collapse of Bear Stearns really due to greed, hubris, and wretched excess? Did Lehmann Brothers really fail due to greed? If so, we can take comfort—because we don’t think those terms apply to us. And that’s a much more serious delusion.

- Lego’s turnaround was due largely to improved efficiency of operations and excellence in execution. Of course, if we’re not careful, we might imagine that any company with strong sales and profits must be efficient. We might conclude that it must execute well and also must be customer focused. Take any company with Wow revenues and profits, and it’s easy to say that its product designers managed to restore the Wow factor. That reflects a simplistic kind of thinking, where we begin with outcomes and make causal inferences. In fact, Lego’s excellence in operations was not merely inferred from results, but could be measured objectively—with metrics like product quality, throughput time, order fill rate, cost per unit, and more. Today, Lego is a very different company from the one described at the start of this book. It’s tempting to say that Lego has better leadership, but that only pushes the question back one step. It’s what the new CEO and his top executives did that made a difference. Similarly, it’s convenient to say Lego became more customer focused, but a closer look suggests Lego has always been focused on its customers; what made the difference was an improved internal focus, on operational efficiency. We might also claim Lego’s culture improved, and very likely an internal poll would show that morale is higher, but that is more likely the result of improved performance than the cause. It’s entirely predictable that employees are happier and more committed than they were in 2004. Of course. All else equal, employees at high performing companies will always be more satisfied. What really drives company performance? The fundamental things apply. Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation. Which is precisely what Lego did. Bestow all the Halos you wish, as gurus and journalists and self-described experts will always be ready to do, but the truth is often simpler. Our task is to see that truth more clearly.
