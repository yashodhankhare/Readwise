## Highlights
- For most Americans, the economy is like the plumbing: something to ignore as long as it’s working. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=262))
- After years of interviewing policy makers, investors, and business leaders, I have found that the economy in the real world often differs from the economy in ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=275))
- Understanding where the American economy is going depends increasingly on decisions in Frankfurt and Beijing, not just New York and Washington. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=296))
- In the long run, though, a country becomes rich or stagnates depending on whether it has the right mix of people, capital, and ideas. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=346))
- The average Chinese was poorer in 1952 than in 1820. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=360))
- So why do some countries grow and some stagnate? In a nutshell, growth rests on two building blocks: population and productivity. 1. Population determines how many workers a country will have. 2. Productivity, or output per worker, ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=361))
- determines how much each worker earns. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=364))
- Medicine has made countless breakthroughs that enable us to live longer, healthier lives, but it hasn’t yet eradicated epidemics. For the same reason, both our wealth and our understanding of the economy have advanced ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=558))
- tremendously but we haven’t yet abolished the business cycle. Business cycles are an unavoidable and largely unpredictable feature of market economies. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=559))
- Business cycles and market cycles reinforce each other. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=566))
- Every business expansion eventually dies. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=571))
- Only the cause of death changes. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=571))
- These imbalances inevitably unwind. Just as people often get sick faster than they get better, bear markets are more violent than bull markets and unemployment rises more quickly than it falls. The event that ends these imbalances ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=572))
- and thus the business cycle is seldom the same. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=574))
- There is one common element to almost all modern business cycles. As the economist Rudi Dornbusch wrote in 1998, “None of the post-war expansions died of natural causes, they were all murdered by the Fed.” ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=580))
- Economists and policy makers often miss fatal imbalances ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=606))
- because they’re looking in the wrong place. Having vaccinated everyone against whatever killed the last business cycle, they fail to spot the virus that infects the current one. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=606))
- How do you know a recession has occurred? Easy: a press release goes out. In 1920, a group of academics formed the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to promote better economic analysis. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=609))
- Because the declaration of the start and end of a recession comes many months after the fact, ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=614))
- it’s about as useful to investors as an autopsy is to an emergency room physician. The NBER would rather be right than early. Theirs is not the only definition of recession out there; it’s simply the most popular. Sometimes recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=615))
- of declining GDP. This is not very practical, though, because GDP is often revised. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=617))
- Harry Truman said “a recession [is] when your neighbor loses his job; it’s a depression when you lose yours.” One rule ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=633))
- of thumb, according to the Economist, is that a depression is a contraction in economic activity of at least 10 percent or lasting at least three years. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=634))
- Financial crises don’t always produce depressions, but they often lead to severe ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=639))
- recessions with unusually weak recoveries. That’s because the assets acquired during the boom collapse in value, but the debt doesn’t: it must still be repaid. The stagnation that followed the collapse of Japanese stock and land prices in the early 1990s is an example. Many ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=640))
- Japanese companies were left insolvent, meaning their debts far exceeded their assets, and were determined to pay down debt, a process called deleveraging. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=642))
- Three years after the recession ended in 2009, almost a quarter of homeowners with mortgages still owed more than their houses were worth. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=645))
- The most popular way of tracking the ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=674))
- economy is by looking at its four principal categories of spending. If the economy is an airplane, then its four engines are consumers, businesses, government, and exports. Its speed depends on the power of all of these engines. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=675))
- Consumer spending represents the largest engine on the airplane, accounting for about two-thirds of GDP. It is primarily driven by household ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=681))
- income; when wages and jobs go up, spending usually follows. It is also driven by wealth. When home prices or stocks go up a lot, consumers feel wealthier and spend more: ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=682))
- But because a house is such a big commitment and so sensitive to interest ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=694))
- rates, it’s the first thing consumers postpone when interest rates rise or they lose their jobs. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=695))
- After consumers, business investment is the next most important component of GDP. It comes in ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=705))
- three types: inventories, buildings, or equipment. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=706))
- What government spends on actual services and supplies, such as tanks, teachers, and park ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=727))
- rangers, shows up in GDP, but not when it simply transfers money to people—such as Social Security benefits and bond interest. That money only affects GDP when the recipient spends it. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=728))
- John Kenneth Galbraith once remarked that “The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=782))
- Lots of detailed economic forecasts are available for free (though remember: Advice is worth what you pay for it!). ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=787))
- Of the many leading indicators you can look to, financial markets are among the best. Investors are constantly sifting millions of bits of new information—from ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=799))
- corporate earnings to the corn harvest—and what they learn is instantly reflected in the prices of shares, commodities, and bonds. The stock market will often signal a turn in the economy 1 to 12 months ahead of time. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=800))
- It seems cruel to label something like unemployment as natural, so economists also call this the nonaccelerating inflation rate of ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=918))
- unemployment, or NAIRU, because below this level, firms have to jack up pay to attract qualified workers. Those higher wages eventually lead to higher prices and inflation. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=919))
- The natural rate of unemployment is to economics what black holes are to physics: ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=921))
- We know it’s there but we can’t really see it. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=921))
- Simply calling yourself unemployed is not enough to be counted as unemployed. The official definition is quite precise: You have to be available and have looked for work in the four weeks before the government takes its survey. You do not, however, have to be ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=947))
- collecting unemployment insurance. In 2011, this official unemployment rate averaged 8.9 percent. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=949))
- The employment report can leave you scratching your head. For instance, you may hear that in one month employment fell, which is bad, but ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=960))
- so did the unemployment rate, which is good. Why might this happen? There are two main reasons. 1. Participation bounces around. Some people counted as unemployed (and therefore part of the labor force) one ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=961))
- month may not be the next, because they gave up looking for work, went back to school, or retired. When unemployment falls because of a drop in participation, it is usually a bad sign. Conversely, if unemployment rises because of higher participation, it is a ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=964))
- good sign. 2. Sometimes the two surveys diverge. The payroll report may find fewer jobs while the household report finds more people employed. This can happen because employment surveys, like opinion polls, have margins ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=965))
- of error, and different results are normal, statistical noise. Or it may result from the fact that the two surveys define employment differently. Someone working two jobs is counted twice in the payroll survey but just once in the household survey. Nannies, farm ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=967))
- workers, and the self-employed are counted in the household survey but not in the payroll survey. If the two surveys go in different directions, you should usually trust the payroll survey because its sample is much larger, and its job ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=969))
- count is constantly revised as more complete information is received. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=972))
- Another important job market indicator is the number of new claims that states receive for unemployment insurance. Because the U.S. Department ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=975))
- of Labor reports total new claims each Thursday, this number is one of the earliest indicators of a shift in the health of the economy. The numbers are volatile, though. Holidays and bad weather can play havoc with the trend. ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=976))
- When the demand for all goods and services runs ahead of the supply (i.e., potential output), inflation rises. When demand falls short of ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1094))
- potential, inflation falls. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1095))
- When unemployment is below its natural rate, workers are better able to win raises. This relationship was captured by Alban William Phillips, a New Zealand economist. The Phillips Curve, which shows an inverse relationship between ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1095))
- unemployment and inflation, is at the heart of the new Keynesian inflation model. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1097))
- Gold and commodity prices are much better measures of the fear of inflation than predictors of inflation. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1200))
- If you spend more than you earn, you cover the difference by running up your credit card, running down your savings, or cashing in some investments. For a country, the ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1426))
- equivalent is running a current account deficit—paying foreigners more for imports, interest, and dividends than it receives from them. ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1428))
- We measure a country’s dealings with the rest of the world with the balance of payments, which has two sides: the current account and the capital account. The current ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1487))
- account includes money we send to foreigners for services rendered: imports and exports of goods like oil and cars and services like tourism, investment income such as interest on bonds and profits that corporate subsidiaries send back to the head office, and transfers, such as money ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1489))
- immigrants send home. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1491))
- Betting on currencies is best left for those with more money than pride. A country that runs a $10 current account deficit finances it by attracting a net $10 worth of capital; that is, it runs a capital account surplus of ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1493))
- exactly the same size. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1495))
- The two are supposed to equal, but seldom do. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1500))
- Whether a country should have its own currency depends on what’s important: the solidarity and efficiency that comes from sharing a currency with ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1545))
- another country; or the flexibility of keeping it separate. The architects of the euro thought the first was more important; the crisis that erupted in 2009, a decade after its creation, suggests they underestimated the importance of the second. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1546))
- In the long run, the most important driver of the exchange rate is inflation. A country that persistently runs higher inflation than its trading partners will see its currency fall as its purchasing power declines. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1551))
- There’s lots of great theory behind currency ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1573))
- movements, but economists who study them have found that in the short run, the average investor is better off flipping a coin. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1574))
- The foreign exchange market is the biggest and deepest on the planet and the only one that truly trades around the clock. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1592))
- The gold standard collapsed in the 1930s but world leaders resurrected it in modified form under the Bretton Woods agreement, named for the New Hampshire resort where they met in 1944. Participating countries fixed their ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1600))
- currencies to the dollar and the United States fixed its dollar to gold; it would convert another country’s dollars to gold at $35 per ounce. The International Monetary Fund would police the system, lending money to a country that struggled to finance a current account deficit, and ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1602))
- permitting it to devalue if necessary to eliminate the deficit altogether. The system fell apart when other countries began to acquire large holdings of dollars, often by running trade surpluses with the United States. Eventually, it dawned on everyone that the ([Location 1604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1604))
- United States didn’t have enough gold to redeem all those dollars. Many countries began converting their dollars to gold, draining American reserves of the metal. In 1971, Richard Nixon shut the gold window: The United States would no longer exchange its ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1606))
- gold for dollars. The world entered a period of generally floating exchange rates. ([Location 1608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1608))
- As with any form of price-fixing, a fixed exchange rate won’t last if the fundamentals are all wrong, such as ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1616))
- excessive inflation or persistent current account deficits. To keep its currency from falling, a central bank must buy it in the open market in exchange for foreign currencies in its reserves. If reserves run low, it has to raise interest rates to persuade investors to buy its currency and ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1617))
- prop it up. But it may not have the fortitude to keep rates high if recession threatens. As a last resort, it can impose capital controls, which means people need the government’s permission before buying or selling its currency. In 2012 Argentines were banned from ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1619))

- When the nations of Europe emerged from the ashes of World War II, they concluded that one way to avoid a repeat ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1625))
- was to become so economically interdependent they would never go to war again. They banded together to form the European Economic Community, which became the European Union, allowing people and goods to move freely across borders. They also ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1626))
- sought to fix their exchange rates to each other. But diverging fundamentals would repeatedly force one or another member to devalue. George Soros made a fortune in 1992 correctly betting the British pound would not stay fixed against the deutsche mark. ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1627))
- The next few years were great for the British economy. The cheaper pound boosted exports, and lower interest rates boosted spending at home. This, of course, did not make Germany happy: Its companies had to labor under a more expensive deutsche mark. To make crises ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1630))
- and competitive devaluations a thing of the past, 11 European countries gave up their own currencies and in 1999 adopted the euro to be issued by the European Central Bank. (Eventually six more countries joined; Britain stayed out.) The theory was that without the ([Location 1631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1631))
- safety valve of inflation or devaluation, Italians, Spaniards, and Greeks would have to become as thrifty and productive as the Germans. This would take sacrifice, but it was worth it: The more irreversible Europe’s economic integration became, the less likely it was to ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1633))
- repeat the horror of World War II. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1635))
- Something surprising happened, though, after the euro was formed. Investors, no longer worried about devaluation, were happy to lend to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (the so-called GIIPS; for some reason they ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1636))
- objected to the original acronym, PIIGS) for only a tiny bit more than they lent to Germany. In some of these countries, households went on a borrowing spree; in others, the government did. Yet their fundamentals did not converge: The GIIPS continued to run higher inflation ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1637))

By 2007, they were running a collective current account deficit of $250 billion while Germany was running a surplus of almost exactly the same size.

- If nothing else gets in the way, a product should cost the same in two countries once their prices are converted to the same currency. In practice, they seldom do; but over long periods of time, currencies should move to the ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1666))

- In 2012, per capita income in the United States was $50,000 and in India, just $1,500. But that’s converting India’s currency, the rupee, to dollars at the going market rate. In fact, $1,500 buys much more in India than in the United States. A ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B9RCY0M&location=1672))
