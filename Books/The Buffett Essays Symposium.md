- Despite changing from the partnership to the corporate form, Buffett preserved Berkshire’s sense of partnership. The legacy is reflected in the first of 15 principles stated for decades in Berkshire’s “owners’ manual”: “While our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” The “Berkshire system,” as Munger dubbed it in 2015, differs significantly from prevailing practices at other large American corporations.

- Berkshire shareholders have unusually long holding periods. In the past decade, share turnover has been less than one percent compared to three, four, or five percent for other conglomerates, large insurance companies, or Berkshire’s formerly-public subsidiaries. At the symposium, when Berkshire’s shares were trading for $30,000 per share, Buffett stated that ninety percent of the shares had a basis of less ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=154))

- Berkshire only acquires companies with strong top management in place and then defers to them with scant supervision. All quotidian decisions qualify: advertising budget; product features and environmental quality; the ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=192))

- product mix and pricing. The same applies to decisions about hiring, merchandising, inventory, and receivables management. Berkshire’s deference extends to subsidiary decisions on succession to senior positions, including chief executive officer. Berkshire rarely transfers businesses between subsidiaries and hardly ever moves managers around. Berkshire has no retirement policy and many chief executives work into their seventies or eighties. Berkshire culture is designed as a permanent home for an eclectic mix of autonomous, self-reliant and thrifty, prosperous businesses.

- As you all know, Casey Stengel was the Yankee manager during those triumphant seasons. Like Warren Buffett, he attracted attention because, like Mr. Buffett, he was a winner. At the end of the day, month or year, you would check the standings and his Yankees would be on top. Unlike Mr. Buffett, however, Mr. Stengel did not write essays, did not write to the Yankees’ owners, players, or fans. Yet he had plenty to say and as a prelude to spending two days thinking about what Mr. Buffett has written over the past many years, I thought I might quote some of Mr. Stengel’s most astonishing remarks. In a vein that might have captured last night’s game, Stengel once said “Good pitching will always stop good hitting and vice versa.” On whether abstinence from drinking helped players play better baseball, Stengel said “It only helps if they can play.” On being decisive, the way you have to be as an investor, Stengel said “I made up my mind, but I made it up both ways.” On his good fortune as a successful manager—and perhaps a comment that Mr. Buffett might feel resonance with—Stengel said “You make your own luck; some people have bad luck all their lives.” And, lastly, on his future, Stengel said, in the spring ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=281))

- The biggest problem is not the terrible manager. The biggest problem is the mediocre manager—and that’s true everywhere. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=353))

- Let me explain it a little bit more. One of the themes that I always tell my students is the chorus from a Statler Brothers’ song: “Life gets complicated when you get past eighteen.” (Laughter.) ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=372))

- MILLSTEIN: We’re trying to compare two models. One is a Buffett model of significant ownership and really paying attention to what’s happening with management, and the TIAA-CREF model which is the epitome of the large public institution—which owns 1600 companies and really can’t pay attention to all of them. It’s impossible, but that is the way the world is going. When you track through the twenty-five ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=386))

- largest companies, you find virtually the same twenty-five institutions owning virtually the same twenty-five companies. Now, as an antitrust lawyer that gives me great concern, but I seem to be the only one in the room with that concern! However, that’s a fact of life. How does TIAA-CREF begin to identify Warren Buffett-type concerns amongst its 1600 companies? ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=389))

- BUFFETT: As a stockholder, I’m really only interested in the board accomplishing two ends. One is to get a first class manager and the second is to intervene in some way when even ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=457))

- that first class manager will have interests that are contrary to the interests of the owners. I think there are great difficulties in achieving both of those ends. I’ve been a director of, counting them up, seventeen publicly owned companies, not counting ones which we control (which probably shows a very dominant, masochistic gene) (laughter). But over that time I’ve wrestled with just these couple of problems and there may be processes that would improve them.

- If you get that first class chief executive—which is a top priority—he doesn’t have to be the best in the world, just a first class one. And I may agree with Jill to some extent—you may be able to turn a five into a five-and-a-half or something by having him consult with lots of other CEOs and get a lot of advice from the board. But my experience is that you don’t turn a five into an eight. I think you’re better off getting rid of the five and having him find something else to do in life and going out and acquiring an eight.

- The second problem is: even a first class chief executive has some interests that are in conflict with the shareholders. One is his or her own compensation. The second one gets into the acquisition category. There are psychic benefits to an executive of running a bigger show or just having more action or whatever that can be in conflict with the shareholders, even though that executive may be first class in other respects. The nature of acquisitions is that they get to the board at a point where if you turn them down you are rejecting the chief executive, you are embarrassing him in front of his troops, you’re doing all kinds of things. So, it just doesn’t happen. I have seen board after board approve deals that afterwards the board members say, “you know, I really didn’t think it was a very good idea but what could we do about it?” And there should be a better mechanism. But I’m not sure what it is. There should be a better mechanism, though, for a board to make those important decisions where a first class chief executive can have an absolutely different equation than the shareholders, weighing all of the personal economic and non-economic considerations.

- There should be a mechanism that enables the board to bring independent judgment on those in a way that doesn’t put the CEO in a position virtually where he or she has to resign or is embarrassed in front of the troops. And I would welcome any discussion on those matters. The compensation question where the first class executive could be in conflict with the owners, I think it gets abused some but I don’t think that it amounts to that much when compared with the other two questions—getting the right one and also ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=492))

- the question of acquisitions. I think it costs shareholders some money that’s unnecessary, and I think that a lot of the compensation schemes have been quite illogical, but I don’t think that they are overwhelming in terms of evaluation.

- Current Commentary “Stock selection and portfolio management are the keys to investment success. Warren popularized the concept of “focus investing,” a portfolio management approach that concentrates one’s bets on those stocks that have the highest probability of beating the market over the long term.” –Robert Hagstrom ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01DNY17FG&location=557))
