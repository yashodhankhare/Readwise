- sure that standup would help me become a better public speaker? Because science says so. “The brain doesn't pay attention to boring things,” notes John Medina, a biologist and author of the best-selling book Brain Rules. “Laughter triggers a dopamine release, which aids memory and information processing. It’s like a mental post-it note that tells your brain, remember this.” ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=200))

- Carmine Gallo is a news anchor turned author, columnist, and keynote speaker. In short, he’s a guy people actually want to listen to.

- are the three keys to public-speaking success according to Darren LeCroix, who brings incredible stories and captivating humor to conferences around the globe, even though he is the first to stress he was “born without a funny bone in his body.” Darren is a self-proclaimed “student of comedy” and touts himself as living proof that humor is a skill that can be learned.

- Most comedians will tell you it takes about seven years to make a living from comedy. Four hours a night for seven years means comedians invest roughly 1,428 hours of time each year to improving their craft.

- speeches in history have clocked in at less than 20 minutes. Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was 272 words and lasted two minutes. Winston Churchill’s “Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat” speech was 688 words. The most powerful emotional expression two humans can say to each other is just three words: “I,” “love,” and “cake.” ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=231))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- say) and delivery (how you say it). It is no different than typical speeches or presentations. TV slots for new comedians tend to be under five minutes, which forces them to continuously refine and refine and refine again in order to get maximum impact from each word. There is a saying in comedy that “a tight five is better than a sloppy fifteen.” Yet business presentations worldwide fail to abide by the same ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=238))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- principle. Instead, there tends to be a lot of sloppy fifteens. Why? The necessary stage time, structure, and conscious editing in order to make maximum impact just aren’t there—most people don’t have to speak often enough to get it. Conversely, the speakers who deliver their talk most tend to be the best and most polished. They know where the laugh lines are, they know what phrasing works best, and they know their timing.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- not by rote memorization. No notes, paper or cheat sheets allowed on stage. Have some stakes. Stakes are essential in live storytelling. What do you stand to gain or lose? Why is what happens in the story important to you? If you can’t answer this, then think of a different story. A story without stakes is an essay and is best experienced on the page, not the stage. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=441))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Start in the action. Have a great first line that sets up the stakes or grabs attention. No: “So I was thinking about climbing this mountain. But then I watched a little TV and made a snack and took a nap and my mom called and vented about her psoriasis then I did a little laundry (a whites load) (I lost another sock, darn it!) and then I thought about it again and decided I’d climb the mountain the next morning.” ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=446))

- Yes: “The mountain loomed before me. I had my hunting knife, some trail mix, and snow boots. I had to make it to the little cabin and start a fire before sundown or freeze to death for sure.” Steer clear of meandering endings. They kill a story! Your last line should be clear in your head before you start. Yes, bring the audience along with you as you contemplate what transpires in your story, but remember, ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=450))

- you are driving the story, and must know the final destination. Keep your hands on the wheel! Know your story well enough so you can have fun! Watching you panic to think of the next memorized line is harrowing for the audience. Make an outline, memorize your bullet points and play with the details. Enjoy yourself. Imagine you are at a dinner party, not a deposition. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=454))

- My story still had one big advantage over the other nine on that windy San Francisco night. It was funnier. The Moth won't tell you that your story has to be funny, but those that incorporate some humor always do very well. I have now won a number of storytelling nights and performed alongside some of the biggest names nationally, and humor always plays as big a part in my stories as it does in my victories.

- exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," Ronald Reagan said during the 1984 presidential debates when asked if, at 73, he was too old to be President. The line, a timeless example of Reagan's sense of humor, even roused a laugh from Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale. The Republican actor-turned-statesman and famed storyteller won re-election in the most lopsided victory in the history of American presidential politics. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=520))
- We are wired to love laughter. Our brains make this so by releasing dopamine. Dopamine feels awesome, so by making your audience laugh during your presentation or speaking event, you can actually make your audience feel good, giving your speech a natural endorphin-fueled evolutionary advantage over those who opted for a typical, boring business presentation.

- relevant to everybody with a general topic, and then we make it relevant to us by connecting it to our own personal story. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=546))
- Entertaining or not, if a speaker finds himself muddied in the details, he’ll likely have lost his audience by the time he gets to the funny part. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=558))
- The root of every good joke really is the surprise element, the punch line. And the punch line often releases an intentionally built-up tension.   A great example of this tension comes from the book Good to Great by Jim Collins. In this book, Jim details a speech delivered by the ex-CEO of Kimberly-Clark, Darwin Smith, a man described by CNN as one of the 10 greatest company leaders of all time. Smith stood up and commenced his talk by saying, “Okay. I want everybody to rise and ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=576))
- give a moment of silence.”  Everybody looked around confused, wondering who had died. They looked down uncomfortably and stared at their shoes in silence. Darwin allowed this process to continue for a period of time. Then he looked down at the group and said in the somber tone, “That was a moment of silence for Procter and Gamble.”  The place went bananas. At the time, Procter and Gamble was Kimberly-Clark’s biggest competitor. Intentionally building up the tension created the laughter ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=580))
- that followed, which was essentially a nervous release of energy. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S4F493C&location=584))
- The punch line shatters the intentionally built-up interest and expectation. According to Corporate Humorist John Kindle, "A funny line is sometimes said to be like a train wreck. You know where the train (your train of thought) has been, you think you know where it's going, but then you're surprised when it goes off track."

- The main takeaways from this section are that we need to take our stories, work to extract the main funny item and feed that into a joke structure. This is going to be a process we’re going to repeat over and over again as we prepare to build humor items into our presentations and speaking.

- The often-unmentioned third element is how you write it. The same can be said for public speaking. Every great presentation, like every great joke, is first crafted with a pen, pencil or keypad.
