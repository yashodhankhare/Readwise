## Highlights
- Rather, this book might best be placed in the genre of cliometrics, applying economics and econometric methods to understanding history—a chimera, a genre-crossing intellectual exploration of the field of investing grounded in rigorous empiricism.

- My most important discovery—a finding that changed the course of my career—is that the future is far less predictable than most investors think. The best places to make money in markets are where others are too confident in their forecasts. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM6MW8P3&location=92))

- Future earnings growth was essentially completely unpredictable. Indeed, the researchers found that the simple rule of predicting that each company’s earnings would grow at the long-run average growth rate of GDP would have been more accurate than relying on analysts’ estimates of future growth, or those implied by market valuation ratios.

- If most market participants are wrong most of the time, then the path to victory requires analyzing the forecasts embedded in markets and taking the other end of the trade when investor opinions become too unanimous in their optimism or pessimism. This would suggest that the best investment strategies come not from feats of brilliance, insight, or clairvoyance, but rather from embracing just how little we know about the future, and then capitalizing on the tendency of others to overestimate their own foresight. I call it betting against hubris. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DM6MW8P3&location=253))
