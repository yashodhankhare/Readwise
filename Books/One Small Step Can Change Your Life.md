## Highlights
- “Small things with great love. . . . It is not how much we do, but how much love we put into the doing. And it is not how much we give, but how much love we put into the giving. To God there is nothing small.” —Mother Teresa ([Location 20](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=20))

- This book will show you how to harness the power of kaizen: using small steps to accomplish large goals. Kaizen is an ancient philosophy captured in this powerful statement from the Tao Te Ching: “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Though it is rooted in ancient philosophy, it is just as practical and effective when applied to our hectic modern lives. Kaizen has two definitions: using very small steps to improve a habit, a process, or product using very small moments to inspire new products and inventions ([Location 35](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=35))

- “We make so many cars in so many different places with so many people. Our greatest fear is that as we keep growing, our ability to maintain the discipline of kaizen will be lost.” —Teruo Suzuki General Manager, Human Resources ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=81))

- Kaizen: The Spiritual Side Before inviting you to begin your journey  through this book and to experience the power and possibilities of kaizen, I would like to cover one more topic: spirituality. By this I do not mean necessarily a faith in God, but a sense of purpose and a feeling of fulfillment. Kaizen is as much a philosophy or belief system as it is a strategy for success in changing or enhancing some behavior. There are two elements of the spirit, or purpose, in which kaizen plays an essential role: service and gratitude. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, expressed it, “You can’t live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=90))

- repay you.” Other luminaries have spoken of the essential element of service: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?” —Martin Luther King Jr. “Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier.” —Mother Teresa ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=95))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Service is even an essential aspect of the business applications of kaizen. Each employee in a kaizen culture is asked to look each day for ways to improve the process or product: lowering cost, increasing quality, and always—I repeat, always—in the service of the customer. Very often, successful corporations such as Amazon, Starbucks, and Southwest Airlines define themselves as primarily devoted to service. As Colleen Barrett, a former Southwest CEO, says, “We’re in the customer-service business; we happen to offer air transportation. We consider our employees to be our number one customer, our passengers our second, and our shareholders our third.” Kaizen demands that every small change be to the benefit of the customer.

- When famous songwriter Warren Zevon was suffering from terminal cancer, David Letterman asked him what wisdom he gleaned from his illness. Zevon’s answer was pure kaizen: “Enjoy every sandwich.” Some quotes on service and gratitude to begin your exploration of kaizen: “I long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.” —Helen Keller “We have to learn to live happily in the present moment, to touch the peace and joy that are available now.” —Thich Nhat Hanh, Buddhist Zen master “Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” —Albert Einstein “I would rather have it said, ‘He lived usefully’ than ‘He died rich.’ ” —Benjamin Franklin ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=116))

- Of course, there are as many ways to achieve success as there are successful people. But over the course of thirty-two years in practice, I’ve had the satisfaction of watching countless clients use an unusual method to create lasting change. They’ve applied the same simple principles to improve their lives in just about every way. They’ve lost weight (and kept it off); begun an exercise program (and stuck with it); kicked addictions (for good); created strong relationships (the kind that last); become organized (without sliding when things get hectic); and improved their careers (and continued to do so, long after their performance reports are filed). If you’d like to make a change—one that sticks—I hope you’ll read on. This method is something of an open secret, one that has circulated among Japanese businesses for decades and is used daily by private citizens across the globe. It is a natural, graceful technique for achieving goals and maintaining excellence. It can slip into even the tightest of schedules. And in this book, I’ll share this strategy with you. But first, I want you to meet Julie. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=138))

- “When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens—and when it happens, it lasts.” —John Wooden, one of the most successful coaches in the history of college basketball ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=213))

- Kaizen Versus Innovation Kaizen and innovation are the two major strategies people use to create change. Where innovation demands shocking and radical reform, all kaizen asks is that you take small, comfortable steps toward improvement.

- But the psychology of the individual is a little different. In fact, a surprising number of my clients intuitively perceive what it took me years of observation to see: that low-key change helps the human mind circumnavigate the fear that blocks success and creativity.

- Eventually, my clients are startled to discover that they have reached their goals with no additional conscious effort on their part. How does this happen? I believe that the kaizen approach is a highly effective method of building new neural connections in the brain, an idea I’ll address in more detail in the coming chapter. As one client often said to me, “The steps were so small I couldn’t fail!” ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=273))

- Kaizen is an effective, enjoyable way to achieve a specific goal, but it also extends a more profound challenge: to meet life’s constant demands for change by seeking out continual—but always small—improvement. Through decades of working with people of all stripes, with unique strengths and needs, I’ve developed a theory about why kaizen works when all else fails. I outline this theory in the first chapter. The succeeding chapters are devoted to the personal application of kaizen and encompass six different strategies. These strategies include: asking small questions to dispel fear and inspire creativity thinking small thoughts to develop new skills and habits—without moving a muscle taking small actions that guarantee success solving small problems, even when you’re faced with an overwhelming crisis bestowing small rewards to yourself or others to produce the best results recognizing the small but crucial moments that everyone else ignores ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=279))

- Why Kaizen Works All changes, even positive ones, are scary. Attempts to reach goals through radical or revolutionary means often fail because they heighten fear. But the small steps of kaizen disarm the brain’s fear response, stimulating rational thought and creative play.

- Change is frightening. This human fact is unavoidable whether the change is seemingly insignificant (visiting a new nightclub) or life-altering (having a baby). This fear of change is rooted in the brain’s physiology, and when fear takes hold, it can prevent creativity, change, and success.

- I noticed that when adults came to see a physician and talked about their emotional pain, they chose words such as stress, anxiety, depression, nervous, and tense. But when I observed children talking about their feelings, they talked about being scared, sad, or afraid. It’s my conclusion that the reason for the difference in word choice had less to do with the symptoms and more to do with expectations. The children assumed their feelings were normal. Children know they live in a world they cannot control. They have no say in whether their parents are in a good mood or bad, or whether their teachers are nice or mean. They understand that fear is part of their lives. Adults, I believe, assume that if they are living correctly, they can control the events around them. When fear does appear, it seems all wrong—so adults prefer to call it by the names for psychiatric disease. Fear becomes a disorder, something to put in a box with a tidy label of “stress” or “anxiety.” This approach to fear is unproductive. If your expectation is that a well-run life should always be orderly, you are setting yourself up for panic and defeat. If you assume that a new job or relationship or health goal is ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=374))

- supposed to be easy, you will feel angry and confused when fear arises—and you’ll do anything to make it disappear. We may not even be aware of the exaggerated, desperate measures we take to get rid of fear. This common but counterproductive phenomenon is captured in a familiar joke: A drunk is on his hands and knees looking for his keys under a streetlight. A policeman approaches him and asks, “What are you doing?” The drunk replies in a slurred voice, “I’m looking for my keys.” The policeman further inquires, “Where did you drop them?” The drunk says, “Over there,” pointing to the end of the city block. The policeman scratches his head and says, “If you dropped the keys over there, why are you looking for them over here?” And the drunk replies, “Because the light is better over here.” When life gets scary and difficult, we tend to look for solutions in places where it is easy or at least familiar to do so, and not in the dark, uncomfortable places where real solutions might lie.

- But if you expect fear, you can approach it in a compassionate manner. It helps to remember that when we want to change, rational thoughts don’t always guide actions, and fear can well up in the most ordinary of places.

- The hippocampus’s main criterion for storage is repetition, so asking that question over and over gives the brain no choice but to pay attention and begin to create answers. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=450))

- Parents intuitively know to ask questions, then answer them, then ask again and see if the child can recall. They understand that the brain loves questions. Again and again, I’ve seen dramatically different effects between asking questions and issuing commands—and that’s not just during business meetings, but in personal and even medical situations as well. For example, we’re all so used to receiving instructions for improving our health, we could recite them in our sleep: Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables, reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats, exercise regularly, drink enough water, and so on. Yet these repeated commands obviously fail to engage most of us, as the national rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes testify.

- I’ve found that patients in the family-practice clinic at UCLA have much better success in meeting health guidelines when I suggest they pose kaizen questions to themselves: If health were my first priority, what would I be doing differently today? What is one way I can remind myself to drink more water? How could I incorporate a few more minutes of exercise into my daily routine?

- By asking small, gentle questions, we keep the fight-or-flight response in the “off” position. Kaizen questions such as “What’s the smallest step I can take to be more efficient?” or “What can I do in five minutes a day to reduce my credit-card debt?” or “How could I find one source of information about adult education classes in my city?” allow us to bypass our fears. They allow the brain to focus on problem-solving and, eventually, action. Ask a question often enough, and you’ll find your brain storing the questions, turning them over, and eventually generating some interesting and useful responses.

- Shhh . . . Don’t Wake the Amygdala! Make your questions small, and you reduce the chances of waking the amygdala and arousing debilitating fear.

- You want to do something creative: write a story or a song, paint a picture, dream up your perfect career, or come up with a zinger of a solution to an office problem. But you have no idea where to start. Your mind keeps coming up empty. During times like these, kaizen can help you summon your powers of inspiration. Although you can’t force your brain to cough up creative ideas on demand, you can program it to launch the imaginative process simply by asking yourself a small question. Here are some of the most popular small questions my clients use for creativity. Feel free to come up with your own. Whatever question you use, your challenge is to ask it with a gentle and patient spirit. When you use a harsh or urgent tone with yourself, fear will clog the creative process. What’s one thing I wish to contribute to the world with my book, poem, song, or painting? Whom could I ask for help or inspiration? What is special about my creative process/talents/business team? What type of work would excite and fulfill me? Remember: If you repeat the question over the course of several days or weeks—or for however long it takes—the ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=520))

- Some of my clients, including Grace, thrive when they are “assigned” to leave answers to their small questions in my voice mail. But not everyone has a therapist (and not every therapist likes an overflowing voice mailbox). These people might try calling a friend or relative. If that’s too scary, another possibility is writing their answers down in a journal or leaving messages on their own answering machines.

- I’ve run into many people who are unhappy in their current careers but cannot think of anything else they’d like to do. Most of these people have been trained to think of a job as a way to earn money—and that’s all. Their brains have never been programmed to answer the question What kind of job could bring me pride and pleasure? In this case, I suggest finding friends who enjoy their jobs and asking: What is one aspect of your job that makes you happy? The answers can stimulate thought about the sources of pleasure at work.

- Here are just a few ideas to get you started. Feel free to come up with your own. If you are unhappy but aren’t sure why, try asking yourself this: If I were guaranteed not to fail, what would I be doing differently? The question’s whimsical quality makes it safe for the brain to answer truthfully, and it can produce some surprising answers that lend clarity to your goals. Someone who is stalled out at work may discover that she really wants to quit and study landscape architecture instead; another might be shocked to find that all she really wants is the courage to ask her boss to say “hello” in the mornings. If you are trying to reach a specific goal, ask yourself every day: What is one small step I could take toward reaching my goal? Whether you ask your question aloud or in the privacy of your own thoughts, please take a kind tone with yourself, the same you’d use for a beloved friend. Recall the experience of Patrick, the manufacturing manager who discovered that a hyper, exasperated approach did nothing to produce creative answers. It’s a truism in business that a corporation must never grow complacent but must always seek out ways to improve. I often wish that more people would apply this philosophy to their relationships, careers, and bodies, instead of taking these gifts for granted. If you are generally content with your life but would like to remain alert to possibilities for excellence, you can ask yourself a slightly different version of the question above: ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=647))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What is one small step I could take to improve my health (or relationships, or career, or any other area)? This question is designed to remain open, to give the brain plenty of room for play. Be prepared for surprising answers! Often we focus our attention on the people we think are most “important”—a key employee, the problem child, or our mate, leading us to ignore others who may have valuable insights for us. Try asking yourself: Is there a person at work or in my personal life whose voice and input I haven’t heard in a long time? What small question could I ask this person? This question is for anyone who has a festering conflict with another person, whether a boss, employee, in-law, or neighbor, and is trying to get past this problem. Every day, ask yourself: What’s one good thing about this person? You may soon find yourself seeing the person’s strengths with the same clarity and in the same detail as you do their weaknesses. If you tend to feel pessimistic or negative, try asking yourself this question: What is one small thing that is special about me (or my spouse, or my organization)? If you continue to ask yourself this question over time, you’ll program your brain to look for what’s good and right, and you may eventually decide to capitalize on these shining aspects, perhaps with a new marketing campaign at work or ideas for family activities at home.

Ian Robertson, one of the world’s leading authorities on brain rehabilitation, theorized in his book Mind Sculpture that during mind sculpture, the brain doesn’t understand that it’s not really performing the imagined activity. Phelps’s brain sent the precise messages to his muscles that were necessary to propel him to Olympic history. In effect, his brain and body were practicing the events, over and over, without mistakes. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=698))

- and Jack Nicklaus, have used this kind of imagery to improve their skills. But these men were already masters of their games when they used mind sculpture. What about the rest of us, who need help with tasks we find frightening, such as chatting with an attractive dating prospect or sticking to a diet? This small kaizen strategy is actually perfect for anyone who’s struggled and struggled to achieve a goal that remains out of reach. That’s because it’s such a safe, comfortable step to take that it allows you to walk right past any mental obstacles that have held you back. Mind sculpture is so effective in neutralizing fear that it’s even worked for earthquake or accident victims who suffer from flashbacks. They imagine themselves inside the flashback—but they envision a positive resolution. The same goes for people with recurring nightmares: I ask them to relive the dream, but with a happy ending. Dozens of my clients have used this technique, and for each one the nightmare or flashback has vanished within a matter of days.

- For the first month, Michael was to spend thirty seconds each day performing mind sculpture. I asked him to imagine giving a person from his department a specific, detailed compliment in an enthusiastic tone of voice, as if there were no problems at all with this person’s work. He was to imagine how he would stand in front of the person, how it would feel to approach the person with a relaxed, open posture, how his voice would sound, and what any ambient sounds or smells might be. I wanted Michael to start with compliments for a couple of reasons. Like most people, Michael found it easier to give compliments than criticism. But I also knew that a likely result of letting trouble in his department percolate for too long was that Michael would see his employees as nothing but a collection of problems. And from another perspective, psychological research clearly shows that people who feel underappreciated tend to resent criticism and ignore the advice they’re given. By practicing mind sculpture for giving compliments, Michael was not only learning to feel comfortable doing something that felt unnatural to him; He was also developing a skill that would increase the satisfaction and productivity of his employees. I asked Michael if he’d mind extending this exercise to his family. I suspected that his silence extended to his home life and that his loved ones would appreciate a little kaizen sent their way. I asked him to spend some of his thirty-second periods imagining giving specific compliments to his wife or one of his three children.

- month I asked Michael if he could continue to imagine one compliment but to add one critical comment as well. He was to imagine himself with a specific employee, feeling his own facial muscles moving and his body posture remaining open as he delivered these messages in a kind, matter-of-fact tone of voice. I also asked him to actually give one compliment out loud to someone at home every day. Two weeks into the second month, my phone rang. “My wife and kids are asking what’s wrong with me!” Michael said, clearly pleased with himself. His family had returned his compliments with such love and warmth that mind sculpture and kaizen now had real credibility with him. “Now,” I suggested, “how about calling me once a day and leaving your one compliment and one criticism for an employee on my voice mail?” He could practice his tone of voice that way, and I’d return the call with feedback about the specificity of the comments and whether his tone had reached the level of neutrality he sought. Mind sculpture—plus the small, active steps that mental rehearsal enabled him to take—taught Michael a new set of skills. It also gave him a taste for the ease and the rewards of applying them. At the end of our three months together, he conducted the belated reviews without any prompting and he found himself stopping in the hallways to give fifteen or twenty seconds of immediate feedback. For several years, I received an annual holiday card from Michael. His family had never been better, the ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=752))

- Kaizen Technique A Mind Sculpture How-To Whatever your goal, mind sculpture is a terrific way to ease into your kaizen program for change. In true kaizen fashion, I’ll break mind sculpture down into several small steps: Isolate a task either that you are afraid to do or that makes you uncomfortable. Try to give yourself at least a month before you actually have to perform this activity. Decide how many seconds you’re willing to devote to mind sculpture for this task each day. Make sure you allot seconds, not minutes or hours; the time commitment should be so low that you can easily fulfill its requirements every single day. Repetition is essential: Whatever you do repeatedly, even if for only a few seconds at a time, the brain decides must be important and so begins committing cells to the new behavior. When you are ready to practice mind sculpture, sit or… ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=764))

- What do they look like? See the expressions on their faces, the clothes they are wearing, their posture. Now expand your imagination to the rest of your senses. What are the sounds and smells and flavors and textures around you? Without moving an actual muscle, imagine that you are performing the task. What are the words you use? What does your voice sound like and how does it resonate through your body? What are your physical gestures? Imagine a positive response to your activity. If you are mind sculpting for public speaking, for example, see the audience leaning forward in their seats, looking responsive and interested. Hear the scratch of pencil on paper as some particularly enthusiastic people take notes. When your allotted time for mind sculpture has become habitual and even fun, you may find that you are automatically performing the formerly difficult activity with enthusiasm. But if you’re not ready for the real thing, that’s perfectly okay. Never force the process of kaizen; it works only if you let change happen in a comfortable and easy manner. You may instead choose to increase the time you spend on mind sculpture—but once again, you should increase slowly,… ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=772))

- Once you feel comfortable using mind sculpture for this task (and it may take days or weeks or even longer), imagine a worst-case scenario and how you would respond effectively to it. A public speaker might feel nervous sweat run down his face as he sees the audience members looking bored and hears them whispering among themselves. He would then imagine how he would like to speak, gesture, and feel in that situation. When you feel ready to take on the actual task, try out some small steps at first.

- Kaizen Tip Below are some suggestions for applying mind sculpture to specific goals. And remember this: Small questions are a powerful way to generate ideas for mind sculpture. Just ask yourself: What is a tiny step I could make to achieve my goal? Let the question stew for a few days or weeks. When you have an answer, you can use mind sculpture to imagine yourself taking that step. If you want to learn portion control, imagine yourself at the table. See a plate in front of you with food remaining on it. What does the food look like? How does it smell and taste? Now imagine putting down your utensil, even though some food remains on the plate. How does the utensil sound as it meets the plate? Pick up your napkin from your lap and note its texture. Put the napkin down and hear your chair and feel your muscles move as you push back from the table. Imagine yourself getting up and effortlessly ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=797))

- walking away. If self-directed anger is blocking your path to change, try this: Consider a situation in which you are often judgmental or harsh with yourself. Since it’s much easier for most self-critical people to be kind to others, try imagining that you are comforting a friend or a small child who has made the same mistake or has the same flaw you see in yourself. Hear that person saying the damaging things you say to yourself, such as “I’m a bad person” or “I’ll never get it right!” Now imagine yourself comforting that person. Experience the love and compassion you’d feel toward someone who is suffering in this way. What gestures and words would you use? If you’d like to repair a ruptured personal relationship, first think of one thing the other person does to push your buttons, leading you to overreact or to avoid that person. Now picture that person performing the irritating behavior and imagine yourself responding in a manner you’d find ideal. How would your body feel? Would it cool down instead of heating up? What would you like to say and in which tone of voice? What posture would you like to assume? Many of us need help learning to relax. Choose a recurring scenario that frequently causes you to become irritated or impatient (driving in heavy traffic provokes these responses in many of us). Then imagine yourself in that situation, feeling a sense of internal poise and demonstrating good grace toward others. If you’re trying to improve your response to heavy traffic, imagine yourself in the car, your muscles remaining relaxed, your breathing deep and even, and your body cool as the drivers around you honk their horns and behave aggressively. Imagine yourself feeling kindness toward the other drivers—and maybe feel yourself ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=804))

- Small actions are at the heart of kaizen. By taking steps so tiny that they seem trivial or even laughable, you’ll sail calmly past obstacles that have defeated you before. Slowly—but painlessly!—you’ll cultivate an appetite for continued success and lay down a permanent new route to change.

- We are so accustomed to living with minor annoyances that it’s not always easy to identify them, let alone make corrections. But these annoyances have a way of acquiring mass and eventually blocking your path to change. By training yourself to spot and solve small problems, you can avoid undergoing much more painful remedies later.

- Ohno had a different idea, one that was apparently influenced by Dr. W. Edwards Deming’s idea of small, continual improvement. Ohno placed a cord at each step along the assembly line, and any worker who noticed a defect could pull the cord and bring the line to a dead stop. Ohno made sure that engineers, suppliers, and line workers were on hand to fully identify the problem and craft a solution, preferably on the spot. Every other manufacturer found this idea absurd, a violation of the basic tenets of mass manufacturing. How could a company assemble products swiftly when the line could be stopped on a worker’s whim to correct a minor defect? Contrary to this common wisdom, Ohno’s method proved to be the most successful means of building automobiles. Fixing a small problem on the scene prevented much bigger problems later. Sadly, though, not every business has learned from Toyota’s experience, and the temptation remains strong to gloss over what appear to be minor problems. The oil and gas company BP, for example, ignored 356 “small” oil spills that occurred between 2001 and 2007. Regulators twice issued concerns, but experts from the petroleum industry dismissed them. It wasn’t until 2010 that BP was forced to recognize the consequences of ignoring these “small” warnings: That was the year when an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caused 200 ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1111))

- Kaizen Technique Learning to Spot Small Problems Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20, and it’s always easier to spot a crack in the ceiling after rain has soaked the plaster. But it’s possible to train yourself to see small warning signs more clearly. Try these exercises to sharpen your small-problem vision: Recall a major mistake you’ve made at some point in your life. Now, take some time to consider whether there were small signs along the way indicating that things were not going according to your plans or wishes. What measures did you have to take to correct the problem? Did you halt your “assembly line” and start all over? Did you ignore the problem in the hopes you’d achieve your result on time anyway? Identify one small mistake you have made today, without becoming angry with yourself for making this mistake.

- This single act, especially if you perform it daily, will raise your awareness of small mistakes. Now ask yourself whether the small mistake you identified in exercise 2 reflects a larger problem, or if it has the potential to gather velocity. (If you misplaced your car keys, for example, ask yourself if you are trying to juggle too many things at once, or are so distracted that you might eventually make a more serious mistake.) By paying attention to this mistake, you will reduce its frequency. If you feel this mistake indicates a more significant problem in your life, ask yourself: What kaizen step can I take to correct this situation? Ask yourself whether there are ways in which you irritate your family, friends, co-workers, or customers. Your new awareness alone reduces the probability that you will make this mistake again, but you should also ask yourself whether this mistake is part of a bigger problem. If you can peg the error to a larger issue, you’ll give yourself further incentive to work on it! ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1141))

- These efforts are laudable and useful, but they demonstrate a blindness to one very small problem that leads to diarrhea: dirty hands. In the countries where fatal childhood diarrhea is most prevalent, soap is usually present in the house, but only 15 to 20 percent of people use it before handling food or babies. When people keep their hands clean, diarrhea cases can be reduced by more than 40 percent. It is easier to teach a person to prevent diarrhea by washing his or her hands than it is to install new plumbing across a continent or to supply a therapy after the disease has taken hold. A happier example can be found in New York City’s approach to crime. In the 1980s, there was a yearly average of two thousand murders and six hundred thousand felonies. In the subway system alone, riders and workers fell victim to fifteen thousand felonies per year. Frustrated politicians and police officials tried again and again to reduce major crime with bold steps, raising the number of cops on the beat, increasing budgets, and so on. They assumed that since crime had attained such outsized dimensions, only the splashiest, most costly techniques could deflate the ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1257))

- statistics. But, despite great expense and effort, crime continued to rise. Enter William Bratton, who was hired in 1990 to reduce New York’s subway crime. Bratton’s philosophy was influenced by a lecture he’d attended on the “broken windows” theory, first postulated in 1982 by two criminologists, James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. The broken windows theory held that if a city—or a neighborhood or a street—tolerated minor infractions of the law, it was practically inviting more serious offenses. Wilson and Kelling observed that when kids threw rocks at a vacant building and broke one windowpane, and that windowpane was not fixed, the remaining windows were soon broken as well. But if the initial broken window was repaired quickly, vandals stayed away and the rest of the windows remained intact. This scenario was emblematic, Wilson and Kelling believed, of a larger truth about crimes: People are more willing to break the law in neighborhoods where small crimes go unnoticed or unpunished. If no one in the neighborhood is able to handle a drunk who is loud and disorderly, will any of the citizens even attempt to interfere with a mugging or call the police during a robbery? When Bratton arrived in New York in 1990, he brought this kaizenlike philosophy with him. Resisting what must have been extraordinary pressure to apply radical, showy solutions to the problem of subway crime—a problem that plagued millions of responsible citizens as they rode to and ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1265))

- from work each day—Bratton isolated small problems instead. He decided to focus on the petty crimes that eroded the quality of life for transit passengers but did not put them in physical danger. These crimes included urinating in public, vagrancy, and turnstile jumping. Imagine Bratton’s bravery in telling cynical and angry New Yorkers that he was going to focus on turnstile jumping instead of homicides. But he held to his plan. Instead of staging massive but infrequent roundups of criminals, Bratton had his officers arrest turnstile jumpers day in and day out and keep fifteen or twenty of them at a time handcuffed in the subway station—where other passengers, not television crews, could see them. This had a dramatic effect not just on small crimes but on major felonies as well. When police ran background checks on the turnstile jumpers, they often found criminals wanted for violent offenses. And it also became clear that would-be muggers were inhibited by the crackdown. Apparently, they weren’t willing to pay for the privilege of riding the subway and robbing people. One of Bratton’s district captains, Miles Ansboro, found himself solving another small problem. He… ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1275))

There may be a momentary delay while they go through the train to correct all conditions. Thank you for your patience.” The officers greeted the passengers, escorted the rowdy and the drunken off the cars, and settled down any kids who were misbehaving.

- The Perfect Reward Think hard before deciding on a small reward. You want the reward to have these three qualities: The reward should be appropriate to the goal. For Karen Pryor, chocolate was a perfect encouragement to get to class—a small, harmless indulgence. But for the man told by his doctor to cut back on unhealthful foods, chocolate would be counterproductive. The reward should be appropriate to the person. If you’re trying to encourage another person to achieve a goal, remember that one person’s reward is another person’s annoyance. For some people, it’s a great boost to receive a compliment every time they take a positive step toward their goal. Others think that frequent compliments are condescending. For certain clients, especially those who are hesitant to contact me outside of our scheduled visits, I use phone calls as a reward: Every time they achieve a small success, they call me so that I can congratulate them. Needless to say, this reward would be meaningless for those clients who feel entitled to call their therapists any time of the day or night! Finding an appropriate reward for another person can be challenging, so you might want to try this technique: If the person in question is a friend or partner, ask, “How do you know you are loved?” Ask him or her to come up with four or five answers if possible. Since most people are not used to answering this kind of question, allow a ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1413))

- few days for mulling it over. At work, you could ask a colleague or employee an alternative question: “How do you know you are appreciated?” Again, give the person a few days and ask for several responses. The answers are often small and invariably illuminating. The reward should be free or inexpensive. You may need to look no farther than your living room. People with all-consuming family lives often find that ten minutes a day with a book or newspaper is a treat. I’ve known several stay-at-home moms who would like to relax in front of a little daytime television but feel compelled to perform chores instead. If losing weight is one of their goals, I usually suggest they grant themselves permission to watch TV—as long as they are exercising in some way while it’s on. If you tend to be your own worst critic, you might try an honest self-compliment as your reward. Other good ideas include taking soaks in the tub, taking short walks, playing your favorite piece of music, making a phone call to a friend, getting a shoulder or foot massage from your partner, or taking a few moments to drink your morning coffee in the luxury of bed. “Most of us miss out on life’s big prizes.

Whenever you find yourself lost in worry or regret, try this: Ask yourself: Do I need to learn to change anything based on this worry or regret of mine? If the answer is yes, then take a step toward that change. If the answer is no (and often it is), scan the room for an object or person that gives you the strongest sense of pleasure.
