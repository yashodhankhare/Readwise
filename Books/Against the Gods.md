- In 1654, a time when the Renaissance was in full flower, the Chevalier de Méré, a French nobleman with a taste for both gambling and mathematics, challenged the famed French mathematician Blaise Pascal to solve a puzzle. The question was how to divide the stakes of an unfinished game of chance between two players when one of them is ahead. The puzzle had confounded mathematicians since ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BV6RTUG&location=186))

- The word “risk” derives from the early Italian risicare, which means “to dare.” In this sense, risk is a choice rather than a fate. The actions we dare to take, which depend on how free we are to make choices, are what the story of risk is all about. And that story helps define what it means to be a human being.

- The centrepiece of the Hindu-Arabic system was the invention of zero—sunya as the Indians called it, and cifr as it became in Arabic. The term has come down to us as “cipher,” which means empty and refers to the empty column in the abacus or counting frame.c The concept of zero was difficult to grasp for people who had used counting only to keep track of the number of animals killed or the number of days passed or the number of units traveled. Zero had nothing to do with what counting was for in that sense. As the twentieth-century English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead put it, The point about zero is that we do not need to use it in the operations of daily life. No one goes out to buy zero fish. It is in a way the most civilised of all the cardinals, and its use is only forced on us by the... needs of cultivated modes of thought. Whitehead’s phrase “cultivated modes of thought” suggests that the concept of zero unleashed something more profound than just an enhanced method of counting and calculating. As Diophantus had sensed, a proper numbering system would enable mathematics to develop into a science of the abstract as well as a technique for measurement. Zero blew out the limits to ideas and to progress. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BV6RTUG&location=708))

- Zero revolutionized the old numbering system in two ways. First, it meant that people could use only ten digits, from zero to nine, to perform every conceivable calculation and to write any conceivable number. Second, it meant that a sequence of numbers like 1, 10, 100 would indicate that the next number in the sequence would be 1000. Zero makes the whole structure of the numbering system immediately visible and clear.

- He defined, for the first time, what is now the conventional format for expressing probability as a fraction: the number of favorable outcomes divided by the “circuit”—that is, the total number of possible outcomes. For example, we say the chance of throwing heads is 50/50, heads being one of two equally likely cases. The probability of drawing a queen from a full deck of cards is 1/13, as there are four queens in a deck of 52 cards; the chance of drawing the queen of spades, however, is 1/52, for the deck holds only one ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BV6RTUG&location=1026))

- Cardano put it, the probability of an outcome is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total opportunity set. The odds on an outcome are the ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes. The odds obviously depend on the probability, but the odds are what matter when you are placing a bet. If the probability of a five-throw in backgammon is 15 five-throws out of every 36 throws, the odds on a five-throw are 15 to 21. If the probability of throwing a 7 in craps is one out of six throws, the odds on throwing a number other than 7 are 5 to 1. This means that ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BV6RTUG&location=1088))

- you should bet no more than $1 that 7 will come up on the next throw when the other fellow bets $5 that it won’t. The probability of heads coming up on a coin toss are 50/50, or one out of two; since the odds on heads are even, never bet more than your opponent on that game. If the odds on a long-shot at the track are 20—to—1, the theoretical probability of that nag’s winning is one out of 21, or 4.8%, not 5%. In reality, the odds are substantially less than 5%, because, unlike craps, horse racing cannot take place in somebody ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BV6RTUG&location=1092))

If you restate the odds on each horse in a race in terms of probabilities—as the 20-to-l shot has a probability of winning of 4.8%—and add up the probabilities, you will find that the total exceeds 100%. The difference between that total and 100% is a measure of the amount that the owners and the state are skimming off the top.

- The last Italian of any importance to wrestle with the matter of probability was Galileo, who was born in 1564, the same year as William Shakespeare. By that time Cardano was already an old man. Like so many of his contemporaries, Galileo liked to experiment and kept an eye on everything that went on around him. He even used his own pulse rate as an aid in measuring time. One day in 1583, while attending a service in the cathedral in Pisa, Galileo noticed a lamp swaying from the ceiling above him. As the breezes blew through the drafty cathedral, the lamp would swing irregularly, alternating between wide arcs and narrow ones. As he watched, he noted that each swing took precisely the same amount of time, no matter how wide or narrow the arc. The result of this casual observation was the introduction of the pendulum into the manufacture of clocks. Within thirty years, the average timing error was cut from fifteen minutes a day to less than ten seconds. Thus was time married to... technology. And that was how Galileo liked to spend his time.

- Averages of averages reveal something even more interesting. We began the experiment I have just described with a die with, as usual, six faces, each of which had an equal chance of coming up when we threw it. The distribution then was flat, bearing no likeness at all to a normal distribution. As the computer threw the die over and over and over, accumulating a growing number of samples, we gleaned more and more information about the die’s characteristics. Very few of the averages of six throws came out near one or six; many of them fell between two and three or between four and five. This structure is precisely what Cardano worked out for his gambling friends, some 250 yean ago, as he groped his way toward the laws of chance. Many throws of a single die will average out at 3.5. Therefore, many throws of two dice will average out at double 3.5, or .7.0. As Cardano demonstrated, the numbers on either side of 7 will appear with uniformly diminishing frequency as we move away from 7 to the limits of 2 and 12.

The subject was whether coordination is possible, or even desirable, between monetary policy, which involves the control of short-term interest rates and the supply of money, and fiscal policy, which involves the balance between federal government spending and tax revenue.

The stock was selling for less than 50 1/4—the “strike price”; if the stock remained below the strike price for the duration of the option, the option would be worthless and its owner would lose the entire premium paid for it. Yet that premium is all that the buyer of the option had at risk and all that the seller of the option could hope to gain.
