## Highlights
- When I first came to write a chapter-length autobiography, I called it “A Theory of My Life.” Now, enlarging and extending it, I give it the more accurate title Models of My Life. The change from singular to ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=121))

- plural eliminates any promise of unattainable scientific truth. Lacking that, why not offer several explanations of events, when none seems certain? The reader may wish to provide others. But there is a further reason for using the plural. It is a denial—a denial that a life, at least my life, has a central theme, a unifying thread running through it. True, there are themes (again the plural), some of the threads brighter or thicker or stronger than others. Perhaps clearest is the theme of the scientist and teacher, carrying on his persistent heuristic search, seeking the Holy Grail of truth about human decision making. In my case, even that thread is woven of finer strands: the political scientist, the organization theorist, the economist, the management scientist, the computer scientist, the psychologist, the philosopher of science. Then there is the theme of the private person: of growing up, of love and family and friends and travel and leisure. A third thread traces the university politician, seeking to build and shape the environment for his scientific work. A fourth winds its way through New York City and Washington, even Beijing and Moscow: the theme of the science politician, concerned with the health of social science, with science as adviser to the polis—even (grandiosely) with the possible contributions of science to maintaining world peace and preserving the global environment.

- These four themes (and a few others as well) each place me in a rather separate or separable role, with its own maze as setting. The stingy paymaster of time, doling out only twenty-four hours a day for everything, binds the roles together as they compete for those hours to pursue their searches. Which of the wanderers through these different mazes will step forward at the call for the real Herbert Simon? All of them; for the “real” self is an illusion. We live each hour in context, different contexts for different hours. To say, truly, that we are actors does not make us “unreal” or hypocritical. We act out our lives within the mazes in which Nature and society place us. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=132))

- Of course, the whole thing is no longer a memory, just a memory of having once had such a memory. Memory and memory of the memory have probably been confabulated for at least sixty years. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=348))

- Before he was twelve, he had learned that quite reasonable and truthful people could perceive the same set of events in remarkably different ways. Sometimes he found himself the mediator, interpreting for each protagonist the viewpoint of the other. Whatever view was presented to him, he could see the merits in the opposing view, and often took it up. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=531))

- In giving an account of the Chicago School and my experiences with it, I have drawn on Barry D. Karl’s biography, Charles E. Merriam and the Study of Politics, to remind me of events that I would otherwise fail to retrieve from memory—although I disagree with Karl on some matters of interpretation.

- He wrote: “It is a long road out of a slavery to inanimate nature, out of a slavery to human nature, up to the mastery of the dark and fateful forces around us and within; but the race is on its way. The future belongs to those who fuse intelligence with faith, and who with courage and determination grope their way forward from chance to choice, from blind adaptation to creative evolution” ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=1353))

- Applying intelligence to the political scene requires an understanding of political institutions and processes. This understanding, Merriam thought, could be arrived at only through the scientific study of politics. And the scientific study of politics meant the study of human behavior, especially as carried on by psychology and her sister sciences.

- Finally, we come to Merriam’s systematic works, and especially Political Power and Systematic Politics, published in 1934 and 1945, respectively. I will focus on the former, which is the better book; but most of my remarks apply to both. The author himself explains his method in the introduction to Political Power: “It is not my purpose to repeat or refute the conclusions of the masters of political dialectics. Acknowledging my deep obligation to such thinkers, I propose to set forth what I have found out about the nature of political power during my years of reading, reflection, observation, experience” (p. 3). The book is entirely consistent with the author’s characterization—“reading, reflection, observation, experience.” It reports no new empirical results and, for that matter, almost no specific old empirical results. The references, only moderate in number, are mainly to books, and seldom to specific chapters. Thus the reader encounters a series of assertions about the nature and workings of political power set forth without any explicit evidential base.

- My career was determined for me in a very casual way. The branching points in the maze of my life offered easy choices. Other people in my environment presented me with opportunities. When the opportunities were attractive, I took them. Two or three such choices (hardly decisions, for I did not search for alternatives) set me on a definite path.

- WRITING ADMINISTRATIVE BEHAVIOR ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=1860))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As I have mentioned, my dissertation later became Administrative Behavior, and it contains almost all the essential content of the book. I have also offered an explanation (or rationalization) of how it was possible for me to write such a document without extensive experience of administration, and I should like to expand on it. The dissertation examined administration as a decision-making process, introducing that framework with the help of a maze metaphor: “A simplified model of human decision making is provided by the behavior of a white rat when he is confronted, in the psychological laboratory, with a maze, one path of which leads to food.” As several readers of the manuscript who provided me with comments prior to publication of the revised thesis objected strongly to the human/rat analogy, it disappeared, along with the maze metaphor, from the published version. But it is clear from this brief quotation and the pages that followed it in the dissertation that I viewed decision making very much in terms of making successive choices along a branching path. Whether I had been preoccupied with mazes prior to this time, I cannot recall. They were prominent in the writings of the principal author upon whom I relied for my psychological facts, Edward Tolman of the University of California at Berkeley. As was true of most other behaviorist psychologists of that time, the subjects of his experiments on choice were usually rats, not people. The dissertation contains the foundation and much of the superstructure of the theory of bounded rationality that has been my lodestar for nearly fifty years. The idea had its origins in the Milwaukee recreation study, was reinforced by what I had discovered about the boundary conditions of rationality in the California tax incidence study, and was not contradicted by any of the management or other human experiences I had had in my six working years, or in the years that preceded them.

- Coverage of subject matter is a snare and a delusion. You begin where the students are prepared to begin; and you carry them as far as you can without losing them. Whether that takes you to the end of the specified curriculum, half as far, or twice as far, is irrelevant. You talk from notes, and certainly do not ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=2063))

- read lectures—in fact, it is better if you do not write them out. Anything you cannot communicate without reading will be forgotten instantly, and probably is not suitable for a lecture anyway. You prepare notes for more material than you can possibly cover so that you don’t suffer from the beginning teacher’s nightmare: What happens if I run out of material before the class ends? (If you do, which almost never happens, you dismiss the class. They will thank you for it.) There is zero correlation between the number of hours you put in preparing formally for your classes and their success, provided that you have a coherent general outline of the curriculum and a thorough knowledge of the subject. You start every class by giving students the opportunity (or better, the obligation) to ask questions about their reading, about previous sessions, or about anything. You take each question seriously, and answer it without making a jackass of the student who asked it (no matter how foolish the question). After a year of teaching constitutional law, I found I was able to write a twenty-page document to distribute to students that provided answers to 90 percent of the questions they asked. I was never sure whether that was a good thing, though, for it cut down the questioning. Of course, students don’t learn by being lectured at, anyway; they learn by thinking hard, solving problems, dissecting proofs. Requiring them to write briefs was the most important component of our teaching at IIT. After students have thought hard about a topic, a lecture can help them sort out and organize their thoughts. Enlightenments, like accidents, happen only to prepared minds. If students have thought about something, you can discuss it profitably in class; without the preparation, it is just a bull session. You keep lectures on the high ground. The details of proofs are better gleaned from books. Above all, you feel no obligation to repeat the contents of the textbook, for that would simply confirm students in the habit of not reading it.

- While I was participating in the Cowles seminars, I also came to understand something about macroeconomics. John Maynard Keynes’s famous book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, wholly verbal and equationless, had mostly baffled me, but now John Hicks, and especially Franco Modigliani, published mathematical models of the Keynesian system that I could understand. I came to understand just enough of monetary theory (a specialty of Modigliani and of Don Patinkin) to know that I did not understand it at all, and to suspect that other economists didn’t either. That suspicion lingers with me today. ([Location 2194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=2194))

- In the early 1950s, when I was on a faculty recruiting trip from Pittsburgh, I had dinner with Marschak one evening in the Quadrangle Club at the University of Chicago. The conversation turned to the selection of faculty. As he had assembled a spectacular group of stars in the Cowles Commission, I asked him what qualities he looked for in selecting staff. “Oh,” said he, “I pick people with good eyes.” I stared at him. Good eyes—what could he mean? I told him he was joking, but he insisted: He looked at their eyes. And then I began thinking of the clear dark Armenian eyes of Arrow, the cool blue Frisian eyes of Koopmans, and the sharp black Roman eyes of Modigliani. It was certainly true that they all had remarkable eyes. Ever since, I think I have included that among my own selection criteria; intelligence shines through the eyes.

- On a third occasion, midway between these two others, I behaved badly. On a visit to New Haven, Connecticut, where the Cowles Commission had moved, I was invited to dinner at the Marschaks. During the cocktail hour, to stir up the conversation a bit, I proposed the following hypothetical situation. Suppose that computers have developed to the point where they can be raised just like children and can acquire human culture, the only difference between computer children and flesh-and-blood children being that the former are less susceptible than the latter to physical and mental disease. A referendum is to be held to decide whether future generations are to be computer children or flesh-and-blood children. How would you vote? The room became very quiet and very cold. Jascha’s wife, Marianne, the warmest and most cordial of human beings, was obviously angry. I thought I was going to be turned away without dinner. Jokes that challenge the basic values of humanity are not funny, especially if they skirt too close to the human values rejected by Nazism, with its medical experiments and gross disrespect for human life. I did not intend my question as a challenge to values but as an opportunity to explicate them. But I had obviously touched a deep and serious nerve. I hastened to back-pedal, and I did get my dinner.

- For me, mathematics has always been a language of thought. I don’t know precisely what I mean by that (and explicating the meaning is today one of my important research goals), but I can try to explain. When I am working on a problem, I am sure that I do not usually think in words, but in terms of a more abstract representation that is perhaps partially pictorial or diagrammatic and partially symbolic. Mathematics—this sort of non-verbal thinking—is my language of discovery. It is the tool I use to arrive at new ideas. This kind of mathematics is relatively unrigorous, loose, heuristic. Solutions reached with its help have to be checked for correctness. It is physicists’ mathematics or engineers’ mathematics rather than mathematicians’ mathematics.

- Fairness is a tricky concept. Evidently it is not unfair to win the raffle of the genes—with respect to either intelligence or industriousness. It is not unfair to have the experiences or to be at the places that provide one with a secret weapon. It is unfair to inherit merit from the prestige of one’s family or organization. Put this way, the distinctions seem highly arbitrary, and I am not prepared to defend them. I simply report the rules of the game that guided my career and conditioned my feelings of success in competition.

- GRAVITATING TOWARD THE SUN Speaking of competition puts one in a Darwinian frame of mind. How does a career, and especially the choices made along its course, look from a Darwinian point of view? What is a Darwinian maze? Fitness is the central concept in modern Darwinian genetics. It is measured simply by the rate at which an organism reproduces itself. If two organisms compete for occupancy of the same ecological niche, relative fitness determines which will survive. Even small differences in fitness can lead to enormous differences in reproductive success over only a few generations. Replace competition between two populations by choice between two alternatives, and replace fitness by any measure associated with the outcomes of the choices. Then if one is confronted repeatedly with choices of some kind (for example, whether to take a second helping), slight differences in the probability of selecting one alternative or another can soon produce substantial differences in outcome (body weight… ([Location 2387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=2387))

- player secures a cumulative advantage by exploiting successive small weaknesses that are observed in the opponent’s choices of moves. We can express the better player’s advantage by a probability, slightly greater than 0.5, that in each pair of moves that player’s will be the stronger. For most of us—those of us who have not won million-dollar lotteries, or suffered sudden crippling accidents—life is much like the chess game. We make hundreds of choices among the alternative paths that lie before us and, as the result of those choices, find ourselves pursuing particular, perhaps highly specialized, careers, married to particular spouses, and living in particular towns. Even if we point to a single event as the “cause” of one of these outcomes, closer scrutiny of the path we have trod would reveal prefatory or preparatory events and choices that made the occurrence of the critical event possible. This kind of biased random walk describes very well my own choice of occupation.… ([Location 2397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=2397))

- Among the fundamental problems in every society, two stand out. People have to be motivated to contribute to the society, to produce. At the same time, they have to be protected if they are unable to take care of themselves adequately. You can think of it as the balance between incentives and distributive justice. Too much concern with the latter may weaken the former, and vice versa. ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=2779))

- IN my 1956 paper, “Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment,” I wove around the metaphor of the maze a formal model of how an organism (a person?) could meet a multiplicity of needs and wants at a satisfactory level and survive without drawing upon superhuman powers of intelligence and computation. The model provided a practicable design for a creature of bounded rationality, as all we creatures are. I was so pleased with the paper’s account of rationality that a year later I found myself writing a short story, “The Apple,” fashioned after it. The maze of my story, unlike the labyrinth of the Cretan myth, provides no heroics, no Theseus to seek out the fearsome Minotaur at its center and then escape by following the thread given him by Ariadne. Its central figure is not Theseus but Hugo, an ordinary man. The story describes Hugo’s life, much like every human life, as a search through a maze. In doing so it strips the mathematical wrappings from the technical paper that provided its metaphor. ([Location 3563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3563))

- Some light is thrown on my preoccupation with mazes, and hence my urge to write “The Apple,” by a conversation I had with the writer Jorge Luis Borges when I was in Buenos Aires in 1970. ([Location 3570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3570))

- Then Borges asked me about my work, and I began to talk about computers and the implications of a belief in the possibility of computer simulation of human thought for free will: SIMON: This is the form in which I conceive free will: It resides in the fact that I am that which acts when I take a given action. And the fact that something has caused this behavior in no manner makes me (the I who acts) unfree. So when we reach a bifurcation in the road, of the labyrinth, “something” chooses which branch to take. And the reason for my researches, and the reason why labyrinths have fascinated me, has been my desire to observe people as they encounter bifurcations and try to understand why they take the road to the right or to the left.

- THE APPLE: A STORY OF A MAZE There once was a man named Hugo who lived in a castle with innumerable rooms. Since the rooms were windowless, and since he had lived there since his birth, the castle was the only world he knew. His mother, who had died when he was very young, had told him of another world “outside,” lighted by a single large lamp that was turned on and off at intervals of ten or twelve hours. She had not seen the outside world herself, but stories about it had been handed down from generation to generation. Hugo was never certain whether his ancestors had really lived in, or viewed, this world, or whether the stories had been invented in some remote time to entertain the children of the castle. At any rate, he knew of it only through his mother’s tales. The rooms of the castle were rectangular and very long—it took Hugo almost ten minutes of brisk walking to go from end to end of one of them. The walls at each end of each room were pierced by four or five doors. These doors were provided with locks so that they could be opened from one side, but not the other. The doors on the west end of a room opened into the room, while those on the east end opened out into adjoining rooms. When Hugo entered a room and the door shut behind him, he could not again return on the path along which he had come, but could only go on through one of the eastern doors to other rooms beyond. At one time, Hugo became curious as to whether the rooms might be arranged in cycles, so that he could return to a room by a circuitous path, if not directly. It was not easy to decide, for many of the rooms looked much alike. For a time, he dropped a few crumbs of bread in each room through which he passed, and watched for evidences of his return to one of these. He never saw any of the bread crumbs again, but he was not certain but what they had been eaten by the mice that lived in the castle with him. After the death of his mother, Hugo lived alone in the castle. Perhaps it seems strange that he or his ancestors had not long since died of hunger in this isolated life. Most of the rooms were quite bare, containing only a chair or two and a sofa. These Hugo found comfortable enough when he wanted to rest in his wanderings or to sleep. But from time to time, he entered a room where he found, on a small table covered with a white linen cloth, food for a quite adequate and… ([Location 3672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3672))

But from time to time, he entered a room where he found, on a small table covered with a white linen cloth, food for a quite adequate and pleasant meal. Those of us who are accustomed to a wide range of foods, gathered for the pleasure of our table from the whole world, might not have been entirely satisfied with the fare. But for a person of simple tastes—and Hugo had not developed elaborate ones—the fruits and green vegetables, the breads, and the smoked and dried meats that Hugo found in these occasional rooms provided an adequate and satisfying diet. Since Hugo knew no other world, it caused him no surprise that the arrangements of the castle provided for his weariness and hunger. He had never asked his mother who it was that placed the food on the tables. The rooms stocked with food were not very numerous. Had his education in mathematics not been deficient, Hugo could have estimated their relative number. For the connecting doors between the rooms were of clear glass, and ([Location 3685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3685))

- peering through one of them, Hugo could see through a series of five or six doors far beyond. If any of the rooms in this range of vision had dining tables in them, he could see them from where he stood. When Hugo had not eaten for some time, and was hungry, he would stand, in turn, before each of the four of five exit doors, and peer through them to see if food was visible. If it was not—as usually happened—he would open one of the doors, walk rapidly through the next room and reinspect the situation from the new viewing points now available to him. Usually, within an hour or two of activity, he would finally see on his horizon a room with a table; whereupon he walked rapidly toward it, assured of his dinner within another hour. He had never been in real danger of starvation. Only once had he been forced to continue his explorations as long as four hours before a dining room became visible. Since life in the castle was not very strenuous, and since the meals that were spread before Hugo from time to time were generous, he seldom took more than two meals a day.

- THE most important years of my life as a scientist were 1955 and 1956, when the maze branched in a most unexpected way. During the preceding twenty years, my principal research had dealt with organizations and how the people who manage them make decisions. My empirical work had carried me into real-world organizations to observe them and occasionally to carry out experiments on them. My theorizing used ordinary language or the sorts of mathematics then commonly employed in economics. Although I was somewhat interdisciplinary in outlook, I still fit rather comfortably the label of political scientist or economist and was generally regarded as one or both of these. All of this changed radically in the last months of 1955. While I did not immediately drop all of my concerns with administration and economics, the focus of my attention and efforts turned sharply to the psychology of human problem solving, specifically, to discovering the symbolic processes that people use in thinking. Henceforth, I studied these processes in the psychological laboratory and wrote my theories in the ([Location 3854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3854))

- peculiar formal languages that are used to program computers. Soon I was transformed professionally into a cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, almost abandoning my earlier professional identity. This sudden and permanent change came about because Al Newell, Cliff Shaw, and I caught a glimpse of a revolutionary use for the electronic computers that were just then making their first public appearance. We seized the opportunity we saw to use the computer as a general processor for symbols (hence for thoughts) rather than just a speedy engine for arithmetic. By the end of 1955 we had invented list-processing languages for programming computers and had used them to create the Logic Theorist, the first computer program that solved non-numerical problems by selective search. It is for these two achievements that we are commonly adjudged to be the parents of artificial intelligence. Put less technically, if more boastfully, we invented a computer program capable of thinking non-numerically, and thereby solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties… ([Location 3861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=3861))

- THE DISCOVERY OF LIST-PROCESSING LANGUAGES Writing and testing the Logic Theorist was only half of what we had accomplished in 1956. We had also invented a whole new class of computer-programming languages known as list-processing languages, the general nature of which has already been briefly indicated. These languages were the direct ancestor of John McCarthy’s LISP, which has been the standard A.I. language for thirty years, as well as embodying most of the ideas of what is now called object-oriented programming.

- The basic idea is that, whenever a piece of information is stored in memory, additional information should be stored with it telling where to find the next (associated) piece of information. In this way the entire memory could be organized like a long string of beads, but with the individual beads of the string stored in arbitrary locations. “Nextness” was not determined by physical propinquity but by an address, or pointer, stored with each item, showing where the associated item was located. Then a bead could be added to a string or omitted from a string simply by changing a pair of addresses, without disturbing the rest of the memory. One could store as many Latin verbs as desired without preassigning storage for them. Each string of beads was called a list. Generalizing, any item on a list, any bead, could be the name of another list, with a pointer to its first bead. Now the structure of memory was no longer restricted to simple strings, but could include great branching treelike structures. But a further generalization was required to represent the directed associations that the experiments of N. Ach (1905) and others had shown to exist in human memory. This was accomplished by the description list (nowadays known more commonly as a property list). The odd beads on a description list held the names of the attributes, the even beads next to them, the values of those attributes. ([Location 4283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4283))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Thus, the attribute “color,” stored as seventh bead, say, on a description list, could be followed by the value “red,” as eighth bead. Again, a value might itself be a list structure of arbitrary complexity. So description lists could be associated with objects, forming schemas describing those objects. Schemas are now widely used in programming under such labels as scripts, frames, objects, and semantic nets. Finally, a list-processing language requires processes that can insert and delete items, find the next item on a list, find the value of an attribute of an object, assign such a value, create objects, and so on. About a dozen such processes are more or less essential to manipulate list structures. That’s basically all there is to list processing. You may say that it’s quite enough. From the beginning, the new artificial intelligence community accepted list processing as the programming tool for A.I. That is still largely true today, more than thirty years later. The rest of the programming profession, however, did not greet the innovation with open arms. They observed that list processing threw half the… ([Location 4293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4293))

- conventional programmers these languages seemed ridiculous, if not suicidal. A few years of experience showed why the condemnation was egregiously wrong. Within a decade, the value, or even necessity, of list processing had become evident in many kinds of programming environments, and chapter 2 of Knuth’s influential Fundamental Algorithms (1968) gave list processing wide credibility outside the A.I. community. Today list-processing ideas are commonplace in sophisticated programming. The languages our group developed were called IPLs (Information Processing Languages). IPL-II, the first one that actually ran on a computer, was the language of the Logic Theorist on JOHNNIAC. Of these languages, IPL-V was the most widely used on the IBM650, IBM704, and many other computers. It is now almost a dead language, although at least one version is still active (on a PC!). It was largely superseded by LISP, designed by John McCarthy, and today there are other competitors as well. The IPLs were precocious in other respects besides being the first list-processing languages. They appeared only… ([Location 4304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4304))

- An interesting, but probably undecidable, historical question is whether IPL-V contributed significantly to the development of structured programming. The IPL-V manual is quite explicit in its advocacy of top-down programming and independent closed subroutines, two of the central features of structured programming. The manual warns against instructions in one subroutine that refer to another, a no-no for structured programming, and characterizes processes solely in terms of inputs and outputs, a desideratum of structured programming.

- THE RESEARCH STRATEGY The initial motives that led us to the Logic Theorist, in the GSIA environment, influenced our research strategy. We were interested both in business applications that exploited the newfound powers of computers for symbolic processing, and in extensions that would contribute to understanding human thinking. Nowadays, we usually call the former artificial intelligence and the latter cognitive science. Along both fronts, our strategy was to select promising tasks that call for intelligence and to write and test programs capable of handling them. In the cognitive science part of our research, we also ran experiments with human subjects doing the same tasks to see how closely the computer simulations paralleled human behavior. As we gained a reasonable understanding of each task, we moved on to another. The precise order in which we took up tasks was partly a matter of chance, although we tended to start with those that seemed simple and progress toward the more complex. Eventually, we wanted to model the whole (cognitive) human being—a goal that would keep us busy indefinitely.

- The significance of a problem for cognitive science could be judged by how much attention psychologists paid to it and whether it illuminated important human capabilities. Doability depended on the current state of the programming art and whether we had any good ideas for experiments. Problem solving was an obvious research candidate, both because we had already made a start with LT, and because it is a critically important human mental activity. A substantial fraction of cognitive science research over the three and a half decades since 1956 has been directed toward understanding human problem solving. Rote verbal learning was another obvious candidate, as it had been studied more than any other subject by American psychologists. The standard experiments were modeled on the way people traditionally learn foreign language vocabulary (paired-associate learning) or memorize poetry (learning by serial anticipation). Apart from experimental work we might do ourselves, there were thousands of experiments already in the published literature that we could use to test our simulation models. Extrapolating letter series was chosen as yet another task for several reasons. It was an example of serial behavior, whose importance to psychology had been emphasized by Lashley. The task had been selected by designers of intelligence tests as a good measure of significant mental abilities. And, as it was a law-discovering task, it could open the path toward illuminating the processes needed for scientific discovery and other creative activities. A more speculative venture, undertaken as a doctoral thesis by Bob Lindsay, was to explore how computers might understand information, taking genealogical charts as the objects to be understood. In another important dissertation task, Ross Quillian was to design semantic memory structures that could display some of the characteristics of human associative memory.

- STATING THE THEORY: HUMAN PROBLEM SOLVING From an early date, Al and I had decided to write a treatise on human problem solving based on our research with human subjects and computer simulation. The project may have been launched as early as 1958 (the evidence is inconclusive); the published volume appeared in 1972. Human Problem Solving begins by introducing information processing, computer simulation, and problem solving by heuristic search. Then it describes our empirical investigation of three task domains: logic, cryptarithmetic, and chess, and concludes with an exposition of the theory of problem solving we inferred from the evidence. LT and list-processing languages were used to illustrate the introductory discussions. GPS provided the machine for simulating human behavior in the Moore-Anderson logic tasks. The NSS chess program and other chess-playing programs were compared with evidence on human chess playing. The cryptarithmetic puzzles led us to an important new insight. In a cryptarithmetic puzzle, the subject is given a pseudo-arithmetic problem, for example: SEND + MORE = MONEY. The problem is solved by substituting digits for letters in such a way that the result is a correct sum. For example, 9567 + 1085 = 10652 (where S has been replaced by 9, E by 5, N by 6, D by 7, and so on) is a solution to the problem just given. The general method of means-ends analysis, the workhorse of GPS, seems to apply to these problems as to the others. The basic GPS control structure that determined what step a subject would take next did not predict our protocols well, however. In the protocols we saw something that looked like a production system, a form of organization already well known in computer science that had not been applied to psychological systems (except to the extent that any primitive stimulus-response, S-R, connection can be regarded as a production). ([Location 4478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4478))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In a production system, each elementary instruction has an if-then form: If conditions C are satisfied, then take action A. Whenever the conditions of a production are satisfied, the action is taken. When the conditions of several productions are satisfied simultaneously, these conflicts are resolved by priority rules. (For example, the productions may be listed in order of priority.) Since the mid-1960s, when we introduced productions into psychological theory, they have been widely adopted, both to explain how human experts make “intuitive” decisions by recognizing familiar cues directly, and as the basis for so-called expert systems in artificial intelligence. Experts, human and computer, do much of their problem solving not by searching selectively but simply by recognizing the relevant cues in situations similar to those they have experienced before. Production systems were important for the shift in cognitive science and artificial intelligence in the 1960s from systems like GPS, which relied on general problem-solving skills, to systems that relied on large stores of specific knowledge. Of course, most expert systems (human and computer) rely on both. We might trace the production system idea, as applied in psychology, back along several paths. First, a production, Condition → Action, bears some resemblance to the stimulus-response connection, S → R, of behaviorist psychology. The stimuli are the conditions that trigger the response. When we examine details, we find many differences, but the analogy is close enough so that causation cannot be dismissed out of hand. Second, we can find early examples, in the literature on problem solving and decision making, of references to intuitive solution—that is, solution by recognition. The following passage is from a talk I gave on August 26, 1957: One can train a man so that he has at his disposal a list or repertoire of the possible actions that could be taken under the circumstances. . . . a person who is new at the game does not have immediately at his disposal a set of possible actions to consider, but has to construct them on the spot, . . . a time-consuming and difficult mental task. . . . [T]he decision maker of experience has at his disposal a checklist of things to watch out for before finally accepting a decision. . . . A large part of the difference between the experienced decision maker and the novice in these situations is not any particular intangible like “judgment” or “intuition.” If one could open the lid, so to speak, and see what was in the head of the experienced decision maker, one would find that he had . . . at his disposal repertoires of possible actions; that he had . . . checklists of things to think about before he acted; and that he had mechanisms in his mind to evoke these, and bring these to his conscious attention when the situations for decision arose. Most of what we do to get people ready to act in situations of encounter consists in drilling these lists into them… ([Location 4492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4492))

- earlier. The idea of condition-action pairs was central to Otto Selz’s theory of problem solving. In 1924 he wrote: Intellectual processes are not a system of diffuse reproductions—as association psychology thought—but rather, like a system of body movements, particularly of reflexes, they are a system of specific reactions in which there is as a rule an unambiguous relation between specific conditions of elicitation and both general and special intellectual operations. In computer science, production systems, derived from formal logic (see, for example, Post 1941), were applied to the design of so-called string-processing languages and to systems programming tasks in the early or mid-1960s. At Carnegie Tech production systems quickly infiltrated into thesis projects. One student, Tom Williams, used a production system language in a 1965 dissertation, and another,… ([Location 4517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4517))

- It appears, then, that the idea that expert “intuition” is to be explained by recognition mechanisms was already abroad in 1924 (and probably much earlier), and that production systems were being used for cognitive simulation as early as 1965. And these ideas seem not to have a single line of antecedents, but several different ones. ([Location 4589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4589))

But it is easy to delude oneself in these matters unless one carries out the calculations. My training as an economist has been of help in one important way: It convinced me that the only information that is of value in a financial market is information that other people don’t have. This means that I don’t have to pay daily, or even monthly, attention to the stock market, since it tells me nothing about whether I should buy or sell.

Whenever I found that one of my hobbies was seriously taking attention from my research, I dropped it. That happened to chess, and then painting, in the late 1950s. In both cases, I found that I was aspiring to professional competence, which obviously would have required an unlimited commitment. It was time to call a halt. It probably says something about my competitiveness that I often found myself getting serious about activities that were begun as diversions.

- Love is as important in marriage as in the maneuvers leading up to it. But my admission of susceptibility to beauty might raise questions about how well I have adapted to monogamy. There are two mind/body problems. The classical one asks how a physical system can have thoughts. It has been answered definitively by the appearance of electronic computers that think. The second mind/body problem, quite different, is that of sacred and profane love. The solution is not so clear as to the first, and attempts to solve it make up a large part of what we call literature. As a young man I had to try to shape my personal answer. For some years, I thought that body could be detached from mind for some purposes—that sexual attraction might be a precondition for love, but was certainly not synonymous with it (I still believe that), and that sexual acts with a loved one or with another had no implications for one’s love (I no longer believe that). I think I arrived at these conclusions in response to my body’s wants and not as a result of reading tracts on free love. With what I now regard as great good fortune, I never fully acted on these earlier principles, and have ([Location 4908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=4908))

- always held strictly to the law, if not exactly to the spirit, of monogamy. Drunk, and occasionally sober, I have sometimes made advances to other women, but two things have prevented matters from progressing far. The first is my sense of vanity. To be attracted to a woman and find that I was not attractive to her would prick my pride. One sure safeguard is never to make the test, to move with great tentativeness and wait for a response. That is not a very powerful strategy in either love or war. But, in love, it does protect vanity and promote monogamy. My second defense against profligacy I like to think of as a form of honesty. I have never been able to tell a woman I loved her when I felt only sexual attraction. Don Juan instructs us that most women are not very vulnerable to attacks that do not promise love, and preferably exclusive love. For more than fifty years I have been deeply in love with my wife, and I have been unwilling to say that I was not. None of the standard gambits for philandering were open to me. I could not say that I needed a woman because my wife misunderstood me. Sometimes Dorothea did misunderstand me, and I her, but crying on another shoulder did not seem a way to solve that problem while love remained. A good logician, examining the sophistry of the preceding paragraphs, will see that I am not yet out of danger. I have not denied (and cannot deny) the possibility of being genuinely in love with two women at once, and this has occasionally happened to me.

The salt slowly dissolved from the wound. Today I can recount this tale in bittersweet terms, a sentimental old man retrieving his lost youth. If I did not acknowledge the importance of this episode, I would be falsifying my life. Moreover, the experience added an important corollary to my theory of love: You can love two or more women at once—denying that would be denying my own emotions—but you cannot be loyal to more than one. The dichotomy of profane and sacred love is not enough. Unless accompanied by loyalty and commitment, love, even love that goes far beyond sexual attraction, provides an insubstantial base for marriage or for a satisfying continuing association.

- Mention of computer simulation and philosophers raises the most contentious issue of all: whether one should speak of computers as thinking. Cognitive psychologists, even those sympathetic to simulation, often avoid the issue by talking of “the computer metaphor.” No one would deny metaphorical thoughts to computers. But the question, “Can computers really (not just metaphorically) think?” raises the warmest passions in philosophers, and sometimes in the common person in the street as well. There is a knock-down argument that is supposed to settle the question instantly. It goes like this: Computers are machines; machines cannot think; hence computers cannot think. It is not regarded as an adequate riposte to say: Human beings are also (biological) machines; therefore, if machines cannot think, human beings cannot think. Argumentation, unlike formal logic, appeals to premises that are not always made explicit but are presumed to be already stored in the memory of the reader, evoking these beliefs and drawing inferences from them. That is the structure of the argument I have just given. Most readers already “know” that machines cannot think and that computers are machines. Those premises don’t require evidence. In fact, most readers will accept the statement, “Computers can’t think,” without any explicit argument at all, because the requisite premises will be evoked from memory as soon as the conclusion is stated. On the other hand, the riposte fails because many readers do not believe that human beings are ([Location 5468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=5468))

- machines; or, if they believe it, do so with substantial qualifications and restrictions. In a debate between two protagonists, that party has a decided advantage whose case rests on beliefs solidly established in the minds of most readers. In arguing that machines think, we are in the same fix as Darwin when he argued that man shares common ancestors with monkeys, or Galileo when he argued that the Earth spins on its axis. Wearied by the prospect of having to establish our nonintuitive premises as well as our conclusions, Al Newell and I have usually let a steadily accumulating collection of programs (our own and others’) demonstrate the thinking of computers. The computers, speaking for themselves (figuratively and literally), will in time convince all but the most hardened fundamentalists that they think. In amplification of these views, I reproduce here a letter I wrote to my daughter Barbara well over a decade ago. May 21, 1977 Dear Bar: You ask about Weizenbaum and all that. It’s a long and complicated story, on at least three different levels. First, there is the whole set of questions about what artificial intelligence has achieved and will achieve by way of imitating human thought and other human processes. In principle at least, that is an empirical question that ought to be answered dispassionately after looking at the facts.

- Second, there are the questions about what the accomplishments of artificial intelligence, however great or meager, mean for human society and people generally. Those are also empirical questions, but their answer depends partly on the answers to the first set of questions. Third, there are the questions about how people feel about intelligent machines and their relations to people. These are questions of emotion and value that are not susceptible to demonstration and proof.*1 Now it would be nice if we could settle the first and second sets of questions, the factual ones, more or less independently of the third, the emotional ones. But it has not worked out that way. From the very beginning of A.I., back in the 1950s, it has generated in the hearts of some people strong fears, anxiety, and even anger. In this respect, A.I. has had much the same kind of effect as Darwin’s announcement of the Theory of Evolution. Both aroused in some people anxieties about their own uniqueness, value, and worth. Thus, very early on, an engineer named Mortimer Taube (I think) wrote an angry letter to Science about the first GPS piece that Al and I published there, and an… ([Location 5490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=5490))

- In general, I have not answered these attacks. . . . You don’t get very far arguing with a man about his religion, and these are essentially religious issues to the Dreyfuses and Weizenbaums of the world. Weizenbaum’s book, for example, vacillates among the positions that (1) the claims for A.I. are much overstated, (2) there is a danger that these claims will be realized, (3) it is immoral for people to try to realize them (he sometimes uses the word “obscene,” and compares such people with the Nazis). Now I understand some of the reasons why Joe is upset (he was himself a refugee from the Nazis), but not why he has fixated on computers as the objects of all of his anxieties. In any event, I see no point in arguing with him. My own posture has been this: my scientific work, and that of other A.I. researchers, will, in the long run, determine how many of Man’s thinking processes can be simulated. I believe that ultimately all of them can, but feel no great urge to try to prove that to others who feel differently. In science, it is the facts that give us the final answers. With respect to social consequences, I believe that every researcher has some responsibility to assess, and try to inform others of, the possible social consequences of the research products he is trying to create. Al and I tried to discharge that responsibility [in 1958] in our OR paper with its predictions, and I have also in the three editions of my New Science of Management Decision and Sciences of the Artificial. Of course I cannot expect that others will always or often agree with my predictions. What I sometimes lose my cool about, however, is to be attacked for making them. . . . However, while I regret such attacks, I am not surprised by them. Cool is . . . seldom preserved in scientific controversies, and I should not expect it to be in this case, where the nerves that are being touched are so sensitive. . . . Just a couple of final comments. First, I don’t think we have to assert any particular uniqueness of man, or separateness from the rest of nature, in order to find value in life. Personally, I find it more agreeable to think that man is a part of nature than that he is apart from and above it, but others may have different tastes in this matter. Second, I think those who object to my characterizing man as… ([Location 5502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=5502))

- THE TRAVEL THEOREM In 1960 that all changed, when Dorothea and I went around the world at the behest of the Ford Foundation, to attend an international management meeting (CIOS) in Australia, to evaluate management education in India, and to catch a glimpse of Rome. That was just after I had first announced the Travel Theorem. People react almost violently to my Travel Theorem. I try to explain that it has nothing to do with the pleasures of travel, but only with the inefficiency of travel for learning. They don’t hear my explanation; they remain outraged. They point out that I seem to be traveling all the time. Why shouldn’t other people travel too? After they simmer down enough to understand the theorem, they still attack it. It takes a long time to calm their passion with reason—and usually it isn’t extinguished, just temporarily subdued. Why, they think, argue with a madman?

- Let me state the Travel Theorem precisely, and then say how I came to discover it. Theorem: Anything that can be learned by a normal American adult on a trip to a foreign country (of less than one year’s duration) can be learned more quickly, cheaply, and easily by visiting ([Location 6092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=6092))

- the San Diego Public Library. San Diego is not essential; you can substitute any other major city. (I conceived of the theorem when I was about to go to India, where I was supposed to acquire expertise in Indian management education and a good tan—in San Diego, I could have acquired both.) The theorem holds in spades if the traveler does not have a fluent knowledge of the language of the country visited.

- That’s really all there is to the Travel Theorem: an assertion that a little experience goes a long way. The theorem emphatically does not claim that travel is not enjoyable. I, for one, enjoy travel a great deal and have spent no little time in it. The theorem insists only that one should not put a veneer of virtue (if learning is virtuous) on what is done for pleasure and self-gratification. The function of the theorem is to produce a well-justified guilt in those who seek to reconcile their passion for travel with the Protestant ethic. Epicureans and bon vivants should have no problem with it. ([Location 6110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=6110))

- Before leaving our trip of 1972, I must recount one revealing anecdote. From the moment we arrived at Canton, the Chinese were very curious about our ages. No matter how often we told them, they would ask again. Then we began to realize that, when our names were arranged in alphabetical order (and how else would Americans arrange them?), our ages coincidentally ran strictly from youngest to oldest (myself). But it was in that order that we were seated at banquets—from highest table to lowest. And it was in that order that our cars proceeded in autocade. (Foreign visitors being rare at that time, each of us had a car, a driver, and an interpreter.) How, wondered the Chinese, could the head of party be the youngest, and the oldest be the last? When I moved forward from the sixth table at the banquet to the head table, to offer the abovementioned toast to Guo Mojo for closer relations beween our science academies, the Chinese were astonished. My interpreter, ([Location 6696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=6696))

- pale with fright, refused to go up with me, and I had to ask one of the Chinese scientists at the head table to translate for me. After the banquet, the Chinese must have held some hurried conferences to determine why the toast had been offered by the most junior (but oldest) member of the party. At our next and final banquet, in Canton, we were seated at our usual tables. With our head of party was seated the senior Chinese scientist who was present. At my, sixth, table was seated the senior Chinese political officer who was present. They had finally figured out that I was the political commissar of our delegation!

- A favorite question to pose to gurus is, “What is your philosophy of life?” On rare occasions, I have been incautious enough to answer the question. A philosophy of life surely involves a set of principles. But principles for what purpose? Principles can provide a book of heuristics to guide choice at life’s branch points, a thread to keep one on the right path in the maze. Principles can also rationalize, explain, or provide excuses for choices one has already made. It’s not easy to distinguish between these two uses of principle; perhaps it is not even necessary. A philosophy of life can contain both. ([Location 7071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7071))

- FORMULATING PROBLEMS It is usually thought that before you answer a question you must state it. Or, to change the metaphor, for something to be found, something must have been lost. But is that always true? When one finds a vein of gold, was it nature who lost it? If we can find gold that we haven’t lost, perhaps we can answer questions that we haven’t asked. We may find gold (even gold we haven’t lost) by searching for it. But that means that we have already asked, “Where can we find some ([Location 7238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7238))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- gold?” But what about the gold we find when we are not looking for gold; when we are engaged in some different activity (gathering wildflowers on the mountain, for example)? At the very least, we must notice the gold; it must attract our attention, distracting us from the flowers. Do we account for this by postulating a need for gold? Or will an attention-attracting propensity of shiny yellow objects do the job? And how does the attraction of these yellow objects distract us from the flower-gathering task? Now let’s return from gold seeking to problem seeking. Our metaphor suggests that one way to find a problem, and perhaps even its solution, is to try to solve some other problem. That doesn’t tell us where the other problem came from—but one problem at a time! We are dealing with the phenomenon of surprise. Searching for wildflowers, we are surprised to see something shining and golden in the rocks. To be surprised, we must attend to the surprising phenomenon. Hence the dictum of Pasteur: “Accidents happen to the prepared mind.” ([Location 7242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7242))

- And now we have a new problem: How does a mind become prepared? If I am to follow the time-honored tradition of using autobiographical anecdotes as the evidence for my theory of discovery, perhaps it is time for an anecdote.

- Lotka’s data show that when the number of species belonging to each genus in some order of plants or animals is counted, and the genera are then arranged according to the number of their species, the genus with the nth largest number of species will have about 1/n as many species as the genus with the largest number. Similarly, when the frequencies with which different words appear in a book are counted, and words are then arranged in order of their frequency, the nth most frequent word will occur about 1/n times as frequently as the most frequent word. Moreover, about half of all the words that occur in a book will occur exactly once, about one-sixth exactly twice, one-twelfth three times, and so on. These relations hold for books in any alphabetic language, and the departures from regularity are small. The same regularity is seen in the populations of cities in the United States: The nth largest city is about 1/n times as large as New York. If the data are replaced by their logarithms they fall on a straight line with a slope of minus one. ([Location 7296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7296))

- What does one do with regularities like this—regularities that, at first blush, can only be described as astonishing? Sir Francis Bacon advised us to induce general laws from them, to find formulas that fit the data; and our computer program BACON (Langley et al. 1987) shows us how to do just that. Then, like the great chemist John Dalton, we should see if we can postulate a mechanism whose operation would produce the regularity described by the formula. Our program DALTON (Langley et al. 1987) simulates that process too. With BACON and DALTON we would know what to do. I wish I could say that this was my immediate response to the Lotka data. Memory fails me. I recall my fascination with them, but not whether I pondered over them or, if I did, for how long. I do recall that when I returned to Chicago after 1942, I thought about them again. I have a clear picture of sitting in the biology library in the University of Chicago, reading a paper referenced in Lotka’s book. I also recall talking about the matter to Allen Newell while visiting him and his wife, Noël, in their Santa Monica apartment between 1952 and 1954. But I was doing many other things during these years. The startling data on word frequencies and city sizes were not a constant preoccupation, but were more like a recurring itch that needed to be scratched occasionally. ([Location 7303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7303))

- Sometime during 1954 I found the answer. Only a few aspects of the discovery are recoverable now from memory. First, I looked for a function to fit the data. I was especially impressed by the regularity of the word frequencies at the low end of the frequency range. The simple fractions seemed to point to a formula involving ratios of integers. In fact, the simple formula, f(i) = l/[i(i + 1)], gives the required numbers, 1/2, 1/6, 1/12 and so on. For large i, we have approximately, f(i) = 1/i2. The rank, which is simply the integral of the frequency, will then give F(i) = 1/i, so that on a logarithmic scale the relation between rank and frequency will be linear with a slope of minus one. Finding an equation that fits these magic numbers sets a new problem: finding an explanation for the equation, a plausible rationale for the phenomena. My recollections of how I did this are even sketchier than my recollections about the previous stage. The ratios of integers were again the key. Where can you get ratios of integers? Ratios of factorials are one possible source: 1/6 can be written as the product of 1/2 and 1/3 and 1/12 is the product of 1/2, 1/3, and… ([Location 7313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7313))

- problems on combinations and probabilities. (In fact, I discovered that the Beta function was what I wanted by searching through my copy of Peirce’s A Short Table of Integrals, where I vaguely remembered having seen some ratios of factorials.) Are there any other reasons for thinking of a probability model? Indeed there are. What do word frequency distributions and city size distributions (as well as the other quite different phenomena where this same law applies) have in common? Nothing very obvious, unless they can be viewed as instantiations of the same probabilistic scheme for drawing balls of different colors from an urn. So let us see whether we can interpret the formula as representing the steady state of some sampling process. Here I recall being aided by a metaphor. We think of a book as being created word by word. If a word is added that has already occured k times, the number of words occurring k + 1 times each will be increased by one, and the number of words occurring k times each decreased by one. For equilibrium, the words that had previously occurred k times must be created as rapidly as… ([Location 7324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7324))

- the next pool below. Working back from our answer—the distribution that we know describes the phenomena—it is not hard to show that the equilibrium condition requires that the probability of creating a word that has already occurred k times must be proportional to k. We are ready for the final step: to interpret the probability assumption. For word distributions, it can mean that the chance of a word’s being chosen as the next word in a text is proportional, because of association, to how often it has been used already, and also proportional, because of long-term associations stored in memory, to how often it is used in the language. In the case of city sizes, it can mean that birth and death rates are approximately independent of city size, while cities will be visible and attractive to migrants in proportion to their current sizes (Simon 1955b). I won’t defend these interpretations here. My purpose is to understand the process that reached them. If my account, through the filter of thirty to fifty years of forgetting, has any relation to reality, then we see a process for arriving at the initial formula that looks very… ([Location 7334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7334))

- cascade metaphor, yet at some time it was evoked and helped me to formulate the steady-state relations. So there is still work to be done on the theory of discovery; still theses to be written and papers published. But I see in this little history, or imagined history, no magic, no mystery. Each step appears to proceed, if not inexorably at least plausibly, from the preceding one. If the data cried out so loudly for explanation, and if the discovery process proceeded so plausibly, why did not others discover this law and its explanation? Indeed they did. The first was G. Udny Yule, the English statistician, who in 1924 constructed a model very similar to the one I have just described to explain the data on the distribution of species among genera. (I could have been led to this paper by a footnote in Lotka, but I wasn’t.) A second was the English economist D. G. Champernowne, who published “A Model of Income Distribution” in 1953, describing a quite similar process. A third was B. Mandelbrot, who, in 1953, published “An Informational Theory of the Statistical Structure of Language.” I learned about all of these partial anticipations when I… ([Location 7345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BSZRLDM&location=7345))
