## Highlights
- Then in 1974, two things happened that tripped my head out of whatever thick, suburban haze I was in and off into a whole different realm of life. I read a book called The Last Laugh and saw a movie called Lenny. The Last Laugh by Phil Berger was the first book completely about the world of stand-up comedy. Lenny was a Dustin Hoffman movie about the life of Lenny Bruce. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=44))

- was more than happy to accept being a not-that-funny comedian over any other conceivable option. Without realizing it, of course, this attitude is the exact right way to start out in the world of comedy. Expect nothing. Accept anything.

- I still don’t know exactly for sure where jokes come from. I think it’s from some emotional cocktail of boredom, aggression, intense visual acuity and a kind of Silly Putty of the mind that enables you to re-form what you see into what you want it to be.

- The real problem of stand-up, of course, is that you must constantly justify why you are the only one talking while a room full of people sit quietly. And in the beginning, to just put yourself into what is—let’s face it—that fairly untenable position, you have to love it badly, madly, maybe even sadly. Getting live laughs is a druggy kind of lifestyle. Adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin. The drugstore of the brain does not ask if you have a prescription. It’s like those yogurt places where they let you pull the handle yourself. Oxytocin is sometimes known as “the love drug” because the brain releases it when it receives positive social and/or amorous stimulation. And let me tell you, when you’re on a stage all by yourself under a hot light, with a hot mic, ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=95))

- and those laughs are crashing down around you, it’s a strong, pure hit of every addiction you’ve ever wanted. When I was young, I was obsessed with race-car driving, big-wave surfing, skydiving and really fast motorcycles. One year into doing stand-up comedy I lost interest in all of it. I learned very quickly that stand-up comedy survival has a lot to do with how much and how good your material is. I never met a stand-up who wasn’t funny at all. But for the most part, it was the people who killed themselves to keep coming up with great new material who were able to keep rising through the many levels.

- I can personally guarantee you that every comedian you’ve ever seen feels inside that they don’t have as much good material as they really wish they had. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=137))

- The Left Bit I’m left-handed. Left-handed people do not like that the word “left” is so often associated with negative things. Two left feet. Left-handed compliment. Bad ideas are always “out of left field.” What are we having for dinner? Leftovers. You go to a party, nobody’s there. “Where’d everybody go?” “They left.” ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=155))

- Superman and Clark Kent are the same person. But no one knows because of the secret identity. The disguise? A pair of glasses. That’s it. No other difference in these two faces. Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane. Professional journalists. Able to observe and analyze every detail of their environment. They see no resemblance. These are two entirely different people to their trained eye. If a friend of yours gets new glasses… is it impossible to recognize them? Clark Kent didn’t even have lenses in the frames of the glasses. He would scratch his eye right through them. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=275))

- So, Clark Kent wears the Super costume underneath the business suit. We’ve seen him tear open the shirt. What about the Superman boots? They go inside the regular shoes? How does that work? “I see Clark’s got those red leather socks on again today.” Did Jimmy Olsen ever get suspicious seeing Clark Kent in the men’s room? (Peeing in classic Superman “fists on waist” pose) ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=283))

- Disneyland I never went to Disneyland as a child. That was never going to happen. My parents were not taking me to a different state, thousands of miles away, so I could sit in a teacup. My mother and father were both orphans. Their attitude was, “You have a room. You have a bed. That’s your ride.” I couldn’t even speak the word. “Mom, Dad, there’s a place called Dis—” “What?” “Dis—… Dis-nuh…” That was the most I could get out.

- Parents Look Like I’m wearing contact lenses now but I wore glasses at the age of 10. I thought I had to get glasses because I couldn’t tell what my parents looked like. I’d ask my mother for money and she’d always say, “What do I look like, a bank?” “Do I look like I’m made of money to you?” The truth is, when you’re a kid your parents are the bank. Where else am I going to get money? Am I going to walk into Chase Manhattan? They’re going to say, “What do I look like, your mother?” “Beat it, four eyes…” ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=320))

- 75% Body Heat I was reading this article about how to dress for cold weather. And they said that 75% of all body heat is lost through the top of the head. Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=445))

- Sister Married I have an older sister who’s married. It was hard at first but I’ve adjusted to it now. When a brother or a sister tells you they’re getting married it’s a shock, because the way you know them, you can’t believe anyone would marry them. I met the guy, I said, “Let me get this straight. You intentionally want to spend the rest of your life with my sister? I have to tell you, I’ve done what you want to do. It’s a big mistake. Have you ever tried to borrow a record album from her? Ever shared the back seat on a long car trip? ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=523))

- Parents Comedians? People do say strange things to you when you come offstage. Someone once said to me, “Hey, you were really funny. Were your parents comedians?” “Yes, and all my relatives are comedians. Every single member of my family is a working, professional stand-up comic. You ought to come over at Thanksgiving. It’s a riot. When I was 5 all the other kids were playing with toys. My parents gave me a tuxedo and a pinky ring.” ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=649))

- Smokers Win Arguments The ultimate conversation prop is the cigarette. You cannot win an argument with someone that has a cigarette in their hand. They’re always waving it around. “I’ve got fire right in front of my face. See that? Does that intimidate you in any way?” And then when they put it out, that just ends the argument. I can go, “I think this. I feel this. My opinion is this.” They go, “Really? ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=687))

- Vague Did you ever write a report or a paper in school, and you get it back and the teacher has written “Vague” across a whole page? It’s frustrating. Because “Vague” is kind of a vague thing to say… I would just write “Unclear,” send it back to the teacher. She’d return it to me, “Ambiguous.” We’re still corresponding to this day… ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=760))

- Unemployed Unemployment, that’s a tough thing. Even if you get a job, after you’ve been unemployed, they take unemployment out of your check every week and show it to you in that little box. So every paycheck has the word “unemployment” on it. You can’t get it out of your mind. You just got the job, they’re already getting ready for you to be laid off. I have a friend who’s collecting unemployment insurance. This guy has never worked so hard in his life to keep this going. He’s down there every week, waiting on the lines, getting interviewed, making up all these lies about looking for jobs. If they had any idea of the effort he’s making to avoid work, I’m sure they’d give him a raise. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=811))

- Professional Football Professional football. To me the hardest part of being a professional football player is on the one hand you’re a millionaire. On the other, they blow a whistle and you have to run around after a football. To me, the whole idea of being a millionaire is, somebody throws a football at me. Maybe I catch it. Maybe I don’t. I would think you get someone to hand you the football at that point. “Here you go, sir, that’s another touchdown for you. Would you like a fresh squeezed orange juice before the next play?” ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=884))

- Time Save We all try and save time. All our little shortcuts. But no matter how much time you save, at the end of your life, there’s no extra time saved up. You’ll be going, “What do you mean I’m out of time? I had a no-iron shirt, Velcro sneakers, clip-on tie: Where is that time?” It’s not there. Because when you waste time in life, they subtract it. Like if you saw all the Rocky movies, they deduct that. So, you’ve got to be careful. You can take the Concorde to Europe, ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=892))

- Desk Family Pictures Why do people who work in offices have pictures of their family on their desk facing them? Do they forget that they’re married? Do they say to themselves, “All right. Five o’clock. Time to hit the bars and pick up some hookers. Hold it a second, look at this picture. I’ve got a wife and three kids. Oh my god, I better get home.” ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=936))

- Date Job Interview I like dating because I like tension. There’s dating going on in this room right now. Feel that…? That’s dating tension. What is a date, really, but a job interview that lasts all night? The difference is, not too many job interviews is there a chance you’ll end up naked at the end of it. “Well, Jim, the boss really thinks you’re the man for the job. Why don’t you strip down so you can meet some of the people you’ll be working with…” ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=966))

- Personal Maintenance Let’s face it, the human body is like a condominium apartment. The thing that keeps you from really enjoying it is the maintenance. There’s a tremendous amount of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly work that has to be done. From showering to open-heart surgery, we’re always doing something to ourselves. If your body was a used car, you wouldn’t buy it. You’d go, “Nah, I’ve heard about these human being bodies. This is one of those Earth models, right? Yeah, a cousin of mine had one. Too much work to keep them going. The new ones are nice looking, though.” ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=985))

- Men’s Room Then there’s the Men’s Room, which I hate. I’m sure if I met a man outside that room, I would find them to be a charming, delightful person. But the Men’s Room is a nauseating, disgusting place. And every man in there is a sickening, revolting human slime. You don’t want to see, relate, or interact in any way with any human in that room. We won’t even use our hands when we’re in there. Men operate everything with their feet as soon as they walk in. We’re like orangutans in the Men’s Room. Manipulating toilets, faucets, handles, everything. They ought to put the ropes in there. So we can just swing in… Pee.

- In Sickness The best time to be in a relationship is when you’re sick. And the best time to be sick is when you’re in a relationship. When I get married, I don’t think I’ll need all those different vows. Just the sickness part. That’s the most important one to me. My whole wedding ceremony will be, “Do you take this man in sickness?” The rest of the time go out, have a ball, do whatever you want. But the second I have a temperature, you better be there.

- A Giant On-Off Switch Your car breaks down. You get out of the car. Walk around the front… Open the hood… And then do the big “Look In.” “Well, there it is… That’s the car. Boy, I wish I knew what was going on in there.” We’re hoping that we will see something that’s so obvious. So simple. So easy to fix. Even you can do it. Like a giant On/Off switch turned “OFF.” “Okay… I think I can fix this.” ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=1053))

- It’s That Guy No matter whatever else you do in life, having a kid is the big step. I think you get to a point where everybody you know has pretty much caught on to you. You need to create a new person, someone that doesn’t know anything about you. You need a relationship with a person who’s impressed that you know where the spoons are. That’s the level. Where to urinate. This is why you have kids. They really look up to you in these areas. Of course, the kid matures, becomes intelligent and leaves the house. That is why people get pets. Dogs stay stupid. They never catch on to anything. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=1061))

- Keys to the Plane The other day on a plane I thought, “I wonder if there’s keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane?” Maybe that’s what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you’re just sitting there at the gate. Maybe the pilot’s up there in the cockpit going, “Oh, I don’t believe this… dammit… I did it again.” They tell you it’s something mechanical, because they don’t want to come on the P.A. system, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while. I, uh… oh god, this is so embarrassing… I, I left the keys to the plane in my apartment. They’re in this big blue ashtray by the front door. I’m really sorry. I’ll run back and get them.” ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=1131))

- Airport Tuna Sandwich Do the stores in the airport have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do they just feel they have their own little country out there, and they can charge anything they want? “You want a tuna sandwich? It’s 28 dollars. If you don’t like it, go back to your own country.” I think the whole airport/airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what’s supporting the entire air-travel industry. The planes could fly empty, they’d still make money. The terminals, the airplanes, the parking, the gift shops. It’s all just to distract you, so you don’t notice the beating you’re taking on the tuna. ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=1189))

That’s your first line of defense. You want those pants so tight, the flap in front of the zipper has pulled itself open and you can see the metal tangs of the zipper hanging on for dear life. Then you put the bag on the conveyor belt. Goes through the little luggage car wash. Then you have… ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=1198))

- Superhero Men Women, the thing you’ve got to understand about men is, men think we can accomplish virtually anything of a physical nature that needs to be done. Every man secretly believes inside his own mind that he is a low-level superhero. This is the true inner nature of men. I’m not even really supposed to be telling you this. When men are growing up and we’re reading about Batman, Superman, Spider-Man. These are not fantasies to us. These are our options. All men think, “If I had to swing from a rope. Crash through a window. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=2597))

- And beat up a room full of bad guys. I would probably somehow be able to do it. In the meantime, I’m going to straighten up the garage. Because that’s pretty important too.” You ever see a guy with a mattress on the roof of his car, driving down the highway? Without fail, he’s got his hand out the window, holding the mattress. This is classic, male, idiot superhero thinking. This moron believes that if the wind catches this huge rectangle at 70 mph, “I got it. I got it… I am using MY ARM.” ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=2605))

I know I will never be able to understand how a woman can take boiling hot wax, pour it on her upper thighs, rip the hair out by the root. And still be afraid of a spider. I’m not spending any more time working on that. And I know women don’t understand men.

That was the longest possible route you could take to get where you wanted to be. Why didn’t we just stay here? We would have been first…” I’ll tell you one thing the horses definitely do not know.

When you go for a hair transplant, they don’t say, “We’re going to perform a Cue-ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We feel the Chrome-domus has advanced to a level we term, Skin-head-ia.

Like, when you go to see the doctor, they don’t just let you see the doctor. You must first wait in the waiting room. There’s no chance of not waiting. That’s the name of the room. Just the fact that doctors have Waiting Rooms is like saying, “All appointments are meaningless. My schedule is bogus.” You sit there, you pretend you’re reading your little magazine, you’re actually looking at the other people… (to oneself) “I wonder what he’s got… ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=3080))

You look around at the other people, (very pleased) “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen…” And you get very excited, because you think you’re going to see the doctor. But you’re not. You’re just going into the next, smaller Waiting Room. Now, you don’t even have your magazine. Now you’ve got your pants around your ankles, you’re sitting on that butcher paper they pull out over the table. Sometimes I bring a pickle with me. Put it next to me right there on the table. In case the doctor wants to wrap the whole thing up for a to-go order. But medically speaking, it’s always good to be in a small room.

- You don’t want to be in a large room, like those operating theaters that they have with stadium seating. You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “Well, I have to see this. Are you kidding? Are they really going to do that? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Doctors always want your pants off. “Get your pants off and get in there and then I will tell you what I think.” “The doctor would like to see you with no pants. Just get them off.” It really gives him an advantage. In any difference of opinion, Pants always beats No Pants. But I hate the extra wait, so I start screwing around with some of his stuff. “Maybe I’ll turn that thing up a little bit.

But a man with some flowers has a chance. If there were no flowers on earth, the world would be men and lesbians, that’s it. And that’s why flower stores are not set up right for what men need. It should be that you walk in, you tell them what you did wrong, they give you the flowers for that, and you just continue right out the back. The “Alright, Your Brother’s Not an Idiot” bouquet.

There is nothing the female brain cannot do. It will solve all problems of Earth and Life. Having done that, it will move on to the hypothetical. Theoretical situations. That may or may not occur. The female needs to know ([Location 3513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=3513))

I have a game show podium. Set up in my living room. I wake up in the morning. Stand behind the podium. Try and answer all my wife’s questions. And get on with the god damn day. I’ve got a little hand button clicker. “I’ll take movies I think we saw together for $200.” ([Location 3518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=3518))

The fashions, the makeup, the hair color, the streaks, the highlights, the sparkles. A sighted man can’t see straight. Blind man sees through all of it.

And they’re always comparing you to what’s on the BlackBerry. “Uh-huh, which is really more interesting here?” Is there anything worse than when they do that slow head drop? And they just leave you.

As far as anyone’s concerned, this whole thing never happened.” I would not want to be cremated. It seems impolite. I feel the least I can do at my own funeral is show up.

For example, in your car, dual zone separate buttons on each side climate control systems. Gee, I wonder if it was a married person that thought of that? Thought this could possibly come in handy, if you are with a certain person that you are perchance legally bound to for the rest of your life, and you need them to shut the hell up about the temperature. “I’m freezing. I’m roasting. I’m boiling. It’s blowing on me.” When my wife says, “The air is on me.” ([Location 4926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=4926))

Just lie down in the bed. When you’re out of bed, that’s when you do stuff. ([Location 5237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5237))

- Device Dictatorship What about the device dictatorship we live under now? Cowering in fear from our phones. “Where’s my phone? I need my phone. Can’t find my phone. Oh, here it is. I got it. I moved it from this pocket to this pocket. I wasn’t sure where it was for 1.5 seconds. But I’m okay now.” We are so hypno-phone-ified. You hand your phone to somebody now to show them something. After three seconds you’re like, (reaching out) “… Okay, you saw it… that’s it… give it back. I am completely off the grid right now!” ([Location 5489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5489))

- You don’t know your cholesterol. You don’t know your blood pressure. But you know how much juice is in your phone. You know that number. I could ask anyone in this audience, “Tell me roughly, without looking, how much juice is in your phone right now?” You know it. I’m sitting on 25 backstage, I don’t feel that good I’ll be honest with you. Could be 15. I’m falling apart back there…! You used to think about your life. Now you think about your battery life. You have two lives you must maintain. And I don’t know which one is more important. If your phone dies, does it really matter if you’re still alive?

- Half Myself/Half Phone There is no separating from the phone for us. Who are you with no phone? What access to information do you have? What can you remember? What are you going to do without your pictures? Are you going to describe what you saw? That doesn’t work. We don’t talk to people without phones anymore. That’s why it’s called an iPhone. It’s half myself, half phone. That’s a complete individual. ([Location 5515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5515))

- First Camera Phone I remember very clearly when I first heard that they were going to put a camera in the cell phone. I thought, “Camera? I’m on the phone.” It’s like a toothbrush popping out of your TV remote. “Yes, I need both these things. Why are they teaming up? What can they do together?” So, when they come up with these things like the camera in the cell phone do they ever go, “Hey, before we put this out to every human being all over the world… Are you sure this is a good idea?” “Of course, it’s a good idea. What do you mean?” “I don’t know… I was just wondering… ([Location 5610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5610))

- You don’t think there’s any chance that this one feature all by itself, could result in so many useless pictures, video, posting, liking, not liking, comments and clapbacks that the entire essential life force of the human race just drains out like a puddle of piss by the side of the road and we never accomplish anything significant ever again? You don’t think there’s any chance of that, do you?” “No, I do not. Nor do I think that every restaurant dinner will end with some picture bully going, ‘Okay, everyone. Picture. Need a picture. Got to get a picture.’ ” “Why? We didn’t have a good time. I don’t want to remember this.” ([Location 5619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5619))

- And let’s make sure we get the least phone-fluent person in the area to take the picture. Someone old, nervous, clumsy, confused or dim-witted. Someone whose fingers do not receive or respond well to brain commands. Can’t hold things, see things, aim things, press things. Someone who, the second they’re handed the phone it somehow slips off camera function, and they can’t get it back. “Hold on… Wait… Can somebody get it back on the camera? I don’t know… how to…” Let’s get them. So we can be standing here even longer with fake frozen smiles and your arm around someone you would never touch in any other social situation.

- Corona Kamikaze I feel like if I could talk to the coronavirus I would say, “Let me understand this. I get you. You kill me. And then that kills you. Where are you going with this?” If any of these conditions was able to outmaneuver all medicines and treatments. Kill everybody. They would get down to the last guy and go, “You know, I don’t think we completely thought this thing through. We just wiped ourselves out. That was a complete dead end.” I guess it’s just a Kamikaze thing. ([Location 5816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5816))

- Which is a group of people I have always been fascinated by. Dedicated. Idiotic. Completely off on their own. It’s basically the show you’re watching right now. What about the Kamikaze pilot parents? Proud? Neighbors come over, “Hey, congratulations. I hear your son’s a Kamikaze. Are you worried about him? I guess the worst thing that can happen is he comes home safe and sound. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. I’m sure he’ll do great.” Do you think the Kamikazes were any of their real good pilots? I don’t know. There really is no way we can know. But I think if you have a fighter pilot in your squadron that is shooting down enemy planes ([Location 5824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5824))

- without getting shot down himself—I think we’re going to hold on to that guy. “But Wing Wa over here, who has busted three sets of landing gear this week. Because he doesn’t listen—we have a special program for you, Wing. And you won’t need your helmet for this one. Unless you want to put it on sideways and look out the earhole like you usually do.” ([Location 5833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5833))

- Pre-Existing Conditions My favorite term in the health care thing is when they talk about pre-existing conditions. To me, something either exists or it does not exist. I always thought everything has to be in one of those two categories. “So before this health problem even existed you had it?” “That’s right.” I went to the doctor, he said, “What’s wrong?” I said, “Nothing yet.” He said, “How long have you been feeling like this?” I said, “My whole life.” He said, “I just wish you would have come in to see me sooner.” So, the disease is in the future. We’re in the present, ([Location 5837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084BYK62K&location=5837))
