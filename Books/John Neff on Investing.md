- Perhaps my career started before I learned to count. I was always a stubborn little fellow, which my mother expressed very succinctly: "John Brown," she declared, "You would argue with a signpost." She was not only right, she was prescient. My whole career, [ have argued with the stock market. Happily, as the Windsor Fund's record shows, I won more arguments with the market than I lost.

- person cannot step twice in the same river, because the river changes constantly. Nor, in the same sense, can an investor step twice in the same market, because the market changes constantly.Hang around long enough, though, and you will begin to recognize the market's personality. It is irrational and unsentimental. It is cantankerous and hostile. At times, it is forgiving and congenial. The market has good days and bad day's, good years and bad years. You can't predict them, and they can reverse course with stunning speed. But you can learn to cope with them and improve your odds. In the bargain, you can make good money.Contrarian that I am, the format for this book is intentionally unorthodox as books on investing go these days. It is not about I lail Mary passes; it's about grinding out gains quarter after quarter, year after year. My kind of investing rests on three elements: character, goals, and experience. Therein lies the three-part structure. Part One (My Road to Windsor) is about niy character, Part Two (Enduring Principles) portrays goals and mechanics, and Part Three (A Market Journal) records how events played out during the last ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WE495G&location=95))

- -VA'indsor's roller coaster experience with Citi underscored a crucial point: investment success does not require glamour stocks or bull markets. Judgment and fortitude were our prerequisites. Judgment singles out opportunities, fortitude enables you to live with them while the rest of the world scrambles in another direction. Citi exemplified this investment challenge. To us, ugly stocks were often beautiful. If Windsor's portfolio looked good, we weren't doing our job. Citi wasn't the first such stock, and it certainly wasn't our last.

- Meantime, Dodds apparently approached my grandmother about providing start-up money for a store of his own, and she complied. Amy success was short-lived. It's hard to say whether the business started to slide and Dodds started to drink, or vice versa. In the end, the sequence did not matter. Dodds succumbed to alcohol, the company went bankrupt, and three more lessons were impressed upon me at a young age: (1) when it comes to money, emotional attachment can fool you; (2) just because a company is down it is not always a wise investment, and (3) excessive drinking was not a business or a personal virtue.

- Much like money in the stock market, poker money migrated to the most proficient and well financed players, a group that usually included me. Observing occasionally, I noted how sailors who ultimately went home with cash in their pockets played consistently and with good knowledge of the odds. They were not lured into action for big pots unless the numbers were on their side. If those sailors applied the same philosophy to stocks, some of them are successful investors today.

- Art Boanas, a thoughtful mentor, always brought a fresh view to investing. An economist by training, Art was brilliant and quirky and contrarian to his marrow. He came to the Bank by way of a post at the Federal Reserve. In contrast with Sidney Robbins, he assigned no particular importance to Graham & Dodd. He professed no interest in what they had to say about securities analysis, but that did not prevent him from sniffing out the kinds of investments they might have recommended.Besides conveying his overarching economic perspective-a mix of classical economics and skeptical views of human nature--Art schooled me in the principles of contrarian investing. Given my penchant for arguing with signposts, I took rapidly to arguing with the marketplace. We fought the same intellectual battles, sometimes together and sometimes challenging each other. A genial Englishman who had patrolled the moors of Yorkshire as a teenager during World \V'ar II, Art nevertheless exemplified, for me, intellectual ruthlessness. Ideas and judgments about markets or stocks are easy to defend when they reflect prevailing opinion, but going your own way is a lonely ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WE495G&location=560))

- task that pits an investor against conventional wisdom and often against his or her own inner voice. When you follow a contrarian path, Art often said, "The investment community can make you look bloody wrong." A decision will look wrong the next day if you can buy the same stock for less-the very opposite of an investor's most fundamental aspiration. But that's how it goes outside the friendly confines of received wisdom. To bolster his own confidence, Art adhered to a simple proposition: "I'm not fighting another person," he said. "I'm fighting the market, just one person against the market." This approach appealed to oddballs like us. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WE495G&location=567))

- On the strength of previous contact, I also called Wellington. Its equity fund, Wellington Lquity, had plunged dramatically since it was introduced in 1958. This time, they weren't looking for just an auto analyst. They wanted someone with ideas for potentially rescuing the beleaguered Wellington Equity fund, which foundered in its fifth year of existence amid the dramatic 1961-1962 inflection point.

- Then, as now, this approach amounts to hitting behnd the hall instead of anticipating market climates six to eighteen months ahead of the investment crowd. Poor performance often occurred as a consequence of a technical orientation that tried to predict peaks and troughs in stock charts. It assumed that where a stock has been implies where it is going. Many funds used charts to divine future stock prices. When I was interviewed at Dreyfus, my tour included the chart room, replete with all kinds of electronic gadgets and readouts. Playing the technical or momentum game always has seemed misguided to me. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WE495G&location=642))

- It is critical to understand that a stock's price reflects two underlying variables: (1) earnings per share and (2) the multiple of earnings per share that the market attaches to it. Thus, two stocks both may earn $2 a share. But if one is perceived to be growing faster, the stock price normally garners a higher multiple to encompass expectations of higher earnings later on. If the multiples are, say, 15 times earnings and 30 times earnings, then the shares of each stock will change hands for $30 and $60, respectively. By capturing growth in earnings and the expansion of a market multiple, shrewd investors cash in. Too many of Windsor's stocks, unfortunately, got caught instead in a downdraft; steep declines in market multiples were set off by hints of slower growth rates.

Of 41 industrial stocks, scarcely 8deserved to he called successful, and their successes were lackluster at best. The majority of extreme losers, it turned out, lent themselves to three generalizations:1. Almost without exception, faulty company analysis deserved the blame. Fundamental targets were simply missed by extremely large margins.2. Windsor had not overpaid for anticipated earnings-or even current earnings, for that matter.

- To prevent similar imbroglios from recurring, I advised fund directors to restrain stock selections in the industrial products segment to predictable companies in predictable industry climates, where Windsor might capitalize on special abilities in economic analysis. These targets would be less dramatic but more assured-essentially incorporating the conservative Wellington philosophy in the Windsor grow-h fund.Restraint did not rule out room in the portfolio for future champions.

Nevertheless, I was promised access to any analysts at any time. As things turned out, the promise of analytical support did not materialize. Put yourself in the analysts' position. While I was knocking at their door, asking for their time and perspective, Wellington also was knocking. Windsor was a $75 million fund; Wellington had $2 billionunder management and it was the flagship. It wasn't hard to figure out which fund was going to command the analysts' attention.After about six months of butting my head against the wall, I concluded that I would never get sufficient support from Wellington analysts.

This concept sounds esoteric, but the idea was really quite simple. We elected to measure our degree of participation in one stock against the relative risks and rewards we would expect to find in other market sectors. For example, no matter how attractive a particular oil stock looks, we have to isk ourselves whether a different sector of the market looks more promising.A decade before experts started talking about asset al location strategies, Windsor set out to shift assets between large, stab e, fairly predictable companies and smaller companies whose products, markets, or services had more room to grow, but on a less sturdv foundation."Measured Participation" framed Windsor's efforts to :lassify, categorize, and analyze our portfolio performance.

We aimed for easier and less risky appreciation, and left "greater fool" investing to others.This strategy gave Windsor's performance a twofold edge: (1) excellent upside participation and (2) good protection on the downside.

- Growth rates and p/e ratios don't always orchestrate themselves so favorably. But the extra gain shown in the table above, courtesy of p/e expansion, is not far-fetched. Windsor landed results of this magnitude time and time again by wagering that overlooked companies would attract market attention. Over almost any period of time, that wager is far safer than betting, along with momentum investors, that high fliers will continue streaking to new heights.Brand-name growth stocks ordinarily command the highest p/e ratios. Rising prices beget attention, and vice versa-but only to a point. Eventually, their growth rate can diminish as results revert towards normal. Maybe not in all cases, but often enough to make a long-term bet. Bottom line: I wouldn't want to get caught in a rush for the exit, much less get left behind. Only when big growth stocks fall into the dumper from time to time am I inclined to pick them up-and even then, only in moderation.
