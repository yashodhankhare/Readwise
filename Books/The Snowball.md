- Warren begins to tell his story: “Balzac said that behind every great fortune lies a crime.1 That’s not true at Berkshire.” ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=159))

- Most of the press people liked Buffett, who went out of his way not to be disliked by anyone. He also intrigued them. His public image was that of a simple man, and he seemed genuine. Yet he lived a complicated life. He owned five homes but occupied only two of them. Somehow he had wound up having, in effect, two wives. He spoke in homely aphorisms with a kindly twinkle in his eye and had a notably loyal group of friends, yet along the way he had earned a reputation as a tough, even icy dealmaker. He seemed to shun publicity yet managed to attract more of it than almost any other businessman on earth.3 He jetted around the country in a G-IV, often attended celebrity events, and had many famous friends, yet said that he preferred Omaha, hamburgers, and thrift. He spoke of his success as being based on a few simple investing ideas and tap-dancing to work with enthusiasm every day, but if that was so, why had nobody else been able to replicate it?

- That was so even though their banker host, Herbert Allen, thought the “new paradigm” for valuing technology stocks—based on clicks and eyeballs and projections of far-off growth rather than a company’s ability to earn cold hard cash—was bunk. “New paradigm,” he sniffed. “It’s like new sex. There just isn’t any such thing.”12 ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=340))

- The stock of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, languished in their dust, and his rigid rule of not buying technology stocks seemed outmoded. But the criticism had no influence on how he invested, and to date, the only public statement he had made was that he never made market predictions. So his decision to do just that at Sun Valley was unprecedented. Perhaps it was the times. Buffett had a firm conviction and an overwhelming urge to preach.14 ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=349))

- “To all you fellow ring-kissers, I would like to talk today about the stock market,” he said. “I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting. “In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it’s a weighing machine. “Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it’s a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications, as you’ve all learned.” ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=390))

- “Now, Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” Interest rates—the cost of borrowing—Buffett explained, are the price of “when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that’s why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand.” In his flat, breathy twang, the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another, Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash—the bird in the hand—at such low rates. So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the “greed factor.” ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=406))

- Buffett continued. There were only three ways the stock market could keep rising at ten percent or more a year. One was if interest rates fell and remained below historic levels. The second was if the share of the economy that went to investors, as opposed to employees and government and other things, rose above its already historically high level.19 Or, he said, the economy could start growing faster than normal.20 He called it “wishful thinking” to use optimistic assumptions like these.

- “This is half of a page which comes from a list seventy pages long of all the auto companies in the United States.” He waved the complete list in the air. “There were two thousand auto companies: the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people’s lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived.21 And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.” He put down the list to shove his hand in his pocket. “Now, sometimes it’s much easier to figure out the losers. There was, I think, one obvious decision back then. And, of course, the thing you should have been doing was shorting horses.”* Click. A slide about horses popped up. U.S. HORSE POPULATION 1900—17 million 1998—5 million “Frankly, I’m kind of disappointed that the Buffett family was not shorting horses throughout this entire period. There are always losers.” Members of the audience chuckled, albeit faintly. Their companies might be losing money, but in their hearts beat a conviction that they were winners, supernovas blazing at the cusp of a momentous shift in the heavens. Click. Another slide appeared. “Now, the other great invention of the first half of the century was the airplane. In this period from 1919 to 1939, there were about two hundred companies. Imagine if you could have seen the future of the airline industry back there at Kitty Hawk. You would have seen a world undreamed of. But assume you had the insight, and you saw all of these people wishing to fly and to visit their relatives or run away from their relatives or whatever you do in an airplane, and you decided this was the place to be. “As of a couple of years ago, there had been zero money made from the aggregate of all stock investments in the airline industry in history. “So I submit to you: I really like to think that if I had been down there at Kitty Hawk, I would have been farsighted enough and public-spirited enough to have shot Orville down. I owed it to future capitalists.”22 Another light chuckle. Some were getting tired of these musty old examples. But out of respect, they let Buffett get on with it. Now he was talking about their businesses. “It’s wonderful to promote new industries, because they are very promotable. It’s very hard to promote investment in a mundane product. It’s much easier to promote an esoteric product, even particularly one with losses, because there’s no quantitative guideline.” This was goring the audience directly, where it hurt. “But people will keep coming back to invest, you know. It reminds me a little of that story of… ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=426))

- a house of ill repute. The speech might rivet the audience to its chairs, but that didn’t mean that they would go forth and abstain. Yet some thought they were hearing something important. “This is great; it’s the basic tutorial on the stock market, all in one lesson,” thought Gates.27 The money managers, many of whom were hunting for cheaper stocks, found it comforting and even cathartic. Buffett waved a book in the air. “This book was the intellectual underpinning of the 1929 stock-market mania. Edgar Lawrence Smith’s Common Stocks as Long Term Investments proved that stocks always yielded more than bonds. Smith identified five reasons, but the most novel of these was the fact that companies retained some of their earnings, which they could reinvest at the same rate of return. That was the plowback—a novel idea in 1924! But as my mentor, Ben Graham, always used to say, ‘You can get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea,’ because you forget that the good idea has limits. Lord Keynes, in his preface to this book, said, ‘There is a danger of expecting the results of the future to be predicted from the past.’ ”28 He had worked his way back around to the same subject: that one couldn’t extrapolate… ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=484))

- for he cared a great deal what they thought of him. He had named no culprits, and he assumed they would get over his jokes. His argument was so powerful, almost unassailable, that he thought even those who didn’t like its message must acknowledge its force. And whatever unease the audience felt was not expressed aloud. He answered questions until the session ended. People began to stand, awarding him an ovation.

- Both regarded rationality and honesty as the highest virtues. Quickened pulses and self-delusion, in their view, were the major causes of mistakes. They liked to ponder the reasons for failure as a way of deducing the rules of success. “I had long looked for insight by inversion, in the intense manner counseled by the great algebraist Carl Jacobi,” Munger said. “ ‘Invert, always invert.’ ” He illustrated this with the story of a wise peasant who said, “Tell me where I’m going to die so I won’t go there.” ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=546))

- “I feel like I’m on my back, and there’s the Sistine Chapel, and I’m painting away. I like it when people say, ‘Gee, that’s a pretty good-looking painting.’ But it’s my painting, and when somebody says, ‘Why don’t you use more red instead of blue?’ Good-bye. It’s my painting. And I don’t care what they sell it for. The painting itself will never be finished. That’s one of the great things about it.5 “The big question about how people behave is whether they’ve got an Inner Scorecard or an Outer Scorecard. It helps if you can be satisfied with an Inner Scorecard. I always pose it this way. I say: ‘Lookit. Would you rather be the world’s greatest lover, but have everyone think you’re the world’s worst lover? Or would you rather be the world’s worst lover but have everyone think you’re the world’s greatest lover?’ Now, that’s an interesting question. “Here’s another one. If the world couldn’t see your results, would you rather be thought of as the world’s greatest investor but in reality have the world’s worst record? Or be thought of as the world’s worst investor when you were actually the best? “In teaching your kids, I think the lesson they’re learning at a very, very early age is what their parents put the emphasis on. If all the emphasis is on what the world’s going to think about you, forgetting about how you really behave, you’ll wind up with an Outer Scorecard. Now, my dad: He was a hundred percent Inner Scorecard guy. “He was really a maverick. But he wasn’t a maverick for the sake of being a maverick. He just didn’t care what other people thought. My dad taught me how life should be lived. I’ve never seen anybody quite like him.” ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=695))

- “When I was a kid,” Warren would later say, “I got all kinds of good things. I had the advantage of a home where people talked about interesting things, and I had intelligent parents and I went to decent schools. I don’t think I could have been raised with a better pair of parents. That was enormously important. I didn’t get money from my parents, and I really didn’t want it. But I was born at the right time and place. I won the ‘Ovarian Lottery.’ ” ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=837))

- Three weeks later, England went off the “gold standard.”* This meant that, to avoid bankruptcy, the country—which was deep in debt—would simply print more money to pay off its loans. It was as if the country with the most widely trusted and accepted currency of the age announced: “We are going to write bad checks, and you can take them or else.” The announcement instantly exploded trust in formerly gilt-edged institutions. All over the world, financial markets plunged. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=880))

- But Leila’s attitude of duty and sacrifice had another, darker, side: blame and shame. After Howard left on the streetcar for work in the morning, Doris and Warren would be playing or getting dressed and suddenly Leila might explode at them. Something in the tone of her voice might give a clue that the fuse was lit, but most of the time there was no warning. “It was always something that we did or said, and ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=922))

- there would be this flash, and then it didn’t subside. All your past sins would be brought up. It was just endless. And my mother attributed it sometimes to having neuralgia, but she never showed that outwardly.” When in a rage, Leila would verbally lash the children over and over again, always the same: Their lives were easy compared to her sacrifices; they were worthless, ungrateful, and selfish, and should feel ashamed. She would pick at every real and imagined flaw; she nearly always aimed the tirade at Doris, and carried on saying the same things for at least an hour, sometimes as long as two. She never stopped until both children “just folded,” says Warren, weeping helplessly. “She was not content until she reduced you to tears,” says Doris. Warren was forced to watch her explosions, unable to protect his sister and desperate to avoid being targeted himself. While it was apparent that her attacks were deliberate and she had some degree of control over them, it isn’t at all clear how she perceived her behavior as a parent. But no matter what she thought she was doing, by the time Warren was three years old and their sister Roberta, known as Bertie, was born, “it couldn’t be put back together,” he says, for him or for Doris. The damage to their souls was done. The children never asked for help from their father, even though they knew that he was aware of Leila’s eruptions. Howard might say to them, “Mom’s on the warpath,” a tipoff that a rage was coming, but he didn’t intervene. Usually, Leila’s explosions took place out of Howard’s earshot, and they were never aimed at him. Even though he did not save them, Howard meant security, because when he was around, they were safe.

- As Warren stood in the doorway with his cornet, the first trumpet player sounded, Dum da DUM. But on the second dum, he hit a wrong note. “My whole life flashed before my eyes, because I didn’t know what to do with the echo. They hadn’t prepared me for this. Paralyzed—my big moment.” Should he copy the other trumpet player’s mistake or embarrass him by contradicting what he’d played? Warren was undone. The scene scalded itself permanently into his memory—except for what he did next. Years later, which course he followed—assuming he played any note at all—had become a blank. He had learned a lesson: It might seem easier to go through life as the echo—but only until the other guy plays a wrong note.

- Enlisting his sister Doris as a partner, he bought three shares of a stock for each of them, costing him $114.75 for his three shares of Cities Service Preferred.11 “I didn’t understand that stock very well when I bought it,” he says; he knew only that it was a favorite stock that Howard had sold to his customers for years.12 The market hit a low that June, and Cities Service Preferred plunged from $38.25 to $27 a share. Doris, he says, “reminded” him every day on the way to school that her stock was going down. Warren says he felt terribly responsible. So when the stock finally recovered, he sold at $40, netting a $5 profit for the two of them. “That’s when I knew that he knew what he was doing,” Doris recalls. But Cities Service quickly soared to $202 a share. Warren learned three lessons and would call this episode one of the most important of his life. One lesson was not to overly fixate on what he had paid for a stock. The second was not to rush unthinkingly to grab a small profit. He learned these two lessons by brooding over the $492 he would have made had he been more patient. It had taken five years of work, since he was six years old, to save the $120 ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=1270))

- to buy this stock. Based on how much he currently made from selling golf balls or peddling popcorn and peanuts at the ballpark, he realized that it could take years to earn back the profit he had “lost.” He would never, never, never forget this mistake. And there was a third lesson, which was about investing other people’s money. If he made a mistake, it might get somebody upset at him. So he didn’t want to have responsibility for anyone else’s money unless he was sure he could succeed. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=1280))

- But it took numbers to prove that it actually worked. He decided to do a statistical analysis of what happened if he did follow Dale Carnegie’s rules, and what happened if he didn’t. He tried giving attention and appreciation, and he tried doing nothing or being disagreeable. People around him did not know he was performing experiments on them in the silence of his own head, but he watched how they responded. He kept track of his results. Filled with a rising joy, he saw what the numbers proved: The rules worked. Now he had a system. He had a set of rules.

That is so fundamental, you know.” Did he realize that he’d made an emotional decision? “Oh, yeah. Oh, I was sick.

- And yet Warren would later come to consider his rejection by Harvard the pivotal episode of his life. Almost immediately, he started investigating other graduate schools. While leafing through the Columbia catalog one day, he came across two names that were familiar to him: Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. “These were big names to me. I’d just read Graham’s book, but I had no idea he was teaching at Columbia.” “Graham’s book” was The Intelligent Investor, published in 1949.6 This book of “practical counsel” for all types of investors—the cautious (or “defensive”) and speculative (or “enterprising”)—blew apart the conventions of Wall Street, overturning what had heretofore been largely uninformed speculation in stocks. It explained for the first time in a way that ordinary people could understand that the stock market does not operate through black magic. Through examples of real stocks such as the Northern Pacific Railway and the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, Graham illustrated a rational, mathematical approach to valuing stocks. Investing, he said, should be systematic. The book had mesmerized Warren. For years, he had been going downtown to the library and checking out every book available on stocks and investing. Many of the books dealt with stock-picking systems based on models and patterns; Warren wanted a system, something that would work reliably. He had been fascinated by numerical patterns—technical analysis. “I read all of them over and over. The book that probably had the most influence on me was Garfield Drew, who wrote an important book about odd-lot stock trading.7 I read that about three times. I read Edwards and McGee, which is the bible of technical analysis.8 I would go down to the library and just clean them out.” But when he found The Intelligent Investor, he read and reread it. “It was almost like he found a god,” said Truman Wood, his housemate.9 After careful study, he had gone ahead and made a “value” investment on his own. Through a connection of his father’s, he had heard of a company called Parkersburg Rig & Reel, which he researched according to Graham’s rules. He bought two hundred shares.10 ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=2400))

- Warren’s vision of shareholder meetings rose from his conception of the nature of a business. He had recently sold his tenant farm, doubling his money over five years. During the time he had owned it, he and his tenant farmer had shared the profits on the crop. But his tenant didn’t share the profits from selling the land. As the capitalist, Warren put up the money and took the risk, and then he got the gain, if there was any. Warren thought of all businesses this way. The employees who managed the business shared in the earnings that their labors produced. But they were accountable to their owners, and it was the owners who got the gains as the value of the business increased. Of course, if the employees bought stock themselves, they became owners, too, and partners with the other capitalists. But no matter how much stock they owned, as employees their job required them to report to the owners on how well they had done. Thus, Warren saw a shareholder meeting as a time of accounting for the stewardship of the managers. This vision was rarely shared by company managements, however.

- Warren had studied insurance at Penn, and there was an aspect of it a little like gambling that intrigued the oddsmaker in him. He had become interested in an insurance scheme called a tontine, in which people pool their money and the last survivor gets the whole pot. But tontines were now illegal.21 ([Location 2580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=2580))

- In his three wives, Graham’s taste had ranged wide: from the passionate, strong-willed Hazel Mazur to Broadway showgirl Carol Wade—eighteen years his junior—to his third wife and former secretary, the intelligent, lighthearted Estelle “Estey” Messing. Complicating all these marriages was his complete indifference to monogamy. Graham later wrote a memoir11 in which he begins, “Let me describe my first extramarital affair in the soberest fashion,” a sobriety he giddily abandons six sentences later as he explains the recipe for his liaison with the sharp-tongued, “by no means beautiful” Jenny: “one part attraction and four parts opportunity.” If more attraction was present, he needed less opportunity, making him shameless, even annoying, in his sexual advances toward women. Combining two of his hobbies, Graham might dash off a seductive little poem to a woman he fancied on the subway. Yet he was so cerebral that it must have been a challenge for his lovers to hold his attention.

- From Graham’s class, Warren took away three main principles: A stock is the right to own a little piece of a business. A stock is worth a certain fraction of what you would be willing to pay for the whole business. Use a margin of safety. Investing is built on estimates and uncertainty. A wide margin of safety ensures that the effects of good decisions are not wiped out by errors. The way to advance, above all, is by not retreating. Mr. Market is your servant, not your master. Graham postulated a moody character called Mr. Market, who offers to buy and sell stocks every day, often at prices that don’t make sense. Mr. Market’s moods should not influence your view of price. However, from time to time he does offer the chance to buy low and sell high. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=2752))
- Warren had one goal in mind. He knew he would excel if Graham would hire him. While lacking self-confidence in many things, he had always felt surefooted in the specialized area of stocks. He proposed himself to Graham for a job at Graham-Newman Corporation. It took audacity to even dream of working for the great man himself, but Warren was audacious. He was, after all, Ben Graham’s star student, the only one to earn an A+ in his class. If Walter Schloss could work there, why couldn’t he? To clinch the deal, he offered to work for free. He went in and asked for the job with far more confidence than he had felt riding up to Chicago for his interview with the Harvard Business School. Graham turned him down. “He was terrific. He just said, ‘Lookit, Warren. In Wall Street still, the “white-shoe” firms, the big investment banks, they don’t hire Jews. We only have the ability to hire a very few people here. And, therefore, we only hire Jews.’ That was true of the two gals in the office and everybody. It was sort of like his version of affirmative action. And the truth is, there was a lot of prejudice against Jews in the fifties. I understood.” ([Location 2796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=2796))

- That didn’t make sense to Warren. Since 1929, the value of businesses had grown substantially. “It was absolutely the reverse effect of what you saw in other times, when the market was staggeringly overvalued. I had looked at companies. I just couldn’t see why you wouldn’t want to own them. It was on a micro level, not an assessment of the growth of the economy or anything like that, and I was working with micro money. But it just seemed to me that it was crazy not to own them. On the other hand, here’s Ben, with his two hundred IQ, telling me to wait. And my dad, who, if he told me to walk out a window, I would have done it.” To make this decision to defy the advice of his two great authorities—his father and Ben Graham—was an enormous step for Warren. It required him to consider the possibility that his judgment might be superior to theirs. Yet he was certain he was right. He might have walked out a window if his father told him to—but not if it meant leaving a Moody’s Manual full of cheap stocks behind.

- Important accounts didn’t take Warren seriously. “I was twenty-one. And I’d go around to all these people to sell them stocks, and when I’d get all through they’d say, ‘What does your dad think?’ I got that all the time.” Warren, who looked like a “dork,” struggled to make sales.3 He didn’t know how to read people, couldn’t make small talk, and his mode of conversation was to broadcast rather than receive. When nervous, he sprayed forth information about his favorite stocks like a fire hose. Some potential clients listened to his pitch, checked with other sources, and used his ideas, but bought the stocks through other brokers, so he didn’t get the commission. He was shocked at this perfidy from people he’d spoken to face-to-face and would be seeing again around town. He felt cheated. “Generally speaking, I was not getting reinforcement. When I first started selling GEICO to people, Buffett-Falk had this little office downtown, and the stock certificates would come in and Jerome Newman’s name would be on those certificates. He was the seller I was buying from. And the guys at Buffett-Falk said, ‘What the hell. If you think you’re smarter than Jerry Newman…’ ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3073))

- In fact, Graham-Newman was forming a new partnership, and some of the investors had given the firm GEICO shares to fund money into the partnership. So in effect, it was they who were selling, not Graham-Newman. Warren didn’t know that.4 But when it came to GEICO, he didn’t care who was selling. It did not occur to him to ask anyone at the firm why they were selling. He was unshakeably certain of his own opinion. Nor did he hide that fact. “I was sort of a wise guy, with this graduate degree, among people who hadn’t gone to college. One time an insurance agent, Ralph Campbell, came in to see Mr. Falk and said, ‘What’s this kid doing going around promoting this company?’ GEICO was a company that didn’t use insurance agents. And I said, like a wise guy, ‘Mr. Campbell, you better buy this stock for unemployment insurance.’ ” The full import of Dale Carnegie’s first rule, don’t criticize, hadn’t sunk in. Warren used what would later become the trademark Buffett wit to show that he knew more than everybody else, but why would anyone have been willing to believe that of a twenty-one-year-old? And yet he did. It must have stunned people at Buffett-Falk to watch him, morning through night, ripping through the manuals, adding to his file cabinets of knowledge. “I went through the Moody’s Manuals page by page. Ten thousand pages in the Moody’s Industrial, Transportation, Banks and Finance Manuals—twice. I actually looked at every business—although I didn’t look very hard at some.” And Warren wanted to be more than an investor, more than a salesman. He wanted to be a teacher, to emulate Ben Graham. He signed up to teach a night course at the University of Omaha. ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3083))

- There was nothing he hated more than selling people investments that lost them money. He couldn’t stand disappointing people. This was what it had been like back in the sixth grade when the Cities Service Preferred stock he’d gotten Doris to invest in was clobbered. She hadn’t hesitated to “remind” him about it, and he’d felt responsible. Now he would do anything to avoid the feeling of letting someone down. Warren began looking for any way to make himself less dependent on the job he was starting to hate. He had always enjoyed owning businesses, and decided to buy a gas station with a friend from the National Guard, Jim Schaeffer. They bought a Sinclair station that was next to a Texaco station “that consistently outsold us, which drove us crazy.” Warren and his brother-in-law Truman Wood, who had married Doris, even worked at the station themselves on weekends. They washed windshields “with a smile“—despite Warren’s aversion to manual labor—and did everything they could to attract new customers, but instead drivers continued to pull in to the Texaco station across the street. Its owner “was very well established and very well liked. He beat us every month. That’s when I learned the power of ([Location 3133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3133))

- customer loyalty. The guy had been in business forever and had a clientele. Nothing we could do was going to change that. “My service station was the dumbest thing—I lost two thousand dollars, and that was a lot of money for me at the time. I’d never had real damage in a loss. It was painful.” It seemed to Warren that nearly everything he did in Omaha reinforced his sense of youth and inexperience. He was no longer a precocious boy who was acting like a man, but a young man—about to get married—who looked and sometimes acted like a boy. Kaiser-Frazer, the stock he had shorted two years before in Bob Soener’s office, still hung stubbornly around five dollars a share instead of going to zero as he had expected. Carl Falk was always giving him funny looks and questioning his judgment. And Warren felt more and more queasy about the very nature of his job. He started to think of himself as being like “a prescriptionist.” “I had to explain to people who didn’t know enough about whether they should take aspirin or Anacin,” and people would do anything the “guy in the white coat”—the stockbroker—told them to do. The stockbroker got paid based on turnover instead of advice. In other words, “he’s getting paid based on how many pills he sells. He gets paid more for some pills than others. You wouldn’t go to a doctor whose pay was totally contingent on how many pills you took.” But that’s how the business of being a stockbroker worked at the time. Warren felt there was a conflict of interest inherent in the business. He’d recommend a stock like GEICO to his friends and family, and tell them that the best thing to do was to hold it for twenty years. That meant he didn’t get any more commissions from them. “You can’t make a living that way. The system pits your interests against your clients.” Nevertheless, he had begun to develop a small clientele of his own through his network of graduate school friends. But he still felt conflicted. He had turned Buffett-Falk ([Location 3143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3143))

- Falk into a “market maker,” a firm that acted as a middleman, buying and selling stocks as a dealer.9 The firm made a profit by selling a stock to clients at a slightly higher price than it paid, and buying stock from clients at a lower price than it sold the stock for. The difference, or “spread,” was its profit. The spread was invisible to the customers. Acting as a market maker lifted a brokerage firm from being a mere order taker to being a player in the Wall Street game. While Warren was proud that he had the know-how to set Buffett-Falk up as a market maker, the conflict bothered him. “I don’t want to be on the other side of the table from the customer. I never was selling anything I didn’t believe in myself or own myself. On the other hand, there was a markup that was undisclosed. If anybody asked me about it, I told them. But I don’t like anything like that. I want to be on the same side of the table with the people who are my partners, everybody knowing what’s going on. And a promoter, by his nature, doesn’t do that.” No matter how Warren thought about his job as a stockbroker, there was always a potential conflict of interest, and always the possibility that he would lose money for his clients and open himself up to disappointing them. He would much rather manage people’s money instead of selling them stocks, with his interest on the same side as the customer’s. The problem was, there were no such opportunities in Omaha. But in the spring of 1952, he wrote an article about GEICO that attracted the attention of a powerful man, and with that, his luck seemed about to change. The article, “The Security I Like Best,” which appeared in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, was not just an advertisement for Warren’s favorite stock, but an explanation of his ideas about investing. It caught the attention of Bill Rosenwald, who was a son of Julius Rosenwald, a philanthropist and the longtime chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co. The younger Rosenwald ran American Securities, a money management firm launched with family stock in Sears10 that sought high returns while minimizing risk and preserving capital. After contacting Ben Graham, who gave Warren a strong recommendation, Rosenwald offered Warren a job. Few jobs in money management were as prestigious, and Warren was dying to accept it, even though that meant moving back to New York City. To do so,… ([Location 3158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3158))

Indeed, Warren had always craved being taken care of by women, as long as they didn’t try to order him around. Susie could see that he was eager for her to assume a motherly role. So she wrapped herself around her husband as she worked on “fixing” him, the wreck, the mess. “Oh, my God,” she said, “he was a case.”8 When they met, she recalled, “I had never seen anyone in so much pain.” Warren may not have been aware of the depths or dimensions of his pain, but describes the powerful role she played in his life. “Susie was as big an influence on me as my dad, or bigger probably, in a different way. I had all these defense mechanisms that she could explain, but I can’t. She probably saw things in me that other people couldn’t see. But she knew it would take time and a lot of nourishment to bring it out. She made me feel that I had somebody with a little sprinkling can who was going to make sure that the flowers grew.” Susie recognized Warren’s vulnerability, his need to be soothed and comforted and reassured.

It was the same kind of unconditional love you would get from a parent.” Warren wanted a lot of things from his wife that you would ordinarily get from a parent. Not only that, he had grown up with a mother who did everything for him. Now Susie took over. Although their basic model of wedded life was typical of the time—he made the money, she took care of him and covered the domestic front—their arrangement was extreme. Everything in the Buffett household revolved around Warren and his business. Susie understood her husband was special; she willingly became the cocoon for his embryonic ambitions. He spent his days working and his nights hunched over the Moody’s Manual. He also arranged his schedule to give himself leisure time to play golf and Ping-Pong, even signing up as a junior member of the Omaha Country Club.

- Well, not quite. Warren and Walter sat at desks in a windowless room that contained the ticker machine, the direct lines to the brokerage houses, some reference books and files. Ben, Mickey Newman, or, most commonly, Jerry Newman appeared periodically from their private offices to check a quote on the ticker machine. “We would look up stuff and read. We would go through Standard & Poor’s or a Moody’s Manual and look at companies selling below working capital. There were a lot then,” recalls Schloss.

- called “cigar butts”: cheap and unloved stocks that had been cast aside like the sticky, mashed stub of a stogie one might find on the sidewalk. Graham specialized in spotting these unappetizing remnants that everyone else overlooked. He coaxed them alight and sucked out one last free puff. Graham knew that a certain number of cigar butts would turn out foul, and thought it futile to spend time examining any individual cigar butt’s quality. The law of averages said most of them were good for a puff. He was always thinking in terms of how much companies would be worth dead—what their assets would be worth if liquidated. Buying at a discount to that value was his “margin of safety”—his backstop against the percentage that presumably would go bankrupt. As a further backstop, he bought tiny positions in a huge number of stocks—the principle of diversification. Graham’s idea of diversification was extreme; some of his positions were as small as $1,000. Warren, who had such confidence in his own judgment, saw no reason to hedge his bets this way and inwardly rolled his eyes at diversification. He and Walter collected numbers from the Moody’s Manuals and filled out hundreds of the simple forms that Graham-Newman used to make decisions. Once Warren had looked over the field, he narrowed it down to a handful of stocks worth even more careful study, then concentrated his money on what he considered the best bets. He was willing to put most of his eggs in one basket, as he had done with GEICO. By that time, however, he had sold his GEICO shares, because he never seemed to have enough money to invest. Every decision had an opportunity cost—he had to compare each investing opportunity with the next best one. As much as he liked GEICO, he had made the wrenching decision to sell it after finding another stock that he coveted even more, called Western Insurance. This company was earning $29 a share, and its stock was selling for as little as three bucks. This was like finding a slot machine that would come up cherries every time you played. If you put in twenty-five cents and pulled the handle, the Western Insurance machine was virtually guaranteed to pay at least two bucks.16 Anyone sane would play that slot as ([Location 3387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3387))

If asked to give up some of his money, Warren responded like a dog fiercely guarding its bone, or even as though he had been attacked. His struggle to let go of the smallest amounts of money was so apparent that it was as if the money possessed him, rather than the other way around. Susie had learned this only too well. Even within their apartment building, Warren had quickly earned a reputation for tightfistedness and eccentricity.

- At work he had become absorbed in a complicated new project that would become a seminal event in his career. Shortly after Warren joined Graham-Newman, the price of cocoa suddenly spiked from a nickel to more than fifty cents a pound. Over in Brooklyn, Rockwood & Co., a chocolate maker “of limited profitability,”1 faced a dilemma. Its number one product was Rockwood chocolate bits, the kind of nuggets used in chocolate chip cookies, and the company couldn’t raise its prices much on this grocery item, so it began running a huge ([Location 3479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3479))

- loss. However, with cocoa-bean prices so high, Rockwood also had a chance to unload the cocoa beans it already owned to reap a windfall profit. Unfortunately, the ensuing tax bill would eat up more than half those profits.2 Rockwood’s owners approached Graham-Newman as a possible buyer of the company, but Graham-Newman wouldn’t pay the asking price. So they turned instead to the investor Jay Pritzker, who had spotted a way to avoid the huge tax bill.3 What he realized was that the 1954 U.S. Tax Code said that if a company was reducing the scope of its business, it could pay no tax on such a “partial liquidation” of its inventory.

- The “futures” market lets buyers and sellers agree to exchange commodities like cocoa or gold or bananas in the future at a price agreed upon today. In exchange for a small fee, Graham-Newman could arrange to sell its cocoa beans at a known price for a specified period of time, thus eliminating the risk that the market price would drop. The person on the other side of the trade—who was acquiring the risk that the price would drop—was speculating.7 If cocoa beans got cheaper, Graham-Newman was protected, because the speculator would have to buy Graham-Newman’s cocoa beans for more than they were worth.8 The speculator’s role, from Graham-Newman’s perspective, was to sell what amounted to insurance against the risk of the price dropping. At the time, of course, neither knew which way cocoa prices would move. Thus, the goal of the arbitrage was to buy as many Rockwood shares as possible while at the same time selling an equivalent amount of futures. Graham-Newman assigned Warren to the Rockwood deal.

But Rockwood stock, which had traded for $15 before Pritzker’s offer, shot up to $85 after it was over. So instead of making $444 from his 222 shares, as he would have from the arbitrage, Warren’s calculated bet earned him an extraordinary sum—around $13,000.11 In the process, he had also made a point of getting to know Jay Pritzker.

- out that deal “was going to do more smart things later.” He went to a shareholders’ meeting and asked some questions, and that was his introduction to Pritzker.12 Warren was then twenty-five, Pritzker thirty-two. Even working with a relatively small amount of capital—less than $100,000—Warren saw that by using this kind of thinking he could open up a world of possibilities for himself. His only constraints were the money, energy, and time he had available. It was lumberjack labor, but he loved doing it. This was nothing like the way most people invested: sitting in an office and reading reports that described research performed by other people. Warren was a detective, and he naturally did his own research, just as he had collected bottle caps and thought about fingerprinting nuns. To do his detective work he used the Moody’s Manuals—Industrial, Banks and Finance, and Public Utility. Often he went down in person to Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. “I was the only one who ever showed up at those places. They never even asked if I was a customer. I would get these files that dated back forty or fifty years. They didn’t have copy machines, so I’d sit there and scribble all these little notes, this figure and that figure. They had a library, but you couldn’t select from it yourself. You had to request things. So I would name all these companies—Jersey Mortgage, Bankers Commercial, all these things that nobody’d ever requested, ever. They’d bring them out, and I’d sit there taking notes. If you wanted to look at SEC documents, as I often did, I went down to the SEC. That was the only way to get them. Then, if the company was nearby, I might very well go see the management. I didn’t make appointments ahead of time. But I got a lot done.” ([Location 3541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3541))

- Warren was the seventh. He put in only $100. The rest of his share would come from future fees he earned by managing the partnership. “In effect, I got my leverage from managing the partnership. I was brimming with ideas, but I was not brimming with capital.” Actually, by most of the country’s standards, Warren was brimming with capital. But he viewed the partnership as a compounding machine—once money went into it, he did not intend to make withdrawals. So he needed to earn the $12,000 a year his family would live on from the rest of his funds. He invested that money separately. He devised a formula to charge his new ([Location 3668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=3668))

- Acting as a “fiduciary” meant to Warren that any responsibility he took on would be unlimited. To lay out the ground rules for his partners, he called the first official meeting of Buffett Associates on the very day he founded the partnership. Chuck got them a reservation for dinner at the Omaha Club, the best place in town if you wanted a private room.

He told Chuck to pass the word that everyone was going dutch.6 He then used the dinner as an opportunity to talk not just about the partnership’s ground rules, but about the stock market. Already he viewed the partnership as a teaching exercise. The partners quickly split into two camps: the teetotalers and the rest. From his end of the table, Doc Thompson suggested, in a paternal way, that the other faction was going to hell. It was Warren, however, who was the preacher that night; they were there for him to hold forth. “I started with an agreement with the investors, which has not needed to be changed much as we’ve evolved.

- Despite his brilliance, Warren was still very immature. For Susie, his helplessness at home meant that he was like having a third child to care for. His personality and interests also shaped their social life. In Omaha, a midsize Midwestern city with relatively few important cultural institutions, weekends were filled with weddings, parties, teas, and charity events. The Buffetts lived a much quieter life than most young married couples of their class and era. Most of their social life took place at dinner with other couples or at occasional dinner parties where Warren could talk about stocks. It was always the same: Warren entertained, either holding forth to an audience on stocks or playing the ukulele. Under Susie’s tutelage, he could now exchange remarks about other subjects more easily than before, but his mind remained fixated on making money. During meals and parties at home, he often fled small talk by leaving the table to go upstairs. But unlike Ben Graham, he was not upstairs reading Proust; he was working.

In segregated Omaha, choosing to cross these social lines was a bold, even defiant act. Susie was aware of this, just as she had been aware in high school and college that dating a Jew was considered shocking, especially to her own family. Her social status had value to her mostly as a way to make her friends feel more included.

- He would later come to think of his memory as functioning like a bathtub. The tub filled with ideas and experiences and matters that interested him. When he had no more use for information, whoosh—the plug popped up, and the memory drained away. If new information about a subject appeared, it would replace the old version. If he didn’t want to think about something at all, down the drain it went. Certain events, facts, memories, and even people appeared to vanish. Painful memories were the first to be flushed. The bathtub memory’s efficiency freed up enormous amounts of space for the new and the productive. Buffett thought of the bathtub memory as a helper that allowed him to “look forward,” rather than “looking backward” all the time like his mother. And it allowed him, at the age of twenty-six, to ruminate in depth on business to the exclusion of almost everything else—in pursuit of his goal of becoming a millionaire.

It had repercussions. When Warren had reapplied for full membership in the Omaha Country Club, he was blackballed.

- would later say.14 So even as he cared for his dying son, Munger decided to marry again. His analysis of the odds of a successful match made him pessimistic, however. “Charlie was despairing over whether he would ever meet anyone else. ‘How can I find somebody? Out of twenty million people in California, half are women. Of these ten million, only two million are of an appropriate age. From that group, a million and a half would be married, leaving five hundred thousand. Three hundred thousand of them are too dumb, fifty thousand are too smart, and of the remaining hundred fifty thousand, the number I would want to marry would fit on a basketball court. I’ve got to find one of those. And then I’ve got to be on her basketball court.’ ” Munger’s mental habit of setting low expectations was well established. He equated this with the route to happiness, since he felt that high expectations led to fault-finding. Low expectations made it harder to be disappointed. Paradoxically, however, they could also confound success. Out of desperation, Munger started reviewing divorce and death notices to find newly single women.

Nancy Barry Borthwick, a petite brunette, played tennis avidly, skied, and golfed. She was also a Phi Beta Kappa economics graduate of Stanford. On their first date he warned her, “I’m didactic.” The thought of a man infected by the urge to preach failed to put Nancy off, which augured well for their relationship. They started taking their children on outings. At first Teddy went along with them, but he soon became too ill. Later, thirty-one-year-old Charlie spent much of his son’s final weeks sitting by Teddy’s bedside. By the time Teddy died in 1955 at age nine, Charlie had lost between ten and fifteen pounds. “I can’t imagine any experience in life worse than losing a child inch by inch,” he said later.15 Charlie married Nancy Borthwick in January 1956. She quickly became his ballast. Nancy had moxie, pricking Charlie’s balloon without hesitation when it inflated with too much hot air. She was an excellent manager, observant, calm, reasonable, and practical. Nancy curbed his caprices when Charlie took off on occasional bolts of impulsiveness. In time, they added three sons and a daughter to his two girls and her two boys. She set about raising eight children while keeping house and taking care of Charlie.16 He became known to his children as a “book with legs,” constantly studying science and the achievements of great men. Meanwhile, he continued seeking his fortune at the law firm of Musick, Peeler & Garrett, but realized that the law would not make him rich. He began to develop some profitable sidelines. “Charlie, as a very young lawyer, was probably getting $20 an hour. He thought to himself, ‘Who’s my most valuable client?’ And he decided it was himself. So he decided to sell himself an hour each day. He did it early in the morning, working on these construction projects and real estate deals. Everybody should do this, be the client, and then work for other people, too, and sell yourself an hour a day.” “I had a considerable passion to get rich,” Munger said. “Not because I wanted… ([Location 4115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4115))

- He told Charlie the story of National American insurance. Munger had gone to Central High with Howard and Hayden Ahmanson. He was amazed that someone like Buffett, who was not from California, could know so much about the Ahmansons and their savings and loan. Before long, the two men were talking simultaneously, yet they seemed to understand each other perfectly.20 After a while, Charlie asked, “Warren, what do you do specifically?” Well, I’ve got these partnerships, Buffett explained, and I do this, and this, and that. In 1957, he said, his partnerships had earned over ten percent in a year when the market had declined over eight percent. The next year the partnerships’ investments had risen more than forty percent in value.21 Buffett’s fees so far from managing the partnerships, reinvested, came to $83,085. These fees had mushroomed his initial contribution of only $700—$100 contributed to each of the seven partnerships22—into a stake ([Location 4145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4145))

- worth 9.5 percent of the combined value of all the partnerships. Moreover, his performance was well on its way to beating the Dow again in 1959, which would make him richer still and raise his stake again. Meanwhile, his investors were thrilled; new partners kept joining. Charlie listened. Eventually he asked, “Do you think that I could do something like that out in California?” Warren paused for a moment and looked at him. This was an unconventional question coming from a successful Los Angeles lawyer. “Yeah,” he said, “I’m quite sure you could do it.”23 As the luncheon wound its way to an end, the Seemans and the Davises decided it was time to go. When they got on the elevator, their last sight was of Buffett and Munger, still sitting at the table, engrossed.24 A few nights later, the two men took their wives to Johnny’s Café, a red-velvet steak joint, where Munger became so self-intoxicated at one of his own jokes that he slipped out of the booth and began rolling on the floor with laughter. When the Mungers returned to Los Angeles, the conversation continued in installments, the two men talking on the phone for an hour or two with increasing ([Location 4154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4154))

- to execute—even more so than buying up the shares of National American insurance. These projects would sometimes evolve into complicated, even dramatic episodes that would absorb his attention for months, or occasionally years, at a stretch. Sometimes several of these investing projects operated simultaneously. Already preoccupied to the point that he was barely present to his family much of the time, this expansion of scale would exacerbate that tendency, while binding him more tightly to his friends. The first of these complicated episodes involved a company called Sanborn Map. It published minutely detailed maps of power lines, water mains, building engineering, and emergency stairwells for all the cities of the United States, maps that were mainly bought by insurance companies.2 Its customer base was slowly shrinking as insurers merged. But its stock was cheap at $45 per share, since Sanborn’s investment portfolio alone was worth $65 per share. To get hold of that investment portfolio, however, Warren needed not just money from his partnerships but also help from other people.

He passed the Sanborn idea along to Cowin, to Stanback, to Knapp, and to Schloss. Some people got in on it as a favor from him. He took an override—a percentage of the profits—from others as a way of leveraging his capital. Eventually he controlled enough of Sanborn’s shares to be elected to the board. In March 1959, Warren took one of his regular trips to New York, staying out on Long Island at Anne Gottschaldt’s little white colonial house. By now she and her sister had adopted him as a sort of surrogate son, as if to replace the long-dead Fred. Warren kept spare sets of underwear and pajamas at her house, and Gottschaldt made him hamburgers for breakfast.

He had sit-downs with prospects for the partnership and another important appointment: his first meeting as a board member at Sanborn Map. Sanborn’s board consisted almost entirely of insurance-company representatives—its biggest customers—so it operated more like a club than a business. None of the board members owned more than token amounts of stock.3 At the meeting, Warren proposed that the company distribute the investments to the shareholders. But since the Depression and World War II, American businesses treated money as a scarce commodity to be hoarded and husbanded. This way of thinking had become automatic even though the economic justification for it had long disappeared. The board responded to the idea of separating the investment portfolio from the map business as preposterous.

Warren was probably doing his father a financial favor, even as he tightened his grip on the company.

- Thus, through force of energy, organization, and will, early in 1960 Warren won the fight. Sanborn made a Rockwood-type offer to shareholders, exchanging a portion of the investment portfolio for stock.6 The Sanborn deal set a new high-water mark: Buffett could use his brains and his partnerships’ money to alter the course of even a stubborn and unwilling company. During this episode, as Buffett traveled back and forth to New York and worked on the Sanborn project, figuring out where to get the stock he needed for control and how to make the board fall in line, all the while looking for other investment ideas, his mind whirled with the thousands of numbers that clicked and spun inside his head.

Another, Eunice Denenberg, was only a child when her father committed suicide. The Buffetts also had black friends, including the most intimidating pitcher in baseball, Bob Gibson, and his wife, Charlene. Being a star athlete meant little in 1960 if you were black. “Those were the days when white people wouldn’t be seen with black people in Omaha,” says Buffett’s childhood friend Byron Swanson.14 Susie reached out to everyone; in fact, the more troubled the person, the more willingly she helped. She took a deep interest in the personal lives of people she barely knew. Almost everyone she met glowed under her attention and felt touched by the encounter. But even with her closest friends, Susie nearly always took care not to share her own problems. She played the same role of ministering angel with her own family, above all with her sister. Dottie remained the beauty of the family, but seemed vacant and, as one person put it, “valiantly unhappy.” She maintained a pleasant surface but told Susie that she never cried because if she ever started, she would never stop.

Still, the Rogerses kept up their vigorous social schedule, and at night, amid the drinks and merriment, their two young sons, Billy and Tommy, roamed underfoot.

- Party, but anyone associated with the Birchers attracted both alarm and ridicule. After he went to the local press to defend his Birch membership, people increasingly wrote him off as an eccentric. That Omaha snickered at his revered father was painful to Warren. But anxiety about Howard had even more to do with eighteen months of mysterious symptoms that doctors could not seem to diagnose despite a trip to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.16 Finally, in May of 1958, Howard had been told he had colon cancer that required immediate surgery.17 Warren had been upset by the diagnosis and angered by what he considered its inexcusable tardiness. Since then, Susie had shielded him from the details of his father’s illness.18 She gave him head rubs and kept up the household schedule. She also devoted herself to propping up Leila during Howard’s surgery and long recuperation. She did all of this cheerfully; she seemed to… ([Location 4266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4266))

When Howie asked him why, he said, “They’re the underdogs now.”19 Throughout his father’s ordeal, Warren used business as a distraction. He kept his head buried in American Banker or the Oil & Gas Journal. And he began to radiate a presence in public, no matter what was going on at home. He displayed an authority, an almost electric charge of energy, that radiated to an audience. “He just used to ooze that stuff wherever he went,” says Chuck Peterson.20 The man who had so impressed Charlie Munger talked constantly and convincingly about investing and the partnerships; he raised money as fast as he could talk—but not as fast as he could invest. Munger listened to Buffett’s investing and money-raising… ([Location 4276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4276))

- into the partnerships’ coffers, making 1960 a watershed year. Buffett made a presentation to a group of doctors headed by Carol and Bill Angle, Peterson’s neighbors from across the street, and wound up managing the Emdee partnership of $110,000 for eleven of the doctors. A twelfth doctor, who worried about losing all his money, did not join. There were other skeptics. Not everyone in Omaha liked what they heard about Warren Buffett. His secretiveness put people off. Some thought the young hotshot wouldn’t amount to anything, and believed the authority he radiated was unearned arrogance. One member of a prominent Omaha family was lunching with half a dozen people at the Blackstone Hotel when Buffett’s name came up. “He’ll be broke in a year,” the man said. “Just give him a year and he’s gone.”21 A partner at Kirkpatrick Pettis, which Howard’s firm had merged with in 1957, said time after time, “… ([Location 4286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4286))

The market shot up, and once again comparisons were made to 1929. Warren had never ridden out a speculative market, yet he remained unruffled. It was as if he had been waiting for this moment. Instead of pulling back, as Graham might have done, he did something remarkable. He went into overdrive raising money for the partnerships. He put Bertie and her husband, his uncle George from Albuquerque, and his cousin Bill into Buffett Associates, the original partnership. Wayne Eves, his friend John Cleary’s partner, got on board too. And he finally put Fred Kulhken’s mother and aunt, Anne Gottschaldt and Catherine Elberfeld, into the partnership.

Legally, he could take on only a hundred partners without having to register with the SEC as an investment adviser. As the partnerships burgeoned, he started encouraging people to team up informally and come in as a single partner. Eventually he would put people into pools, combining their money himself.23 He later described the tactic as questionable—but it worked. His compulsion to get more money, to make more money, drove him on. Warren was on fire, shuttling back and forth to New York at a frantic pace. He began to suffer from stress-related back pain. It often worsened when he was on an airplane, and he tried all sorts of things to alleviate it—everything but staying home. By now his name was passed along like a secret.

Instead of asking a favor, he was granting one; people felt indebted to him for taking their money. Making people ask put him psychologically in charge. He would come to use this technique often, in many contexts, for the rest of his life. Along with getting him what he wanted, it seemed to soothe his persisting fears of being responsible for other people’s fates. Though his insecurity was rampant as ever, his success and Susie’s care and tutoring had given him a bit of polish and flair. He was starting to appear powerful, not vulnerable. Plenty of people were happy to ask him to invest for them. Buffett formed the eleventh and last of his partnerships, Buffett-Holland, on May 16, 1961, for his friends Dick and Mary Holland.

The bookkeeping and banking and safe-depositing and post-officing required for his complicated empire, which had grown to almost four million dollars, eleven partnerships, and well over a hundred investors, now became almost overwhelming. Amazingly, Warren was still handling all the money and doing all the clerical work himself: filing the tax returns, typing the letters, depositing the dividend and capital checks, stopping for a meal at the Spare Time Café along the way, stuffing the stock certificates in the safe-deposit box. On January 1, 1962, Buffett dissolved all of the partnerships into a single entity, Buffett Partnership, Ltd.—or BPL. The partnerships had produced a stellar forty-six percent return in 1961, compared with the Dow’s twenty-two percent. After the partners invested more money that January 1, the new Buffett Partnership, Ltd., started the year with net assets of $7.2 million. In just six years, his partnerships had grown bigger than Graham-Newman.

- And for the first time, Warren put his own money—all of it, almost $450,000—into the partnership.31 With that, his and Susie’s share of the partnership rose to more than a million dollars after his six years of work; together they owned fourteen percent of BPL. The timing was stupendous. In mid-March 1962, the market finally broke. It continued its slide until the end of June. Stocks were suddenly cheaper than they had been in many years. Buffett was now sitting on a single partnership with a huge pile of cash to invest. Its portfolio was relatively unscathed in the downturn—“Compared to more conventional (often termed conservative, which is not synonymous) methods of common stock investing, it would appear that our method involved considerably less ([Location 4363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4363))

- Warren may have said he wanted to become a millionaire, but he never said that he would stop there. Later he would describe himself during this period as “a lousy sport at doing anything I didn’t want to do.” What he wanted to do was invest. His children now ranged from five to ten years old, and one friend described Susie as “sort of a single mother.” Warren would show up at school events or toss around a football if asked, but he never initiated a game. Susie taught the children that his special mission must be respected; she told them, “He can only be so much, so don’t expect any more from him.” ([Location 4460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4460))

- Susie’s role as problem-solver and emotional carpet-sweeper meant that people thought of calling her whenever there was trouble, of any kind. She had referred to Warren as her “first patient,”4 and there were others. She stepped in more often now to manage Dottie’s life as her sister’s ability to cope declined and her drinking increased. She counseled Doris through her divorce from Truman and gave her a copy of a book, Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning, that Doris turned to again and again looking for hope amid misery.5 Outside of Warren’s study, the Buffetts’ home was never a refuge from the world, and opportunities for solitude were rare. Yet the children were growing up with a balance of freedom and discipline, strong ethical principles instilled by both parents, an excellent education, and an emphasis on enriching experiences. Warren and Susie had many long conversations about how to bring up children in a rich family so that they became self-sufficient rather than feeling entitled. What the children lacked was attention from their parents. They responded to this upbringing in their different ways. The older Little Susie got, the fewer overtures she made for her mother’s attention and the more authority she assumed over her brothers. Howie, the tornado, tunneled through the backyard, leaped off the banisters, hung from the curtains, and tore through the house. He dumped a bucket of water from the roof onto Phyllis the babysitter. Everybody knew not to drink a glass of anything he handed them. But he was also easily wounded. Tenderhearted like his mother, he craved more attention than she could supply. When Susie reached her limit, she sometimes locked Howie in his room.6 Peter, who was naturally quiet, felt rewarded for staying in the background as his siblings ruled through squabbles, with bossy Little Susie striving to contain Howie’s whirlwind.7 When the energy around Peter grew too intense, he retreated inside his head. Rather than express his feelings in words, he played “Yankee Doodle” on the piano in a minor key whenever he was unhappy.8 ([Location 4487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4487))

- Another would-be partner, Laurence Tisch, one of two brothers who were building a New York hotel empire, sent in a check for $30,000 made out to Charlie Munger. Buffett called him and said he was glad to have Tisch join the partnership, but next time, “make the check out to me.” Munger could have used the money. Whatever Laurence Tisch may have thought, in 1963 he and Buffett were not partners. Munger had just opened a partnership of his own after waiting until he had accumulated a fair amount of money—around $300,000—by investing in real estate. But this was peanuts by Buffett’s standards, a fraction of Warren and Susie’s wealth. “Charlie had a lot of children early on. That hindered him a lot in getting independent.

- with no encumbrances is a big advantage.” Ever since they first met, Buffett would say to Munger, It’s nice to be a lawyer and to do real estate on the side, but if you want to make some real money, you ought to start something like my partnerships.10 In 1962, Munger had gone into partnership with his poker buddy Jack Wheeler, a trader on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange who owned an investing partnership, Wheeler, Cruttenden & Company, which included two “specialist posts” on the exchange, where traders took orders from brokers to trade stocks on the floor. They renamed the business Wheeler, Munger & Co., and sold the trading operation. Munger had continued his law practice but bolted from his old firm together with several other lawyers, among them Roy Tolles and Rod Hills. They founded a new firm, Munger, Tolles, Hills & Wood.11 All along, Munger had naturally resisted following the rules of a law firm run by anyone but himself. At their new firm, Munger and Hills imposed an elitist, Darwinian ethos designed to attract the brightest and most ambitious.

- forty-one, Munger abandoned the law altogether to work full-time at investing. But he still consulted to the firm and kept an office there, where he remained an important, almost spiritual presence. Tolles, too, shifted most of his attention to investing. In his new role as a money manager, Munger had to raise money to manage. Buffett had always hustled for investors in an understated way, often using others as his promoters—people like Bill Angle and Henry Brandt, who found and prepared prospects—so that he could show off his impressive track record with a pleasing modesty. But however gracefully he’d hustled, he’d still done it. Munger felt this was demeaning. He managed to parlay his law practice into an investing partnership, albeit one smaller than Buffett’s, by raising funds from his powerful Los Angeles business connections. Jack Wheeler had explained to him that, as a member of the exchange… ([Location 4531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4531))

- likewise nearly doubled his risk. If he lost twenty-five percent, he would lose nearly half his capital. But Munger, more than Buffett—far more than Buffett—was willing to take on some debt if he was positive the odds were right. He and Wheeler set themselves up at the exchange in a “crude, cheap” office festooned with radiator pipes and stuck their secretary, Vivian, in the tiny private back office overlooking an alley.14 Wheeler, a big spender who liked to live large, had just had a hip replacement and soon started showing up for work on the golf course most mornings.15 Munger fell into a routine, arriving at five a.m., before the market opened on the East Coast, and checking the quotation board.16 Buffett had connected him with Ed Anderson, the Graham-Newman investor who had worked for the Atomic Energy Commission and seemed so smart; Munger hired him as his assistant. Most of the traders at the stock exchange had ignored Munger’s arrival on the scene, but one of them, J. Patrick Guerin, took note. Guerin had bought the trading part of Wheeler’s partnership. A rough-and-tumble guy who was scrambling like mad to better himself, Guerin had worked as a salesman for IBM, then became a stockbroker at a couple of small firms that peddled third-class stocks. This was a part of stockbroking Buffett had detested; Guerin, too, found it a relief to escape life as a “prescriptionist.” By the time Munger met him, the lean, handsome Guerin had learned to roll his crisp shirt cuff down over his tanned forearm to cover his tattoo. He did the trading for Wheeler, Munger, and says he immediately recognized that Munger had a money mind and began to emulate Munger and Buffett, with the goal of forming his own investing partnership.17 Munger bought cigar butts, did arbitrage, even acquired small businesses—much of this in Buffett’s style—but he seemed… ([Location 4540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4540))

- could compete with it. Munger had a Caterpillar tractor dealership as a client. To grow, the business had to buy more tractors, gobbling up more money. Munger wanted to own a business that did not require continual investment, and spat out more cash than it consumed. But what were the qualities of such a business? And what gave such a business an enduring competitive advantage? Munger was always asking people, “What’s the best business you’ve ever heard of?” But he was a man of no great patience, and inclined to think that people could read his mind.18 His impatience stood out more than any theory that was emerging inside his head. He wanted to get really rich, really fast. He and Roy Tolles made bets on whose portfolio would be up more than one hundred percent in a year. And he was willing to borrow money to make money, whereas Buffett had never borrowed a significant sum in his life.… ([Location 4560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4560))

- around $19 and being taken over by the Canadian government at a little more than $22. Munger put not just his whole partnership, but all the money he had, and all that he could borrow into an arbitrage on this single stock20—but only because there was almost no chance that this deal would fall apart. When the transaction went through, the deal paid off handsomely. Yet despite their different approaches, Munger regarded Buffett as the king of investing, and saw himself as merely a friendly pretender to the throne.21 “Vivian, get me Warren!” he shouted several times a day to whichever secretary had come to occupy Vivian’s desk.22 He cultivated Buffett like a garden he was tending. Buffett explained his philosophy: “You’ve got to coattail,” he said.23 But he did not want his friends to coattail him and considered it unethical when they did. Hence, while Munger, cultivating Buffett, was open about his trades—he got Buffett into his British Columbia Power deal, for example—Buffett always kept his trades to himself unless he was working an idea with a partner. By the early 1960s, the Buffetts had begun to vacation in California, so that Warren could spend more time with Graham and Munger. Once Warren and Susie took the kids on a long trip up and down the coast, but usually when they came to visit, they’d settle into a motel on Santa Monica Boulevard, and he and Munger would talk stocks for hours. The differences in their philosophies made for long conversations. Buffett would forgo the chance of profits any day to avoid too much risk, and viewed preserving his capital as an almost holy imperative. Munger had the attitude that if you weren’t already rich, you could afford to take some risk—if the odds were right—to get rich.

- Graham’s flaw, Munger felt, was that he considered the future “more fraught with hazard than ripe with opportunity.”25 Munger began trying to wean Buffett away from Graham’s dreary pessimism, which underlay the drudgery of stooping for cigar butts and sucking out their last puff. Buffett had a buoyant optimism about the long-term economic future of American business, which had enabled him to invest in the market against his father’s and Graham’s advice. Yet his investing style still reflected Graham’s doom-laden habits of looking at businesses based on what they were worth dead, not alive. Munger wanted Buffett to define the margin of safety in other than purely statistical terms. In doing so, Munger was working against a subtle tendency toward catastrophism in Buffett’s outlook that sometimes cropped up when solving theoretical problems. His father, Howard, had always prepared for the day the… ([Location 4589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4589))

- wrong, it eventually will. This style of thinking was the proverbial double-edged sword: It made Buffett a gifted visionary whose thoughts oriented toward doomsday. He would come to use this sword often to slice through knotty problems, sometimes in a very public way. A few years earlier, another friend of Buffett’s, Herb Wolf of New York Hanseatic, an over-the-counter trading house, had helped Buffett tame another personality trait that was hindering his financial quest. Wolf, an investor in the water utility American Water Works, had sought Buffett out in the early 1950s after reading an article that Warren had written on IDS Corporation in the Commercial & Financial Chronicle.26 “Herb Wolf could tell the effect on American Water Works’ earnings if somebody took a bath in Hackensack, New Jersey. One day Herb said to me, ‘Warren, if you’re looking for a gold needle in a haystack of gold, it’s not better to find the gold needle.’ I had this thing that the more obscure something was, the better I liked it. I thought it was a treasure hunt. Herb got me out of that way of thinking.” By 1962, Buffett had shaken off the treasure-hunt way of thinking. But he still had Wolf’s passion for detail, and his operations had expanded so much that he now needed another employee to assist him. He managed to keep this one off his own payroll; Buffett would forever go to extremes to control his overhead by paying for expenses in ways that could be shut off as needed, or, better yet—as in this case—could be covered in ways that made them effectively free. Henry Brandt, Buffett’s stockbroker friend who worked at Wood, Struthers & Winthrop, had been doing part-time research for the BPL partnership. Buffett had been paying Wood, Struthers for Brandt’s time through the brokerage commissions he paid for trading stocks through it. He would be paying commissions to somebody anyway, so Brandt effectively worked for him for free.27 Now Brandt worked for Buffett almost one hundred percent of the time. Buffett paid Brandt by waiving his partnership fee and beginning to cut him in on outside deals without an override. The two men shared an interest in knowing the minutest details about a company. Brandt was fearless about asking questions. Unlike Buffett, he never thought twice about making himself obnoxious if this was what it took. He gladly did enormous amounts of meticulous… ([Location 4598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4598))

- the loans guaranteed by warehouse receipts were secured by a smaller and smaller amount of soybean oil. Eventually, it occurred to De Angelis that, in fact, very little oil was needed. Indeed, just enough to fool the inspectors would do the trick. So the tanks were filled with seawater, and oil was placed inside a little tube that the inspectors used to guide their measuring sticks. They did not notice the difference or think to test a sample from outside the tube.31 In September 1963, De Angelis saw a chance to make a further killing. The Soviet sunflower crop had failed, and rumors spread that the Russians would have to turn to soybeans for oil. De Angelis decided to corner the soybean market, forcing the Communists to buy from him at an inflated price. He began to trade in the futures market.

- it appeared that the U.S. government might not let the Soviet deal go through. The price of soybean oil collapsed. De Angelis’s lenders, holding the now-worthless warehouse receipts, hired investigators and turned to American Express, issuer of the receipts, to recoup their $150 to $175 million in losses. And American Express—caught holding tanks full of nothing but worthless seawater—saw its stock plummet. The story began to hit the newspapers. Two days later, on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a Dallas motorcade. Buffett was downstairs eating lunch in the Kiewit Plaza cafeteria when somebody came in with the news that Kennedy had been shot. He went back upstairs to his office and found that stocks were plunging on heavy trading. Then the exchange closed, its first emergency closing during trading since the Great Depression.33 As a stunned country erupted in sorrow, anger, and shame, Buffett went home to sit, along with the rest of the country, and watch the nonstop television coverage throughout the weekend. He characteristically displayed no powerful surge of emotion, rather a detached gravity. For the first time, shock and sorrow united the world through the medium of television. For a brief while America stopped thinking about anything but the assassination. The newspapers, of course, relegated the American Express scandal to their back inside pages for days as the dramatic headlines took precedence.34 But Buffett went looking for it. The stock never recovered from the blow it took on Friday when the market closed, and afterward it continued to slide downhill. Investors were fleeing from the stock of one of America’s most prestigious financial institutions.35 It wasn’t clear whether American Express would survive.

Brandt scouted Travelers Cheque users, bank tellers, restaurants, and credit-card holders to gauge how American Express was doing versus its competitors.37 Back came the usual foot-high stack of material. Buffett’s verdict after sorting through it was that customers were still happy to be associated with the name American Express. The tarnish on Wall Street had not spread to Main Street.38 During the months that Buffett was investigating American Express, his father’s health declined precipitously. Despite having undergone several surgeries, Howard’s cancer had spread throughout his body. In early 1964, Warren took charge as the de facto leader of the family. While time remained, he had Howard remove him from his will to increase the share left to Doris and Bertie in a trust.

Howard’s previous will had specified an ordinary wood casket and an economical funeral, and the family convinced him to delete that part.39 One of the most difficult things Warren felt he had to do was to level with his father that he was no longer a Republican at heart.40 The reason, he said, was civil rights.41 Amazingly, however, he could not bring himself to change his voter registration as long as Howard was alive.42 “I wouldn’t throw that in his face. In fact if he had lived, it would have really constrained my life. I would not have come out against my father politically in public.

- As Howard worsened, Warren poured his attention into American Express. He had the largest cache of money with which to work that the partnership had ever seen: BPL’s capital at the beginning of 1964 stood at just under $17.5 million. His own money had exploded: He was now worth $1.8 million. During Howard’s last weeks, Warren began to invest in American Express, working tirelessly and methodically to get as many shares as he could without running up the price. Only five years before, he had had to scrape and scrounge to find a few tens of thousands for National American. Never had he put to work anything approaching this much money, and so fast, in his life. Through most of Howard’s final few days, Susie was alone with him, often for hours at a time. She both feared and understood pain, but she was unafraid of death and had the strength to sit with Howard even when those around her… ([Location 4684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=4684))

No matter how controversial Howard Buffett’s views were during his life, people came out to show respect for him in the end.

This joke was not particularly apt, since none of their children had ever actually been partners—or would be. He was determined to manage their expectations about money, in order to ensure that they would find their own way in life. From an early age, each of the kids knew not to expect financial help from him except to pay for their education. He could have brought the children into the partnership as a learning exercise—to teach them about money, about investing, and about how he spent his time. Certainly he used it that way with those who were members of the partnership. But Warren rarely—if ever—“taught” those he saw day to day. For him, teaching was a performance, a conscious act that took place before an audience. His kids got no lessons.

- Whatever message he and Susie were trying to give the children about money, one unvarying theme came through: Money was important. They were growing up in a household where it was routinely used as a tool of control. Warren would take Big Susie to a store for her birthday and give her ninety minutes to race through and buy whatever she could grab. The Buffett side of the family had always been about making deals. Although Susie felt that Warren’s obsession with making money was unworthy, she still angled to get more of it from him. Now she was struggling with her weight and this too became a money deal. Warren’s childhood obsession with weighing machines—he would have weighed himself fifty times a day—had been no passing phase; he was obsessed with his family’s weight and preoccupied with keeping them all thin. The family’s eating habits helped neither his cause nor their health. Susie, who had suffered from a mysterious and excruciating abdominal adhesion two years before, cooked unenthusiastically.

Berkshire Hathaway was now “on life support.” Buffett had recently hired his Peat, Marwick auditor, Verne McKenzie, and sent him off to New Bedford to oversee the wretched textile mill. He had been regretting a mistake he had made at a recent Berkshire Hathaway board meeting. Feeling flush during what would turn out to be a brief moment of financial success, Buffett had let himself get talked into a ten-cent-per-share dividend.

A total of 32,000 shares were turned in.

He checked out armloads of books from the library and came to understand Ringwalt’s strategy, which was to insure the most difficult customers. Ringwalt, Buffett saw, was the mix-up player of insurance—the cautious risk-taker and the penny-pinching, aggressive underwriter who went around the office every night and turned off all the lights.13 ([Location 5346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=5346))

His daughter referred to him by the racy-sounding nickname Jet Jack. He managed National Indemnity’s investments himself, buying tiny positions in hundreds of stocks, scribbled almost illegibly on ledger sheets: fifty shares of National Distillers, 2,500 of Shaver Food Marts.

Buffett himself started buying the blandest, most popular stocks that remained reasonably priced: AT&T, BF Goodrich, Jones & Laughlin Steel.

With the stock in a slump, Rick Guerin, who had founded his own partnership, Pacific Partners, noticed Blue Chip and took it to Munger. Buffett had noticed it too. “Blue Chip did not have an immaculate conception,” Charlie Munger concedes, but they all decided to make a calculated bet that Blue Chip could work its way out of its woes.

All kinds of businesses had float. Deposits in banks also created float. Customers often thought of banks as doing them a kind of favor by holding their cash in a safe place. But the banks invested the deposits in loans at the highest interest they could charge. That was “float.” To someone like Buffett, having other people’s money to invest, on which he kept the profit, was catnip.

If someone offered them trading stamps, they thought, “Hmm, it’s probably better to own the trading-stamp company.” Even Buffett—a boyhood stamp collector who still dreamed occasionally about counting stamps, and had a sentimental stash of Blue Eagle stamps in his basement—would rather own Blue Chip stock than collect Blue Chip stamps.

At Grinnell College, he showed up for a meeting to find his fellow trustee Bob Noyce itching to leave Fairchild Semiconductor. Noyce, Gordon Moore (its research director), and its assistant director of research and development, Andy Grove, had decided to start a nameless new company in Mountain View, California, based on a vague plan to extend the technology of circuits to “higher levels of integration.”22 Joe Rosenfield and the college endowment ([Location 5675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=5675))

Buffett had a long-standing bias against technology investments, which he felt had no margin of safety. Years ago, in 1957, Katie Buffett, wife of his uncle Fred Buffett, had arrived at Warren’s back door one day with a question. Should she and Fred invest in her brother Bill’s new company? Bill Norris was leaving Remington Rand’s* UNIVAC computer division to start a company called Control Data Corporation to compete with IBM. Warren was horrified. “Bill thought that Remington Rand was falling behind IBM. I thought he was out of his mind. Aunt Katie and Uncle Fred wanted to put a few bucks in Control Data there right at the start. Bill didn’t have any money. Nobody had any money, in a sense.” Well, except Warren and Susie. “I could have financed half the thing if I’d wanted. I was very negative on it. I told them, ‘It doesn’t sound like much to me. Who needs another computer company?’ ”23 But since Bill was Katie’s brother, for once she and Fred had ignored Warren’s advice and invested $400 anyway, buying the stock at sixteen cents a share.24 Control Data’s success hadn’t changed Buffett’s opinion about technology.

As much out of regard for Rosenfield as for any other reason, however, Buffett signed off on a technology investment for Grinnell.25 Rosenfield provided the margin of safety by guaranteeing the college’s investment. And as much as Buffett admired Noyce, he did not buy Intel for the partnership, thus passing on one of the greatest investing opportunities of his life. While he had lowered his investing standards in difficult environments—and would do so again—one compromise he would never make was to give up his margin of safety. This particular quality—to pass up possible riches if he couldn’t limit his risk—was what made him Warren Buffett.

Buffett wanted the crusty Abegg as part of the deal.

These connections also kept Harding, Loomis, and Brandt in Buffett’s extended “family.” Buffett brought Ruane to Omaha and promoted the Sequoia Fund to the partners. He endorsed Ruane in typically mathematical terms. Unremarkably, even though he had known Ruane for years, he still felt it necessary to leave a small escape hatch, fearing blame in case things didn’t work out, and wrote: “There is no way to eliminate the possibility of error when judging humans … [but] I consider Bill to be an exceptionally high-probability decision on character and a high-probability one on investment performance.”20 ([Location 5858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=5858))

I kind of enjoyed it. “You know, clothing holds its value better than jewelry.” On December 26, after the exchange of Christmas gifts, he sent the partners another long letter, going out of his way to answer at length a number of their questions.8 A few of the partners had been challenging him. If it was such a lousy business, why not get rid of the Berkshire Hathaway textile mill? “I have no desire to trade severe human dislocations for a few percentage points additional return per annum,” he wrote. But since the whole point of his business was to eke out a few additional percentage points per annum, this kind of rationalization would have been unthinkable earlier in his career. What is Sun Newspapers? they asked. It’s worth a buck a share, he replied, kind of skipping the rest of the economics. Adding some famous last words, “We have no particular plans to expand in the communication field,” he wrote.9 Why didn’t you register the Berkshire Hathaway and Diversified stock so that it could be freely traded?

Within days, he wrote a detailed letter to Chuck Huggins, executive vice president, about opening new See’s stores in locations like Colorado Springs, Fayetteville, and Galveston. He suggested that Huggins avoid Iowa, because he had heard that “Iowans are generally not candy enthusiasts.”28 He gave Huggins permission to stop sending monthly boxes of candy to the long list of women whom Candy Harry had designated as his special friends. He started following sugar futures and cocoa futures, which at 58 cents a pound were approaching prices unheard of since the year of the Rockwood cocoa caper.29 Buffett suggested that Huggins “play around with” advertising slogans and try to come up with one along the lines of Coca-Cola’s “pause that refreshes.” It was as if, over his breakfast cornflakes, Huggins could dream up an advertising slogan that compelling.30… ([Location 6123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6123))

During a dinner at the Sarnats’ in California, one of his fingers started to swell. He had taken a double dose of delayed-action penicillin earlier that day for a minor infection. Bernie Sarnat, a surgeon, suspected an allergic reaction.

The one she finally reached insisted that they go to an emergency room immediately. By then Buffett was barely conscious, and the emergency room team started working to save his life.

And increasingly she seemed drawn to California. She had “fallen in love” with the place they had been renting at Emerald Bay in Laguna Beach, perched fifty feet above the ocean among a group of other luxury vacation homes.46 Warren particularly disliked buying houses, considering money spent on them as lying fallow. Susie needled him. “If we were rich,” she said, “you would just go up to that house, and ask the owner how much she wants for it, and pay however much she asked. But I know we’re not rich.” In their perpetual tug-of-war, Susie was usually able to dislodge the cash from him in the end. Buffett delegated the task of buying the house to the Tolleses, who dickered the owner down to $150,000.47 When Roy Tolles called to tell Warren, he said, “I have bad news.

He made no impression on her whatsoever. For his part, he did not find her particularly attractive—even though she was a handsome woman—for she lacked the soft femininity and caretaking qualities of his ideal, Daisy Mae.

But instead of legalistic boilerplate, he wrote a highly flattering, personal missive that linked their common interest in journalism and stressed the Sun’s Pulitzer. Nonetheless, Graham panicked. She reached out for advice. While she instinctively pursued women’s equality—she had given the seed money to Gloria Steinem for Ms. magazine—deep inside she still thought that only men knew anything about business. Thus, when she asked André Meyer his opinion and he became “irate” and told her that Buffett meant her no good, she took him seriously.7 “André Meyer really wanted to think he controlled everything. And it was easy when he got a woman like Kay—he would make her feel like she’d better not go to the bathroom without checking with him. He had that style.

Her mother told her that and her husband told her that, over and over and over and over again.”8 Graham barely remembered Buffett from their earlier encounter.9 She and her colleagues bought copies of Supermoney and devoured the chapter on him, wondering what the man from Nebraska had in store for them.

But by 1973, Susie Buffett had seen him expend a tidal wave of energy on each new obsession, sometimes changing entire coastlines in his wake. From his childhood hobby of collecting license-plate numbers to reforming the jiggery-pokery of journalism, three roles invariably interested him. The first was the relentless collector, expanding his empire of money, people, and influence. The second was the preacher, sprinkling idealism from the lectern. The third was the cop, foiling the bad guys. The perfect business would allow him to do all of these at once: preach, play cop, and ring the cash register. The perfect business was a newspaper. That was why the Sun had been a sliver of something that he wanted more of, much, much more. But he and Munger had struck out at trying to buy major city newspapers.

Graham labored every day over the Watergate story. In a sense, she had staked the Post’s franchise on it. She relied heavily on the opinion of the devoutly religious, utterly respectable Gillespie. He had served the Graham family ever since, as a twenty-eight-year-old trust lawyer, he had drafted Eugene Meyer’s final will, witnessing the signature of the fading old man. “He’s going to take over the Washington Post,” she said about Buffett. “Forget it,” Gillespie said. “It’s not possible. It doesn’t make any difference how much B stock he owns. He has no rights. All he could do would be to elect himself to the board if he owned the majority of the B stock.” Gillespie had called a San Jose Water Works director and was convinced that Buffett had had no inside information.

He agreed eagerly, and when she arrived at an office borrowed from the Los Angeles Times, she looked exactly as she had two years before: impeccably tailored shirt-dress, her pageboy hairdo lacquered into place, lips pursed in a small smile. When she saw Buffett, Graham said, his “very appearance surprised” her. “The great blessing and curse in my mother’s life,” says her son Don, “was she had very high standards when it came to taste. She was used to traveling in highfalutin circles. She thought there was one right way to dress and eat and one circle of people to be paid attention. Warren violated all her standards when it came to these things, yet he didn’t care.”17 Wearing a suit that looked tailored for some other man, the hair no longer crew-cut and beginning to float up slightly at the ends, “he resembled no Wall Street figure or business tycoon I’d ever met,” she later wrote. “Rather, he came across as corn-fed and Midwestern, but with that extraordinary combination of qualities that has appealed to me throughout my life—brains and humor. I liked him from the start.”18 But at the time, that certainly didn’t show. “When I first met with Kay, she was wary and scared. She was terrified by me, and she was intrigued by me. And one thing about Kay was that you could tell. She was not a poker-face type.” Buffett told her he thought Wall Street did not see the value of the Post. Graham relaxed her guard slightly. In her patrician accent, she invited him to meet with her in Washington a few weeks later. Warren and Susie arrived November 4, the evening before the meeting, drove up in a taxi to the Madison Hotel, directly across the street from the Post headquarters, and, as they were checking in, found that the… ([Location 6677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6677))

She said, ‘Yes, the amortization of intangibles caused us a problem’ or something like that. Howard looked her right in the eye, and he said, ‘Kay, what is the amortization of intangibles?’ “And at that moment, I mean, I loved it. She was just frozen. She was paralyzed. Howard was enjoying it. So I jumped in and explained what amortization of intangibles was to Howard. And when I got through with this description, Kay said, ‘Exactly!’ ” Buffett loved outthinking Simons, short-circuiting the game, and coming—indirectly and subtly—to Graham’s defense.

But we’ll just take them out.’ ” That afternoon, Buffett—who had spent $10,627,605 to buy twelve percent of the company—signed an agreement with Graham not to buy any more of the Post stock without her permission. “I knew that was the only way that she would ever be comfortable.” In the evening, the Buffetts were due at Graham’s for one of her famous dinners, this one for forty guests honoring Warren and Susie. Despite Graham’s personal insecurity, she was considered Washington’s greatest hostess, above all because she knew how to help people relax and enjoy themselves. “She traveled widely in the world, so found occasions to give dinners,” says Don Graham. “If she had gone to Malaysia, when the prime minister came to town she’d give a dinner for him. The ambassador would look up what they did last time, and there was always a meal at Mrs. Graham’s house.

And when she had a party, she could get anybody she wanted.

At the bottom it says ‘black tie.’ Well, I didn’t have that, needless to say.… So I called her secretary, panicked. “Her secretary is a very nice gal. She says, well, let’s put on our thinking cap.” Graham’s assistant, Liz Hylton, called a local store and found something suitable.23 The Buffetts left the Madison Hotel and were driven past mansion after mansion on Embassy Row.

[Yet] I was so uncomfortable.” He had never attended a gathering of such formality or grandeur. When the cocktail hour ended, crossing the hallway to the huge dining room where Graham held her famous parties, its paneled walls lit by the glow of tapered candles in bronze sconces, did nothing to make Buffett feel more at home. Crystal candlesticks and armorial porcelain gleamed on the round walnut dining tables, although the guests whom Graham had invited outshone the splendor of the surroundings. The room at any given time could be filled with a selection of U.S. Presidents, foreign leaders, diplomats, administration officials, Congressional members, senior lawyers in town, and people chosen from her group of prominent friends. Buffett found himself seated next to Edmund Muskie’s wife, Jane, an obvious dinner partner, since the Buffetts had entertained her husband in Omaha. On his other side was Barbara Bush, whose husband was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations but would soon become the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in Peking, with the important role of steering the United States through the delicate process of renewing its diplomatic ties with China. Graham pressed a button to signal the kitchen, and waiters began to move around the antique Georgian tables and serve. Warren tried not to gape at the protocol. “Susie’s over there sitting next to some senator. And he’s trying to make out with her, he’s got his hand on her leg and all these things. But me, I’m dying, because I don’t know what to talk to these people about. Barbara Bush could not have been nicer.

- By the time he dined with Katharine Graham in 1973, Buffett was no longer just an investor who was buying newspaper stocks. He was becoming a business mogul on a small scale. Berkshire Hathaway and Diversified were his bailiwick. Charlie Munger was the czar of Blue Chip Stamps. The interlocking ownership of these three companies had tightened the business relationship between Buffett and Munger, and resembled the embryo of an empire built by an investor whom Buffett admired, Gurdon W. Wattles.1 His company was like a Russian doll; open it and inside find another company, and another, and another. Wattles controlled them, although he did not own one hundred percent of any of them. From early in his career, Buffett admired the Wattles model. He talked about Wattles all the time to his friends. “The only way to go is coattail-riding,” he would say.2 “Wattles had this little closed-end investment company called Century Investors. He did this chain thing where he would be buying stock in a company at a discount, which would be buying stock in another company at a discount.… The big company at the end of the thing was Mergenthaler Linotype, which was two-thirds owned by American Manufacturing. In those days, you didn’t have to file with the SEC to publicly reveal that you were buying, so nobody knew and he just would keep buying until he got control. He bought control of Electric Auto-Lite, partly through Mergenthaler, and he was doing the same thing with Crane Co. Somewhere in the chain was Webster Tobacco.… Everything sold at a discount, and you could just keep buying all of them and make more money every time you made a purchase.… I owned Mergenthaler, I owned Electric Auto-Lite, I owned American Manufacturing.3 What would cause the value to come out, that was always the question. But you just had a feeling you were with a smart guy and eventually it would. “For ten or fifteen years I followed him.

- very Graham-like. Nobody paid any attention to him except me. He was sort of my model as to what I hoped to do for a while. It was so understandable and so obvious and such a sure way of making money. Although it didn’t make you huge money necessarily, you knew you were going to make money.”4 What interested Warren about the Wattles model: the way one company could legitimately buy cheap stock in another. Eventually Wattles had merged his empire into one company, Eltra Corporation. This stock was now a favorite of Bill Ruane’s, because the company’s earnings were compounding at fifteen percent a year.5 The Buffett-Munger companies were beginning to look a little like Eltra before its combination: Berkshire was Diversified’s largest shareholder and also owned Blue Chip stock. Each of them also owned businesses that were not traded publicly. See’s Candies was so profitable that it more than offset the losses from Blue Chip’s trading-stamp business. Munger now took the step of buying twenty percent of a near-defunct investment firm, Source Capital, for Blue Chip. “We bought it at a discount from its asset value,” says Munger. “And there were two assholes who were the sellers. We had a no-asshole rule very early. Our basic rule has ([Location 6801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6801))

- always been that we won’t deal with assholes. And so Warren, when he heard about Source Capital, said, ‘Now I understand the two-asshole exception to the no-asshole rule.’ ”6 Source Capital was small change. Buffett and Munger were always on the lookout for anything new they could acquire, especially something bigger that would give Blue Chip the kind of boost that See’s Candies had. They had found a sleepy West Coast savings-and-loan company, Wesco Financial. They bought some cheap Wesco shares for Blue Chip Stamps.7 Then Wesco announced that it was going to merge with Financial Corporation of Santa Barbara, a hot stock, with an aggressive approach that Wall Street liked. Analysts thought Santa Barbara was paying too much for Wesco.8 Yet Buffett and Munger saw the opposite: They thought Wesco was handing over its stock too cheap.9 Founded by the Casper family, Wesco owned Mutual Savings, a savings and loan that had prospered when the GIs came home during the… ([Location 6811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6811))

- on the board, felt that Wesco’s managers condescended to her, dismissed her suggestions that they should grow the company, and used her family’s legacy only as a ticket to ride at the head of the Rose Bowl parade.11 Peters, an elegantly dressed, high-cheekboned former art history student, had school-age kids, no business background, and spent much of her time tending the family vineyard in Napa. Now she drove back and forth to Pasadena on Wednesdays to attend board meetings. Running a savings and loan, she found, was hardly a black art. She subscribed to everything relevant she could get her hands on and sat down and read and figured it out. As Peters’s frustration grew, she pushed for a merger. She knew the Santa Barbara offer wasn’t great. But although the company’s executives hung around the country club too much for her taste, they were aggressive, acquiring branches and doing things that she thought should be done. Munger thought that he and Buffett should keep buying Wesco stock. If Blue Chip kept adding to the eight percent of Wesco it already owned, it could accumulate enough stock to defeat the Santa Barbara deal. But then he discovered that it would take fifty percent of the stock, a much higher obstacle. Munger had a greater incentive than Buffett to keep going, since Blue Chip was his partnership’s most important investment. He urged going ahead; Buffett thought the threshold too high and held back.12 Soon thereafter, Munger went to see Wesco’s CEO, Louis Vincenti, and tried to persuade him to abandon the Santa Barbara deal.13 And Vincenti brushed Munger off like a flake of dandruff—not an easy thing to do. After being rebuffed, Munger and Buffett had no intention of launching a competing hostile bid. Further, Munger could not imagine that such a thing might be necessary. He wrote Vincenti, appealing to his higher values.14 It was wrong that Wesco should sell itself too cheap; Vincenti should… ([Location 6823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6823))

- Peters was the shareholder pushing for the merger. Munger sent Don Koeppel, CEO of Blue Chip, to see Peters. She dismissed him as a minion.16 So it was time for the big gun. Within ten minutes of Koeppel’s departure, Buffett called her. Peters had just finished reading the chapter on him in Jerry Goodman’s Supermoney, which her husband had given her for Christmas. “Are you the same Warren Buffett that’s in Supermoney?” she asked. Buffett admitted that he was the man who, according to Jerry Goodman, represented the triumph of straight thinking and high standards over flapdoodle, folly, and flimflam. They agreed to meet twenty-four hours later. At the TWA Ambassador Lounge at the San Francisco airport, Buffett, with Pepsi in hand, underplayed his talent and record while asking questions in a warm, unthreatening manner. They talked for three hours, mostly about Omaha, where Peters’s mother had grown up. They talked about politics.

He told her he had a partner, someone who would be in charge of Berkshire and the Buffett family’s stockholdings if the proverbial truck mowed him down. On her next trip to Pasadena, Peters sat down to breakfast with Buffett and Munger at the grand old Huntington Hotel so that she could get to know this mysterious partner. They asked her for a meeting with the Wesco board. Peters then did something brave, allowing herself to look capricious in front of the board rather than let the company make a serious mistake. At the next board meeting she asked the board to reverse course and meet with Buffett and Munger. The board waved her off and voted at a special meeting to “use every effort to complete the merger with Financial Corporation of Santa Barbara.”17 Forgetting who actually owned the company was their mistake.

I knew that what was going on in everyone’s mind was ‘My God, is this what happens when you let a hormonal woman on the board?’ ”18 Wall Street thought so; it sent Wesco stock nosediving from a high of above $18 to $11 on the news. An analyst claimed Santa Barbara was paying too much for Wesco, a “sleeping company for years, with old management.” Another referred to it as “garbage.”19 For her courage, Buffett and Munger now felt indebted to Peters.20 They had also decided they wanted to own Wesco themselves and felt it would be possible to win Vincenti’s cooperation. But, by then it must have been apparent that Lou Vincenti would not gambol along behind them like a lamb after its mother.

We really thought we’d make a better impression on Louie Vincenti.… [W]e wanted Louie to be our partner for the long term. We were trying to behave well.”21 By March 1973, Blue Chip owned a quarter of the Wesco stock. And Buffett, who had never stopped buying Blue Chip, continued his drive to get hold of more. Including the thirteen percent of Blue Chip he owned outright as well as his share of the stock owned by Berkshire and Diversified, Buffett was now effectively the largest Blue Chip shareholder. Blue Chip began to formally tender for Wesco’s shares, this time paying $15 a share in cash, until it owned more than half.22 Within weeks, Munger outlined for… ([Location 6874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6874))

- Then, no sooner had Blue Chip bought the majority of Wesco than the whole stock market fell apart.25 Buffett’s stake in the Washington Post lost a quarter of its value.26 Ordinarily he would have bought more, but he had promised Graham that he wouldn’t. Instead, he recommended it to his friends, and looked for new opportunities.27 He bought National Presto, maker of pressure cookers and popcorn poppers,28 and Vornado Realty Trust, which put him on its board.29 Buffett had a set of legacy shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway who understood his investing approach and would never question his judgment. Thus he had earned the luxury of ignoring Mr. Market, which had marked down the value of his portfolio to a fire-sale price. Others were not so lucky.

- As 1974 began, stocks for which he had recently paid $50 million lost a quarter of their value. Berkshire, too, slid down to $64 per share. Some of the former partners began to fear it had been a mistake to keep the stock. Buffett saw it just the opposite way. He wanted to buy more Berkshire and Blue Chip. But “I’d run out of gas. I had used all the $16 million of cash I got out of the partnership to buy stock in Berkshire and Blue Chip. So all of a sudden I woke up one day and had no money at all. I was getting $50,000 a year salary from Berkshire Hathaway and some fees from FMC.39 ([Location 6932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6932))

- But I had to start my personal net worth over again from zero.” He was very, very rich but cash-poor. Yet the companies he controlled, especially Berkshire Hathaway, had cash to buy stocks. To move some of Berkshire’s money to Diversified, Buffett sent a pipeline into Berkshire. He set up a reinsurance company—a company that insures other insurers40—in Diversified. This company, Reinsurance Corp. of Nebraska, agreed to take part of National Indemnity’s business, receiving premiums and covering losses. Because National Indemnity was so profitable and generated so much “float”—premiums paid ahead of claims, i.e., cash—as time passed, the pipeline would give Diversified millions more dollars to invest.41 With this money, Buffett began to buy stocks for Diversified. Principally he bought stock in Blue Chip and Berkshire Hathaway. Soon, Diversified owned ten percent of Berkshire. It was almost as though Berkshire was buying back its own stock—but not quite. Diversified’s owners and Berkshire’s weren’t the same. Buffett still forbade his friends to buy Berkshire—whereas he, Munger, and Gottesman were partners in Diversified.42 At the time, even though the three did one another business favors and swapped stock ideas on occasion, their interests didn’t necessarily align. Asked later under oath if he was Buffett’s “alter ego,” Munger said no. He acknowledged similar mannerisms and ways of speech. But “I’ve never chosen a role of being a junior partner,” he said. “I like the idea of having a sphere of activity” of my own.43 On one occasion, Munger said, he had found a block of Blue Chip stock that he and Gottesman wanted to buy for Diversified. Buffett wanted to take the block away from them and buy it for Berkshire Hathaway. After “a discussion”—clearly about who needed it more—the combined strength of Munger and Gottesman had somehow overpowered Buffett, and Diversified got the stock.44 At least that way they kept a little share. Still, Buffett did own forty-three percent of Diversified, so its purchases of Berkshire had added almost five percent to his personal ownership. Buying through Diversified was particularly attractive in that it tended not to ratchet up Berkshire’s stock price. Hardly anybody was paying attention.45 But why did he want it at all? “Berkshire was not worth more than forty bucks as a business. You couldn’t have sold the textile mills and insurance business for more. And half the money was ([Location 6937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6937))

But in effect, I was betting that I could do something. I was betting on myself.” He didn’t know what he was going to do, except invest. Verne McKenzie, who had returned from New Bedford to become Berkshire’s controller, thought that to Buffett, it simply “looked like an interesting game. All he was doing was solidifying his control.” That he was, and doing so in the manner in which he always approached investing—as a collector, one who bought in secrecy to avoid tipping off other bargain hunters.

- of compounding, as float and investments doubled and redoubled over time. The novelty and strength of Buffett’s model cannot be overstated. Nothing else like it existed, or would for years to come. “That was the golden period of textbook capital allocation,” he says. The timing was stupendous. Capital from the insurance companies was pouring into Berkshire and DRC at the same time that the market was collapsing, the environment that Buffett liked best. While he had not yet decided exactly what to do with the collective enterprise he had built by the end of 1974, of two things he was certain. One was the business model’s power, and the other his skill in using it. Above all, he had confidence in himself. “Always,” he says. “Always.” ([Location 6988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=6988))

- As was her habit with powerful men, Graham reached out to him for help. Buffett needed little encouragement. “The first time she was going to speak to the New York Society of Security Analysts, I went over there to her apartment in New York on a Sunday morning to help her write her speech. She was a basket case. She was terrified that all these men were going to be there and she was going to have to stand up in front of them. Public speaking was something that was very hard for her always. The funny thing is, she had a great sense of humor, she was smart, but she tended to freeze in front of a crowd. Particularly if she thought they were going to question her about numbers.” As Robert Redford had said in an interview after first meeting her to discuss the Watergate movie All the President’s Men, Graham had a “tight-jawed, ([Location 7005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7005))

- blue-blooded” quality that demanded that her privacy not be invaded. Why, therefore, Redford asked himself, “did she keep making speeches and accepting awards?”2—particularly since it terrified her to do it. Buffett sat down in the living room of Graham’s apartment in the UN Plaza, overlooking New York City’s East River. Surrounded by Asian art and antiques from Agnes Meyer’s collection, they started to work. “She kept imagining these questions they were going to ask, like how much are you paying for your newsprint per ton? She thought it was a quiz.… I kept trying to get her away from trying to remember facts. Just have a theme.” Graham wanted to say that good journalism makes good profits. Buffett snorted to himself over this notion and refocused her. “You know, good journalism is not inconsistent with good profits, or something like that. The hell with all the other stuff. I just tried to convince her that she was a hell of a lot smarter than all those dumb males that were out there. That’s what really sort of bonded us initially.” In an ironic turnabout, Buffett became Kay Graham’s personal Dale Carnegie instructor. He, of all people, could sympathize with someone who ([Location 7012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7012))

He knew how to anticipate their reactions and to phrase things in a nonthreatening way. His letters, which had always been self-conscious, were now more deftly worded and empathetic. He had learned to listen and show interest in other people. It helped that he was genuinely fascinated by Graham. Buffett returned to Omaha having seen a new side of Graham. As he continued getting to know her on a personal level, he saw her as a bundle of paradoxes. “Fearful but willful. Patrician but democratic. Wounded by the people she cared most about.” He was surprised how much she still talked about her former husband a decade after his suicide. “When you first met her, she would often get off on the subject of Phil very quickly, almost like Charlie getting off on a subject.

When he used to chop up the children right in front of her, she wouldn’t stop him.” That he and Graham—who showed the aftereffects of an upbringing by a cruel, neglectful mother and years of abuse by a sadistic husband with untreated bipolar disorder—would be mutually attracted seems almost a foregone conclusion given Buffett’s own childhood experiences. By the spring of 1974, she began to switch her allegiance from her other advisers to him. He seized the chance to tutor the CEO of the Washington Post Company about business as if he had been waiting to play Pygmalion all his life: his very own Eliza Doolittle. More patient than Henry Higgins, he coached her gently and sent helpful, interesting articles to Kay and to her son Don.

Riding with him in a taxi in Washington, D.C., she pointed out philanthropist Stewart Mott, who was running the Stewart R.

The Buffetts were now richer than Mott, who had started with $25 million. “Why don’t you quit?” Susie said. “Stewart Mott is doing all these other things now and he doesn’t have to work every day.” But Warren was incapable of quitting; he fell back on his philosophy that $50 million today would be worth $500 million someday.

- Forbes captured Buffett’s attitude in an interview that November, which opened with a juicy quote: Asked how he felt about the market, “Like an oversexed man in a harem,” Buffett replied. “This is the time to start investing.”13 He went on to say, “This is the first time I can remember that you could buy Phil Fisher [growth] stocks at Ben Graham [cigar butt] prices.” He felt this was the most significant statement that he could make, but Forbes didn’t include it; a general audience wouldn’t understand the references to Fisher and Graham.14 But despite his enthusiasm for the market so far in 1974, he had invested at a trickle, and mostly moved money around. He had also bought 100,000 shares of Blue Chip from Rick Guerin. “He sold me at five bucks because he was getting squeezed,” Buffett says. “That was a brutal period.” The “harem” comment had a double meaning: Buffett, for the most part, could look but not touch. One of National Indemnity’s business partners, an aviation broker, had run amok, selling money-losing aviation-insurance policies. The company had tried to stop the agent by revoking its authority but for several months was unable to shut it down.15 The accounting records were a shambles and the ([Location 7111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7111))

The hope was that they were much less, because National Indemnity did not have tens of millions. Buffett was sweating.16 ([Location 7122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7122))

- For the first time they all realized that Blue Chip was in trouble.20 No sooner had Buffett achieved the glory of joining the Post board than his and Munger’s need for legal services was about to grow with stunning rapidity. Rickershauser, who already knew what it was like to work with Buffett, had once explained to a colleague that “the sun is nice and warm, but you don’t want to get too close to it.”21 He would spend the next couple of years testing what could be called Rickershauser’s Law of Thermodynamics. In February 1975, the SEC issued subpoenas and launched a full-blown fraud investigation of Blue Chip’s purchase of Wesco: “In the Matter of ([Location 7146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7146))

- Blue Chip Stamps, Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated, Warren Buffet [sic], HO-784.” The commission staff speculated that Buffett and Munger had committed fraud: “Blue Chip, Berkshire, Buffet [sic], singly or in concert with others … may have engaged in acts which have, directly or indirectly, operated as a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; or included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted …” The commission’s lawyers zeroed in on a theory that Blue Chip had secretly planned from the beginning to take over Wesco Financial but had not disclosed that fact, and that Blue Chip’s purchases of stock after the Santa Barbara deal dissolved were “tender offers” that were never registered with the SEC.22 This latter charge was most serious—the SEC might even file, with great fanfare and publicity, civil fraud charges not only against Blue Chip but also against Buffett and Munger personally. In considering action against a target, Sporkin had a choice. He could prosecute or settle. A settlement let the target say sorry and accept a penalty without officially admitting guilt. And in agreeing to a settlement, the SEC could also make a deal with the company itself without naming anybody. Being named in a settlement might not be the literal end of someone’s career, but there would be no ([Location 7152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7152))

- elephant-bumping afterward. Having so recently been elevated into the high and mighty through Supermoney and Forbes and the board of the Washington Post, Buffett began to fight desperately to save his reputation. Instead, the investigation widened. Under subpoena, Buffett had to open his files—which, naturally, represented a huge and comprehensive collection of documents, just as huge and comprehensive as everything he had ever collected. Lawyers from Munger, Tolles sifted out trade tickets for recent stock purchases, memos to bankers, letters to See’s Candies, notes to Verne McKenzie at the textile mill, and the like and shipped them off to investigators in Washington, D.C. Buffett felt persecuted. He and Munger were being chased in a nightmare by a huge, lumbering giant. To survive, they would have to outrun it. Letters flew back and forth like shuttlecocks between Munger, Tolles and the SEC. Buffett maintained a veneer of calm, but his back problems… ([Location 7162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7162))

- to know what happened?” she asked. They interviewed Peters without a lawyer. Munger was summoned. For two days—also unaccompanied, for what additional legal counsel could Charles T. Munger possibly need?—he tried to defend Blue Chip against the charges. Yes, Blue Chip had thought about getting control, he said, but those plans were only “remote and contingent” until the Santa Barbara merger blew up. This discussion became somewhat circular given his and Buffett’s role in talking to Vincenti and their admitted “wooing” of Betty Peters and the Casper family’s votes. Munger had a regrettable tendency to interrupt and lecture the SEC staff lawyer, Larry Seidman. “We wanted to look very fair and equitable to Lou Vincenti and Betty Peters,” he said.23 What about your Blue Chip shareholders? Seidman asked. Seidman saw no reason for Blue Chip to be so generous to Wesco shareholders; Wesco’s stock by then was largely in the hands of arbitrageurs. These people had bought Wesco’s stock… ([Location 7172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7172))

- Munger reached for his ultimate weapon—Benjamin Franklin. “We didn’t feel our obligation to the shareholders was inconsistent with leaning over backward to be fair. We have that Ben Franklin idea that the honest policy is the best policy. It had a sort of shoddy mental image to us to try to reduce the price.”25 Seidman seemed a little baffled by this argument, and even Munger admitted that the details of what had been done did not look good. He begged Seidman to look at the big picture. “As you look at the overall records, we go way beyond any legal requirement in trying to be fair with people to observe the niceties of fair-dealing.… If there’s any defect at all, it’s not intentional.” When Buffett appeared, they asked him why he and Munger hadn’t let Wesco go into the tank so they could buy it cheap. “I think the general business reputation of Blue Chip would not have been as good,” Buffett said. “I think someone might have been sore about it.” But why should he… ([Location 7182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7182))

He made a favorable impression on Seidman, but not on the senior SEC staff lawyer who was in charge of the investigation, a “tiger” of a prosecutor whose motto was “They shall not pass.” He found these arguments unconvincing.26 The senior investigator’s attitude was that nobody who did anything close to the line would ever get by him.27 The SEC staff seemed fascinated by the intricacies and complications of Buffett’s empire. It even started looking into whether he had traded on inside information about San Jose Water Works.28 The staff started kicking around Source Capital, the closed-end investment fund that Munger had bought a twenty percent interest in as a cigar butt.

- paid for stocks at the time grew harder as the market recovered. Rickershauser had been studying a chart that showed Buffett and Munger’s complex financial interests. Buffett sat at the center, buying Blue Chip, Diversified, and Berkshire, Wattling them into so many pockets that it made Rickershauser shudder.29 Everyone knew Buffett, the great white shark, was virtually helpless to stop himself from acquiring these stocks. After he and Munger had bought the first twenty-five percent of Wesco, Rickershauser had finally advised Buffett to buy stock only through formal tender offers to avoid the appearance of impropriety.30 The complex cross-holdings that Buffett had created looked suspicious. Rickershauser stared at the crazy diagram and fretted, “There’s got to be an indictment in there somewhere.”31 He didn’t think the SEC would have enough evidence to convict, but it would be awfully easy to accuse.

He was unswayed by their testimony and believed they had intentionally quashed the Santa Barbara merger by overpaying for the stock. He was unsympathetic to the “Who was harmed?” explanation for paying more than necessary for Wesco’s stock. He thought the pair was splitting hairs too fine in its explanations of events.33 Rickershauser wrote Sporkin directly. He pleaded with him not to prosecute Buffett and Munger, “individuals who value their good names and reputations as their most priceless possessions,” because “many people, probably most people, assume evil conduct on the part of anyone civilly prosecuted by the commission.” Even if Buffett and Munger consented to a settlement without admitting or denying the charges, merely filing them would cause “terrible, irreversible damage” because “the good reputation of the commission automatically and inexorably destroys the good reputation” of the… ([Location 7218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7218))

- consent to an order on minor, technical disclosure violations on behalf of Blue Chip only, as long as the consent decree did not name any individuals. The panic inside Buffett’s mind can only be imagined. Within the office, he did his best to maintain an imperturbable facade so as not to alarm his staff, any of whom might be interviewed by the SEC. Rickershauser worked like a stevedore to portray his clients as upstanding citizens from the perfect model families. He sent in biographies of Munger and Buffett to the SEC, stressing their charitable work, the many boards on which they served, Howard Buffett’s tenure as a Congressman, and the millions of dollars of taxes that Buffett had paid to the government since filing his first tax return at age fourteen. Buffett obviously had been grinding away at this document as if his life depended on it. Munger was resigned. “If a policeman follows you down the road for five hundred miles,” he said to Buffett, “you’re going to get a ticket.” Then Rickershauser made a further proffer to Sporkin, put delicately: “The complex financial interests of Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger … have apparently raised the impression that compliance with various legal requirements is becoming difficult,” he wrote, noting the pair had tried to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law. “They now wish to simplify their holdings as rapidly as they can.”35 In their interviews, the SEC lawyers had already explored what simplifying would mean. Buffett had acknowledged that he might merge Blue Chip with Berkshire, but until Blue Chip’s legal problems were resolved, it would be hard to put a fair value on the company. “I don’t really like these complications,” he said. “It may look like I like these complications. I don’t have a great staff to handle it all. It seemed fairly simple while we were doing it,” he said, “but not simple now.”36 Asked by an SEC investigator if Buffett had “contingency… ([Location 7228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7228))

- person you would ever meet.” Coming from almost anyone else, Sporkin says he would have dismissed this as rhetoric, but coming from Rickershauser, he took these statements to be both sincere and probably well-judged.38 Sporkin felt he had as great a duty to absolve as to convict. He thought that a prosecutor had to differentiate between a fundamentally honest person who had made a misstep and a crook. His view of Buffett and Munger was that they had certainly misstepped, but that they were not crooks.39 And so the giant tapped Blue Chip gently on the wrist.40 The company consented to an SEC finding that named no individuals.41 The publicity over the event had been trivial and would fade.

- The night of Susie’s first public performance, before a crowd made up of about thirty-five friends, she was so anxious that she asked Warren not to come. Talking and greeting people in a long sequined dress, she stalled until Denenberg pushed her out onto the stage. From Aretha Franklin’s “Call Me,” to what she said was one of her favorites, Roberta Flack’s “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” her choice of music was soulful, passionate, and romantic. The audience responded to and returned her warmth.1 The same pulse and flow Susie got from connecting with people individually came through in a wave when she sang to a group in an intimate space. This was her special gift, transmuted and magnified. She wanted to become a cabaret singer. Warren at the time had many distractions. He was closing the SEC investigation. He was so fascinated with Kay Graham that he literally could not get enough of her. When Warren got obsessed with something—especially someone new—he could not stop thinking about it or them; this came across to a new person as a wholehearted, flattering, and even overwhelming attentiveness.

- arose, however, he snapped back to it in a split second with all the fierce intensity his steely mind could muster. As Munger put it, Buffett “never let his minor obsessions interfere with his major obsession.”2 Katharine Graham, however, was no minor obsession. Warren was also taking Kay to business school in a serious way. “Kay had had me trying to explain accounting to her on the side. I’d bring these annual reports to Washington. And she’d say, ‘Oh, Warren, lessons.’ There I was, teaching again.” He considered her son Don “unbelievably smart,” with “as close to a photographic memory as anyone I’ve ever run into.” As a sign of reassurance to the family, Warren had signed the voting proxy on his shares over to Don. He now stayed at Kay’s house when he came to Washington for monthly board meetings. Buffett felt that Kay was “very, very smart, and in many ways wise, as long as you didn’t go into those areas where the wounds were.” As they grew more intimate, he felt he could say something to her about the way she presented herself to her board. He knew she was less needy than she herself realized. One day he took her aside and said, “You can’t plead for help anymore from the board. It’s just not the position you want to be in.” And so, he says, she ([Location 7277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7277))

- quit. The business and personal ties between the Grahams and Buffett had become close enough that Warren invited Katharine and Don to join the Graham Group at their 1975 meeting, at Hilton Head. Don made an immediate impression with his unpretentious manner, while raising its already high average IQ. Many people quickly saw beneath Kay’s brittle, patrician veneer to the vulnerability and humility that had endeared her to Warren. Thus she fit easily with most of the group despite her queenly presence, worldliness, and connections. She made a sincere effort to get along with everyone—although her deep belief that men were far superior to women wasn’t lost on the women at the meeting. The beautifully dressed, perfectly coiffed Graham, an icon among them, would slide casually into a chair amid the men with a cocktail in her hand; somebody would utter a political opinion, and she would respond “Henry thinks thus-and-so”—speaking of Kissinger. It was impossible not to be impressed. Henry Brandt pulled Buffett into a separate room and asked him to promise that Berkshire stock wouldn’t drop below $40. By October 1975, the stock had been cut in half after trading at $93 just ([Location 7288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7288))

- two years before. “Look, I love you,” Buffett recalls saying, “but I can’t promise you that.” “The world is ending,” said Brandt, or words to that effect. “I’ve got every dollar I own in this stock.” The world continued to end. Even though the rest of the stock market was recovering, Berkshire was not. Brandt panicked and called Buffett, who offered him $40 a share. Then Brandt called Walter Schloss and said, “Warren will pay me forty dollars and I want fifty. What should I do?” Schloss was the last champion of cigar butts. At the meetings, the others razzed him about his “buggy-whip” portfolio of bankrupt steel companies and destitute auto-parts makers. “So what,” said Schloss. “I don’t like stress and I sleep well at night.” He filled out his checklists, applying Graham’s philosophy in its purest form. He went home from his desk in the closet at Tweedy, Browne at five o’clock every evening, and his results were phenomenal. Now Schloss was dismayed to hear Brandt telling himself he was better off without… ([Location 7296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7296))

- him,” says Schloss. But the U. S. economy by then was in so much trouble that New York City was nearly bankrupt; the country was in a mood of such profound pessimism that it affected people’s judgment. “On Monday he called his broker,” says Schloss, and began selling until half his family’s shares were gone.3 Immediately afterward, President Ford refused a bailout of the New York City economy; the New York Daily News captured the feeling of the times in a huge headline: “Ford to City: Drop Dead.”4 The partners who took Berkshire stock in 1970 when it traded around $40 seemed no better off five years later. “It looked like not much was happening favorably for a long, long time,” says Munger. “And that was not the way our partners, by and large, had previously experienced things. The paper record looked terrible, yet the future, what you might call the intrinsic record, the real business momentum, was gaining all the while.” Buffett’s own net worth, based on where the… ([Location 7307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7307))

- and buying. In 1974, before the SEC investigation began, Berkshire had owned twenty-six percent of Blue Chip. When all was said and done, Berkshire would own more than forty-one percent of Blue Chip—so much that he and Susie owned, personally and through Berkshire Hathaway, thirty-seven percent of the stock all by themselves. He thought of another way to capitalize on the situation, getting his mother, “who cared nothing about money,” to sell her 5,272 shares of Berkshire to Doris and Bertie. For $5,440 plus a $100,000 note, they each got 2,636 shares of Berkshire—paying the equivalent of $2 a share in cash.5 Buffett, who viewed debt as almost sinful, thought Berkshire so cheap at $40 a share that he had his sisters borrow ninety-five percent of the purchase price to buy it. At the rate he obviously thought he could compound the stock’s value, buying on these terms would make his sisters rich (and avoid an enormous estate tax bill).6 “That was probably the… ([Location 7317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7317))

- station. Buffett realized it would be a terrific deal, but he couldn’t buy it because the Washington Post Company also owned television stations. Since he sat on the Post board, it would put the Post over the limit the FCC allowed.7 “What am I involved with that I don’t own?” he asked himself. He actually had to think about it to find something. Then he remembered that he didn’t own Grinnell College. At Buffett’s recommendation, Grinnell eventually bought a Dayton, Ohio, station for $13 million, putting down only $2 million. Sandy Gottesman arranged debt financing for the rest. The broker who sold it to Grinnell called it the best deal he had seen in the past twenty years.8 There were some good reasons, however, why stocks were cheap and cities like New York were close to bankruptcy. Along with rampant inflation, out-of-control labor costs and unstable labor relations were strangling the economy. Newspapers were among the most severely affected businesses. Right after the Hilton Head meeting, the Washington Post’s union contracts expired, and the pressmen sabotaged the pressroom at four a.m. on their way out the door to go on strike. Most of the unions other than the pressmen stayed at work, especially the all-important Newspaper Guild of journalists. Using helicopters to move key people past picket lines, the Post started getting out an attenuated paper after only one day’s disruption. But as the strike ground on, Graham became paralyzed with fears that her paper was committing suicide. The Post could produce only half the number of papers at a quarter of their normal size, and advertisers marched steadily over to the Post’s archrival, the Evening Star. “We crossed the picket line together. Kay was gutsy about that. But I saw her burst into tears when she picked up the Star,” which was copying the Post’s format and stealing its advertisers. When she felt threatened, the woman that her editor Howard Simons called the “Bad Katharine” flew down the chimney. “It wasn’t really the… ([Location 7328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7328))

- mind that she was in an unfriendly environment and it could be triggered by some incident. “But she always knew that I was on her side. That didn’t mean I agreed with her on everything or ate everything she wanted me to eat. But I was on her side. And I always would be.” The Bad Katharine bore some similarities to Leila Buffett. And Warren took an obvious pride in being the one person who could win Kay’s trust and keep the Bad Katharine at bay. For the next six months, the Post would continue to publish while navigating fruitless negotiations, threats, violence, a logistical war of nerves, and a constant struggle to keep the torn Newspaper Guild from striking in sympathy. “She had people telling her, including some of the people she respected most, ‘You’ve got to give in or you’re going to lose.’ They were afraid, they hated not publishing and seeing the Star gain on the Post. “So I was the countervailing force. I said to her, ‘I will tell you before the tipping point is reached.’ The tipping point is the point at which the other guy becomes dominant, and after you go back, he is still dominant. At what point does it become more of a habit for them to buy the other paper?” While “Warren encouraged her, it was her backbone, not his,” stresses George Gillespie, Graham’s lawyer.9 Two months into the strike, the Post had made a final offer to the pressmen, who rejected it.10 Graham began to hire replacement workers, breaking the strike. Over the next few months, the paper gradually won back the remaining unions, readers, and advertisers, even though the picketing and bad publicity continued through the spring. Just as Graham was slowly rescuing her company,11 Buffett and Munger had finally reached their settlement with the SEC. Now Buffett invited Munger for a steak dinner down at Johnny’s Café near the stockyards to finalize their “simplification” plan. He had decided to stop managing money for FMC on the side.

- to normalize. The Post board meetings lost their edge of emergency, and Graham began thinking of expanding her empire. Newspapers at the time were being snapped up left and right. “Kay really wanted to buy newspapers. But above all, she didn’t want other people to buy them instead of her,” Buffett says. “Tell me what to do,” she would beg. “I would just make her make the damn decision,” he says. He helped her understand that it was always a mistake to pay too much for something you wanted. Impatience was the enemy. For a long time, the Post did very little and grew slowly. Buffett taught the Grahams the immense value of buying their company’s own stock when it was cheap to reduce the shares outstanding. That increased the size of each slice of the pie. Meanwhile, the Post avoided making expensive mistakes and became much more profitable as a result.13 Buffett, used to doing the taking, for the first time found himself in the giving role and discovered that,… ([Location 7371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7371))

- “Kay tried to upgrade me a little. It was just very gradual and not so I would notice. It was very funny. She worked so hard to sort of remold me, but it didn’t work. She was a hell of a lot more sophisticated than I was, that’s for sure.” Buffett learned that Graham thought it was uncouth and disgusting to eat out in restaurants. “Around Washington your cook was a big point of pride. The highest compliment you could pay somebody at a party was, ‘I’m going to try and hire away your cook,’ or ‘You must have brought your cook over from France.’ Kay cared about that, like everybody in Washington. So her dinners tended to be quite fancy, except that she would make exceptions for me.” Graham’s chef found the restrictions imposed by cooking for Warren a challenge. “Broccoli, asparagus, and Brussels sprouts look to me like Chinese food crawling around on a plate. Cauliflower almost makes me sick. I eat carrots reluctantly. I don’t like sweet potatoes. I don’t even want to be close to a rhubarb, it makes me retch.”… ([Location 7382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7382))

Yet Buffett became a regular guest at Graham’s famous dinners, which he called her “Kay Parties.” He enjoyed his status as the hayseed who was flummoxed by a lobster. His childlike tastes conveyed an air of authenticity and innocence. But his social naiveté was also genuine—mostly because he went around with blinders on.

Katharine Graham was dragging the man of simple tastes who thought of his life as something out of Leave It to Beaver into elephant territory as fast as she could. “She didn’t change my behavior as much as changing what I knew and saw. Everywhere she went, she was treated just like royalty. I saw a whole lot of interesting things that I wouldn’t have seen in the world. I had a lot of things explained to me. I picked up a lot around her. Kay knew so damned much about everybody that she would give me insights on people in the political arena. “It bothered her that she thought I was teaching her all these things and she wasn’t doing anything for me. She was constantly laboring in terms of trying to think of something she could do to help me out, whether it was inviting me to fancy dinners or something else. You could call all these events glamorous or exotic. I found them quite interesting. I’m not knocking these things. There were probably people who were way more dying to do them, particularly in her presence, than I would be.

- As he knew all too well by now, despite the fame from Supermoney and the articles in Forbes, many prominent people had never heard of him. In May 1976, Buffett was visiting Kay Graham in Washington when she said, I have someone I want you to meet. Jack Byrne, the person in question, was reluctant, however. When Graham called to arrange a meeting, he said, “Who’s Buffett?” “Well, he’s a friend of mine,” Graham said. “He’s ([Location 7488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7488))

- just bought a piece of the Washington Post.” Neither knowing nor caring, Byrne turned down the meeting. Then Buffett’s old friend Lorimer “Davy” Davidson, who had retired from GEICO in 1970, called Byrne. “God, what kind of ninny are you to pass up a meeting with Warren Buffett?” he asked.27 Byrne had been hired in 1976 to try to pull GEICO—on the brink of bankruptcy—out of the ditch. Once an insurer only of government employees, GEICO had taken on John Q. Public. “Growth, growth, growth, the emphasis was all growth,” says a longtime executive.28 Fueled by growth, GEICO stock had traded as high as $61—far too rich for Buffett, but he had never stopped following it for the past twenty years. In 1975, “I looked again at GEICO and was startled by what I saw. It was clear in a sixty-second examination that the company was far underreserved [for claims] and the situation was getting worse. I went in to see [the CEO] Norm Gidden on one of my Washington Post trips. I had known and liked Norm for twenty years on a casual basis. He was friendly, but he had no interest at all in listening to my comments. They were ([Location 7491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7491))

- in deep denial. He really sort of hustled me out of the office.”29 That Buffett, who did not own the stock, was trying to help GEICO’s management says something about how attached he still was to the company from which Lorimer Davidson had recently retired, the stock that had been his first really big idea, the investment that had made so much money for him and for his friends and family. In early 1976, GEICO announced its worst year in history, a $190 million loss from underwriting operations during 1975.30 The company stopped paying dividends, a move that conveys to shareholders that the till is empty. Gidden cast about frantically to bolster the mere $25 million in capital that GEICO had in its coffers.31 That April, at Washington’s Statler Hilton, four hundred angry stockholders stormed the shareholder meeting, armed with questions and accusations. Shortly afterward, the insurance commissioners arrived in a squadron at GEICO’s offices.

A former actuary who became a millionaire at age twenty-nine through a start-up insurance company, Byrne had been instrumental in turning around the Travelers’ flailing home- and auto-insurance lines two years earlier. Butler called him in Hartford and played on his ego, explaining that if he took the job at GEICO it would prevent a national emergency that would throw the whole United States economy into jeopardy. Byrne was easily recruited to audition for CEO in Washington in early May.33 “I came in and gave a sort of off-the-cuff five-hour blah, blah, blah, here’s five points, here’s what we have to do, boom boom boom speech,”34 he says. The desperate board had no trouble deciding to hire this ruddy, round-faced cannonball.

- the public,” Byrne recalls. He was disgusted with GEICO’s former management and had refused to deal with them. Byrne perceived that Wallach was not wild about him either. Nevertheless, the two men began talking daily, sometimes hourly.35 Wallach insisted that the company put a deal in place by late June to raise money while simultaneously getting other insurance companies to take over some of its policies—that is, to “reinsure” GEICO.36 The idea was to increase the resources GEICO had available to pay claims and to cut the risk it was carrying so that they were more in balance. Thus, Byrne had to sell other insurers on the idea of putting up money to save a competitor. Byrne’s prior experience was that he could sell anything. At first he was confident. “My pitch was that if GEICO failed,” says Byrne, “the regulators would just send the bill for GEICO’s unpaid claims to its competitors. So they would end up bailing it out.

- “In the end,” Byrne says, “a couple of really good friends reneged. The Travelers just said, ‘We’re not going to help.’ They didn’t have any principled idea behind this. Travelers was just wussy about it.” Three weeks after he joined GEICO, “I was racing around, thinking I had made the biggest mistake of my life. My wife, Dorothy, was up in Hartford, crying and crying.” The market was suggesting GEICO might not survive; its stock had crashed from $61 to $2 a share. Somebody who owned, say, twenty-five thousand shares had just seen their fortune dwindle by almost ninety-seven percent—from more than $1.5 million to $50,000—from enough to live on for the rest of your life to enough to buy a very good sports car. The reaction of the company’s investors and shareholders to the calamity would, in not a few cases, literally determine their fate. Many longtime shareholders had panicked and talked themselves into selling, which is how the stock got to $2 in the first place.… ([Location 7533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7533))

- told them to sell it, since stocks that cheap rarely recover. They decided—au contraire—a stock that had sunk so low was too cheap to sell. They had little to lose by keeping it. So they did nothing.37 Likewise, Lorimer Davidson never sold a share.38 Leo Goodwin Jr., the son of GEICO’s founder, sold and destituted himself. Shortly thereafter, his son, Leo Goodwin III, died of a drug overdose, a presumed suicide.39 As for Buffett, he had sniffed out another situation like American Express. Here, however, the company didn’t have a franchise strong enough to pull it out of the ditch. GEICO needed a tow truck. Buffett felt that only a brilliant, energetic manager had any chance of turning the situation around. He wanted to size up Byrne before committing any money to the stock. He had Katharine Graham call Byrne; after overcoming Byrne’s initial resistance, she set up the meeting.

- right person in to run it, I think he could turn it around.”40 In came Byrne like a firecracker exploding. The two men sat down by the fireplace in Graham’s library. Buffett questioned Byrne for a couple of hours. Of all the Irish-Americans who would ever swing through Buffett’s orbit, Byrne had the greatest gift of blarney, and “by a wide margin,” Buffett says. “I was excited and babbling on and on and on,” says Byrne. Despite the babbling, Buffett decided that Byrne “understood insurance very well and had the analytical abilities. And he was a leader and a promoter. GEICO needed an analytical leader to figure out how to solve its problem and it needed a promoter to make that sale to all the constituencies that were involved.”41 The next morning, Buffett met up with George Gillespie, the lawyer who had sold him the Post stock, because they had a board meeting to attend at Pinkerton’s, the detective company.42 “George,” he said, “it… ([Location 7554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7554))

- Buffett had waited years for the chance to buy GEICO at the right price. But GEICO still did not have reinsurance, it needed capital, and both depended on the goodwill of Max Wallach, the regulator.44 Yet now a new phenomenon took hold. Buffett’s margin of safety was his mere presence as a backer—a now-legendary investor whose company already owned a successful insurer. This gave Byrne a powerful card to play with the regulators.45 In addition, “General McDermott, the head of USAA, wrote a letter” to other insurers, says Byrne. The United Services Automobile Association sold insurance only to military officers and behaved accordingly. Within the insurance industry, it was fabled, General Robert McDermott almost revered. He supposedly wrote that “in the military we never leave people behind; we have a fallen eagle here.”46 Buffett went to see Wallach to do what he could to convince the crusty old public servant to ease up on the June deadline. But assembling the reinsurance deal was like convincing two dozen shivering children to hold hands and jump into a lake.47 To pull it off, the story Byrne was selling was that the former management, befoulers of GEICO, had been tossed out; that what was left of the house was now clean; that Jack Byrne, rescuer of Travelers, had helicoptered in to restore the damage; and so confident was the infallible Warren Buffett in Jack Byrne that he had plunked down a whopping $4 million on the stock. Nonetheless, when Byrne started hitting the banks on Wall Street, “people were walking out in the middle of lunch,” he says. Then Sam Butler took him down to Salomon Inc. An old, respected specialist bond house, Salomon had never done an equity deal but craved to enter the lucrative business of underwriting stocks. John Gutfreund, an influential Salomon executive, sent a junior research analyst, Michael Frinquelli, and his sidekick, Joe Barone, to Washington to check GEICO out. “I kept them waiting for an hour and a half, so they were furious,” says Byrne. “But I talked till the sun came up. And they were very blank-faced, but on the way to the airport, the company driver heard them talking, and he told me they were very, very enthused on the way back.”48 “The insurance industry can’t afford to let these guys go down,” Frinquelli told Gutfreund. “It would be a terrible black eye on the industry, and these assholes will not tolerate… ([Location 7566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7566))

- the deal.52 To get the financing done, Salomon had to convince investors that GEICO would survive, yet the financing was what would enable GEICO to survive. The deal reeked of desperation, and investors could smell it. GEICO was getting such bad press, Byrne said, that if he had walked across the Potomac River, the headlines would have screamed, “Byrne Can’t Swim.”53 Buffett, the ace in the hole, was unperturbed by these events. When the offering looked dicey, he simply went to New York and met with Gutfreund, saying he stood ready as a backup buyer for the whole deal. He strengthened Salomon’s hand, but Gutfreund also got the impression that Buffett wouldn’t mind if the deal failed and he ended up buying all the stock.54 For Buffett, this was the ultimate no-risk deal. Naturally, the backup price he insisted on was low. Salomon told Byrne unequivocally that, given Buffett’s ceiling, the convertible offering would sell no higher than $9.20 per share, not $10.50 as Byrne wanted. Indeed, once the self-fulfilling prophecy of the sage of Omaha took hold, the deal became oversubscribed.55 Buffett got only a quarter of the stock. Within a few weeks, after a total of twenty-seven reinsurers came forward to provide the required reinsurance, the stock had quadrupled to around $8 a share. And GEICO’s savior, John Gutfreund, became one of a tiny handful of modern Wall Street figures whom Buffett genuinely admired. But GEICO was still not fixed. Byrne needed a thirty-five percent rate increase in New York—and speedily got it.56 In New Jersey, he went to plead with Commissioner James Sheeran, an ex-Marine who prided himself on being tough. Byrne marched into Sheeran’s office with a copy of the company’s license in his pocket and told him that GEICO must have a rate increase. “He had a sour-ass, little wizened actuary at his side who had been fired by some insurance company and had a bone to pick,” says Byrne. Sheeran said his numbers didn’t justify a rate increase. “… ([Location 7598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7598))

- stop him.58 “It showed everybody, all audiences, I was serious about this,” recalls Byrne. “And that I was going to fight for the life of this company no matter what, including walking out of a state, which wasn’t done back then.” Byrne’s impalement of New Jersey had exactly that effect. Everybody knew he was serious. “It was like he had trained all his life for that position. It was like he’d been genetically designed for that particular period of time. If you’d searched the country, you could not have found a better battlefield commander.… It was a Herculean job. Nobody could have done it better than Jack.” Byrne walked through GEICO’s door each morning, sailed his hat fifty feet up to the upper floor of the atrium, and hollered hello to the secretaries.59 “If I don’t whistle by the graveyard, who is going to?” he asked. “If I don’t dance, who’s going to dance?” He had a way of making people feel tah-riffic about the place where they went to work every morning, despite the career-threatening status of their employer. He chopped forty percent of the company’s customers, sold half of its profitable life-insurance affiliate to raise cash, and withdrew from all but seven states plus the District of Columbia. Byrne seemed to run on rocket fuel. His attitude was: “You’re not running a public library here, you’re trying to save a company.”60 “Jack was unmerciful on me,” says Tony Nicely, who had worked for GEICO since he was eighteen years old. “He liked picking on young, aggressive people. But he taught me a lot and I will always be indebted to him. He taught me to think of the business as a whole, not separate functions like underwriting or investing. I learned the importance of a disciplined balance sheet.”61 Byrne told his workers if they couldn’t meet a certain sales figure, they would have to hoist his 240 pounds on their shoulders into a sedan chair like a Roman emperor and bear him into company meetings for a year.62 They made the numbers.

He was beautifully dressed and looked as though everything he was wearing had been bought that morning. He was about seventy at the time, and I was about forty-seven. And he said, in a nice, kind manner, as if he were talking to a young man he was trying to help, ‘Mr. Buffett, the first thing you should understand is, nobody likes to be criticized.’ That was setting the ground rules for getting along.” Nothing could be easier for Buffett. “I said, ‘Yes, Mr. Ambassador. I’ve got it. Don’t worry about that one.’ “And then he started in on ‘Essentiality.’ “ ‘There are three properties in the world,’ he said, ‘that have the quality of ‘Essentiality.’ They are the Daily Racing Form, the TV Guide, and the Wall Street Journal. And I own two out of three.’ “What he meant by ‘Essentiality’ was that, even during the Depression, he saw the Racing Form being sold for two and a half bucks down in Cuba.” The Racing Form had that quality because there was no source of better or more complete information about handicapping horses.

If you were headed to the racetrack and were a serious racing handicapper, you wanted the Racing Form. He could charge whatever he wanted, and people were going to pay it. It’s like selling needles to addicts, basically. “So every year, Walter would go in and say, ‘Mirror, mirror, on the wall, how much should I raise the price of the Racing Form this fall?’ “And the mirror would always say, ‘Walter, charge another quarter!’ “ This was when you could buy the New York Times or Washington Post for a quarter. And yet, thought Buffett, the Times and the Post were great businesses! That meant the Daily Racing Form was an incredible business. Annenberg wanted to own all three of the Essentialities. The visit to Sunnylands was the beginning of a reel that he and Buffett would dance from time to time: talking about whether and how they could buy the Wall Street Journal together. But “the real reason that he had me out there was to send a message to Kay.” The Annenbergs and the Grahams had once been friends.2 Then, in 1969, during the confirmation hearing for Annenberg’s appointment as ambassador to Great Britain, he had taken offense at columns written by the Post’s muckraking Drew Pearson, which described at length Annenberg’s editorial vindictiveness at the Philadelphia Inquirer, said that his fortune “was built up by gang warfare,” and repeated an unsubstantiated rumor that his father had paid $1 million a year in protection money to mob boss Al Capone.3 Annenberg, enraged, accused Graham of using her paper as a political weapon against President Nixon, the man who had restored his family to respectability by taking the risk of nominating him for the ambassadorship. He called Graham to ask for a retraction. She tried to soothe his feelings, but said she never interfered with the editorial page. After his Senate hearing, Annenberg stalked out of a Kay Party in his honor over what he felt were major, and others felt were unintentional, social slights. “Kay was distraught about it. She wanted enormously to get along with Walter. Kay was not looking to have fights with anybody.

And if Walter had a theory, you didn’t argue with it. Walter liked me, but one reason that he liked me was that I never disagreed. If Walter said to me, black was white, I just wouldn’t say anything. “So I became the go-between with Kay.” Annenberg expected Buffett to deliver the message that if he published the book about Phil Graham’s teeth, well, that’s show business. “Meanwhile, he couldn’t have been nicer to me.

- As his relationship with Buffett developed, the proper, traditional Annenberg seemed to take at face value Buffett’s relationship with Graham. He continued to use Buffett, in his role as a Post board member, as emissary to Graham. All the while, Graham was calling Buffett constantly about the smallest details of her personal life. Buffett visited her rambling shingle mansion on Martha’s Vineyard, and they went, on a lark, to Niagara Falls. He took her to see one of his totems, the Berkshire textile mills.

- Graham put it, “eyebrows shot up.”10 Friends observed, as one put it, that the pair had “zero chemistry.” Yet Graham presented their relationship as an affair to her friends.11 She was obviously sexually insecure but tried to project the opposite, as illustrated in her memoir.12 Whatever genuinely romantic elements the relationship with Kay may have had initially, at heart theirs was a friendship. But the publicity upset the delicate equilibrium between Susie and Warren. Whatever else was going on in her life, she still cared very much about her husband. Moreover, Susie needed the people in her life to need her, even to be dependent on her. Now she felt discounted and trivialized. Yet she would never allow herself to look like the spurned Daisy Mae in public. She continued to stay at Kay’s house when she traveled to Washington and smiled benevolently no matter how often her husband was seen with Kay. Some of Susie’s friends believed that she was, in fact, indifferent. Others felt that she needed to be in control or that Warren’s relationship with Kay gave her cover to live her own separate life in peace. Nevertheless, she made it plain to several friends that she was furious and humiliated.

- There was the rub. Being a rich man’s wife opened doors that would have helped her pursue a serious singing career. But it also opened doors that invited others to peer into her personal life, doors that she would prefer remained shut. Warren could stay at Kay Graham’s house and be seen as her date in public in perfect freedom, while the gossip columns did no more than wink. Yet as a married woman, Susie had no such liberty. The women’s movement had changed many things, but not that. With her privacy eroding, the question of how to deal with her increasingly divided feelings was beginning to tear her apart. Stan Lipsey, their Sun publisher friend, was also having some issues with his marriage, and he and Susie sat on park benches in the mornings, sharing confidences. Both of them were interested in Eastern thought and the human-potential movement.27 They somehow convinced Warren, as well as Stan’s wife, Jeannie, and Susie’s sister, Dottie, to join them at a weekend workshop in a Lincoln hotel. The idea was to get in touch with yourself. The workshop started with an exercise to get people to open up to one another nonjudgmentally, a skill of Susie’s. Warren’s reaction to such an outpouring was nothing like his wife’s. ([Location 7838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7838))

And one of them was to start talking, and the other person, no matter what, just keeps saying, ‘And then what?’ “So I paired up with this nice woman from Oklahoma, and she starts talking. Then she pauses and I say, ‘And then what?’ In ten minutes, she’s sobbing uncontrollably. I’ve destroyed her, just by saying, ‘And then what?’ It was like I was boring into her. I felt like I was running a torture chamber or something.” After having misinterpreted this exercise in every possible way, Buffett left his tear-drenched companion, eager to move on. The leader told the participants to find another partner. “Now, when I hear the leader say, ‘I want you to choose a partner of the opposite sex,’ Lipsey says, “I’m looking for someone attractive.” Buffett stood looking around like someone who didn’t quite know what to do. “The next thing you know,” says Lipsey, “he’s paired with this very heavy woman.” “She was wearing a muumuu and weighed about four hundred pounds. My job was to get down on the floor. And then the leader said this woman was to give me the ‘gift of her weight.’ Which meant she flopped ([Location 7848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7848))

- right down on top of me. There was this whale coming right at me. I was just—ack! It turned out to be the gift that never stopped giving. “Meanwhile, in the other room, they were having people bark like dogs. I could hear Dottie—who was so uptight she could hardly say hello to somebody—trying desperately to bark.” Following a session of being blindfolded and led through the streets of Lincoln to experience sensory deprivation, Susie and Stan gave up and they all ran away to a movie theater to watch Annie Hall—“a nervous romance”—and “spent the rest of the weekend gorging ourselves on fried food and ice-cream sundaes,” says Lipsey. The summer of 1977, while Buffett again played bridge marathons at Kay Graham’s apartment in New York, Susie stayed away from home at all hours of the day and night. Howie got married that August to Marcia Sue Duncan, despite her father’s warnings that she would not be happy with a guy who dug basements for a living and drove a pickup with a couple of big shaggy dogs in its cargo bed. Over Labor Day weekend, Susie gave her final performance in Omaha, appearing at the Orpheum Theater as the opening act for singer/songwriter Paul Williams. In a pink chiffon gown, she smiled and beguiled as her smooth contralto oozed romantic jazzy ballads, “languorous and sensual.” She come-hithered the audience with “Let’s feel like we’re in love, okay?”28 But in a small, gossipy city like Omaha, that announcement probably could have been left unmade. That fall, Susie apparently began to realize what a mess her life had become. She went out until four o’clock in the morning, driving all the way to Wahoo—where she had spent her wedding night—playing music at top volume on the radio of her Porsche before returning at dawn to her lonely home.29 At her best Susie gave people part of her soul. Now panicked, she reached out to people and hoped they would… ([Location 7858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7858))

- troubled marriage and the secret yearnings of his disillusioned wife. You can’t tell Warren, she said to one person. If you love him, you won’t hurt him that way. If he ever found out, he would kill himself.30 So powerful was Susie, so beloved, so apparent was Warren’s devotion to his wife, and so thoroughly had Susie trained everyone to think that he was helpless without her, that people accepted this burden. Some did it automatically, some did it out of loyalty, some did it uneasily, half aware of the flaws in her logic. But they all now felt responsible for keeping her secrets on the pretext of Warren’s vulnerability. Yet nothing appeared amiss at Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Arizona, where the Graham Group was meeting that fall. Most of the group—now usually referred to as the Buffett Group—had long ago accepted the idea of “Warren-o” and “Susan-o” as an affectionate couple who lived separate lives. This year proceeded like any other, with Susie in attendance… ([Location 7878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7878))

- protection against inflation—but their value is still eroded by severe inflation, a problem that he referred to as a “giant corporate tapeworm.”32 At a social break, Marshall Weinberg told Warren and Susie about his niece, who was living and working on a reservation with Native Americans. “Oh!” gushed Susie. “I would love to do that! It would be so wonderful to live so simply and help those poor people on a reservation that way.” Warren looked at her. “Sooz, I’ll buy you one,” he said, deadpan.33 At age forty-seven, Warren had already accomplished everything he had ever imagined he could want. He was worth $72 million. He ran a company that was worth $135 million.34 His newspaper had won the two highest prizes in journalism. He was one of the most important men in Omaha and increasingly prominent at a national level. He was serving on the boards of the largest local bank, the Washington Post, and a number of other companies. He had been CEO of three companies and had bought and sold successfully more stocks than most people could name in a lifetime. Most of his original partners were now enormously rich. All he wanted was to keep on making money for the thrill of it without changing anything else about his life. He knew Susie thought he was obsessed with money, just as she always had, yet they had managed to lead their lives in such a way so as to honor their differences while staying a united team for twenty-five years. Or so it seemed to him. Later that fall, after the Buffett Group meeting, Susie went to visit a high school friend who lived in San Francisco. She stayed for four or five weeks. One relationship after another seemed to bind her to California. Her nephew Billy Rogers had moved to the West Coast to join the music scene.

- Spending this extended time in San Francisco, Susie found it a beautiful, creative, spirited city. At every angle from its rising hills, the bay and ocean and bridges and sunsets and rickrack rows of Victorian houses beckoned, Come look at me. A delirious mosaic of people, neighborhoods, architecture, culture, art, and music said, You’ll never be bored in San Francisco. The thermometer never registered 110 degrees in San Francisco. The city’s air raced through your lungs, clean and liberating. In the spontaneous, hot, do-anything-with-anyone mood of the 1970s, San Francisco was the capital of mind-expanding, hedonistic spirituality, a magnet of tolerance where people didn’t judge one another. Susie looked at some apartments. She came back to Omaha and went to the French Café, where she had been singing, and talked to Astrid Menks, who was the maître d’ there on Monday nights as well as a sommelier and sometime chef. She and Menks were friendly; Astrid served her tea between sets at the French Café, and had catered… ([Location 7909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7909))

- cob, and hot-fudge sundaes. Now Susie asked Astrid to look in on Warren and cook an occasional meal for him. Then she had a talk with him and said she wanted to rent a funky little cubbyhole on Nob Hill so she could have a base in San Francisco. Warren’s tendency not to listen, to hear only what he wanted to hear, worked in Susie’s favor as she explained that she was not leaving him. They were not “separating.” They would stay married. Nothing would really change if she had a room of her own, a place where she could be herself in San Francisco. She simply wanted to surround herself with a city full of art and music and theater, she reassured him. Their lives were already on such different courses, and they both traveled so much anyway, he would barely notice the difference. With the children grown, it was time for her to tend to her needs. She told him, over and over, “We both—we both—have needs.” That part was for sure true… ([Location 7919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7919))

- occur to him to leave her. “Wanting a change” and “not totally leaving” were the kind of ambiguous Buffettesque statements they both tended to make to avoid feeling as though they were disappointing anyone. And then she left. Susie went off to Europe for a few weeks with her friend Bella Eisenberg. She returned to Emerald Bay for Christmas with the family but left to go back to Europe again. Increasingly, it was clear that for Susie, having a place of her own in San Francisco did not mean renting a pied-à-terre that she would escape to for a week every now and then. Warren was hopeless at taking care of himself and Susie Jr. came back to Omaha for a couple of weeks to lend a hand. Susie Jr. tried to explain to her father that, given how much time he and her mother had been spending apart, his life was not going to be that different from before. But Warren had not previously thought of himself and Susie as living virtually separate lives. In his… ([Location 7928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7928))

- the phone. Now that he understood, Warren would have done anything she asked to get her back, submitted to any conditions, met any demands—move to California, learn to dance. But it was too late. He could not give her what she wanted, whatever that was. She explained it in terms of her freedom, her need to be separate and to fulfill her needs and find her own identity. She could not do that while spending all her time taking care of him. So he wandered aimlessly around the house, barely able to feed and clothe himself. He came to the office most days with a raging headache. In front of the staff, he maintained his self-control, although he did look as though he was not sleeping well at night. He was calling Susie every day, weeping. “It was as if they couldn’t live together and they couldn’t live without each other,” one person said. Seeing her husband helpless and destroyed, Susie wavered. She told a friend, “I might have to go back.” But she didn’t. They both had needs. One of her needs was for her tennis coach to move to San Francisco. She installed him in a tiny separate apartment down the street from her own. His understanding was that this was temporary and that when Susie got divorced, they would marry.36 While Susie waffled, she made no move to get divorced. “Warren and I don’t want to lose anything,” she told a friend who inquired about her plans. It wasn’t the money she was talking about; she had enough Berkshire stock of her own. Susie was the type of person who never subtracted from but only added to her life, and she didn’t consider acting differently now. Meanwhile, she phoned Astrid Menks at the French Café over and over. “Have you called him yet? Have you called him yet?”37 Susie knew her target well. Born in West Germany in 1946 as Astrid Beaté Menks after her parents walked out of Latvia after the war, Menks had emigrated to the United States at age five with her parents and five siblings on a converted, broken-down battleship. Her first… ([Location 7937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7937))

- operated by Lutheran sisters. Her father, who spoke little English, worked as a maintenance man on the grounds while the children lived at the orphanage. Astrid’s mother died in 1954. When Astrid was thirteen, she was sent to a succession of three foster homes. “I can’t say I had wonderful experiences in foster care,” she says. “I felt more secure at the children’s home.” After high school, Menks attended the University of Nebraska, until she ran out of money. For a while she worked at Mutual of Omaha and as a buyer and manager for a women’s clothing store, although she dressed herself in thrift-store finds. Eventually she wound up working as a garde-manger in restaurants, slicing fifty pounds of zucchini and preparing cold foods. She lived in a little apartment downtown in the Old Market close to work, which was convenient because the rusted-out floor of her Chevy Vega had holes through to the street.38 She was always broke but knew everybody in the perpetually gentrifying warehouse district,… ([Location 7957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7957))

- subtle hard-knocks edge to it. At times she looked even younger than her thirty-one years. She always made light of her life struggles, but when Susie Buffett got to know her, Astrid was depressed, empty, and unfulfilled. Nonetheless, when it came to caretaking people in need,39 she could out-Susie Susie any day. Faced with all this badgering about calling Warren, Menks wasn’t exactly sure what Susie intended, so she was terrified. But finally she made the call.40 Arriving at the door to cook a homemade meal, she found a cave filled with books, newspapers, and annual reports. Warren, who was incapable of functioning without female companionship, was desperate for affection; he had been trying to fill the void by taking Dottie to the movies and spending time with Ruthie Muchemore, a divorcée and family friend. Yet he was obviously still a lonely, miserable man who had been reduced emotionally to an eleven-year-old boy. He needed feeding.

- mistake”: “Parts of it are sort of not understandable. It was definitely ninety-five percent my fault—no question about that. It may even have been ninety-nine percent. I just wasn’t attuned enough to her, and she’d always been perfectly attuned to me. It had always been all in my direction, almost. You know, my job was getting more interesting and more interesting and more interesting as I went along. When Susie left, she felt less needed than I should have made her feel. Your spouse starts coming second. She kept me together for a lot of years, and she contributed ninety percent to raising the kids. Although, strangely enough, I think I had about as much influence. It just wasn’t proportional to the time spent. And then she lost her job, in effect, when the kids were raised. “In a sense, it was time for her to do what she liked to do. She did a lot of volunteer things along the way, but in the end, that never really works that well. She didn’t want to be Mrs. Big the way a lot of wives of prominent guys in town do. She didn’t like being a prominent woman because she’s the wife of a prominent guy. She loves connecting with people, and everybody connects with her. “She loved me, and she still loves me, and we have an incredible relationship. But still … it shouldn’t have happened. And it’s totally my fault.” No matter how huge the wound or its reasons, as each day passed Warren discovered that he was still alive. And so eventually he fell back on the one role that suited him best: the teacher, the preacher. As long as he had his brains and his reputation, people would listen to him. In the winter of 1978, Buffett turned with renewed intensity to writing his annual letter. The previous letter had been a brief report on how the businesses were doing. Now he started drafting lessons on how managements’ performance should be measured, why short-term earnings are a poor criterion for investment decisions, a dissertation on insurance,… ([Location 7977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7977))

- By early 1978, with encouragement from Susie, Astrid Menks was coming to Farnam Street from time to time, cooking and caretaking. Susie was calling Astrid to cheer her on, saying, “Thank you so much for taking care of him.” Gradually, however, the relationship with Menks became something more. At first, he and Astrid spent time at her tiny place down in the old warehouse district. In May she moved in with him. By the time Peter came home from Stanford that summer, she was growing tomatoes in the yard on… ([Location 7999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=7999))

- just happened naturally.”1 Meeting Astrid, Buffett’s friends were taken aback at the match. She was sixteen years younger, a blue-collar girl. Nonetheless, she knew everything that Buffett didn’t about haute cuisine and fine wines, shellfish forks and chef’s knives. In contrast to Susie’s spending habits and preference for all things modern, Astrid haunted junk shops looking for bargain antiques. So parsimonious was Astrid that she made Buffett look like a wastrel. Her interests—cooking, gardening—were narrow compared to Susie’s constantly expanding and evolving tastes. Although modest, Astrid had a blunt-spoken, provocative wit that bore no resemblance to Susie’s sly sense of humor; Astrid’s down-to-earth manner was as unlike Kay Graham’s patrician refinement as could possibly be. Their differences magnified Susie’s shock. This wasn’t what she had had in mind when she stressed to her husband that they both had needs. To her it seemed impossible that Warren could… ([Location 8004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8004))

- cook the meals, answer the telephone, and provide all the companionship he needed. Astrid never told him what to do and asked for nothing in return except to be with him. Susie had fled Omaha partly to escape this endless well of neediness. As she adjusted to the shock, she came to accept the relationship, which did make her new life easier. But she was possessive by nature. No matter how she divided her own attention, she did not want Warren to divide his. And thus it was Susie’s expectations—not Warren’s—that came to define all of their roles. The pieces of Buffett’s life began to come back together into some sort of coherent whole. But he had been shocked into realizing the truth of Susie’s insistence that sitting in a room making money was no way to spend a life; he began to see what he had missed. While he was friendly enough with his kids, he hadn’t really gotten to know them. The reality behind the jokes (“Who is that? That’s your son.”2) meant that he would spend the next few decades trying to repair these relationships. Much of the damage could not be undone. At age forty-seven, he was just beginning to take stock of his losses.3 Warren, who placed a high value on honesty, was perfectly open about living with Astrid. Everybody knew (except Doc Thompson). Both Susie and Astrid remained closemouthed, saying merely that they liked each other. Warren made only one public statement: “If you knew the people involved, you’d see that it suited all of us quite well.” That was true, as far as it went. Oddly, the situation resembled the life of Warren’s idol, Ben Graham. In the mid-1960s, Graham had proposed a novel arrangement to his wife, Estey, in which he would live half the year with his deceased son Newton’s former girlfriend, Marie Louise Amingues, or Malou—ML, as she was called by the family—and half with Estey. But Estey had her limits, and had reached them. Ever since she said no, the Grahams had been separated but they never divorced. Ben felt perfectly friendly… ([Location 8014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8014))

- The imbalance of this particular triangle was multiplied because in fact it involved two triangles—but only one of them knew that. In a state of ignorance, Warren thought of Susie as the one who had been wronged. He tried to square things by placating her in private and showering her with lavish attentiveness in public, which left Astrid exposed and vulnerable. In a similar state of ignorance, Astrid—who practically worshipped Susie—accepted that Warren would never marry her, ceded Susie the turf of all social and business events outside Omaha, and unhappily tolerated being called Buffett’s housekeeper and mistress so that his marriage to Susie would appear as intact as possible. Buffett would come to rationalize this: “Astrid knows where she fits with me. She knows she’s needed. That’s not a bad place to be.” And her role, however narrowly defined, did give Astrid a security that she had always lacked. It had taken a literal change in geography for Susie to maintain her aura of the selfless Mrs. Warren Buffett while simultaneously seeking fulfillment in a life completely outside that role. Yet it was Warren who looked as though he were getting the best of it, even though the new relationship didn’t compensate for his loss. He couldn’t defend ([Location 8035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8035))

- himself against the impression that he had driven his wife to move out through his relationship with Katharine Graham or—when people got the time line wrong—his relationship with Astrid. He wanted desperately to hold the remaining pieces together, and would try for the rest of Susie’s life to make up for what he had done. But of course that didn’t mean he would stop seeing Kay. Buffett invited Graham to Omaha to visit the Strategic Air Command, probably as a pretext to introduce her to Astrid. On meeting an attractive woman like Astrid, Buffett says, “Kay’s first thought would be how to get her out of the room.” Buffett took them to dinner with Stan Lipsey at the Omaha Club. Kay carried on a spirited conversation with Warren; her friend Meg Greenfield, editorial page editor of the Post, who had come along, and Stan occasionally joined in. The conversation left Astrid, who was not the type to put herself forward, entirely on her own. Except for ordering, she sat in silence for the entire meal. Buffett did nothing to help. A couple of dozen people at a huge table nearby carried on with a raucous birthday celebration, then started doing the Chicken Dance. Ever Miss Proper, Graham sat staring with a “priceless” look on her face.6 From then on, Buffett almost always saw Graham outside of Omaha. When she called the house and Astrid answered the phone, Kay had nothing to say.7 She handled the situation mostly by acting as if she believed that Astrid didn’t exist. Susie and Astrid were on a wholly different footing; Astrid even went to San Francisco to visit Susie. Susie was grateful to Astrid for making her life easier, as long as Astrid accepted the limited public role that Susie had defined for her. Moving to San Francisco had been difficult enough because she had had to leave behind so many friends and causes she cared about. Her departure had left shock waves in its wake. Local civic organizations regrouped, but felt a huge hole had been ripped from their center. Her friends and her hangers-on had coped in varying ways. A few felt abandoned, others simply missed her. Some began going back and forth to San Francisco, considering it a sort of second home. A couple of them even followed her to San Francisco and relocated there.8 To many of the Buffetts’ friends, the explanation that Susie needed to live in San Francisco because it offered her a richer palette that she couldn’t find in Omaha conveyed a vague impression of time spent visiting art galleries, jazz clubs, and the symphony.

- But by the late 1970s, San Francisco was not the Paris of America. A wave of returning war veterans had washed up on the Bay Area’s shores, many of them injured physically, mentally, and spiritually. Those still drawn to San Francisco for its hedonism stepped through a growing mass of homeless on the streets. The gays had burst from the closet earlier in the decade, making San Francisco the de facto capital for an era of gay-bashing. Among the first of Susie’s new friends were a gay couple. She added others—musicians, artists, people she met in stores, at church, while getting her nails done, at the theater. She soon had a large circle, many if not most of whom were gay men. The rebel in Susie blossomed and the former hostess of charity luncheons now threw parties that felt like being backstage at a rock concert. But, true to form, she also took up a cause, once again defying convention. As she worked the soup kitchen lines, she became the accepting mother that many of her gay friends had never… ([Location 8064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8064))

- apartment. But she told a friend that she couldn’t do it. “It would ruin everything,” she said. Warren was equally clear: “I don’t want you selling Berkshire shares.” He still covered all her expenses. Gladys monitored her spending and paid all her bills. Similarly, it was Warren whom Susie got to lend her friend Charles Washington $24,900. He was an Omaha activist whom she had championed through thick and thin. Buffett thought the loan was a terrible idea, and probably wouldn’t have agreed to it were he not now so eager to please his wife. Sure enough, seven months later, Washington missed a couple of payments. Rarely did anything pierce Buffett’s pleasant demeanor, but if he felt someone was trying to cheat him out of money, his eyes would flash pain and rage and revenge all at once. Within seconds, the emotion would subside while he considered a businesslike response. This time, he promptly filed suit against Washington and won a judgment of $24,450.… ([Location 8073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8073))

- budget. When the children had needs, she took care of expenses that Warren wouldn’t. Howie had sold some of his Berkshire stock to build a tree house for him and Marcia to live in. They were struggling with their finances as well as their marriage. “It’s just terrible that Warren won’t pay for it,” Susie grumbled. “He was going to let the ceiling fall in. He was going to let them lose the house.” But this was part of their game: Warren knew that Susie would take care of it for them, as she had taken care of Little Sooz when she was unhappy in her marriage, as she always took care of everything. Everything, that is, except the money. Making that was Warren’s job, and all these changes and complexities and mounting bills had come at a time when the family fortunes were declining. Just as Susie was leaving for San Francisco, Warren had been dragged into court in Buffalo, New York, for a costly battle between two newspapers. Normally he was competitive enough to roll up his sleeves and relish something like this. But now,… ([Location 8083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8083))

In the spring of 1977, he and Munger had finally bought the daily newspaper for which they had been searching these many years. At $35.5 million this was their biggest purchase ever.9 Rusting, icebound Buffalo wasn’t the growing one-newspaper town of their dreams, but it was still a good place to own a newspaper. Buffalo’s citizens left for their factory jobs before dawn and read the paper in the evenings. The Buffalo Evening News dominated its nearest competitor, the Courier-Express, which was weak financially. Buffett had developed a well-founded theory of competition in the newspaper industry. “Kay was always saying how competition made them better and all that stuff. I said, ‘Lookit. The economics in the business is inevitably leading… ([Location 8092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8092))

- The Courier-Express’s lawyer, Furth, accused Buffett of having discussed whether the News would put the Courier-Express out of business, which Buffett denied. Furth approached the witness stand waving a copy of a recent, glowing Wall Street Journal profile of Buffett. His growing fame was about to be used against him as a weapon for the first time.17 Buffett had told the reporter how glad he was to be out of money management, his ego no longer on the line. But, in fact, with his newly heightened profile, his ego was now more on the line than ever before. In this story, his friend Sandy Gottesman had been quoted by the reporter as saying, “Warren likens owning a monopoly or market-dominant newspaper to owning an unregulated toll bridge. You have relative freedom to increase rates when and as much as you want.”18 Had he said this? Furth demanded in court. No, well, Buffett responded, “whether it is like a toll bridge I don’t remember, but it is a great business. It may be better than a toll bridge in Fremont, Nebraska. I know a lot of honest people, but when they start giving quotes they don’t necessarily get them—” Furth bore down. Did he believe it or not? “I won’t quarrel with that characterization.… I would like to own one.… I have said in an inflationary world that a toll bridge would be a great thing to own if it was unregulated.” “Why?” asked Furth. Buffett looked at the judge, to whom he was trying to teach economics. “Because you have laid out the capital costs. You build the bridge in old dollars, and when there is inflation, you don’t have to keep replacing it—a bridge you build only once.” “And you used the term ‘unregulated’ so that you can raise prices; is that right?” “That is true.”19 Buffett now hung twisting in a net of his own weaving. A toll bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge over the Missouri River, was, in fact, a prominent feature of his youth.20 During Buffett’s childhood, Omaha had been torn for more than a decade over how to liberate the only route to Iowa from the toll-taker’s grasp. He and Munger later tried to buy the Detroit International Bridge Company, which owned the bridge that connected Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, but wound up with only twenty-four percent of the company.21 “It was one hell of a bridge. A thousand square feet, and it made more money … I was terribly disappointed when we didn’t get it.

- how well off we were that we didn’t get it. Because, he said, what could be worse for your image than a guy who raised the prices on a toll bridge?” Indeed. “The judge didn’t like me. For one reason or another, he just didn’t like me. He didn’t like our lawyers either. Most people like Ron Olson, but the judge did not like Ron.” Judge Brieant’s ruling on a preliminary injunction, which was issued in November 1977, said that the Evening News was perfectly within its rights to start a Sunday paper and it was in the public interest that it should do so. But Brieant, apparently taken with Furth’s exploitation of the toll-bridge theme, took off with it on a flight to the land of metaphor, lamenting that the “readers and advertisers of Greater Buffalo [might] conclude that they can get along with only one newspaper as their unregulated toll bridge to the events of the outside world.”22 He deemed the News’s plan predatory and hamstrung its ability to promote the new edition. The Courier-Express fired a prepared publishing barrage crowing about its victory over an out-of-town bully that was trying to drive a small-fry local business into the ground. The Evening News could say nothing in response. ([Location 8158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8158))

- “Now we were going to lose or win, and we had a judge who didn’t like us, and we were operating with our hands tied and under threat of contempt.” Five weeks later, advertisers had rallied behind the Courier-Express, and the new Sunday edition of the News could boast of only a quarter of the Courier-Express’s ad lineage.23 The Evening News swung from a modest profit to a whopping $1.4 million loss.24 Buffett was chilled by the news. No business he had ever owned had lost so much money so fast. On a miserable, rain-driven day the week before Christmas 1977, Judge Brieant called the court into session for the beginning of a trial that would determine the terms of a final injunction. Buffett had spent the latter part of the fall sleepless and in tears, trying to digest what it meant that Susie was gone and yet not really leaving him. His idea of a distraction from his personal woes had been to cling like a junebug to Carol Loomis, Astrid, and Kay Graham in turn as he flew back and forth between New York, Omaha, and Washington. Certainly he had not wanted a distraction like this. The trial went into recess as he flew to Emerald Bay for the annual holiday family gathering, the first under the new arrangement with Susie, during which she would continue to reassure him that their lives would go on much as before. As soon as the Buffetts’ New Year’s Day party was over, Warren and Susie went their separate ways, Judge Brieant reconvened the litigants, and Olson and Munger began calling Buffett with updates on the trial as he returned to work in Omaha. Judge Brieant’s final opinion, issued in July 1978, a masterpiece of judicial unrestraint carrying the subtitle “Mr. Buffett Comes to Buffalo,” kept in place restrictions against the Evening News. Munger and Olson planned to appeal. Characteristically, Buffett did not want to lengthen the fight with the judge. Munger had always kidded Buffett that his management technique was to take out all the cash from a company and raise prices. If that failed, Buffett didn’t have any more arrows in his quiver. This technique wouldn’t solve the problems of the Evening News. Buffett was so beaten down and wanted so badly not to get into a confrontation with the judge that he was willing to let $35.5 million go down the drain.

- take so damned long, it would irritate the judge, and that we had more to lose by irritating him as he enforced this injunction and as the Courier came up with all these furious attacks, and he could just keep extending it. I declared, We’re not going to appeal because in a year or year and a half we’ll be dead anyway. And Ron and Charlie told me I was wrong, and I was wrong.” In the end, he decided to go along with them. “We had to appeal. I wasn’t going to give in to a set of conditions which were going to make us noncompetitive. So basically I had no choice. We don’t bluff. It’s not my style anyway. Over a lifetime, you’ll get a reputation for either bluffing or not bluffing. And therefore, I want it to be understood that I don’t do it.” The Buffalo Evening News was Buffett’s single largest investment, and by a wide margin. It was tying up a third of Blue Chip’s capital, losing money under Judge Brieant’s restrictions, and vulnerable to any strike that would weaken it further at a time when the stock market was falling and Buffett needed it to produce cash to buy stocks at the bargain-basement prices he always favored. The potential failure of the Buffalo Evening News risked more than setting him and Munger back their $35 million; for the man who begrudged spending $31,500 on a house because that money could ultimately turn into a million, the lost compounding potential of their investment in the newspaper made the situation much graver than it appeared superficially. So Buffett not only decided to appeal the decision, but he Tom-Sawyered Stan Lipsey, who was thinking of moving to San Francisco, into trying to turn the paper around. “What would you think about going up to Buffalo?” Buffett asked. “My heart sank,” Lipsey says, “but I couldn’t turn Warren down on anything.”25 Lipsey started spending one week a month in Buffalo. On one of his weeks in Omaha, he joined Warren and Astrid to take the temperature of Buffett’s current life. Warren was clearly relaxed in his new relationship. He let Astrid take them all to a drag show.26 By 1979, Lipsey had straightened out the paper’s management, and victory was approaching in the battle of the legal briefs with the Courier-Express. In April 1979, nearly a year and a half after Brieant’s preliminary injunction, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously reversed him, saying his opinion was “infected with legal and factual error.… Courts must be on guard against efforts of plaintiffs to use the antitrust laws to insulate themselves from the impact of competition.”27 But the reversal of Judge Brieant’s order was a victory that came almost too late. The Courier-Express immediately appealed the ruling, seeking to reinstate the injunction. The News’s lawyers wearily took up their swords to continue the ludicrous fight. The battle had cost so much in legal fees and lost advertising line age while the News operated under all the judge’s restrictions for the better part of two years that it was losing… ([Location 8188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8188))

- BusinessWeek declared “The Death of Equities,” as if no one would ever buy stocks again. Investors piled into gold, diamonds, platinum, art, real estate, rare coins, mining stocks, feedlot cattle, and oil; “cash is trash” was the watchword of the day. In Forbes, Buffett wrote that it was time for investors to buy stocks. “The future is never clear,” he wrote; “you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. Uncertainty actually is the friend of the buyer of long-term values.”29 He was the buyer of long-term values—except that he had no cash. Periodically, cash had showered on Buffett since the beginning of the decade—$16 million from distributing the partnership assets, then millions more from the sale of Data Documents stock, a private investment. But he had poured it all into Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett had always paid himself only $50,000 a year, a number that he now raised to a still-modest $100,000. He borrowed some money from banks and started to invest again. And finally, Stan Lipsey made the move Warren had been hoping for. One day in 1980 Lipsey showed up at Warren’s unlocked back door in Omaha to say that his wife, Jeannie, wanted a divorce and that her lawyer was, from Stan’s perspective, raising hell. Buffett reminded Lipsey of something Tom Murphy had taught him. “You can always tell them to go to hell tomorrow, Stan,” he said. He invited the sparring lawyers to his office and helped mediate the end of a marriage between his friends—the second time he had done so. Not long before, Buffett had brokered peace between his friend Ed Anderson and his wife, Shirley Smith Anderson, an old friend of Warren and Susie’s. He was experienced at easing his friends through difficult transitions. He began talking to Lipsey about the need to make changes in his life. Maybe it’s time, Stan thought. As the conversation progressed, Buffett helped Lipsey talk himself into moving to Buffalo. “It was typical Warren.

For several years he had stoically tolerated growing cataracts, until they reached the point at which his eyesight was seriously impaired. When he had cataract surgery on his left eye, it resulted in an extremely rare complication called an epithelial downgrowth: A specialized type of primary body tissue from outside the eye (probably corneal cells) got inside his eye and started growing like a cancer. The pressure and destruction of the optic nerve caused severe, disabling pain.31 When he could no longer tolerate the agony of his slowly exploding eye, Munger arranged to have it eviscerated and replaced with a glass eye. But afterward, “I was like a wounded animal for several days.”32 He could not stand up to be bathed by the nurses because he was so nauseated from the pain. He told Buffett that he wanted to die.

- News’s drivers’ union—perhaps emboldened after three years with new management running the place under duress—demanded overtime for work not performed. Then in December 1980, the Teamsters, figuring that Buffett couldn’t take a strike while the battle with the Courier-Express dragged on, walked out at six a.m. after an all-night mediation attempt failed. Working with other unions, who crossed the picket line, Lipsey, Henry Urban, and Murray Light worked feverishly to get out the evening paper. Then, at the last minute, the pressmen walked off the job, pulling the page plates off the presses as they went. Buffett figured he was sunk. From his background in newspaper circulation, he knew that, even more than the pressmen, the tiny drivers’ union—all of thirty-eight employees—had the power to shut the paper down. Other unions and volunteers could run the presses, but without the drivers to distribute the newspapers, the paper was dead.

Within forty-eight hours, the Evening News was back on the streets. By then, the News, though still trailing on Sundays, had gained some ground and was crawling toward the lead while maintaining its weekday advantage.35 By the end of 1981, Lipsey and Buffett had cut the losses to $1.5 million a year, half of what the Courier-Express was suffering.36 In a war of “survival of the fattest,” it was almost certain to win—albeit at a staggering price. The Courier-Express had never given up the lawsuit trying to reinstate Judge Brieant’s injunction, but its owners saw another judge, the judge of the marketplace, heading with the blue ribbon toward the Buffalo Evening News.

Somebody asked about profit sharing. “There is nothing that anybody on the third floor”—where the newsroom sat—“can do that affects profits,” Buffett said. Capital took the risk and reaped the rewards. He and Munger had staked $35 million on a series of decisions. They might have lost every dime; to them went all the profits that followed. The workers got a paycheck for the time and effort they put in—no more, no less. A deal’s a deal. But after everything they had all been through, the staff was stunned at his lack of empathy. As Buffett and Munger left the office, Munger walked past publisher Henry Urban, who was “waiting for at least a small accolade,” said Ron Olson. Munger was famous for getting into cabs while people were talking to him as if he did not hear them and for disappearing through doors the second he finished talking without waiting for a response. Nonetheless Urban stood open-mouthed. Buffett followed along right after Munger without looking at anyone. Nobody said thanks. Olson, following in their wake, moved around the room shaking hands in an effort to make up for it.37 A year later, with higher ad rates and soaring… ([Location 8271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8271))

- Those who tested Rickershauser’s Law of Thermodynamics found that the sun was indeed nice and warm, but Buffett was so focused and his mind worked at such speed that extended conversations with him left them sunburned. “My mind was so tired,” said one friend. “I had to recuperate from seeing him,” said another. “It was like being pounded on the head all day long,” said a onetime employee. Buffett had the energy and enthusiasm of a restless teenager; he seemed to remember every fact and figure he had ever read; he finagled people into volunteering for tough jobs, then assumed they could accomplish miracles; and while remarkably tolerant of others’ quirks and flaws, he was less so of quirks and flaws that cost him money. So eager for results was he, so confident of others’ skills, so unaware of how far short of his own they fell, that he chronically underestimated people’s workloads. Buffett, the sun around whom everyone revolved, was oblivious to the effects of Rickershauser’s Law himself. “People tell me I put pressure on them. I never intend to. Some people like to apply pressure. I never do. It’s actually the last thing I like to do. I don’t think I’m ever doing it, but I’ve had enough people tell me that I do it that it must be true.” The managers out in the hinterlands who ran the businesses that Berkshire and Blue Chip owned were lucky because Buffett largely left them alone, his trick of management being to find obsessed perfectionists like himself who worked incessantly; ([Location 8311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8311))

- Buffett made Munger, who now owned two percent of Berkshire, the company’s vice chairman. Munger also now took over as president and chairman of Wesco, a wee thing compared to the now-swollen Berkshire, but Munger’s own. It dangled like a tiny strand of spaghetti from the corner of Berkshire Hathaway’s mouth, the only morsel that Buffett had yet failed to swallow. Wesco’s shareholders eventually figured out that he would get to it someday, and inevitably they began to value Wesco’s stock at a forbidding price. Munger’s influence on Buffett’s thinking had always far outweighed his financial clout. The main difference between their behavior in business was that Munger on occasion would veto deals that the more easily enraptured Buffett might have struck.

- Their attitude toward their shareholders was identical. With the merger done, in the 1983 annual report the two men spelled out to Berkshire’s shareholders a set of principles from which they would operate. They called them the “owner-oriented principles.” No other management told its company’s owners these things. “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership,” they wrote. “We do not view the company as the ultimate owner of our business assets, but, instead, view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets.”7 This statement—deceptively simple—amounted to a throwback to a former generation of corporate governance. The modern-day corporate chief viewed the shareholders as a nuisance, a group to be either appeased or ignored. We don’t play accounting games, Buffett and Munger said. We don’t like a lot of debt. We run the business to achieve the best long-term results. All of these sounded like simple truisms—except that so few managements could honestly make all of these statements. Incidentally, Buffett also wrote that year, “[r]egardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns, and are ([Location 8343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8343))

We made half the men’s suit linings in the country, but nobody ever went to a tailor and said, ‘I’d like a pin-striped gray suit with a Hathaway lining.’ A square yard of cloth that came out of our mill cost more than a square yard from somewhere else, and capitalism’s frugal that way.” And yet he clung to the beleaguered mills. Thus, it had been even harder, like having a root canal without novocaine, for him to sell one of the company’s most profitable businesses, the Rockford Bank. But he had had to do it; the Bank Holding Company Act required it in order for Berkshire to carry on its nonbanking interests (especially in insurance).9 Even so, he still carried money with Gene Abegg’s picture on it in his wallet… ([Location 8353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8353))

Charlie and I loved him so much we didn’t want to face it.” “Lou Vincenti was decisive, he was intelligent, and he was honest and shrewd,” says Munger. “He was cranky and independent and a very good human being.

He handed the kids their Berkshire stock without stressing how important it might be to them someday, explaining compounding, or mentioning that they could borrow against the stock without selling it. By now, his shareholder letters, polished to a fine sheen by Carol Loomis, had tackled most financial subjects, and he undoubtedly thought that these, along with the example of his life, served as adequate lessons for his children. Buffett did care very much about what they did with their stock, however, because he and Berkshire were as one. To sell the stock was to sell him too.

- Easy Street because of Berkshire Hathaway. Rather, he thought the future of his children and the future of Berkshire Hathaway would ultimately be joined not through ownership of the company, but by an act of philanthropy—their stewardship of the stock in the Buffett Foundation. Buffett expressed his feelings on the subject of inheritance and philanthropy through a tribute he wrote in the Omaha World-Herald upon the death of Peter Kiewit, a near-mythical figure in Omaha. Kiewit’s company, Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc., was reportedly the most profitable construction company in the world.19 Buffett and Kiewit never had business dealings, but Kiewit owned the Omaha World-Herald and Buffett sat on its board. The childless, workaholic Kiewit had lived in a penthouse apartment in Kiewit Plaza, where Berkshire was headquartered, and he commuted to work by elevator. Buffett envied him this arrangement.20 Kiewit was another Buffett prototype, a hard taskmaster and penny-pincher in the office who instilled his values through pithy little sayings. The company was his labor of love, and he was often “pleased, but never satisfied.” “A reputation is like fine china,” he said, “expensive to acquire, and easily broken.” In making ethical decisions, therefore, “If you’re not sure if something is right or wrong, consider whether you’d want it reported in the morning paper.”21 Also like Buffett, Kiewit was obsessed with managing other people’s weight. In many ways, Peter Kiewit exemplified Warren Buffett’s ideas about how a life should be lived. When Kiewit died, Buffett’s tribute not only honored the man, it expressed—as much as anything that Buffett ever wrote—how he would like to be remembered himself.22 “Starting from scratch,” he wrote, Kiewit “built one of the great construction companies of the world.… Although not the largest, it may well be the most profitable business of its type in the country, an achievement possible only because Kiewit was able to transmit, throughout an organization of thousands of employees, an unremitting insistence on excellence and efficiency. “Kiewit was overwhelmingly a producer, not a consumer,” he went on. “Profits went to build the capacity of the organization, not to provide opulence to the owner. “In essence, one who spends less than he earns is accumulating ‘claim checks’ for future use. At some later date he may reverse the procedure and consume more than he earns by cashing some of the ([Location 8432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8432))

- accumulated claim checks. Or he may pass them on to others—either during his lifetime by gifts, or upon his death by bequest.” William Randolph Hearst, Buffett wrote, used up many of his claim checks by building and maintaining his castle in San Simeon. He arranged to have ice hauled daily to the bears in his private zoo, much the way pharaohs used their claim checks to build the pyramids. Buffett had meditated on the economics of the pyramids. If he hired a thousand people to build a pyramid dedicated to himself, he says: “It would all go into the economy. Every dime. And a lot of forms of giving and spending are just a form of that. It’s crazy, and it’s probably somewhat morally wrong too. But there are people who would think it’s great that you’re giving employment to the people who are tugging the slabs for the pyramid. And they’re making a mistake. It isn’t productive. They’re thinking in terms of input, not output. “If you want to build pyramids to yourself, and take a lot of resources out… ([Location 8454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8454))

- the claim checks passed them along to their heirs, enabling hundreds of descendants to “consume far more than they personally have produced; in effect, their whole lifetimes have been spent at the withdrawal window of the bank of societal resources.” Buffett found the results ironic. “I love it,” he says, “when I’m around the country club, and I hear people talk about the debilitating aspects of a welfare cycle, where some woman had a child at seventeen, and she gets food stamps, and we’re perpetuating a cycle of dependency. And these same people are leaving their kids a lifetime supply of food stamps and beyond. But instead of having a welfare officer, they have a trust fund officer. And instead of having food stamps, they have stocks and bonds that pay dividends.”… ([Location 8463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8463))

- As his wealth grew, Buffett’s often articulated and unwavering determination to keep making money at a furious rate while withholding it from his family and his foundation finally sparked a rebellion among his friends. Rick Guerin had written to Joe Rosenfield about the possibility of Buffett becoming the world’s richest man: “What will Warren do when he becomes No. 1 sled dog and sees that there’s more to the world than hair and a small target? (He thinks it’s a bull’s-eye, but we know better.)”25 When the Buffett Group met in Lyford Cay, Bahamas, between the snorkeling and deep-sea fishing George Gillespie sparked a hot debate by organizing a talk on “The Children (and Charity) Will Have to Wait.” Years earlier Buffett had said he gave his kids a few thousand dollars for Christmas each year and told them to expect half a million dollars when he died.26 That, he thought, was “enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.”27 This phrase would become one of his mantras, repeated ([Location 8494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8494))

- over the years. “Warren, that’s wrong,” said Larry Tisch, one of his former partners. “If they aren’t spoiled by age twelve, they won’t be spoiled.”28 Kay Graham, tears streaming down her face, asked, Don’t you love your children, Warren? Prompted by Carol Loomis, Fortune took up the issue in a cover story: “Should You Leave It All to the Children?” Family comes first, many people said. “My kids are going to carve out their own place in the world and they know that I’m for them, whatever they want to do,” Buffett said. But “just because they came out of the right womb,” setting them up with a trust fund—which he considered “a lifetime supply of food stamps”—could be “harmful” and an “antisocial act.”29 Nevertheless, Buffett had made a decision that demonstrated newfound—if slight—flexibility. In 1981, he set up an innovative program in which Berkshire Hathaway would contribute $2 per share to a charity of the shareholder’s choice. Berkshire did not pay a dividend, but this program allowed the shareholders to direct how the company spent its charitable dollars rather than letting top management donate to its pet causes. The program was minuscule, but for Buffett to do it at all was a loosening of the fist. And the shareholders loved it.

- The participation rate was always close to one hundred percent. To Buffett, the collector of information, the contributions program also turned out to be a tiny gold mine. It gave him an insight into the philanthropic interests of each shareholder, which he could never have gotten any other way. Collecting this information had no purpose whatsoever—even less than collecting nuns’ fingerprints. Buffett, however, was insatiably curious and had a deep interest in knowing about his shareholders as individuals, as if they were part of an extended family, which was how he thought of them. At fifty-three, Buffett—who had already “retired” twice—was thinking through issues of philanthropy and inheritance. The subject that visibly unnerved him was retirement. He joked about working after he was dead and made a point of highlighting elderly managers like Gene Abegg and Ben Rosner.

She hid under a train seat for three hundred miles to save her money, until she reached the closest town, Gomel. There she knocked on twenty-six doors until the owner of a dry-goods store responded to her proposition. “I’m not a beggar,” the four-foot-ten-inch girl said. “I’ve got four cents in my pocket. Let me sleep in your house and I’ll show you how good I am.” The next morning, “I waited on customer. I rolled out the material and I added it up before anybody picked up a pencil.

She rode through Manchuria to Tientsin, China, on another train. By then Rose had journeyed over nine thousand miles across almost the entire continent of Asia.5 From Tientsin she took a boat to Yokohama, Japan. There she found the Ava Maru, a cargo boat carrying peanuts. As the Ava Maru crossed the Pacific on its way to Seattle, she was so sick for most of the six-week journey that she couldn’t eat.6 Landing in Seattle after almost three months of travel with a face swollen from illness, Rose was met at the dock by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.

Sending fifty dollars at a time back to Russia, she brought ten of her relatives to America. Unlike her husband, she still didn’t speak much English. “I was too dumb,” she said. “They couldn’t drill it in me with a nail. The kids teached me. When my Frances started kindergarten, she says, ‘I’ll show you what an apple is, what a tablecloth, what a knife.’ “9 But the store struggled and almost did go broke during the Depression. Then Rose took charge. I know what to do, undersell the big shots, she told her husband. “You buy an item for three dollars and sell it for $3.30. Ten percent over cost!” When the old-fashioned suits they carried weren’t selling, Rose handed out ten thousand circulars all over Omaha, offering to outfit a man for five dollars—underwear, suit, tie, shoes, and straw hat. They took in $800 in a single day, more than they had made the entire year before.10 The store branched into jewelry, fur coats, and furniture. Rose drove the department stores crazy when she started underselling them on new fur coats on consignment.11 But she had a philosophy: “It’s better to have them hate you than to feel sorry for you.” Soon customers started asking her for more furniture. She saw that, unlike pawnbroking, selling furniture was a “happy business,” so in 1937 she borrowed $500 from a brother to open a store called Blumkin’s in a basement near her husband’s pawnshop. But the furniture wholesalers didn’t want her as a customer, because their dealers complained that she was underselling them. So Rose went to Chicago, found one sympathetic man, and ordered $2,000 worth of merchandise from him on thirty days’ credit. The time came due and she was short, so she sold her own house furnishings cheap to pay off the debt. “When my kids came home, they cried like somebody will die,” she recalled. “Why I took away the beds and the refrigerator? The whole house, an empty house? I told them, they were so nice to me I can’t stand it not to keep my promise.”12 That night she took a couple of mattresses from the store for the family to sleep on. “The next day I brought in a refrigerator and stove,” she said, “and… ([Location 8553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8553))

But selling carpet wasn’t enough; Rose still couldn’t pay her suppliers. Finally an Omaha banker loaned her $50,000 for ninety days; Rose couldn’t sleep worrying about how she was going to pay it back. She hit upon the idea of renting the Omaha City Auditorium and cramming it with sofas and dinettes and coffee tables and TV sets. Master merchandisers, she and Louie took out an ad in the paper that played on wartime scarcity. This is It! The Sale of Sales! … We can’t eat ’em! We must sell ’em! We’ve been shipped so much merchandise this past 60 days, we have no warehouse room.20 The Furniture Mart sold a quarter of a million dollars’ worth of furniture in three days.

- Omaha. People came into the store at every stage of their lives: when they got married, when they bought their first house, when they had a baby. A tornado tore the roof off their huge new West Side suburban store in 1975, and she and Louie moved everything to their remaining downtown store without hesitation. “If you have the lowest price, they will find you at the bottom of a river,” she said. They did. When a fire burned down the store, she gave the firefighters free TV sets.22 “Everything Mrs. B knew how to do, she would do fast. She didn’t hesitate and there was no second-guessing. She’d buy five thousand tables or sign a thirty-year lease or buy real estate or hire people. There was no looking back. She just swung. You got about two inches outside the perimeter of her circle of competence, she didn’t even want to talk to you about it. She knew exactly what she was good at, and she had no desire to kid herself about those things.” By the early 1980s, Rose and Louie Blumkin had built the largest furniture store in North… ([Location 8609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8609))

- and tried to compete with the Mart. Rose and Louie created discount campaigns that broke them financially and drove them away. Customers began to arrive from Iowa, Kansas, and the Dakotas. Rose became known as Mrs. B, even to her family. She awoke at five a.m., ate only fruits and vegetables, and never touched liquor. A few gray hairs appeared around the edges of her lacquered black bun, but it stayed firmly in place as she raced around the store with the energy of a young woman. As her bargaining position grew stronger, she brooked no sympathy for her suppliers. “Seven dollars? We go bankruptcy tomorrow should we pay that,” she sniffed at one’s demand.24 The wholesalers who had formerly snubbed her now kneeled at her feet. She loved it. “If you want to sell her twenty-three hundred end tables, she will know in a minute what she can pay, how fast she can move them … and she’ll buy them from you.

- the furniture “just as you would find in the store” because “it’s the only way we could be sure she would be comfortable.”26 The lamp shades remained covered in plastic. Price tags dangled from some of the furniture. “I only use the kitchen and bedroom,” said Mrs. B. “I can’t wait until it gets daylight, so I can get back to the business.” On Sunday afternoons—her only time off—she drove around town with Louie. “I go shop the windows,” she said. “I plan an attack on the shopkeepers, thinking, ‘How much hell can I give them?’ ”27 All her work, she said, was inspired by her “diamond mother,” who had run a grocery in Russia. She never forgot waking in the night to find her mother doing laundry and baking bread at three a.m. And so, Rose’s soft spot was refugees and immigrants. She sometimes put them to work in the bookkeeping department, telling them, “You don’t need English to count.”28 In 1982, the Omaha World-Herald interviewed her. She said that over the years the family had rejected several offers to buy her company. “Who could afford to buy a store this big?” One of the offers was Berkshire’s. She’d told Buffett: “You’ll try to steal it.”29 In 1983, Buffett heard that the Blumkins were negotiating with a company in Hamburg, Germany, that operated the largest furniture store in the world. The Blumkins were selling! Maybe this time they were serious. Twenty-some-odd years before, on yet another occasion, Rose had summoned Buffett to her store downtown, indicating that she was thinking of selling. He really wanted to buy the Furniture Mart for Berkshire. He had walked in to find a short, squat woman lecturing a group of men lined up against the wall: her grandsons and sons-in-law and nephews. She turned to Buffett. “ ‘See all these guys next to me?’ she said. ‘If I sell it to you, you can fire them. These people are a bunch of bums, and they are all related to me and I can’t fire them. But you can fire them. They’re bums, bums, bums.’ “She went on like this for an hour, literally. The word ‘bums’ recurred many, many times. She thought the only one who was worth anything was Louie, and he was perfect.” The other relatives, long used to Rose, stood, impassive. “Then she dismissed me. I had served my purpose.”30 If the Blumkins had talked themselves into selling, now was the time. Mrs. B had had two knee replacements, ceding most of the day-to-day… ([Location 8630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8630))

- subsequently behave in that manner. We will behave exactly as promised, both because we have so promised, and because we need to.” Buffett explained that he wanted the Blumkins to stay on as partners. He told Louie that he would get involved in only two things: capital allocation and selecting and compensating the “top man.” Buffett had something else to offer. He was not German. The German company had offered well over $90 million, but to Mrs. B, selling to a German company was anathema. The Blumkins agreed to sell the company to Berkshire. To seal the deal, Buffett drove out to the Mart. There he found the eighty-nine-year-old Rose gunning the motor of her three-wheeled golf cart and racing around the store, roaring at her employees, “You’re all good for nothing! I wouldn’t give a nickel for all of you!” while Louie and her three sons-in-law looked on.32 “I don’t even want to take inventory,” said Buffett. “I’ll take your word, Mrs. B, whatever you say you got… ([Location 8663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8663))

- and knew that they’d get far more money from the Germans. “And she snarled at them, Just tell me how much more you think you’re going to get and I’ll give it to you. She wanted to divide up the money and get them out of there so it would be Louie’s company. And then she said the price was fifty-five million dollars for ninety percent of the company.” She wanted cash. “She really liked and trusted me. She would make up her mind about people and that was that.” Buffett knew she made decisions about everything once and for all and in the blink of an eye, so he wasn’t taking much risk when, after she signed, “I said, ‘If you change your mind on this it’s okay with me.’ I would never say that to any other seller in the world, but I just felt that this was just such a part of her, if there was any reason she decided she didn’t want to do it after—I didn’t want her to feel bound. And she said, ‘I don’t change my mind.’ “After the deal was done, I said, ‘Mrs. B, I’ve got to tell you something. It’s my birthday today.’ ” Buffett was fifty-three… ([Location 8674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8674))

- and she gave us her word,” he said.33 Her word was as good as “the Bank of England.” To announce the deal, he held a press conference and showed a video on the company’s history. Mrs. B dabbed at her eyes as the film was shown.34 Buffett had not only found another unusual specimen to add to his collection of interesting personalities. Something about Mrs. B’s indomitable will, history of hardship, and strength of character inspired awe in him.35 “Dear Mrs. B,” he wrote to her. “I have promised Louie and his boys that all members of the family are going to feel good about this transaction five, ten, and twenty years from now. I make you the same promise.”36 Buffett had promised more than that. Mrs. B was used to operating in total control and privacy; she did not want Buffett to throw her financial dress up in the air and show her knickers to the world. He agreed that the accounts of the Mart would not be separately reported when Berkshire Hathaway filed its financial statements with the SEC, as of course was legally required. Buffett had no worries about getting a waiver from the SEC—or rather getting one of his employees to get the waiver. He was a likable boss who never lost his temper, never changed his mind capriciously, never said a rude word to anyone, never berated or criticized his employees, didn’t second-guess people on their work, and let them do their jobs without interference. He also operated on the assumption that if somebody was smart, they could do anything. Charlie Munger said of him, “Warren doesn’t have stress, he causes it.” Dale Carnegie said to give people a fine reputation to live up to, and Buffett had learned that lesson well. He knew how to Carnegize heroic accomplishments out of his people. The gist of what he told his employees was something like: “You’re so good, this won’t take you any time at all, and it won’t cost anything to do. And, of course, you’ll have it back to me in the next mail. Because you’re just so damn great at what… ([Location 8685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8685))

- Buffett, meanwhile, had the happy job of diving into a new business and a new collection of people. He grew fond of Louie and “the boys”; he started driving out to 72nd Street at eight-thirty in the evening when the store closed to go out to dinner with them, talking for hours about furniture and merchandising. Buffett’s affection and admiration for Rose Blumkin ran deep.39 He had plans for her and enlisted Buffett Group member Larry Tisch in his behind-the-scenes machinations. In a virtuoso display of gratitude and showmanship, he had decided to turn the geriatric Rose into Cinderella. With the help of Tisch, who was a trustee of New York University, he arranged it so that both Creighton University and NYU gave Rose honorary degrees.40 At Creighton, the tiny Mrs. B was so overcome that she cried on the stage, saying, “Oy, oy, oy, I never even believe it.”41 Then she spoke of America, the country that made her dream come true.

- took care to keep her from seeing the price of her hotel room, for she had been to New York before and thought anything more than $75 for a hotel room was outrageous.43 She had Louie take her to see Ellis Island and Delancey Street, but getting around the city was a struggle, for she felt cheated by the price of a taxi.44 On the morning of commencement, Mrs. B was “robed” with great pomp and circumstance and received her degree alongside Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and the poet Octavio Paz. Despite the august company of the NYU ceremony, when asked which of the two honorary degrees she preferred, Rose did not hesitate. It was Creighton’s. They had bought carpet from her. Soon after, Berkshire’s auditors conducted the Nebraska Furniture Mart’s first inventory. The store was worth $85 million. Mrs. B, seized with a severe case of remorse after she had sold it for a total value of $60 million, including the share retained by the family, told Regardie’s magazine, “I wouldn’t go… ([Location 8719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8719))

- safety in the price. Within two years, however, this fairy tale of a story turned ugly. Tired of being yelled at in front of customers and of being called bums, Mrs. B’s grandsons Ron and Irv gradually stopped speaking to her. Finally, when Mrs. B was ninety-five, “the boys” overruled her on a carpet purchase and she exploded. It was the last straw. “I was the boss. They never told me nothing,”46 she said, and quit. She also demanded $96,000 in unused vacation pay on her way out the door.47 But sitting at home alone, she acknowledged, was “awful lonely, not to do nothing. I go nuts.”48 In ominous newspaper interviews she referred to her grandsons as “dummies” and, shockingly, “Nazis.”49 She hinted at solo trips to the North Carolina High Point Market, the furniture industry’s largest trade show. She suddenly arranged to have a warehouse she owned right across the street from the Furniture Mart refurbished. She held a “garage sale” in it, and cleared $18,000 in one day, selling “some of her own things.”50 A few months later, “Mrs. B’s Warehouse” was grossing $3,000 a day before it officially opened.

- she snarled to the local paper, “I’ll give it to them.” She put up a sign: “Their price $104, our price $80.”51 When Bob Brown on ABC’s 20/20 program asked her about the Furniture Mart, she said, “I would it should go up in smoke. I like they should go down to hell.…”52 Some time earlier, Buffett had created a saying. “I would rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs. B and her progeny.”53 Now Buffett acted as he always did when any of his friends’ relationships broke down. He refused to take sides. Mrs. B thought that was disloyal. “Warren Buffett is not my friend,” she told a reporter. “I made him fifteen million dollars every year, and when I disagreed with my grandkids, he didn’t stand up for me.”54 This was torture to Buffett, who couldn’t bear conflict and broken relationships. Louie, who could do no wrong in his mother’s eyes, made no headway with Rose. “She figured she lost control of this place, and she blew her top,” he says. After two years, Mrs. B’s Warehouse, while still small, was growing at such a rate that pound for pound, it was trouncing the Mart. Finally Louie intervened again. “Mother,” he said, “you’ve got to sell this thing back to us. There’s no sense competing one against the other.”55 And so Rose called Buffett. She missed the Mart. She missed her family. She was lonely in her house, separated from her family. “I was wrong,” she said. Mrs. B told Buffett that she wanted to come back. With a box of See’s Candies under his arm and holding a huge bouquet of pink roses, Buffett went out to see her. He offered her $5 million simply for the use of her name and her lease. He added one catch: She must sign a noncompete agreement, a contract designed so that she could never again compete with him. This was something he wished he’d done before. The absurdity of imposing a noncompete agreement on a ninety-nine-year-old woman was far from lost on him. Nevertheless, Buffett was taking no chances. The agreement was cunningly written to outlast Mrs. B. If she retired, or quit in a rage or for any other reason, no matter how old she was, for five years afterward she could not compete with Buffett and her relatives. “I thought she might go on forever,” he says. “I needed five years beyond forever with her.” Mrs. B still could not read or write English. Nevertheless, she signed the noncompete, which had been explained to her, with her characteristic mark. The truce made headlines. “And then I made ([Location 8742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8742))

- sure she never got mad,” Buffett says. He set about flattering his new employee unctuously to make her so happy that she would never, ever quit and start the clock running on her noncompete. On April 7, 1993, the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce put her in the inaugural class of its business hall of fame, alongside Buffett. Then Buffett, knees trembling slightly, got up on a stage at the Highland Club and sang in public, for the first time in his life, to Mrs. B on her hundredth birthday. He also donated a million dollars to a local theater she was renovating. Nobody could believe it. Warren Buffett had given away a million dollars. Rose felt she owed everything, all her good fortune, to this country for the opportunities it had given her.

Somehow, however, Warren wound up with the impression that this relationship was in the past, and that it involved someone she had met after she left Omaha.5 Even while confessing, therefore, Susie kept her secrets. Yet she had finally committed herself to one course. By telling Warren, she had chosen his side of the fence. She would never leave him. They would stay married. And Warren did not kill himself when he found out—as if that had ever been likely. But he did lose what appeared to be ten pounds almost overnight.

- Buffett did not stop writing about the insurance industry, however. In fact, in the 1984 letter he wrote about it more than ever. But he lumped all of Berkshire’s insurance companies together and took the blame for their poor performance himself, without naming a single company or a single manager who had been responsible for the hemorrhage of losses. He went on like this for an excruciating seven pages, citing the “walking dead” competition and the losses coming back to haunt him like bill collections for the man who was “buried in a rented suit.” Although it was appropriate for him, as CEO, to feel accountable, he seemed almost to be trying to forestall criticism through self-flagellation. And he was writing these things even as he knew that, underlying the terrible numbers, substantial improvements were already taking place. By the next year, the insurers began coming together into the powerful engine that Buffett had envisioned. They started to produce the cash flows that would be the raw material to fuel the rest of his career. ([Location 8891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=8891))

- By 1985 the unique business model that Buffett had designed began rising to its potential. No other business resembled it, and this structure would enable the dramatic compounding effect that propelled the shareholders’ wealth. Then there came the moment when Goldberg found the capstone to the structure. One day, says Buffett, “I was down here on a Saturday, and Mike Goldberg walked in with Ajit.” Ajit Jain, born in 1951, had an engineering degree from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur and a business degree from Harvard. Ajit was skeptical and hard-nosed like Buffett and Munger. Nobody would ever put one over on Ajit. Buffett saw himself in Ajit, who quickly rose in his esteem to share Mrs. B’s pinnacle. “He had no background in insurance. I just liked the guy. I would love to glue myself to Ajit. You can argue that Ajit was when we discovered the electric light. It was huge. It was huge compared to anything we’d ever done at Berkshire.” Buffett claimed that he “added nothing” to the quality of Ajit’s decisions. But he was far from a passive participant in Ajit’s deals, and if there was any job at Berkshire Hathaway he would have liked to do himself, it was Jain’s. He loved the handicapping aspect, the tough negotiating in which temperament mattered and huge sums of money were won or lost based on pure intellect and will. This business in which psychology gave the right person an edge drew together all of Buffett’s skills. Buffetting by proxy through Ajit was as close to the old “under-the-counter” market way of trading as he could get these days, and he loved doing it. With Buffett glued to Ajit, and the chaos sorted out, Goldberg’s job was done; he moved over to start Berkshire’s credit and real estate business. Ajit did not seem to need much sleep; when he got up around five or six a.m., he roused his colleagues for lengthy predawn talks about reinsurance deals, even on Saturdays and Sundays. He and Buffett established a routine of nightly ten o’clock phone calls, which Ajit maintained in every time zone throughout a ceaseless routine of globe-trotting. Ajit had arrived at an opportune time. Insurance prices were peaking. He took an ad in Business Insurance magazine: “We are looking for more—more casualty risks where the premium exceeds one million.” The ad combined the showmanship and sharp thinking that were Buffett hallmarks. “We didn’t have a reputation, we didn’t have the distribution system,” says Buffett.

This policy made Berkshire more like a partnership—or even a club—and the high stock price drew attention to Berkshire like nothing else.

Anything new at the castle?’ ” Still, by 1987 a billionaire commanded a certain cool respect; Buffett had become something of an elephant himself, no longer so dependent on Graham.

Before long, McNamara became Graham’s “Husband Number Three,” as one of her board members referred to him. True to form, she put him on the Post board. From the beginning, McNamara and Buffett “were not the best of friends,” though over time, their relationship resolved into a sort of mutually respectful truce. Buffett could handle people like McNamara through diplomacy; a greater problem was the physical danger that accompanied his fame. Two men arrived at Kiewit Plaza, one waving a chrome-plated replica of a .45, intending to kidnap Buffett and hold him for $100,000 ransom.13 The building security and police handled it. Afterward, Buffett would not hear of hiring a bodyguard, for that would restrict his cherished privacy and freedom, but he did have a security camera installed, along with a three-hundred-pound security door to shield the office.14 Strangers called often now, insistent, wanting to speak with him.

When Howie was over the limit, he had to pay twenty-six percent of the farm’s gross receipts to his father. When he was under, he paid twenty-two percent. “I don’t mind it, really,” Howie said. “He’s showing he’s concerned about my health. But what I do mind is that, even at twenty-two percent, he’s getting a bigger paycheck than almost anybody around.”18 So Warren couldn’t lose on this deal either.

So she asked her father for a loan. “Why not go to the bank?” he asked, and turned her down.

But applying such strictly rational rules to his own children was a chilly way to look at the world. “He won’t give it to us on principle,” said Susie. “All my life, my father has been teaching us.

Ever since 1977, with the help of Carol Loomis, his unusual chairman’s letters to his shareholders in the Berkshire annual reports—carefully crafted, enlightening, eye-opening letters—had grown more personal and entertaining by the year; they amounted to a crash course in business, written in clear language that ranged from biblical quotations to references to Alice in Wonderland and princesses kissing toads. Much of their acreage was devoted to discussions of matters other than Berkshire Hathaway’s financial results—how to think about investing, the harm the dismal economy was doing to business, how businesses should measure results. These letters brought out both the preacher and the cop in Buffett, giving people a sense of him as a man. And the man was charming, he was attractive; his investors wanted more of him. So he gave it to them at the shareholder meetings. The earliest meetings had taken place in Seabury Stanton’s old loft above the New Bedford mill. Two or three people with Ben Graham connections came because of Buffett. One was Conrad Taff, who had taken Graham’s class. Buffett wanted his shareholder meetings to be open and democratic, as unlike the old Marshall-Wells meeting as possible. Taff peppered Buffett with questions, and Buffett enjoyed it, as if he were sitting in an armchair at a party with people gathered round listening to his wisdom. The meetings carried on like this for years, with only a sprinkling of people showing up to ask questions, even after the meetings moved to Nebraska and took place in the National Indemnity cafeteria. Buffett still enjoyed them, despite the sparse attendance. As recently as 1981, only twenty-two people attended. Jack Ringwalt actually had to recruit employees to stand in back of the National Indemnity cafeteria so as not to embarrass his boss with an empty room.25 Then in July 1983, coincident with the Blue Chip merger, a little crowd of people suddenly showed up at the cafeteria to hear Buffett talk.

- them in his plainspoken, unpretentious style: He was teaching, and he came across as democratic, Midwestern, and refreshing, just as he did in his letters to the shareholders. Buffett spoke in metaphors the audience understood—the emperor’s new clothes, the bird in the hand versus the two in the bush. He told plainspoken truths that other businessmen would not acknowledge, and routinely burst the bubble of corporate double-speak. He developed a memorable way of fabulizing life and businesses into instructive tales that rang true. The meetings took on a quality associated with almost everything that Buffett touched. They began to snowball. In 1986, Buffett moved the meeting to the Joslyn Art Museum. Four hundred people came, then five hundred the next year. Many of them worshipped Buffett, who had made them rich. In between questions, some people read poems of praise from the balcony.26 Buffett’s anomalous success, and the fame it had brought him, was putting him on the road to becoming a brand just as surely as Skippy peanut butter. Inevitably, therefore, he became the target of a group of finance professors who were at that very moment attempting to prove that someone like ([Location 9097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9097))

- Buffett was a mere accident who should not be paid attention, much less worshipped. These academics believed that the modern-day market was “efficient,” and no one was expert enough to beat it. The many who scrambled to beat the average would, in fact, become the average. Their very efforts to beat the market made the work self-defeating and futile, said Eugene Fama, a professor from the University of Chicago. Yet an army of professionals had sprung up who charged everything from modest fees to the soon-to-be-legendary hedge-fund cut of “two-and-twenty” (two percent of assets and twenty percent of returns) for the privilege of processing trades, managing an investor’s money, and trying to predict the future behavior of stocks. Every year, the sum of all these people’s labors added up to exactly what the market did (less the fees). Charles Ellis, a consultant to professional money managers, published a book saying that the best way to make money in the market was… ([Location 9106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9106))

- market hypothesis (EMH) kept hacking away at their computers over the years, however, to turn these ideas into an even tighter version. They concluded that nobody could beat the average, that the market was so efficient that the price of a stock at any time must reflect every piece of public information about a company. Thus, studying balance sheets, listening to scuttlebutt, digging in libraries, reading newspapers, studying a company’s competitors—all of it was futile. The price of a stock at any time was “right.” Anybody who beat the average was just lucky—or trading on inside information. It was certainly true that exceptions to the efficient market had grown rarer. Yet the proponents of EMH denied all exceptions, and to them Buffett—the most visible exception of all—and his lengthening and increasingly acclaimed record became an inconvenient fact. Economists like Paul Samuelson at MIT, Fama at the University of Chicago, Michael Jensen at the University of… ([Location 9116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9116))

- an anomalous stunt were not worthy of study. Burton Malkiel, a Princeton economist, summed the whole thing up by saying that anyone who outperformed the stock market consistently was no different from a lucky monkey that had a winning streak at picking stocks by throwing darts at the Wall Street Journal stock listings.28 Buffett loved the Wall Street Journal; he loved it so much that he had made a special deal with the local distributor of the paper. When the batches of Journals arrived in Omaha every night, a copy was pulled out and placed in his driveway before midnight. He sat up waiting to read tomorrow’s news before everybody else got to see it. It was what he did with the information the Wall Street Journal gave him, however, that made him a superior investor. If a monkey got the Wall Street Journal in its driveway every night just before midnight, the monkey still could not match Buffett’s investing record by throwing darts. Buffett made sport of the controversy by playing with a Wall Street Journal dartboard in his office. The efficient-market hypothesis invalidated him, however. Furthermore, it invalidated Ben Graham. That would not do. He and Munger saw these academics as holders of witch doctorates.29 Their theory offended Buffett’s reverence for rationality and for the profession of teaching. Columbia held a seminar in 1984 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Security Analysis and invited Buffett to represent the Grahamian point of view at the seminar, which was actually more of a debate over EMH. His opponent on the panel, Michael Jensen, stood up and said he felt like “a turkey must feel at the beginning of a turkey shoot.”30 His role in the morality play was to cast withering comments at the antediluvian views of the Grahamian value investors. Some people could do better than the market for long periods, he said. In effect, if enough people flip coins, a few of them will flip heads over and over. That was how randomness worked. Buffett had spent weeks preparing for this event. He’d anticipated the coin-flipping argument. When he got up for his turn, he said that while this might be so, the row of heads would not be random if all the successful coin-flippers came from the same town. For example, if all the coin-flippers who kept flipping heads came from the tiny village of Graham-and-Doddsville, something specific that they were… ([Location 9125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9125))

- The loosely defined dual role he was playing had so far suited him and his shareholders. Now, however, a decision faced him that required him to choose—he could either run a de facto partnership or continue his role as a major-company CEO. But he could no longer do both. The reason was taxes. Berkshire was already burdened with corporate income taxes, a cost the partnership had not faced. On the other hand, Buffett charged his Berkshire partners no “fee” to manage their money. That was a good deal (for everyone ([Location 9209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9209))

- but Buffett) or at least the shareholders’ loyalty suggests they saw it that way. Now, however, in 1986, Congress passed a major tax-reform act that, among other things, repealed what was called the General Utilities Doctrine. Formerly, a corporation could sell its assets without paying any taxes as long as it was liquidating and distributing the assets to the shareholders. The shareholders would be taxed on their gain, but the gain would not be taxed twice. Once the General Utilities Doctrine was repealed, any liquidation of a corporation and distribution of its assets would result in a tax on the corporation’s profits and another tax on the shareholders upon distribution. Since the double tax added up to a staggering amount of money, closely held and family corporations all over the country rushed to liquidate themselves before the act went into effect. Buffett, who regularly said in his shareholder letters that Berkshire had gotten so large that its money was a barrier to investing success, could have distributed its assets, then raised a more manageable sum—still in the billions—set up a new partnership, and started over investing within weeks (collecting his fee again, to boot).

- sheet, had Buffett liquidated Berkshire, he could have given his shareholders a total tax avoidance of more than $400 million and the chance to start over in a partnership free of the corporate double tax.39 But he didn’t. Buffett wrote a lengthy dissertation on taxes in his annual letter, in which he addressed this topic and dismissed the idea of liquidating out of hand: “If Berkshire, for example, were to be liquidated—which it most certainly won’t be—shareholders would, under the new law, receive far less from the sales of our properties than they would have if the properties had been sold in the past.”40 The Warren Buffett of old would not have sneered at an extra $185 million in his own bank account and the chance to start over earning fees without the corporate income tax—which is what his decision not to liquidate Berkshire Hathaway in 1986 cost him personally. But ordinary greed no longer drove his decisions—for this cost him far more than any other shareholder. His… ([Location 9222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9222))

By shutting down the partnership, he had freed himself from that tyranny; in fact he no longer presented numbers in a fashion that allowed someone to calculate his investing performance from inception.42 Yet even though Buffett had now officially joined the CEO club, he had no desire to acquire most of their habits—collecting wine or art, buying a yacht.

Over the weekend of a Jewish holiday, when Gutfreund knew the observant Perelman would be neutralized, Buffett flew to New York, and he and Gutfreund met at Salomon’s lawyers’ offices. Buffett walked in by himself, without a briefcase or even a pad of paper in his hand. Over a handshake, he agreed to buy a preferred stock with a nine percent coupon that would convert to common stock at the price of $38.59 The nine percent yield gave Buffett a premium return until the stock went to $38, when he had the right to convert to equity. So the upside was unlimited. But if the stock went down, he had the right to “put” the security back to Salomon and get his money back.60 The ([Location 9359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=9359))

Along with the deal, Buffett and Munger each got board seats. Before signing the papers, Buffett climbed aboard his new jet and flew to New York. He met Munger at One New York Plaza to inspect Salomon.

Unlike the many people devastated by losses, they were buying stocks.8 When the avalanche victims were dug out of the snow, however, Warren’s sister Doris turned out to be one of them.

It is hard to imagine that the broker gave her any kind of realistic description of the risk she was taking, especially using a scary term like “naked put.” Doris was unsophisticated about investing but highly intelligent, with a hard-nosed common sense. She had not talked to Warren about the investment, however. He was famous for recommending only extremely safe, low-return investments, like Treasury or municipal bonds, especially when counseling divorced women. These were investments that he would never make himself. Doris had trusted him enough to become one of his first partners; she trusted him implicitly when it came to investing for Berkshire.

The story hit the Washington Post that the sister of “a highly successful investor” had done something extremely dumb. Damaging Warren’s reputation was a serious transgression in the Buffett family, and Doris’s timing was terrible. The Buffetts were still trying to recover from a tragic event several months before. Susie’s nephew Billy Rogers had died of a fatal overdose in a rooming house in San Francisco. Susie, Peter, and Mary discovered his body when they did not hear from him for several days.

All the warlords—theoretically, candidates for CEO—had begun to gather outside an “interview room.” Only a few of them made sense or actually wanted the job, but he had to interview every one. Meanwhile, a pair of “plenty smart,” tough investigative lawyers from Wachtell, Lipton—Larry Pedowitz and Allen Martin—gave “a masterful presentation” to Buffett and Munger, who had flown in to participate in person.

- Before starting the fifteen-minute interviews, he told the group, “J.M. is not coming back.”66 With that, he began to interview the candidates one by one. He asked them all the same question: Who should be the next CEO of Salomon? “I was going into a foxhole with this guy, and he had to be the right choice. The question was, who would have all the qualities that would provide leadership to the firm, cause me not to worry for a second about whether anything was going on that was going to subsequently embarrass the firm or even put us out of… ([Location 10122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10122))

- you were deciding who you wanted to be a trustee under your will, or who you wanted to have marry your daughter. I wanted the kind of person who was going to be able to make decisions as to what should get to me and what could get solved below the line—who would tell me all the bad news, because good news always takes care of itself in business. I wanted to hear every bit of bad news as soon as it happened, so we could do something about it. I wanted someone who was ethical, who wouldn’t stick a gun to my head later on knowing that I couldn’t fire him.”67 Buffett found that all but one of the other candidates thought it should be Deryck Maughan, who had returned three weeks earlier from running Salomon’s Asian operations.68 Maughan, forty-three years old, now headed the investment-banking group. He was not a trader, and he was English, not American. He had the least resemblance to Mozer or any of Salomon’s frat-house trading boys of anyone that could be found. He was viewed as both ethical and possessed of common sense. Thanks to Liar’s Poker, the public thought of Salomon as a… ([Location 10128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10128))

Of all Maughan’s qualifications, possibly the most valuable was his distance from the crime. Within Salomon, land of the long knives, all of the other candidates had enemies. Maughan was a question mark, like the token black guy in the movie Putney Swope, who gets elected to the job of CEO of a backstabbing advertising agency when the old CEO croaks… ([Location 10140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10140))

As one of the other warlords put it, they all voted for Maughan because it’s “better to choose someone you don’t know than someone you think is bad.” In the movie, Putney Swope had had the sense to vote for himself. When Buffett asked Maughan who should run Salomon, Maughan replied adroitly: “I’m afraid you’re going to find out that it’s me.”72 Two other things got Buffett’s attention.

That afternoon, Buffett taxied back uptown to Graham’s UN Plaza apartment, where the arb boys met him to plead “with passion and logic” for Meriwether’s job. If J.M. left, Buffett knew, there was a risk that the arb boys would eventually join him.73 Without Meriwether, the main source of Salomon’s profits would drain away. Buffett’s investment in Salomon could become worth far less. Then Meriwether himself arrived, shaken. He did not want to resign, and he talked to Buffett at length. Buffett began to waver. He focused on Meriwether’s straightforwardness in reporting the problem. “After listening to all of this, my reaction was not to ask for his resignation. As best I knew at the time, and this is still my belief, when he had heard of his subordinate’s misdeeds, he had gone straight upstairs to his superiors and the general counsel and had reported it.

Gutfreund felt the firm owed him $35 million. “As he was laying all this out, I was listening like the Japanese, saying, ‘Yes, I understand your position.’ Not ‘Yes, I agree with you.’ We had no interest whatsoever in trying to arrange a compensation agreement with anyone who was in the middle of a scandal of this proportion without knowing the full facts.” Buffett then said that they could not… ([Location 10163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10163))

But he was not having nearly as much fun tonight. Almost as soon as they arrived, Philip Howard showed up, carrying a sheaf of papers about Gutfreund’s severance, which he wanted Munger to sign.77 He talked to both of them for a while, until Buffett left them alone and went off to make some phone calls.

I was being polite, but I wasn’t paying much attention.… I sort of turned off my mind.… I was just sitting there politely with my head turned off.” When Howard reached the end of his lengthy list of demands, Munger refused to sign the papers, but stressed that Gutfreund would eventually be treated fairly.78 On the way out the door, Howard hesitated. It bothered him that he still had nothing in writing. “You can’t get paid after the divorce,” he said. Munger reassured him: “Phil, you have to practice law the way my father did, by trusting in a man’s word.”79 While Howard and Munger were talking, Meriwether and his lawyer, Ted Levine, arrived. Meriwether had changed his mind. He said that he was in an impossible position and had to leave Salomon. He “at least partially understood the seriousness of the company’s situation. He was pacing back and forth, and he was smoking cigarettes as fast as he could light them. He said that the best thing for him to do was to resign.” Munger would later express feelings of guilt… ([Location 10186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10186))

Nonetheless, they appeared slightly awed by Buffett. When he spoke, “The Red Sea parted, and the Oracle appeared,” says Maughan.19 Salomon, Buffett said, was going to have different priorities from now on. “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” Those words have since been parsed and dissected in classrooms and case studies as the model of corporate nobility. Buffett’s unflinching display of principle summed up much about the man.

He exempted petty moral failures like minor expense-account abuses, but, “when in doubt, call me,” he told them. He put his home phone number on the letter.

Before long, he had set up a regular bridge game with Carol Loomis, George Gillespie, and Ace Greenberg, the CEO of Bear Stearns. Bridge helped him relax because when he played bridge, he couldn’t think about anything else. A couple of miles uptown, in his enormous Park Avenue apartment filled with a painstakingly assembled collection of art, his old friend Dan Cowin lay dying of cancer. Buffett wasn’t sleeping.

He had been born in an age where money was scarce and life was lived at a walking pace, and he’d arranged his own life to keep things that way. On Wall Street, money was plentiful and life was lived at whatever speed bandwidth could currently supply. People left their homes at five a.m. daily and returned at nine or ten at night.

With some reluctance, Buffett had agreed to go. Gates had similar reservations. He was interested in meeting Graham, now a seventy-four-year-old legend, but, “I told my mom, ‘I don’t know about a guy who just invests money and picks stocks.’ … But she insisted.” The day of the visit, Gates flew in on a helicopter so he could make a quick getaway.3 ([Location 10765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10765))

Buffett skipped the small talk; he immediately asked Gates whether IBM was going to do well in the future and whether it was a competitor of Microsoft. Computer companies seemed to come and go, and why was that? Gates started explaining. He told Buffett to buy two stocks, Intel and Microsoft. Then he asked Buffett about the economics of newspapers, and Buffett told him that they had gotten worse, because of other media.

Gates and Buffett talked on, even as many of Seattle’s best-known people circulated around them. They took a walk on the pebbly beach. They were starting to attract attention. “We were sort of ignoring all these important people, and Bill’s father finally said, gently, that he’d prefer that we join in with the rest of the people a little more. “Bill started trying to convince me to get a computer.

At sunset the helicopter had to leave. Gates did not go with it.4 “Then at dinner, Bill Gates Sr. posed the question to the table: What factor did people feel was the most important in getting to where they’d gotten in life? And I said, ‘Focus,’ And Bill said the same thing.” It is unclear how many people at the table understood “focus” as Buffett ([Location 10783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10783))

What was it you couldn’t see that prevented you from remaining the leader? Most of the proposed answers, regardless of the company, revolved around arrogance, complacency, and what Buffett called the “Institutional Imperative”—the tendency for companies to engage in activity for its own sake and to copy their peers instead of trying to stay ahead of them. Some companies didn’t bring in young people with fresh ideas. Sometimes managements weren’t attuned to tectonic shifts in their industry. Nobody suggested these problems were easy to cure. After a while Buffett asked everyone to pick their favorite stock. What about Kodak? asked Bill Ruane. He looked back at Gates to see what he would say. “Kodak is toast,” said Gates.8 Nobody else in the Buffett Group knew that digital technology would make film cameras toast. In 1991, even Kodak didn’t know that it was toast.9 “Bill probably thinks all the television networks are going to get killed,” said Larry Tisch, whose company, Loews Corp.,… ([Location 10807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=10807))

Moreover, the copycat funds were buying the stocks that Berkshire owned at prices far higher than Berkshire had paid, and charging fat fees to do it. They were cheating investors. Now the cop in Buffett came out. To foil the putative copycats, he decided to issue a new class of shares. Each B share—or “Baby B”—was equal to 3.33 percent, or 1/30, of a pricy A share.

The reason is the math of losing money, which works like this: If someone has a dollar and she loses fifty cents, she has to double her money to make back what she’s lost. That’s difficult to do.

The arbs’ strategy, however, assumed that their estimate of value was right. Therefore, when the market moved against them, they only had to wait to make the money back. But “risk” defined this way—in terms of volatility—presumes the investor can be patient and wait. Anyone who borrows to invest may not have that luxury of time.

- thousands of trades, leveraged by at least twenty-five times the firm’s capital. The highest loss that Long-Term contemplated was twenty percent of its assets, the odds of which it estimated at no more than one in a hundred.11 Nobody estimated the odds of losses bigger than that; the numbers wouldn’t make sense. The name Long-Term came from the fact that investors were locked in. Meriwether knew that if he started losing money, he needed the investors to stay until the losses turned around. But so much leverage, combined with no way to cap the risk completely, made Buffett and Munger uncomfortable. “We thought they were very smart people,” says Munger. “But we were a little leery of the complexity and leverage. We were very leery of being used as a sales lead. We knew others would follow if we got in.” Munger thought Long-Term wanted Berkshire as a “Judas goat.” “The Judas goat led the animals to slaughter in the stockyards,” he says, recalling Omaha. “The goat would live for fifteen years, and of course the animals that followed it would die every day as it betrayed them. Not that we didn’t admire the intellect of the people at Long-Term.”12 Long-Term charged its clients two cents off every dollar under management every year that they invested, plus a quarter of any profits it earned. Clients signed up for the prestige. It raised $1.25 billion, the largest hedge-fund start-up in history.

The next day the Dow dropped four percent in what the Wall Street Journal referred to as a “global margin call,” with investors panicking and selling. Buffett picked up Hilibrand at the airport and drove him back to Kiewit Plaza. Hilibrand had gone deep into debt to pump up his personal investment in the firm, leveraging the leverage with which Long-Term had already leveraged itself. He spent the day going over every position the firm owned and stressing the incredible opportunity he was offering to Buffett.18 “He wanted me to put in capital.

- Fed would cut interest rates. Long-Term lost another half billion dollars; the banks picking over its books were using what they learned against it.26 The fund now had less than a billion dollars of capital left. The irony was the $2.3 billion it had paid out to its own investors a year before in order to increase the share of the fund owned by its partners. If it had that money now, Long-Term might have been in a position to survive on its own. Instead, it had a hundred dollars of debt for every dollar of capital—a ratio no sane lender would ever entertain. Buffett was en route to Bozeman, Montana, with the Gates party, but Corzine had reached him earlier that morning and gained permission to enlist a large insurer, AIG, which owned a derivatives business, to join the bid. Its chairman, Hank Greenberg, was on friendly terms with Buffett. AIG had the experience and the team to replace Meriwether as manager, and Greenberg’s powerful presence would balance out Buffett’s—and it might make Buffett’s bid more palatable to Meriwether. The next morning, forty-five bankers arrived at the Fed, as summoned, to discuss a bailout of the customer that had bullied them so relentlessly for the past four years.

As one domino fell after another, a global financial meltdown was a real possibility—a repeat of Salomon.

People wondered if Buffett’s willingness to give away his stock when it was trading at such an unheard-of price meant that he, too, thought BRK was overvalued.14 Buffett had spent his career tightening his stranglehold on Berkshire.

Coca-Cola stock was trading as high as forty times its estimated 2000 earnings—a multiple that said investors believed the stock would keep rising by at least twenty percent a year. But to do that, it would have to increase earnings twenty-five percent a year for five years—impossible. It would have to almost triple sales—again impossible.16 Buffett knew it. Nevertheless, he did not sell his Coca-Cola stock. Buffett carefully sidestepped these questions about the market and Coca-Cola when he used Berkshire stock to buy General Re, saying, “It is not a market call whatsoever.”17 BRK, he said, was “fairly valued” before the merger, and the combined companies would create “synergy.” When Charlie Munger was asked, he stated that Buffett had consulted him about this deal very late in the game. In effect, he disowned the deal.18 Not unexpectedly, investors began to reprice BRK as if either Berkshire and its holdings in stocks like Coca-Cola were overpriced or the deal’s synergies… ([Location 11549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=11549))

He bought just over seventy-five percent of MidAmerican for about $2 billion plus $7 billion of assumed debt, with the other twenty-five percent owned by his friend Walter Scott; MidAmerican’s CEO, Scott’s protégé David Sokol; and Sokol’s number two, Greg Abel. Investors were mystified. Why would Buffett want to buy a regulated electric company? Admittedly, the business was growing moderately, was well-managed, and had attractive embedded returns that were relatively certain and would be so for as long as could reasonably be imagined. Buffett saw this as a second cornerstone for Berkshire alongside the insurance business. He said he was working with excellent managers who could potentially put a lot of money to work in utilities and energy at predictable rates of return, which compensated for the limited growth. However, Buffett was already being ridiculed for his refusal to buy technology stocks. Now he had bought the light company. How dull! But this was not how he thought.

She sprinted outside and saw Kay lying at the top of the steps on the porch in front of her door. Running over, she bent and spoke to Graham, who didn’t respond. She started screaming for Herbert Allen to come out.10 By the time the emergency medical technicians arrived a few minutes later, Don Graham had rushed back from the golf course. He was going to need someone to help him make decisions, and asked Buffett whether he wanted to come along. But Buffett could not do it.11 Griffith Harsh, a prominent neurosurgeon who was married to eBay CEO Meg Whitman, went with Don to look at the CAT scan at St. Luke’s hospital in Ketchum, about ten minutes away.12 Susie Jr. drove off to meet Don and Herbert Allen at the hospital. She knew very well that no one could expect her father to deal with any kind of medical crisis. Big Susie had had a cardiac catheterization in 1997, and Warren got on a plane to go to San Francisco to be with her.

While all of this was transpiring, Warren retreated to his condo. Big Susie had left earlier that day for a wedding in Greece and knew nothing of what was going on.

To the students, he explained his “Twenty Punches” approach to investing. “You’d get very rich,” he said, “if you thought of yourself as having a card with only twenty punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You’d resist the temptation to dabble. You’d make more good decisions and you’d make more big decisions.” He ran his life on Twenty Punches, too, with as little flitting as he could arrange. Same house, same wife for fifty years, same Astrid on Farnam Street; no desire to buy and sell real estate, art, cars, tokens of wealth; no jumping from city to city or career to career. Some of that was easy for a man so certain of himself; some of it came with being a creature of habit; some of it was a natural tendency to let things compound; and some of it was the wisdom of inertia. When he gave somebody a punch on his card, they became a part of him and that decision was permanent. Any crack in the facade of permanence was extraordinarily difficult for him to face.

A moment later, after the torrent of grief had poured out of him, he was recovered enough to speak. He regretted not being able to eulogize Kay at her funeral, he said. It shamed him. The man who had worked so hard to become comfortable on a stage felt that he should have been able to do that for Kay.

Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy subsidiary invested in the troubled Williams Companies and bought its Kern River Pipeline.11 Berkshire bought Garan, the maker of Garanimals children’s clothing. It picked up the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Dynegy, another troubled energy company.12 Within days, MidAmerican lent more money to Williams Companies.13 It bought The Pampered Chef, which sold cookware at parties through a sales-force of 70,000 independent “kitchen consultants.” It bought farm-equipment maker CTB Industries and teamed with investment bank Lehman Brothers to lend $1.3 billion to struggling Reliant Energy. Ajit Jain quickly moved into the terrorism-insurance business, filling a sudden vacuum by insuring airlines, Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building, a South American oil refinery, a North Sea oil platform, and the Sears Tower in Chicago. Berkshire insured the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City against a terrorist attack. It insured the FIFA World Cup soccer championship against terrorism.14 Buffett was handicapping. Some of Berkshire’s businesses struggled in a weak economy. Buffett had always said he’d rather have a lumpy fifteen percent return than a steady ten percent.

- One of Buffett’s least favorite ways for the rich to get richer was through stock options—since his famous “no” vote on the pay package at Salomon, no other board had ever asked him to serve on its compensation committee. Coca-Cola had given Doug Daft options on 650,000 shares of its stock in 2001. Daft had originally asked to be compensated with stock options that would pay off only if earnings increased fifteen to twenty percent. The shareholders approved it with Buffett staring at his shoes thinking, Okay, this will never happen. A month later, the compensation committee belatedly realized that too, and backtracked and bonus-pimped for him, lowering the target to eleven to sixteen percent.21 That was like moving the finish line in a marathon to the nineteen-mile mark. So far, Daft had not impressed, and Coca-Cola’s stock had gone nowhere. Watching trophy-sized option payments proliferate despite rising outrage, Buffett felt he had to seize the opportunity he had been waiting for—to finally kill counterfeit stock-option accounting. Managers loved stock options because of a quirk of accounting history that said that if companies paid their employees with options instead of cash, they booked no cost. It was as if the stock options did not exist. In the “real” world, a privately owned business would instantly recognize this as a bogus idea. If the butcher, baker, and candlestick maker gave away options for shares worth, say, twenty percent of their businesses, they would be acutely aware that they had just given away a chunk of the profits as well. But the accounting rules had made stock options into play money. Thus, bonus-pimping on an incredible scale had begun to occur in the late 1990s. CEOs had, on average, been paid forty-two times as much as the average blue-collar worker in 1980. Twenty years later, that ratio had increased to more than four hundred times.22 The top-earning CEOs got billion-dollar packages. In 2000, Sandy Weill was paid $151 million at Citigroup, Jack Welch $125 million at GE, Larry Ellison $92 ([Location 12215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=12215))

Although Steve Jobs was taking only a $1 salary at Apple for 1997 through 1999, he got a windfall $872 million stock-option grant in 2000—plus a $90 million Gulfstream jet.23 When the accountants had tried to change these rules in the early 1990s, corporate America, led by Silicon Valley, stormed the gates of Congress, armed with lobbyists and campaign contributions, begging their representatives to save them from the terrible new accounting rules. Until the bubble finally burst in 2002, they had succeeded in stopping those rules dead in their tracks. Buffett had been writing about stock options since 1993 but now felt the time was finally ripe for change.

- point.” Afterward, Buffett was able to perform his ongoing miracle of the bathtub memory, and carried on with composure. The Coca-Cola board made a decision during its meeting and announced in a press release that it would start to book the cost of its employee stock options as an expense, which was currently allowed but not required. Coca-Cola’s announcement hit corporate America like a cluster bomb, its force magnified by the venue at which the new policy was proclaimed—the Sun Valley gathering where the press had dug in outside its flowerpot barricades like an encampment. Buffett’s thinly veiled hand could be seen behind this announcement. Right after Sun Valley, the Washington Post Company emulated Coca-Cola and announced that it, too, would expense stock options.25 Silicon Valley suited up for another fight in Congress. But one by one, other companies began to follow in the footsteps of Coca-Cola and the Washington Post Company, announcing that they, too, would recognize the expense of stock options on their books. The battle over stock options would continue formally for nearly two years, until the Financial Accounting Standards Board finally made it official. But Coca-Cola’s decision had kicked over the domino in a chain of events. Buffett’s momentum as an influential statesman during this period was gathering speed. Although the estate tax was still scheduled to be repealed, he found another target in the accountants who had facilitated the accounting frauds of the past few years. If the auditors had not been sitting in the laps of the CEOs, wagging their tails, he felt, then managements would not have been allowed to loot the shareholders’ pockets, transferring vast sums into their own pockets.… ([Location 12250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=12250))

- Buffett headed out to San Francisco for Christmas, which occurred during the first two weeks of Susie’s radiation. Warren and Susie gave each of the kids another six hundred shares of Berkshire stock for their foundations—a complete surprise, which thrilled all of them.2 With an eye to the future, knowing that they would one day have much larger sums of money to distribute, their parents had decided to give them this gift to train them in philanthropy.

- forty, fifty billion dollars or more—depending on Berkshire’s stock price at the time—would sluice into the foundation, and the law required that shortly thereafter the foundation begin giving away five percent each year. But with only a couple of employees, the Buffett Foundation was woefully ill-equipped to ramp up fast enough to give away a billion dollars a year.3 Warren had been giving this problem a lot of thought, and it occurred to him that one way Susie could choose to deal with it was to turn some of the Buffett Foundation money over to the Gates Foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had grown since its establishment in 2000 to a multibillion-dollar ([Location 12799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=12799))

Coca-Cola had changed its policy of requiring directors to retire at age seventy-four to one that merely required directors at that age to submit a letter of resignation for the board to consider. Leaving the Coke board would have let him tap-dance off into the sunset. But for the savior of Salomon to snub a company in trouble would be like sticking a dagger in the stock. “I wouldn’t stay on the board, except I don’t feel like leaving the other guys” to deal with the mess at Coca-Cola, Buffett said.

- The Buffetts had triangulated the shareholder weekend so that Astrid (who considered the whole thing a bore and was pleased to be excused) accompanied Warren only to the backstage social events, just as she did in real life, while Susie attended the “official” public social events in the role of “wife.” She sat in the directors’ section at the meeting and sang onstage with Al Oehrle’s band in the mall at Borsheim’s on Sunday afternoon. Buffett’s supporting cast of loyal Daisy Maes had grown larger over time, and made their own appearances. From time to time throughout the weekend, a clanking sound heralded the approach of Carol Loomis wearing her bracelet hung with a collection of twenty-seven matchbook-size gold and enamel charms, facsimiles of the Berkshire Hathaway annual reports—one for each year she had edited Buffett’s words. Sharon Osberg became part of the show by taking on any shareholder who wanted to play bridge with a champion on Sunday afternoon in the big white tent outside Borsheim’s. Buffett had not yet figured out a way to put his latest Daisy Mae, Devon Spurgeon, to work.

The eBay listing said: “Possibly meet in person Warren Buffett or ask him a question at the meeting.… Winning bidder also receives the visitor’s guide.

People did not take him seriously about not having money until he actually mortgaged his house to fund the show. In a no-lose deal, Warren offered to pay the last ten percent of the cost if Peter could raise the rest. When he had raised two million of the total, his father went ahead and gave him $200,000 of the $300,000 he had promised. Peter then raised the rest of the money himself. From start to finish he struggled against heavy odds to raise funds while trying to stage and produce the show at the same time.

With hindsight, Peter was grateful that his show did not become a vanity project funded by his father—which no one would have taken seriously. He felt that his father had found one of his typically brilliant solutions to complex problems. Peter had his family’s endorsement, for which he was grateful, along with the pride of raising most of the three million needed by himself—although he could have used that last hundred thousand dollars.

Her children each received $10 million. A long list of other people received smaller amounts. She had amended her will in the year before her death through a codicil executed by a new lawyer; the codicil gave John McCabe $8 million.1 The secret codicil shocked nearly everyone. Susie had never reconciled the divisions within her world and in the end chose to leave them unexplained. The life she lived for others was her legacy; her inner truth would remain forever unspoken. Thus it would be left to others to form their own interpretations. Warren had long loved his wife as an ideal. She had been the “grounding person who was his connection to the outside world” as well as the “glue that held the family together.”2 After her death, he was never able to look at Susie’s photograph without crying. But he did not lapse into a years-long depression, or commit suicide, as Susie had suggested he might. Instead he mourned. For about two months, he seemed deeply depressed. And then, as most people do, he gradually returned to living his life. Once the dreamlike assumption that “Susie will take care of everything” popped like a soap bubble, Warren began to show a newfound realism.

- they had both avoided facing all these years. He took the blame and went to work setting things right. Gradually, as he passed through the stages of mourning, he brought Astrid more and more into his public life. In December, Warren sent all of his grandchildren large checks as a Christmas gift. He had always paid for their college tuition, but he had never before given them money without any strings attached. Buffett made two exceptions to the checks. He did not include Nicole and Erica Buffett, Peter’s adopted daughters. Big Susie had loved Erica and Nicole. They had shown up at her funeral dressed in long flowing outfits and wailed like a pair of brunette banshees. Susie had left each of her “adored grandchildren,” including Nicole and Erica, $100,000 “as a hug” in her will. But ten days after Susie’s funeral, Warren had told Peter, “By the way, I don’t consider the girls my grandchildren. I don’t want them to expect anything from me in my will.” Peter found this inexplicable. “Are you sure you want to do this?” he asked. His father was undeterred. That Susie had given the girls—who had been adopted after their mother’s divorce from Peter—money and specified that they had the same status as her other grandchildren in her will seemed to have roused Warren’s feelings of possessiveness about money. Two years later, Nicole participated in Jamie Johnson and Nick Kurzon’s documentary The One Percent, a story about the children of the rich. In the documentary, Nicole unwisely positioned herself as a spokesman for the unspoiled Buffett way of life.

He had been scouring the global economy, looking for a country, a market, that was overlooked and undervalued. He had found it in Korea. Night after night, he leafed through the tome, studying column after column of numbers, page by page by page. But the numbers and their nomenclature puzzled him. He realized that he needed to learn a whole new language of business that described a different culture of commerce. So he got another book and figured out everything important there was to know about Korean accounting. That would reduce the odds of getting hornswoggled by the numbers. Once he’d mastered the listings, he began sifting and sorting. It felt something like the old days back at Graham-Newman, when he sat next to the ticker machine clad in his cherished gray cotton jacket.

He had spent all his life rolling up the snowball as if it were an extension of himself; yet he would establish no Warren Buffett Foundation, no Buffett hospital wing, no college or university endowment or building with his name on it. To donate the money without naming something after himself, without controlling personally how it would be spent—to put the money in the coffers of another foundation that he had selected for its competence and efficiency, rather than creating a whole new empire—upended every convention of giving. No major donor had ever done such a thing before. “It was a historic moment in the field of philanthropy globally,” said Doug Bauer of ([Location 13537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=13537))

An unconventional thinker and problem-solver, he was making a gesture against philanthropic waste and grandiosity. The Gates Foundation got its money, but had to spend each installment—and fast. The decision was unusual, highly personal, a form of teaching by example, and—naturally—enormously attention-getting. Meanwhile, in another sense, this was a classic Buffett no-lose deal. He had stunned the world by giving away almost all of his money by earmarking it, yet got to keep most of it until he actually transferred the shares.

But he would not pay a premium price for what he considered a rich man’s trophy, even to play a potentially historic role in media. Long ago, during the days of the Washington Monthly, the unsentimental side of Buffett had divorced his fondness for journalism from his wallet. Nothing had changed that. In Buffett’s lifetime, the rapid “disintermediation” of the entirety of traditional media—that is, the replacement, at varying speeds, of recorded music, movies, newspapers, radio, television, and magazines by a single medium, consisting of the Internet and various hard storage devices such as the personal computer and the iPod—was the greatest change in business that he had ever witnessed in any of the industries he had studied. Even his favorite of Walter Annenberg’s “essentialities,” the Daily Racing Form, had become, for all practical purposes, toast. Buffett would always love reading newspapers, but his investing was tightly focused on simple businesses that were as close to immortal as possible. Newspapers—in fact, any sort of media—no longer qualified. Candy, on the other hand, was an immortal business, and the economics of the candy business remained predictable.

- Buffett’s next move was equally counterintuitive. He wrote various derivative contracts for Berkshire that amounted to optimistic calls on the stock market in various economies. Some of these were direct bets on the market, and others were indirect bets that tied up some of Berkshire’s capital, rendering it unavailable in the event of a market crash. The direct bets were “put options” on four stock indices—the Euro zone, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan—that would expire between 2019 and 2028. Berkshire would pay the buyers if any of the indices were lower at expiration than they had been when the puts were written. The total maximum exposure to these contracts (before taxes, and before $4.9 billion of premiums and the investment income they will earn) was $37.1 billion. Most likely, Berkshire would lose nothing, or a smaller amount. To lose the entire $37.1 ([Location 13826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=13826))

In deciding to insure investors against the risk that most of the world (except China) becomes insolvent, Buffett had handicapped the situation the way he would a catastrophe reinsurance contract—by assessing probabilities—and concluded that he liked the price compared to the risk Berkshire was taking. One curious aspect of these deals was their duration. Buffett had entered into contracts worth tens of billions of dollars, which would take up a chunk of Berkshire’s capital and whose value would not be known until he was between eighty-nine and ninety-eight ([Location 13832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=13832))

- 2009 shareholders meeting) that he did not realize this. He thought of Berkshire, with its “Fort Knox” balance sheet and triple-A credit rating, as having essentially no credit risk, even though investors looked at it differently—quantitatively. If Berkshire could not pay for any reason, they would lose money. The investors bought credit default swaps (CDSs), a type of derivative that insures against credit risk, to make bets that would pay off if Berkshire stock fell. The CDS price, or “swap spread,” is an indicator of a company’s bankruptcy risk. Stocks tend to trade in the reverse direction of their swap spreads. The CDS market has certain flaws, an important one being that a company’s bankruptcy risk grows as its stock price falls, and its stock price falls if its perceived bankruptcy risk rises. This self-reinforcing loop means that even companies with strong finances can find their balance sheets encumbered by perceived credit risk if their stock prices fall when their swap spreads rise. Initially, this feedback loop did not seem important to Berkshire. Its stock price was approaching an all-time high; few people were paying attention to the puts; Berkshire’s balance sheet seemed impregnable. Buffett’s sanguine attitude about the market, as displayed in the ConocoPhillips stock, the derivative deals, and his investing in a pair of Irish banks that were profiting from the booming—some said speculative—Irish economy, was all of a piece with another decision: to maintain large positions in certain stocks, especially financial stocks, but also in the rating agency Moody’s and in Coca-Cola, despite record stock valuations and signs of a bursting real estate bubble.

- might have put it—money down the rathole, and declined. That same month, Buffett proved again that even though he could envision a financial tsunami with unusual clarity, he did not realize one was actually about to sweep over the world. He agreed to invest $3 billion for Berkshire in convertible preferred stock of Dow Chemical, to finance its merger with Rohm and Haas. The 8.5 percent dividend was modest compared to what Buffett had demanded in other such deals, and would appear paltry in hindsight. By September, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had failed and were placed under federal conservatorship. Meanwhile, several funds that invested in subprime mortgages also failed. Lehman Brothers put itself up for sale, and investors began betting against the stock, speculating that Lehman’s losses might be so heavy (or unquantifiable) that it might not find a buyer. The weekend of September 13 and 14, in the domino sequence that Buffett had speculated might occur, Lehman continued to search frantically for a buyer, while Merrill Lynch, its stock price melting, struck a deal to sell itself to Bank of America rather than become the next Bear Stearns. Buffett took distress calls that weekend asking him to invest in various deals, among them syndicates to bail out or else buy pieces of insurance giant AIG, which had lost huge amounts on derivatives trades made by its financial products division. Buffett, who was always good at saying no, refused without hesitation, saying that while he couldn’t quantify how much money AIG needed, it was far more than Berkshire could supply. Hanging over all of these stricken companies was the question: What is too big to fail?

Within days, the Reserve Primary Fund, one of the nation’s largest money market funds, failed because it was holding Lehman bonds. Reserve Primary could only pay investors ninety-seven cents on the dollar, setting off a panic in the credit markets and among retail investors by overturning the assumption that a dollar invested in a supposedly safe money market fund was sacrosanct and would always be worth a dollar. Lenders everywhere began to deny each other credit. This was the nightmare that Buffett had envisioned at Salomon, writ larger because massive growth in the global derivatives market had increased systemic risk over the years.

With part of the price assigned to the value of the warrants, the effective yield on the preferred was more than fifteen percent. This kind of loan-shark interest rate was, at last, what it took to get Buffett to open his wallet and give Goldman his imprimatur, which enabled the firm to raise another $2.5 billion in equity capital. The deal was so rich, he said later, that he couldn’t have gotten it a week earlier, or a week later. Buffett had a longstanding, nostalgic, almost emotional attachment to Goldman, dating from the day his father took him to see Sidney Weinberg when he was ten years old; he liked its management; and, of course, his Goldman banker Byron Trott had helped Berkshire make a lot of money, which Buffett always found endearing. Still, it was astonishing… ([Location 14007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=14007))

- even better terms than the government was getting on its bailouts. Within days of Berkshire’s investment in Goldman, the House of Representatives rejected the Bush administration’s $700 billion bank bailout package. This, combined with the failure of thrift bank Washington Mutual—unprecedented in size—sent the Dow down 777.68 points to 10,365 on September 29, its largest one-day drop in history. Goldman stock swooned, and the blogosphere almost immediately began to call Buffett’s investment in Goldman a failure. Days later, Buffett struck a similar deal with General Electric for both warrants to… ([Location 14018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=14018))

- at a price of $22.25 per share. As with the Goldman deal, Buffett’s presence as an investor enabled GE to raise money from other investors. The extraordinary terms he could exact were the price of his reputation. While Buffett was deal-making, he appeared on the television talk show Charlie Rose on October 1 to stress the need for confidence in the economy and urge Congress to pass the Treasury’s bailout bill. Buffett described the financial crisis as an “economic Pearl Harbor.” The following day, Congress reversed itself and signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to make $700 billion in… ([Location 14024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=14024))

- soon be cited worldwide. His was probably the most influential expression of confidence during the crisis, at a time when hordes of politicians, pundits, and economists were opining in every possible medium. Financial institutions were not the only casualties during this phase of the crisis. Another piece of fallout from the Lehman bankruptcy hit Constellation Energy, which saw its stock decline fifty-eight percent in three days. Constellation reached out to a number of parties seeking rescue; Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy made an offer to buy the entire company for $4.7 billion and Constellation accepted. This offer was a classical Buffett no-lose deal: It was priced at less than half the market value of Constellation the previous week; MidAmerican also injected $1 billion of cash—at a fourteen percent interest rate—into Constellation to provide immediate liquidity, and Buffett locked in the deal with an onerous break-up fee. Whether Berkshire bought Constellation or not, it would make a hefty profit. In December, EDF (Électricité de France SA) offered a far higher competing bid that would pay $4.5 billion for forty-nine percent of… ([Location 14029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=14029))

- Yet even this huge profit was smaller than the $2 billion or so that Berkshire netted in the fall and winter of 2008 from a series of casual trades Buffett made buying distressed corporate bonds. This type of investing was easy and automatic for him; he scanned the bond tables and made his choices based on a few mental calculations the way somebody else might fill out a Sudoku puzzle. As he was picking off bonds, Buffett published a New York Times editorial, “Buy American: I Am,” in which he said that stocks were cheap enough and that while they might get cheaper, looking for the… ([Location 14040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009MYD9F8&location=14040))
