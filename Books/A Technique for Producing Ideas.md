- “After studying just why he is so successful we have come to the conclusion that it all rests on just one thing: he doesn’t sell space; he sells Ideas. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=43))

- “Well,” he said, somewhat ruefully, “we could see that what we ought to do is to sell ideas, all right. But after that we sort of got stuck. “What we are not clear about is just how to get ideas. “So I said maybe you could tell us, and that is what I am here for. “You have produced a lot of advertising ideas. Just how do you get them? The boys are waiting for me to come back and tell them.” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=48))

- But it struck me afterward that maybe the question “How do you get ideas?” wasn’t as silly as it sounded. Maybe there was some answer to it. And off and on I thought about it. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=56))

- An idea, I thought, has some of that mysterious quality which romance lends to tales of the sudden appearance of islands in the South Seas. There, according to ancient mariners, in spots where the charts showed only deep blue sea, there would suddenly appear a lovely atoll above the surface of the waters. An air of magic hung about it. And so it is, I thought, with Ideas. They appear just as suddenly above the surface of the mind—and with that same air of magic and unaccountability. But the scientist knows that the South Sea atoll is the work of countless, unseen coral builders, working below the surface of the sea. And so I asked myself: “Is an idea, too, like this? Is it only the final result of a long series of unseen idea-building processes which go on beneath the surface of the conscious mind? “If so, can these processes be identified, so that they can consciously be followed and utilized? In short, can a formula or technique be developed in answer to the question: How do you get ideas?” ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=60))

- What I now propose to you is the result of a long-time pondering of these questions and of close observation of the work of idea-producing men with whom I have had associations. This has brought me to the conclusion that the production of ideas is just as definite a process as the production of Fords; that the production of ideas, too, runs on an assembly line; that in this production the mind follows an operative technique which can be learned and controlled; and that its effective use is just as much a matter of practice in the technique as is the effective use of any tool. If you ask me why I am willing to give away the valuable formula of this discovery I will confide to you that experience has taught me two things about it: First, the formula is so simple to state that few who hear it really believe in it. Second, while simple to state, it actually requires the hardest kind of intellectual work to follow, so that not all who accept it use it. Thus I broadcast this formula with no real fear of glutting the market in which I make my living. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=70))

- One answer to that question is suggested in the work Mind and Society by the great Italian sociologist Pareto. Pareto thought that all the world could be divided into two main types of people. These types he called, in the French in which he wrote, the speculator and the rentier. In this classification speculator is a term used somewhat in the sense of our word “speculative.” The speculator is the speculative type of person. And the distinguishing characteristic of this type, according to Pareto, is that he is constantly preoccupied with the possibilities of new combinations. Please hold that italicized definition in mind, because we shall return to it later. Note particularly that word pre-occupied, with its brooding quality. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=87))

- The term used by Pareto to describe the other type, the rentier, is translated into English as the stockholder—though he sounds more like the bag holder to me. Such people, he says, are the routine, steady-going, unimaginative, conserving people, whom the speculator manipulates. Whatever we may think of the adequacy of this theory of Pareto’s as an entire explanation of social groups, I think we all recognize that these two types of human beings do exist. Whether they were born that way, or whether their environment and training made them that way, is beside the point. They are. This being the case I suppose it must be true that there are large numbers of people whom no technique for producing ideas will ever help. But it seems to me that the important point for our purpose is that the speculators, or reconstructors of this world, are a very large group. Theirs at least is the inherent capacity to produce ideas, and it is by no means such ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=101))

- a rare capacity. And so, while perhaps not all God’s chilluns got wings, enough have for each of us to hope that we may be among those that have. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=111))

- In learning any art the important things to learn are, first, Principles, and second, Method. This is true of the art of producing ideas. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=119))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So with the art of producing ideas. What is most valuable to know is not where to look for a particular idea, but how to train the mind in the method by which all ideas are produced and how to grasp the principles which are at the source of all ideas. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=128))

- The first of these has already been touched upon in the quotation from Pareto: namely, that an idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=135))

- The second important principle involved is that the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=139))

- With these two general principles in mind—the principle that an idea is a new combination, and the principle that the ability to make new combinations is heightened by an ability to see relationships—with these in mind let us now look at the actual method or procedure by which ideas are produced. As I said before, what I am now about to contend is that in the production of ideas the mind follows a method which is just as definite as the method by which, say, Fords are produced. In other words, that there is a technique for the use of the mind for this purpose; that whenever an idea is produced this technique is followed, consciously or unconsciously; and that this technique can consciously be cultivated and the ability of the mind to produce ideas thereby increased. This technique of the mind follows five steps. I am sure that you will all recognize them individually. But the important thing is to recognize their relationship and to grasp the fact that the mind follows these five steps in definite order—that by no possibility can one of them be taken before the preceding one is completed, if an idea is to be produced. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=161))

- The first of these steps is for the mind to gather its raw material. That, I am sure, will strike you as a simple and obvious truth. Yet it is really amazing to what degree this step is ignored in practice. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=170))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The materials which must be gathered are of two kinds: they are specific and they are general. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=176))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Now this gathering of general materials is important because this is where the previously stated principle comes in—namely, that an idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of elements. In advertising an idea results from a new combination of specific knowledge about products and people with general knowledge about life and events. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=195))

- This, then, is the first step in the technique of producing ideas: the gathering of materials. Part of it, you will see, is a current job and part of it is a life-long job. Before passing on to the next step there are two practical suggestions I might make about this material-gathering process. The first is that if you have any sizable job of specific material gathering to do it is useful to learn the card-index method of doing it. This is simply to get yourself a supply of those little 3 × 5 ruled white cards and use them to write down the items of specific information as you gather them. If you do this, one item to a card, after a while you can begin to classify them by sections of your subject. Eventually you will have a whole file box of them, neatly classified. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=208))

- The second suggestion is that for storing up certain kinds of general material some method of doing it like a scrapbook or file is useful. You will remember the famous scrapbooks which appear throughout the Sherlock Holmes stories and how the master detective spent his spare time indexing and cross-indexing the odd bits of material he gathered there. We run across an enormous amount of fugitive material which can be grist to the idea-producer’s mill—newspaper clippings, publication articles, and original observations. Out of such material it is possible to build a useful source book of ideas. Once I jotted in such a book the question: “Why does every man hope his first child will be a boy?” Five years later it became the headline and idea for one of the most successful advertisements I ever produced. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=217))

- Now, assuming that you have done a workman-like job of gathering material—that you have really worked at the first step—what is the next part of the process that the mind must go through? It is the process of masticating these materials, as you would food that you are preparing for digestion. This part of the process is harder to describe in concrete terms because it goes on entirely inside your head. What you do is to take the different bits of material which you have gathered and feel them all over, as it were, with the tentacles of the mind. You take one fact, turn it this way and that, look at it in different lights, and feel for the meaning of it. You bring two facts together and see how they fit. What you are seeking now is the relationship, a synthesis where everything will come together in a neat combination, like a jig-saw puzzle. And here a strange element comes in. This is that facts sometimes yield up their meaning quicker… ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W5WLJN6&location=226))
