## Highlights
- Much of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=105))
- In the fifth year of our collaboration, we presented our main findings in Science magazine, a publication read by scholars in many disciplines. The article (which is reproduced in full at the end of this book) was titled “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.” ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=179))
- A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome.

- decision making under uncertainty. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=219))
- Five years after the Science article, we published “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,” a ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=224))
- theory of choice that is by some counts more influential than our work on judgment, and is one of the foundations of behavioral economics. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=225))

Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking… ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=248))
- The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel Simon’s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he writes: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” We are not surprised when a two-year-old looks at a dog and says “doggie!” because we are used to the miracle of children learning to recognize and name things. Simon’s point is that the miracles of expert intuition have the same character. Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. Good intuitive judgments come to mind with the same immediacy as “doggie!” Unfortunately, professionals’ intuitions do not all arise from true expertise. Many years… ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=250))
- been impressed. “Boy, do they know how to make a car!” was his explanation. He made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling and was satisfied with himself and with his decision. I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: Is Ford stock currently underpriced? Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock. From… ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=261))
- The specific heuristics that Amos and I studied provide little help in understanding how the executive came to invest in Ford stock, but a broader conception of heuristics now exists, which offers a good account. An important advance is that emotion now looms much larger in our understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past. The executive’s decision would today be described as an example of the affect heuristic, where judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning. When confronted with a problem—choosing a chess move or deciding whether to invest in a stock—the machinery of intuitive thought does… ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=265))

This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an… ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=275))
- Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. The most dramatic demonstration was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=401))
- their book The Invisible Gorilla. They constructed a short film of two teams passing basketballs, one team wearing white shirts, the other wearing black. The viewers of the film are instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team, ignoring the black players. This task is difficult and completely absorbing. Halfway through the video, a woman wearing a gorilla suit appears, crosses the court, thumps her chest, and moves on. The gorilla is in view for 9 seconds. Many thousands of people have seen the video, and about half of them do not notice anything unusual. It is the counting task—and especially the instruction to ignore one of the teams—that causes the blindness. No one who watches the video without that task would miss the gorilla. Seeing and orienting are automatic functions of System 1, but they depend on the allocation of some attention to the relevant stimulus. The authors note that the most remarkable observation of their study is that people find its results very surprising. Indeed, the viewers who fail to ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=402))
- see the gorilla are initially sure that it was not there—they cannot imagine missing such a striking event. The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=409))
- System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=418))
- One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=431))
- One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=453))

- Müller-Lyer illusion. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=459))
- you must learn to mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to them. To implement that rule, you must be able to recognize the illusory pattern and recall what you know about it. If you can do this, you will never again be fooled by the Müller-Lyer illusion. But you will still see one line as longer than the other. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=465))
- The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=487))
- The defining ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=523))
- feature of System 2, in this story, is that its operations are effortful, and one of its main characteristics is laziness, a reluctance to invest more effort than is strictly necessary. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=523))
- Casting about for a useful topic of research, I found an article in Scientific American in which the psychologist Eckhard Hess described the pupil of the eye as a window to the soul. I reread it recently and again found it inspiring. It begins with Hess reporting that his wife had noticed his pupils widening as he watched beautiful nature pictures, and it ends with ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=538))
- two striking pictures of the same good-looking woman, who somehow appears much more attractive in one than in the other. There is only one difference: the pupils of the eyes appear dilated in the attractive picture and constricted in the other. Hess also wrote of belladonna, a pupil-dilating substance that was used as a cosmetic, and of bazaar shoppers who wear dark glasses in ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=541))
- order to hide their level of interest from merchants. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=544))
- One of Hess’s findings especially captured my attention. He had noticed that the pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. His observations indicated that the response to mental effort is distinct ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=544))
- from emotional arousal. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=547))
- During a mental multiplication, the pupil normally dilated to a large size within a few seconds ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=568))
- and stayed large as long as the individual kept working on the problem; it contracted immediately when she found a solution or gave up. As we watched from the corridor, we would sometimes surprise both the owner of the pupil and our guests by asking, “Why did you stop working just now?” The answer from inside the lab was often, “How did you know?” to which we ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=569))
- would reply, “We have a window to your soul.” ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=571))
- Much like the electricity meter outside your house or apartment, the pupils offer an index of the current rate at which mental energy is used. The analogy goes deep. Your use of electricity depends on what you choose to do, whether to light a room or toast a piece of bread. When you turn on a bulb or a toaster, it draws the energy it needs but no ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=588))
- more. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=591))
- In contrast, the response to mental overload is selective and precise: System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=595))
- attention it needs; “spare capacity” is allocated second by second to other tasks. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=596))
- He eventually became the leading authority on “cognitive pupillometry,” and I wrote a book titled Attention and Effort, which was based in large part on what we learned together and on follow-up research I did at Harvard the following year. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=605))
- Studies of the brain have shown that the pattern of activity associated with an action changes as skill increases, with fewer brain regions involved. Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity. A general “law of ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=608))
- least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=611))
- Laziness is built deep into our nature. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=614))
- System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=628))
- between options. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=629))
- Fortunately, cognitive work is not always aversive, and people sometimes expend considerable effort for long periods of time without having to exert willpower. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=695))
- (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=696))
- compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.” Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to racing motorcycles—and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a book is often an optimal experience. Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=699))
- attention. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=702))
- at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy. Their experiments involve successive rather than simultaneous tasks. Baumeister’s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=719))
- depletion. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=722))
- In a typical demonstration, participants who are instructed to stifle their emotional reaction to an emotionally charged film will later perform poorly on a test of physical stamina—how long they can maintain a strong grip on a dynamometer in spite of increasing discomfort. The emotional effort in the first phase of the experiment reduces the ability to withstand ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=722))
- the pain of sustained muscle contraction, and ego-depleted people therefore succumb more quickly to the urge to quit. In another experiment, people are first depleted by a task in which they eat virtuous foods such as radishes and celery while resisting the temptation to indulge in chocolate and rich cookies. Later, these people will give up earlier than normal when faced with a difficult cognitive ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=724))
- task. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=727))
- The evidence is persuasive: activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant. Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=734))
- had to. In several experiments, people were able to resist the effects of ego depletion when given a strong incentive to do so. In contrast, increasing effort is not an option when you must keep six digits in short-term memory while performing a task. Ego depletion is not the same mental state as cognitive busyness. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=736))
- The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=783))
- much as possible. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=785))
- It suggests that when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=794))
- The bat-and-ball problem, the flowers syllogism, and the Michigan/ Detroit problem have something in common. Failing these minitests appears to be, at ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=812))

- What makes some people more susceptible than others to biases of judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled Rationality and the Reflective Mind, which offers a bold and ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=859))
- This remarkable priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=948))
- Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our choices. For instance, most of us think of voting as a deliberate act that reflects our values and our assessments of policies and is not influenced by irrelevancies. Our vote should not be affected by the location of the polling ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=973))
- station, for example, but it is. A study of voting patterns in precincts of Arizona in 2000 showed that the support for propositions to increase the funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location. A separate experiment showed that exposing people to images of classrooms and school lockers also increased the ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=975))
- tendency of participants to support a school initiative. The effect of the images was larger than the difference between parents and other voters! The study of priming has come some way from the initial demonstrations that reminding people of old age makes them walk more slowly. We now know that the effects of priming can reach into every corner of our lives. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=978))
- Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one’s body, an impulse that has been ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1004))
- dubbed the “Lady Macbeth effect.” ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1005))
- I conclude with a perfect demonstration of a priming effect, which was conducted in an office kitchen at a British university. For many years members of that office had paid for the tea or coffee to which they helped themselves during the day by dropping money into an “honesty box.” A list of suggested prices was posted. One day a banner poster was displayed just above the ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1020))
- price list, with no warning or explanation. For a period of ten weeks a new image was presented each week, either flowers or eyes that appeared to be looking directly at the observer. No one commented on the new decorations, but the contributions to the honesty box changed significantly. The posters and the amounts that people put into the cash box (relative to the ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1023))
- amount they consumed) are shown in figure 4. They deserve a close look. Figure 4 On the first week of the experiment (which you can see at the bottom of the figure), two wide-open eyes stare at the coffee or ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1026))
- tea drinkers, whose average contribution was 70 pence per liter of milk. On week 2, the poster shows flowers and average contributions drop to about 15 pence. The trend continues. On average, the users of the kitchen contributed almost three times as much in “eye weeks” as they did in “flower weeks.” Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1030))

- may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions.

- near future. It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. And it does most of this without your conscious awareness of its activities. System 1 is also, as we will see in the following chapters, the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions.

- experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT. Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out gray print. The puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain.

- dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible. You read this correctly: performance was better with the bad font.

- The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect. The term has been in use in psychology for a ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1471))
- century, but it has not come into wide use in everyday language. This is a pity, because the halo effect is a good name for a common bias that plays a large role in shaping our view of people and situations. It is one of the ways the representation of the world that System 1 generates is simpler ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1472))

The stubbornness of an intelligent person is seen as likely to be justified and may actually evoke respect, but intelligence in an envious and stubborn person makes him more dangerous. The halo effect is also an example of suppressed ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1487))
- ambiguity: like the word bank, the adjective stubborn is ambiguous and will be interpreted in a way that makes it coherent with the context. There have been many variations on this research theme. Participants in one study first considered the first three ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1489))

When they had imagined the two individuals, the participants were asked if it was plausible for all six adjectives to describe the same person, and ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1491))
- most of them thought it was impossible! The sequence in which we observe characteristics of a person is often determined by chance. Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005MJFA2W&location=1493))
- To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. This rule is part of good police procedure.
