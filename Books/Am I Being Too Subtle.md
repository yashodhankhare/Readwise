## Highlights
- I can seem gruff. I know that. And I can be impatient. I have an embedded sense of urgency. What I can’t figure out is why so many other people don’t have it. But from an early age I realized that I had a fundamentally different perspective from my peers. And I was willing to trade conformity for authenticity—even when that meant being an outlier, which it usually did, and even if it meant being on my own.

- In real estate I’m known as the Grave Dancer. That was the title of an article I wrote back in 1976, and the nickname stuck. Some might see buying and creating value from others’ mistakes as a form of exploitation, but I see it as giving neglected or devalued assets, in any industry, new life. And often in my career I’ve been the only bidder for them—the last chance for a resurrection. I’m not claiming to be altruistic—just optimistic, and confident that I can turn those assets around. That, in my definition, is an entrepreneur. Someone who doesn’t just see the problems but also sees the solutions—the opportunities. Not surprisingly, a fundamental part of being an entrepreneur aligns with my tendency to walk out of step with the norm. I have a saying: “If everyone is going left, look right.” Conventional wisdom is nothing to me but a reference point. In fact, I believe it can be a horribly debilitating concept. It often boils down to a bunch of people yelling “Go this way!” And once the crowd gets going, it can get real loud real fast. We saw it in the stampede of commercial real estate development in the 1970s and 1980s, the dot-com craze of the 1990s, and the subprime mortgage mania of the 2000s. I make a point of shutting out the noise—doing what makes sense to me. I want everyone’s opinion, because there is tremendous value in being a good listener. But then I determine my own path. I look for clarity, and if something’s not clear, I get more information. That could mean reading various sources of news, understanding new legislation, or meeting with someone halfway across the world. The point is, I don’t make assumptions. But determining my position is the easy part. Once I have formed my opinion, I have to trust my perspective enough to act on it. That means putting my own money behind it. My level of commitment is usually high. And I stay with my decision even when everyone is telling me I’m wrong, which happens a lot. If I had a nickel for every time I heard “Sam, you just don’t understand,” I’d be rich. I believe the fundamentals of business—supply and demand, liquidity equals value, good corporate governance, and reliable partners, to name a few—apply across the board. They inform my decision making, or what I do, just like my philosophies guide how I do it. I run my company as a meritocracy with a moral compass. And for those who raise their… ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=63))

- Since I was a twelve-year-old who spent afternoons exploring the streets of Chicago alone, I’ve been hungry for new experiences. So I’ve never understood the traditionally strict boundary between “work” and “fun.” If I’m being intellectually challenged, if I’m doing things I’ve never done before, if I’m using my creativity and resources to solve problems, if I’m constantly learning—that is fun. There’s a healthy amount of irreverence at my core, and I apply it in an equal-opportunity way—externally and internally. Early on I adopted a philosophy I call the Eleventh Commandment, “Thou shalt not take thyself too seriously,” and it became a governing principle in my life. Big investment deals can get heady at times, and it can be easy to start thinking your brand is bigger than your performance. I never want that to be me. And hopefully it’s contagious. Back in 1985, the Wall Street Journal did a front-page story on me and quoted me saying “If it ain’t fun, we don’t do it.” The next day I walked into the office and all the mailroom guys were wearing T-shirts with that quote. I loved the fact that they thought to do it, that they felt they could, and that they made it happen. That epitomizes the culture at my investment firm, Equity Group Investments (EGI). One of the biggest raps about me is that I’ve been known to use profanity. Sure, sometimes my real estate colleagues will make over/under bets on whether or when I’ll drop the f-bomb onstage at a conference. I simply don’t buy into many of the made-up rules of social convention. I think people often get distracted by these superficialities. For example, I’ve been wearing jeans to work since the 1960s, long before it was acceptable. And to this day, I’m usually ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=103))

- People often ask me, “When are you going to retire?” And I answer, “Retire from what?” I’ve never worked a day in my life. Everything I’ve done has been because I’ve loved doing it, because it was enthralling. I thrive on inspiring and challenging people, giving them new opportunities and watching them grow, and I take enormous pride in their accomplishments. And I never stop pushing—myself or others. I’m seventy-five; I work out every morning at 4:45, I’m at the office by 6:30 a.m., and I don’t get home from work until 7:00 at night.

- But I had enormous respect for my father, and that respect was absolute. He would say, “You don’t have to love me, but you do have to respect me.” I took that directive literally, figuring that if I didn’t open my mouth to talk back, I wasn’t being disrespectful and could retain an ounce of dignity. So when we disagreed, I simply clammed up and refused to speak to him. We sometimes spent months not talking to each other. It made for some very long family dinners, and my mother hated it. One time our silence lasted for three months. I don’t recall what the disputes were about—who cares? We had a lot of them. The bottom line was, if I was angry, I deferred. I wouldn’t take him on. That was the respect he demanded. Ultimately, I always ended up apologizing, prompted by my mother. She would pull me aside and say, “Sammy, you can’t do this.” I’d respond, “Mother, he’s wrong.” And she’d say, “You don’t understand, Sammy. He’s your father, therefore he’s never wrong.” Many years later, in the 1970s, my father and I would go together to the annual dinner for the Jewish Federation—which I referred to as “the big Jew dinner.” It was a fund-raiser, attended by the most prominent Jews in the city. Every year my father gave a substantial donation, and I donated accordingly, less than my father. By 1979 I was successful enough to up my pledge to more than he was giving. But I couldn’t do that unless I cleared it with him first. So I told him, “I’d like to make the following pledge, but I won’t do it if you think that it shows a lack of kavod” (respect). He said, “No, no. That’s wonderful,” and so I did it. I was giving him respect, but he was letting me know that he respected me too. I think that was a turning point for us.

- I would say, “Because it’s fun,” and he’d reply, “You have plenty of time in your life for fun. Now you have to focus. You have to achieve. You have to be directed.

- Our home was traditional and sober in nature, but it had great warmth. We ate dinner as a family every night, and from as early as I can remember, we would discuss world affairs, politics, and current events in the country. My parents never dumbed down the conversation for the kids. It was an environment of metaphors, a Talmudic approach, where lessons were always given from examples or stories. To this day I tell stories as a primary way of getting my point across. My parents were very strong, very smart, and, understandably, slightly ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=295))

- paranoid people. My father was, without question, the patriarch, and my mother was traditionally deferential. It was simply a function of the era in which they were raised. In public, my mother never disagreed with my father. For many years, I mistook her submissive role as weakness. I remember riding in a car with my father one day as he lectured me on how strong my mother really was; that even though it appeared she was the weaker of the two, the reverse was the case in many respects.

- It also led to my first entrepreneurial adventure. On one of my walks I discovered a newsstand underneath the “L” tracks. It was 1953, and a provocative new magazine called Playboy had just made its debut featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover. It sold for 50 cents. I bought a copy and thought it was terrific. So I brought it home to Highland Park, where it wasn’t for sale, and showed it to my friends. One of them offered to buy it. “Three bucks,” I said. After that, I started a little magazine import business and, in the process, learned a lasting business lesson: Where there is scarcity, price is no object. This basic tenet of supply and demand would later become a governing principle of my investment philosophy. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=356))

- I had been in school for what felt like a long time already, and law school was boring beyond belief. I just wasn’t built for the arcane attention to detail and the endless rules and subrules and sub-subrules. Of course later, especially when my deals started to get more complex, I realized my legal education was invaluable; it taught me how to assess, how to think, and where to draw the line. Every day, even today, I use it. I’ve spent my whole career challenging conventional wisdom and creating my own playbook. You can’t do that unless you understand the rules of the game and play well within the lines. It would be like a guy playing football and not knowing where the line of scrimmage is set. As long as you know where everyone else is, you can play the game. As a result, I became a huge advocate of law school, with the caveat that it is numbingly boring. My real estate deals during that time were what kept me sane. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=486))

- Along the way, I learned something about people I’ll never forget. I was trying to buy the next house in the succession of acquisitions, and the owners said, “You just paid eighteen thousand dollars for the house next door, and you’re only offering us eighteen thousand, but our house is a lot nicer.” “But I’m just buying the land; it’s an assemblage for a development,” I explained. “I will be tearing the house down, so it doesn’t matter that it is nicer.” “But our house is worth a lot more. You’ve got to pay us more,” they argued. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=514))

- “If I pay you more, then the people next door will come back and want more money too,” I replied. And then they said, “Pay us more, and we won’t tell them.” I was stunned. I wasn’t naïve, but that was a lesson in human nature that was completely foreign to me and the way I was raised. These people had been friends and neighbors for twenty-five years, and for $1,000, they were willing to throw their neighbors under the bus. I ended up paying them the original price I offered. They could fool their neighbors, but I wasn’t going to. The idea that I was supposed to lie to the people next door—I would never do that. I’ve never forgotten that experience.

- The last property I wanted on that block was a double lot. Every developer in town had been trying to buy it because it was buildable on its own, but no one could figure out how. I refused to accept that it couldn’t be done. It was simply a problem to be solved—an invitation to look at things a different way. For me that has always been where the fun starts.

- I remember this event so clearly because it was at this point in my career that I fully realized the value of tenacity. I just had to assume there was a way through any obstacle, and then I’d find it. This is perhaps my most fundamental principle of entrepreneurialism, and to success in general. But my experience with Mrs. D was also about the value of really listening, which is at the heart of any negotiation.

- That was my first real investment thesis. If I could replicate what I was doing in Ann Arbor in other markets, I could realize some serious upside.

- Jay’s level of intellectual rigor really appealed to me. And I immediately latched on to the understanding that I could cut right to the heart of something complex if I broke the problem into pieces. It was a matter of organizing my thinking. A discipline.

- Bob and I originated the unique culture at EGI that became our company trademark. We abandoned all pretense and established a casual-dress office policy—which, believe me, was unheard of in the rigid world of finance in the 1970s. We invented business casual. Our thinking was that if you dress funny and you’re great at what you do, you’re eccentric. But if you dress funny and you’re just okay at what you do, you’re a schmuck. We were determined to show everyone that we could excel without conforming. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=807))

For me, it all came back to being, in my father’s words, a man of shem tov, a man of good name. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=911))

- I realized that the basics of business are straightforward. It’s largely about risk. If you’ve got a big downside and a small upside, run the other way. If you’ve got a big upside and a small downside, do the deal. Always make sure you’re getting paid for the risk you take, and never risk what you cannot afford to lose. Keep it simple. A scenario that takes four steps instead of one means there are three additional opportunities to fail. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=965))

- In general, the buildings I chose had a few common denominators. First, they had to be available below replacement cost. If I could set rents based on a $10,000-per-unit purchase price, and the sunk costs of new development were $20,000 per unit, a new building would be priced out of the market. Second, they had to be good-quality, well-located properties, which usually perform better than market throughout economic cycles. Tenants tend to stick in the up cycle, and upgrade to nicer space in the down cycle as rental rates fall. So better assets provided more stable cash flow, and that gave us downside protection. Many of the properties I chose also had deferred maintenance. While the structures were good, repairs and upgrades had been neglected. So there was room for improvements that would help us lease more space, often at higher rents, thereby improving the value of the asset. To manage so many properties effectively and with the care needed to protect and enhance their value, I knew the management had to be done in-house. That’s where FPM, our new distressed property management company, came in. We brought our $4 billion of newly acquired assets—apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, and so on—right into FPM.

- The 1970s could have been a disaster for us. They were for many in real estate. Instead, they were a great ride. Our firm ended the decade with an enormous, diverse portfolio, some of which would later seed two of the largest REITs in the industry. Years later, people would ask me, “How did you know when and what to buy?” But all I basically did was create a massive arbitrage—a fixed-rate instrument in an inflationary environment. I essentially took on $4 billion of nonrecourse debt at an average interest rate of 6 percent in an environment with inflation of 9 percent or higher. That means I was already making 3 percent returns the second the deal closed—without doing a thing to the assets. Sure, we picked some terrific properties, but every one didn’t have to be Class A. Overall, it was the creation of an enormous amount of nonrecourse, fixed-rate debt (in some cases three to four hundred basis points, or 3 to 4 percent) below inflation. When we started, my estimate was that we could make $50 million (equivalent to about $250 million today) in five years. What I didn’t envision was that the country would elect Jimmy Carter. As a result, everything he did raised inflation. So we made a lot more. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1036))

- A review of the current list of bestselling fiction reveals a novel that needs to be written. Titled The Grave Dancer, it would be a story of an individual or organization immersed in resurrecting the real estate corpses created by the greatest explosion of real estate lending and building in the country’s history. Somehow, Arthur Haley and Harold Robbins have both missed this great idea for a bestseller containing all the excitement and intrigue of their other chronicles. This bit of hyperbole revealed a very important fact: At its heart, grave dancing was an opportunity to resurrect those assets deserving of a fresh start. It was a bet on my ability to affect a turnaround. And the low entry price paid for the risk I was taking to do it. Grave dancing involves confidence, optimism, conviction, and no small amount of courage. All the opportunity in the world means nothing if you don’t actually pull the trigger. One of my favorite parables is about a man named Moishe. He was an observant Jew who owned an appliance store in Brooklyn.

Please, I’ve never asked you for anything before, but I really need to win the lottery.” Again, the following morning, Moishe checked the lottery results in the newspaper and again he hadn’t won. By the third Saturday, he was desperate. At temple, he again prayed, “God, I’ve got to win the lottery!” Then from on high came… ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1058))

- market. So I created a simple Lucite block engraved with “We Suffer From Knowing the Numbers.” It relayed our frustration with a fundamental truth. We loved doing deals, but we weren’t deal junkies. The ultimate discipline was that we were always committing our own money. We weren’t going to sacrifice the outcome when the numbers said turn the other way. The building boom in the first half of the decade had been intoxicating, yet we had stayed home from the party. But “knowing the numbers” means having the discipline to listen to them—even if they’re not telling you what you want to hear. Some of the best deals, of course, are the ones you don’t do. I ended my 1976 article, “The Grave Dancer,” with an important warning: “Grave dancing is an art that has many potential benefits. But one must be careful while prancing around not to fall into the open pit and join the cadaver. There is often a thin line between the dancer and the danced upon.” Vigilance was essential—as the 1980s would prove. In 1984, eight years after that article, I wrote “The Return of the Grave Dancer” for the same publication. Times had changed. As I wrote, “Like Rip Van Winkle, the Grave Dancer hibernates from one real estate cycle to the next.” ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1068))

Competition skews people’s assessments; as buyers get competitive, the demand for assets inflates pricing, often beyond reason.

- This was my first experience listening to proposals about the great “synergies” of mergers. As an investor and a risk taker, my focus has to be on what is specifically attainable. Buying another company based on the perception of opportunities for cross-selling and other intangible benefits generally represents a much higher level of risk than I believe is justified. Therefore, I concentrate on eliminating redundancies, which measurably reduces the capital required to run the business. This epiphany later became relevant across industries from drugstores, to radio stations, to supermarkets, and others. Redundancies are much more predictable and transparent than theoretical opportunities to add value. My focus is always on the downside. Overly optimistic assumptions lead to the graveyard of corporate acquisitions. Finally, we looked at the railcar business and tried to understand where it was going to go. At that time, owning railcars was considered about the worst thing you could do. I said, “Let’s look at the numbers.” We did, and there was the opportunity based on—you guessed it—supply and demand. In a single year, 1979, the industry had built over 100,000 railcars. Like real estate earlier that decade, the railcar industry had succumbed to easy money and tax incentives for building, and disregarded the realities of demand. That bubble burst in 1981, and over the next ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1169))

- five years the industry built only 20,000 railcars total. During that same period, 65 percent of the existing railcars in the country were scrapped. On the demand side, loadings were flat but stable. I don’t think you need a degree from MIT to follow the two lines: demand was flat, supply was going down. At some point, those two lines were going to intersect, and when they did, anybody with railcars was going to make a lot of money. At the same time, the average utilization of our Itel fleet was only 32 percent due to lack of demand. Across the industry, the average utilization rate for older cars was even lower, so scrappage was increasing. It seemed to me that the logical strategy was to buy up all the used railcars in America. So we did. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1179))

- As the chairman of public companies, I’ve always selected board members based on the assumption that they were cheap consultants to the business, not potted plants. I’ve never hesitated to use them—or to have management teams use them—to further the objectives of the company. Also, board materials are prepared with all relevant information prior to meetings. Board members are expected to read the materials in advance, and the real purpose of the meetings is to generate robust discussion. Our board meetings are often raucous, with frequent interruptions, questions, and commentary. As a result, our companies have always benefited from the combined wisdom of our directors. My experience with Santa Fe also gave me a heightened awareness that companies absolutely need engaged owners. It’s an owner who is willing to give up short-term benefits for long-term gains. It’s an owner who uses vision to steward a company and guide management. And it’s an owner who brings in resources—additional capital, financial expertise, banking relationships, whatever it takes—to help a company and its management team succeed. My interests have always been and will always be directly aligned with the shareholders of the companies I chair. I’ve got a stake. I’ve got skin in the game.

Whether it’s in the boardroom or at the management level, I start with this: Don’t depend on people unless you understand their motivations and you are confident that your interests align with theirs. Be an owner, act like an owner, and when it comes to your investments, do everything you can to make sure everybody is aligned. A lot of Wall Street’s headaches—the executive compensation issues, the accounting scandals, the options backdating, the subprime mortgage mess—can be chalked up to misaligned interests created when there’s too much reliance on outsiders who don’t have a stake. Similarly, a lot of people who get burned by depending on Wall Street analysts, or hedge fund managers, or their local stock picker discover quickly that the advice they’re getting isn’t coming from a committed owner—it’s coming from a professional who is collecting a fee. After all, it ain’t their money. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1223))

- Unfortunately, when people live in a balloon, they tend to shy away from the guy holding the needle. So I wrote an article titled “From Cassandra, With Love” and it ran in the March 1988 Real Estate Issues. Cassandra was a character in Greek legend cursed by Apollo with the ability to make accurate predictions that no one believed. In my article, I presented a dire warning to the real estate industry, which, not surprisingly, no one took seriously. I cited the panic I was seeing. It was fragmented but spreading. The downturn was being grossly underestimated. People were asking when it would end, but that was the wrong question. This time, as I pointed out in my article, there was a structural change in real estate that went deeper than the normal peaks and valleys of a boom-bust cycle. Although oversupply was definitely a factor, the damage was compounded by other emerging realities in the marketplace. I likened the fuzzy thinking to that of a postoperative patient waking up in the recovery room. Before he even knows the extent of the damage and the fix, his first reaction is that he’s been through the worst of it and all will be well. But the prognosis of a patient suffering from a broken leg is radically different from one who just had his leg amputated.

- can’t know the difference until the drugs wear off and the full reality of his situation sets in. In the real estate scenario, the drug was easy Japanese money, which led to overbuilding and overinvesting and simultaneously disguised massive permanent changes for the industry. They included the obliteration of dedicated real estate lenders through the savings and loan crisis and extreme tax reform. S&Ls provided federally insured loans at long-term fixed interest rates. When inflation rose and the Fed doubled rates, S&Ls were no longer competitive for depositors and lost much of their business to money markets, depleting the banks’ coffers. Out of desperation, many S&Ls made risky speculative loans and in some cases committed fraud, which exacerbated the scenario. With S&Ls on life support, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 86) dealt another crushing blow to the real estate industry by destroying one of the primary motivators of real estate investment—capital gains and other tax benefits. Until TRA 86, real estate investors were largely passive. Syndicates of investors (many of whom were doctors, lawyers, or businessmen like my father) pooled their money to buy properties and hired management companies to run them. They used the depreciation of real estate as a tax break to offset their other income. It was a sweet deal. But TRA 86 dramatically reduced the value of real estate as an investment to them by sharply limiting the tax benefits. As I laid it out in my “Cassandra” article: “The prognostication herein represents a bitter pill to a consumptive and macho industry. Failure to recognize and differentiate between past overbuilding and structural change in demand, use and affordability will be viewed with the same historical reference held by those who opened the gates to Troy.” I got a lot of flak for that article. Some people said, “Sam keeps writing these pessimistic articles because he’s trying to save all of the good deals for himself.” What they didn’t appreciate was that I wasn’t pessimistic. I was realistic. Eyes wide open. There was another big difference between the pending opportunities in the 1980s compared to the 1970s. In the 1970s, the real estate crisis created opportunities to buy assets at very cheap prices. Sellers provided financing because they didn’t have to mark the assets down to market. In the 1980s, owners were going to have to take the write-downs. Therefore, to buy discounted assets, I would need a lot of cash.

- Risk is the ultimate differentiator. I have always had a deep and complex relationship with it. I am not a reckless person, but taking risks is really the only way to consistently achieve above-average returns—in life as well as in investments. My father proved that when he left Poland. I am probably more comfortable with risk than most people. That’s because I do as much as I can to understand it. To me, risk-taking rests on the ability to see all the variables and then identify the ones that will make or break you. Sure, I’m always looking for unlocked potential, for strong fundamentals in a business that suggest a high probability of success. But everybody wants to look at how good a deal can get. People love focusing on the upside. That’s where the fun is. What amazes me is how superficially they consider the downside. For me, the calculation in making a deal starts with the downside. If I can identify that, then I understand the risk I’m taking. What’s the outcome if everything goes wrong? What actions would we take? Can I bear the cost? Can I survive it?

- they can be disastrous. Of course, none was worse in our lifetime than September 11, 2001. It was an indelible heartbreak. And in the months that followed, as the country struggled to regain its footing, the economy and, in particular, the travel industry, were devastated. In 1993, we had invested in a bankrupt company called American Hawaii Cruises and merged it into our existing cruise ship company, American Classic Voyages. American Hawaii had a fleet of two ships built in the 1950s, was overleveraged, and had no solid business strategy. They operated interisland Hawaiian tours. Passengers would fly in and out of Hawaii and stay on American Hawaii’s ships so they could travel between the islands at night and spend very few waking hours at sea. The opportunity was in the fact that maritime law, in the form of the Jones Act, prevents foreign-built or foreign-flagged ships from conducting coastal trade in the U.S. In the case of tourism, foreign vessels have to either drop off or pick up passengers from a non-U.S. port, certainly not convenient for interisland vacationing in Hawaii. American Hawaii had the last two operating cruise ships built in the U.S. Most of the other domestically built ships in the industry had been scrapped, and demand for travel and tourism was increasing. So essentially, American Hawaii Cruises had a monopoly on the passenger cruise ship market among the Hawaiian Islands.

- could keep it if we could figure out how to build more ships in the U.S. It was highly inefficient to construct these huge horizontal floating hotels on American soil because the only shipyards capable of the task were used solely by the military. Adapting them to build customized, consumer-oriented products was an ambitious program. Our plan was to begin by refurbishing our two forty-plus-year-old existing ships and then follow with the construction of two new ones. The latter would be the first major cruise ships built domestically since the 1950s. We lobbied Congress, and the idea of boosting this sector in U.S. manufacturing caught on. Congress secured our loan guarantees, significantly reducing our cost of capital. Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, won the contract and began refurbishing our first ship. It was scheduled to begin service by late 2002, and the second ship was slated for 2004. The scenario positioned American Classic for a great decade of growth. Then September 11 happened. Since American Classic’s business was predicated on passengers flying to Hawaii to access our ships, the… ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=1859))

I sat down with Tim Callahan, who was the CEO of Equity Office at the time, and I told him this was another “hometown” deal. The effort to win it would be massive, with a small probability of winning. As an aside, I also mentioned that I didn’t really want to own a target.

Other large media companies were suffering from falling revenues as well. The onslaught of the Internet and its easy, free information and limitless advertising possibilities presented traditional media with an existential crisis—a question of identity that went to the heart of how the media industry would evolve in the decades ahead.

- In 2009, I read that Louis Vuitton and other high-end retailers were opening up stores in Mongolia. Huh? That got my attention. Mongolia had fewer than 3 million people, and over 700,000 of them were nomads. What would nomads need with Louis Vuitton? And Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s largest city, was hardly world class. But Mongolia had begun development of one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, the Oyu Tolgoi mine. It is well located to feed the insatiable commodity needs of China, whose border is about fifty miles away. The mine was expected to increase Mongolia’s GDP by about 20 percent a year, and it was making a lot of Mongolians very rich. So I went to Mongolia to check it out. When I got there, I met with the developer of Oyu Tolgoi and he took me on a tour. I was staggered by the scale of the undertaking. I’d been inclined to avoid the mining industry before, and this experience reaffirmed my attitude. The capital expenditure required to develop a mine that was 1.2 kilometers below the surface with a potential mineral supply of more than fifty years was daunting beyond belief—$10 billion just to bring the mine into production. I chose not to invest because of what happens at the end of every commodity cycle—more supply than demand. It was a great trip, though, except for the food, which must be an acquired taste. After my first encounter with the smell of yak butter, which is a local staple, I restricted my diet to bananas and bread for the rest of my trip. It shouldn’t be surprising that, as the son of immigrants, I have an international orientation. Even as a young man, I was very interested in what was going on in the world and how events were relevant to my future. This wasn’t just true in business. My innate curiosity also made me a world traveler. I’m intrigued by change and events surrounding it. Change leads to new experiences and opportunity. When I read or hear about a place that intrigues me, I go there. I’ve always been that way. But over the past twenty-five years in particular, I’ve made a concerted effort to see as much of the world as possible. Sometimes the impetus is a motorcycle trip, which lets me experience the landscapes and cultures close up. Other times it’s an intriguing trend or anomaly—something I’ve read that piqued my curiosity as a potential business opportunity. Often it’s both.

It had a great multinational tenant roster, from Exxon to Citigroup, and was poised for growth throughout the region. In early 2004, as Chavez’s rhetoric about the government’s reach increased, our local partner said, “Don’t worry about what he says; worry about what he does.” Then, later that year, our partner called us and said, “Chavez is starting to take action. Now it’s time to worry.” It was a mad rush to the exit, and we weren’t the only ones scrambling. But because we had a great partner on the ground, we were able to sell our position soon after. It was at a loss, but a much better outcome than if we hadn’t had his local expertise and influence. ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2095))

- I’m drawn to emerging markets because of their built-in demand. I’ve always believed in buying into in-place demand rather than trying to create it. To me, international investing is largely a story of demography. Just look at population growth. Most of the developed countries (e.g., U.K., France, Japan, Spain, Italy) have aging populations and are ending each year with flat or negative population growth rates. For instance, we don’t spend much time looking at Western Europe. It’s Disneyland. It’s great for wine and castles and cheese, but there’s no growth there. Further, Europe has the largest population of pensioners in the world. The number of retirees who don’t work is close to double what we have in the U.S. and most of those European countries fund each year’s pensions from taxes. It begs the question, with a shrinking workforce where will that money come from? ([Location 2115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2115))

When I think about this perspective, I often find myself contemplating my father’s way. By the time I knew him, he was very conservative and very risk averse. And yet before I was born, he had taken an extraordinary risk—with no real ability to foresee how things would turn out. There were times when he and my mother were escaping from Poland that it looked doubtful they would survive. That changes a person, and I don’t think that vestige of fear ever fully leaves you. By the time he arrived in the United States, my father’s orientation was to work hard and keep his head down, stay under the radar, and avoid any risk. However, he created a son—me—who was part of a new generation. I learned from observing and listening to him, and that made me… ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2627))

- Keep Your Eyes (and Mind) Wide Open Did you ever wonder how the Jews allowed the Nazis to come into Poland without taking action? I asked my father that when I was little, and I’ll never forget what he said. The Jewish community in Poland at the time was extraordinarily myopic—it had little idea what was going on in the world. And it cost most of them the ultimate price. In contrast, my father’s macro understanding of world events and the conviction to act saved the lives of my family. I apply the same strategy on a much less life-and-death scale. I rely on a macro perspective to identify opportunities and make better decisions, both in my investment activity and in leading my portfolio companies. I am always questioning, always calculating the implications of broader events. How will worldwide depressed currencies affect capital flows and world trade? Does it create opportunity for international expansion among multinational companies? What real estate needs will they have? How can we get a first-mover advantage into new markets? And on and on. Luckily, I don’t need much sleep. If there’s one consistent theme, it’s that I’m always on the lookout for anomalies or disruptions in an industry, in a market, or in a particular company. Recognizing the psychology of market extremes can lead to attractive points of entry. Any event or pattern out of the ordinary is like a beacon telling me some interesting new opportunity may be emerging. I’ve said it before and I’ll underscore it here: I am a voracious consumer of information. I have honed my ability to digest a lot of information, sift out… ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2639))

- When I negotiate, I spend a lot of time thinking about the person across the table, their motivation and priorities. I work to understand which issues are the deal breakers for them—which three of the twenty things we’re discussing they really care about. And of course I’m crystal clear on the ones that are most important to me. That way we can both get what we want. It’s a win-win—the best kind of deal. On Wall Street I have a reputation for pricing things so the buyer wins. I don’t squeeze out the last nickel. For example, in the late 1980s when I was offering convertible bonds for Itel, I found myself sitting in Merrill Lynch’s New York office one day in front of a very humorless bank representative. He told me, “Merrill Lynch is prepared to buy $200 million of convertible bonds for a six and a half percent return.” “Fine,” I said. “Let’s make it six and three-quarters.” He stared at me, not comprehending. “What?” “Make it six and three quarters,” I repeated. “But Mr. Zell,” he said, “we can do the deal at six and a half.” I said, “I know that. But a quarter of a point means relatively nothing in this transaction for us, and it guarantees that every single buyer makes a profit the moment they buy the issue. And if everybody’s a winner, they’re gonna come back.” I knew that every one of those buyers would then become a candidate to buy from me in the future.

- My definition of “win” is not binary. It is not a zero-sum game. Negotiation that leads to a winner and a loser rarely leads to a successful transaction, or another one down the road. That’s how it’s been throughout my business career. Sometimes my team argues with me—they can’t believe we’re leaving money on the table. But I want to create an environment where everyone wants to keep playing. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2745))

- My son-in-law once observed that my businesses and I are like a brand, and I’m always thinking about protecting the brand. That’s an interesting way of looking at it. What he was basically saying is that in everything I do, I’m consistent, and I’m never tempted to do something that’s at odds with my name. Do things go awry? You bet. But I never go into something sideways, and if it takes a wrong turn I do my best to correct it. ([Location 2749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2749))

- I believe loyalty defines your character. Do you stick with your friend, colleague, or partner when it’s not easy? Do you consider their circumstances as much as you consider your own? The length and strength of my business relationships and the longevity of employee tenure across the Equity companies are among my proudest accomplishments. I have more than my fair share of critics, but nothing speaks more loudly to me than that. ([Location 2761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01K1ATZU4&location=2761))

- Don’t take yourself too seriously. I have to restate it because so many people do. Ego and pride have their places, but when they are not self-regulated, they can be detrimental, if not debilitating. But for me the Eleventh Commandment implies something more. Simply put, it’s being the first person to laugh at yourself. Being able to laugh at yourself has nothing to do with the size of your ego. If anything, you could argue that the fact that you are the subject of your own mirth is a reflection on how highly you value your ego.

- Go All In The minute you acknowledge that a problem is insurmountable, you fail. If you just assume there is a way through to the other side, you’ll usually find it, and you’ll unleash your creativity to do so. I equate this fundamental truth with an entrepreneurial mind-set. It’s tenacity, optimism, drive, and conviction all rolled into one. It’s commitment to get it done, see it through, make it work. In my world, I call that being an owner.

- For me, that means investing time as well as money. It means giving whatever it is—a company or a project—space in my head. I constantly think about it, how to make it better and how to introduce it to new opportunities. All with the goal of making a difference, effecting a positive change. That said, as a rule, I generally don’t let sentimentality influence my business decisions. It’s how I’m wired, but it’s also something Bob and I discussed back when we were first starting out together.

- my business. This was my dream; I won’t impose it on someone else. I tell my kids and grandkids, “Your responsibility is to maximize the skills you were given. But whatever you decide to do, invest everything you have in it—excel. What I’ve done is not the example I wanted to set; it’s the way I’ve done it that I hope you emulate, through focus, effort, and commitment.” This isn’t a dress rehearsal. I try to live full throttle. I believe I was put on this earth to make a difference, and to do that I have to test my limits. I look for ways to do that every day. After all, I think it was Confucius who said, “The definition of a schmuck is someone who’s reached his goals.” It’s up to me to keep moving the end zone, and go for greatness.
