## Highlights
- A picture is not thought out and settled beforehand. While it is being done it changes as one’s thoughts change. And when it is finished, it still goes on changing, according to the state of mind of whoever is looking at it. A picture lives a life like a living creature, undergoing the changes imposed on us by our life from day to day. This is natural enough, as the picture lives only through the man who is looking at it. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=787))

- If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. —Isaac Newton We should stress that most of the ideas in the book are not our own. In many cases, we have simply repackaged well-vetted concepts into what we believe is a much more user-friendly format. As Paul S. has said, think of the book’s building blocks as Legos. We did not invent the Legos in our book, although we feel we have built something unique with them. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=981))

- contributed to our understanding of the concepts we present in the book. In addition to all the individuals we have previously mentioned, there are numerous other people who have provided an insight or relevant subtlety that we included in the book. In some cases, we make reference to them in the text or in a footnote, but in other cases we may have inadvertently left them out. Any oversight is unintentional and we apologize in advance for not being more diligent with our notes. We will seek to correct this deficiency over time as we assemble a reading list of books and journal papers that we feel were relevant and important in our writing the book, which we will make available on our website, ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1033))

- In the words of Judd Kahn, paraphrasing Samuel Johnson, “You never finish a book, you just stop writing.” There is a lot more we could have written, but we had to stop somewhere. Please keep in mind that we do not view this book as a definitive treatise. Rather, we have tried to advance the discussion and add to the overall mosaic of available investment literature. For us, writing the book has generated more questions in our minds than it has answered, which we found both exhilarating and terrifying. One can imagine the world as an infinitely long hallway with doors on either side. To us it felt that we were exposed to other worlds we never knew existed every time we opened one of the doors to look inside, which we found exhilarating. The terrifying part is our recognition that there are many more doors in the hallway that we did ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1040))

- The authors take the position that everyone bleeds the same color blood and are therefore equal. However, for environmental reasons (which we discuss in the next paragraph), economy in writing, and consistency, we wrote primarily in the masculine gender.12 While our preference would be to use a single pronoun throughout the book, unfortunately, this option does not exist in the English language.

- This framework stresses the role information plays in market efficiency and shows that an efficiently priced stock is one that “fully reflects all available information.” From here we establish the conditions or rules required for market efficiency ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1193))

- Armed with these insights, we show the analyst how to begin his research process with the goal of finding situations where genuine mispricings exist. The book establishes the importance of having a variant perspective, a concept created by legendary investor Michael Steinhardt. We show that developing a variant perspective helps the analyst identify the source of the mispricing and provides a process to establish an advantage or edge in the market. The discussion describes the three potential advantages an investor can develop, which mirror the three tenets of market efficiency: An informational advantage is when the investor has information other investors do not have that has not been adequately disseminated in the market. With an ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1229))

- informational advantage the investor can state, “I know this will happen.” An analytical advantage is when the investor looks at the exact same data set as other investors but sees things that other investors don’t see. However, with an analytical advantage the investor can only state, “I think this will happen.” A trading advantage is when the investor can trade or hold the security when other investors are unable or unwilling to take or hold a position.3 ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1235))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We discuss the difference between the two terms and explain that uncertainty is defined as a situation where the potential outcome is indeterminate, while risk is defined as the possibility of loss or injury. We then show that financial risk is present only when capital is committed, which is the only time an investor has the possibility of financial loss. We further demonstrate that there are two types of risk when an investor commits capital—being wrong in estimating intrinsic value or in estimating the time it takes for the mispricing to correct, as we show in Figure I.7. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1245))

- At this point in the book, we will have explained how to: Calculate the range of intrinsic values for a stock. Articulate why the stock is mispriced. Determine whether you have a variant perspective and an advantage over other investors. Assess the investment’s level of risk.

- portfolio manager has four key investment questions he needs answered concerning any idea he is pitched before he will take action. We explain that the manager’s first instinct, when hearing a new idea, is greed, and the question that comes to mind is, “How much money can I make?” However, fear begins to get the better of him as he shifts his thinking from “How much can I make?” to “How much can I lose?,” which becomes the second question he needs answered. If the idea offers sufficient return given the level of risk, there is a third factor that needs to be addressed, which reflects the portfolio manager’s unease that the opportunity looks too good to be true. The question the manager asks himself at this point is, “Why me, O Lord?”4 and the analyst will need to convince him that a genuine mispricing exists to answer this question successfully. Once this concern is put to rest, the portfolio manager most-likely will raise one final issue—“How and when will the next guy figure it out?”—knowing that he will only make money if other investors eventually recognize and correct the mispricing. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1270))

- We show that the most effective pitch is organized into three segments: a 30-second hook, a 2-minute drill, and a longer period of Q&A. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1298))

- Portfolio managers have a template in their mind of what their perfect investment looks like, called a schema. A schema is a type of mental model comprised of the manager’s implicit checklist of investment criteria. The manager’s investment schemas are shaped by their domain-specific knowledge, which is comprised of the facts and experiences they have accumulated over their lifetime. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1323))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As we emphasize throughout the book, it is critical for the analyst to find an idea that fits the portfolio manager’s schema. Most young analysts make the understandable mistake of pitching an idea that they like rather than one that the portfolio manager will like. This approach is like concluding, “I like bacon sundaes, so the portfolio manager will like them, too.” However, whether you like bacon or bacon sundaes is irrelevant. The only question you need to answer is, “Does the portfolio manager likes bacon sundaes?” This insight stresses the importance of identifying and understanding the criteria that comprise the portfolio manager’s investment schema, which we show in Figure I.12, and then selecting an appropriate stock to match it.

Drawing a different conclusion from observing the behavior of other investors clearly falls in the analytical advantage category.

- It is important to note that it is necessary to make estimates for all four subcomponents—timing, duration, magnitude, and growth—to calculate the asset’s future cash flow. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1540))

- The two most popular ratios used in investment analysis—a P/E ratio and an EBITDA multiple—are simply modified versions of the present value of a perpetuity, which is the steady-state cash flow divided by the required discount rate. The formula for a present value of a perpetuity is: ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1849))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- where i = discount rate We can show that a P/E ratio is equivalent to a perpetuity by rearranging the factors used in the formula: We can demonstrate this analysis for a company with earnings of $8.66 per share and a stock price of $117.16: An EBITDA multiple is basically a modified P/E and is nothing more than another version of the business value divided by its cash flow: The valuation in all these cases assumes that the cash flow—EPS (earnings per share) and EBITDA—continues in perpetuity, which is the same assumption used with the perpetuity valuation formula and is nothing more than an abbreviated DCF. ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1852))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If the portfolio manager values a company using a breakup, liquidation, or replacement value calculation, he assumes that the assets will convert to cash in a future liquidation or when a third party acquires the business in a buyout or M&A transaction. However, the acquirer will make the purchase only if he believes he can generate enough cash flow from the business to justify the purchase price. Since the estimate of value in each of these cases is based on what someone else is willing to pay for the business, the valuation, ultimately, is based on a DCF. Even if the portfolio manager invests based on changes in investor expectations, he is relying on someone else placing value on the business’s future cash flows, which follows the preceding logic. Once again, the underlying valuation assumption is based on a DCF. Despite what portfolio managers claim is their preferred valuation method—enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, P/E ratio, price to sales, caprate, Private Market Value, sum of parts or liquidation value—they are performing, at the core, a discounted cash flow analysis, either explicitly or implicitly, whether they admit it or not.

- Bonds that have no set maturity date are called perpetual bonds, or perpetuities for short. Perpetuities pay regular coupon payments like a bond, except perpetual bonds never mature, as the name implies. As a result, the coupon payments continue forever and the principal is never paid back. Because perpetuities have no maturity date, the duration is infinite. We use the following parameters to value the perpetuity: Timing—coupon payments: annual Duration—number of payments: infinite Magnitude—coupon payment rate: 6% Growth—not applicable: payments fixed Uncertainty—probability of default (ability to pay): extremely low Time value of money: 5% Interestingly, calculating the value of a perpetuity is simpler than the DCF model used to value a standard bond because there is no maturity to the cash flows, as we show with the following formula. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1929))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Valuing a business is similar to valuing a perpetuity because the cash flows the business generates last forever (at least in theory), which matches the duration of the coupon payments from a perpetuity. We will, therefore, use the perpetuity valuation formula as the first step in valuing a business. The main difference between the two entities is that the coupon payments (cash flows) are contractually set with a bond (even with a perpetuity) and are usually the same amount each period. This condition is not the case with a lemonade stand, or any other business, for that matter, because the business’s future cash flows can, and will, vary from year to year—greatly in some cases. We show the differences in the parameters used in a DCF to value a bond, a perpetuity, and an operating business in Table 2.3.

Valuing any asset using the perpetuity formula requires that the cash flows remain constant over time. Although this assumption is unrealistic for an ongoing business, the exercise offers valuable insights and is an important step in ultimately understanding how to value an ongoing… ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1961))

- Zoe’s Lemonade Stand generates $120 of cash flow each year, as we show in Table 2.1. The present value of the lemonade stand using the perpetuity formula, with a discount rate of 8.5%, equals $1,412, as shown here: The calculation captures the six valuation components we discuss in the prior chapter. For instance, because we are using estimated annual cash flows and have set them to be the same each year, the estimates capture timing and magnitude. Also, because we assume the business will generate cash flow every year in the future, the estimates capture duration. And, as with the perpetuity, the discount rate captures the time value of money and uncertainty. What is not captured with this formula is growth, which we discuss in further detail in the next section. How to Calculate the Present Value of a Growing Cash Flow Stream Using a Two-Stage DCF Model The valuation process up to this point has been relatively straightforward, mostly because we either knew all the inputs to the DCF model or made simplifying assumptions.… ([Location 1979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1979))

- is highly sensitive to the assumptions employed. A standard method used to value growth is to split the cash flow estimates into multiple stages, which allows the analyst to apply a different growth rate to each stage, and then value each stage separately, with the most common approach using a two-stage model. Using a two-stage model, individual cash flow estimates are made for each year in the first stage, which is called the explicit forecast period, and then each cash flow estimate is discounted back to its present value, as we have done in each example up to this point. The second stage, called the… ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=1992))

- How to Think About the Discount Rate We have used a discount rate of 8.5% in all examples up to this point. We need to address the question, “Is 8.5% the proper discount rate to use?” or what we think is an even better question, “How do we determine what is the appropriate discount rate?” An in-depth discussion of discount rates is beyond the scope of this book, as academics in finance and investment professionals have published hundreds of books and thousands of journal articles debating the topic. We discuss ways to think about what might be a proper discount rate instead. Calculating the Cost of Capital ([Location 2094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2094))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The “correct” rate to use in the discounting process is the company’s cost of capital, which also represents investors’ opportunity cost, making the two returns opposite sides of the same coin. The cost of capital is the rate of return an investor demands to make an investment, while the opportunity cost is the foregone return the investor gives up when he chooses one investment opportunity over another one. A company’s cost of capital has three main components: The ratio between debt and equity financing The after-tax interest on the company’s borrowings (cost of debt) The cost of equity Because the cost of capital is weighted by the ratio of debt to equity, it is called the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which is known as WACC and calculated using the following formula: Where: Debt = value of debt Equity = market value of equity rdebt = cost of debt requity = cost of equity t = corporate tax rate ([Location 2101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2101))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Calculating a company’s cost of debt is straightforward, as we show later in the chapter . Calculating a company’s cost of equity, on the other hand, is complicated and requires further explanation. A company’s cost of equity is the return that is required to compensate individuals for investing in the company and is the rate of return investors expect to receive for owning the stock. The return must compensate the individual for the time value of money as well as for the uncertainty of the company’s future financial performance. In other words, the company’s cost of equity is the rate of return necessary to entice investors to purchase the company’s stock.

- expected return for a security equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The risk-free rate compensates the investor for the time value of money and is customarily represented by the yield on long-term government bonds, such as U.S. Treasuries, while the rest of the equation represents how the investor is compensated for the uncertainty in the business, which requires further explanation.

- The Beta Delusion4 A stock’s beta measures its volatility relative to the market and, according to academic finance, represents the stock’s market-related risk. The market premium is the expected market return plus the risk-free rate and is the additional return necessary to compensate investors for holding stocks rather than risk-free assets such as government bonds. The CAPM combines a stock’s beta with the market premium to produce the expected return of the stock given its relative volatility to the… ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2134))

- stock’s risk. A stock with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the overall market and is viewed as a riskier asset, at least in theoretical finance, while a stock with a beta less than 1 is less volatile than the market and is viewed as less risky. Academics in finance argue that beta is important because it represents the stock’s market-related risk, which cannot be reduced by diversification and, therefore, is the only risk for which investors should be compensated above the risk-free rate. Theoretical finance further states that because a stock’s beta is the appropriate measure of the stock’s risk, the capital asset pricing model can be used to determine a company’s expected return, which is equivalent to the company’s cost of equity. Professional investors rarely view a stock’s volatility as the primary risk of investing in a company and, in turn, dismiss beta’s relevancy to investing because it is calculated without regard to the fundamentals of the business. Seth Klarman wrote in Margin of Safety, “I find it preposterous that a single number reflecting past price fluctuations could be thought to completely describe the risk in a security. Beta views risk solely from the perspective of market prices, failing to take into consideration specific business fundamentals or economic developments. The reality is that past security price volatility does not reliably predict future investment performance (or even future volatility) and therefore is a poor measure of risk.”5 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Chemtura In the following example, we use Chemtura, a specialty chemical company, to show how to calculate a public company’s weighted average cost of capital, using the CAPM. Calculating the company’s cost of debt is relatively easy.

- There are numerous factors other than the stock’s relative volatility that should to be considered when determining a company’s cost of capital. These factors are the building blocks of the discount rate stack, which we show in Figure 2.10. ([Location 2191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2191))

- Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, two of the greatest investors in history, seem to agree with the challenges we outline above, as is reflected in their comments on the topic during the Berkshire Hathaway 2003 annual meeting: Buffett: Charlie and I don’t know our cost of capital. It’s taught in business schools, but we’re skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital that we have. We measure everything against our alternatives. I’ve never seen a cost of capital calculation that made sense to me. Have you, Charlie? Munger: Never. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs—in other words, it’s your alternatives that matter. That’s how we make all of our decisions. The rest of the world has gone off on some kick—there’s even a cost of equity capital—perfectly amazing mental malfunction.8 Buffett and Munger acknowledge that calculating a company’s cost of capital, at best, is an inexact art and one that will not result in reaching a precise estimate.

- Professor Bruce Greenwald instructs the students in his value investing class to “Just use 10%. It’s close enough and it makes the math easy.” We agree that it is reasonably safe to use 10% as an estimate for the cost of capital when calculating a company’s value. The analyst can always adjust the rate (up or down) as he gains additional insight into the uncertainties facing the company.

- For simplicity, invested capital is equivalent to the amount of cash invested in the business, which in Zoe’s case is all the different items she needs to purchase to get the business up and running. More formally, invested capital is defined as follows: ([Location 2438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2438))

- The dollar amount of the cost of capital is called a capital charge, which equals the company’s cost of capital times the amount of capital invested in the business. ([Location 2478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2478))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It is important to fully understand the concept of a capital charge to follow the examples in the rest of the chapter. A capital charge is nothing more than the dollar equivalent of the cost of capital and is calculated by multiplying the amount of invested capital by the cost of capital. For instance, if Zoe’s cost of capital is 8.5% (as we assume throughout the book), then the capital charge on the $600 of capital she invested in the business would be $51 per year. If Zoe funds the lemonade stand exclusively from borrowing money ([Location 2486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2486))

- at a rate of 8.5%, her cost of capital would be a real cash expense and it would be easy to identify the capital charge because interest expense is a line item on the income statement. On the other hand, Zoe will still have a capital charge if she funds the business entirely with equity. However, unlike interest expense, the equity capital charge is a noncash expense and there is no explicit line item on the income statement reflecting the charge. Although there is an obvious financial cost with equity, we have found that it is hard for many investors (and most senior executives) to comprehend its importance because there is no actual cash or corresponding accounting expense associated with ([Location 2490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2490))

- There are four main sources of competitive advantage: customer-facing advantages, production advantages, efficiency advantages, and advantages due to government policy. ([Location 2576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=2576))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Competitive advantages that allow a company to charge a higher price are generally referred to as customer-facing advantages, which implies that the customer is willing to stick with their current supplier and pay the higher price rather than pay a lower price by switching to a new supplier. These advantages exist when the customer is faced with search costs, switching costs, or buying habits. Customer captivity based on search costs occurs when a consumer cannot or will not take the time to compare competing products or services. This customer behavior is generally found with purchases that are infrequent and involve decisions that are critically important. For example, if your car breaks down on a rainy night, you probably won’t call four different towing companies to see which one is the cheapest. Customer captivity based on switching costs arises in situations when there is a prohibitively high cost in terms of time or money to switch from one product to another.

A company with a cost advantage can either charge the same price for its products as competitors, generating higher profitability and return on capital; or, charge a lower price for its products than competitors, potentially gaining market share, yet still maintaining its profitability and high return on capital.

- The final potential source of competitive advantage is advantage due to government policy. In some instances, governments can limit entry into specific markets. This barrier provides existing firms with a competitive advantage, which will exist only for as long as the regulation remains in place. Government policies affecting competition usually involve antitrust, zoning, or environmental regulations; patents; tariffs; quotas; and subsidies.

- We have found that a company’s competitive advantage will be sustainable if, and only if, it possesses a true customer-facing advantage coupled with a scale-based advantage. The customer-facing advantage makes it hard for competitors to steal customers, and the scale-based advantage provides the incumbent vendor with lower operating costs. The two advantages reinforce each other and make it extremely challenging for any new company to enter the market successfully.

- To arrive at the definition of the value of a company’s competitive advantage: The estimated value of a company’s competitive advantage is the sum of the estimated cash flow solely generated by excess returns, over the period that the company can sustain those excess returns, discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows.

- As we demonstrate in the examples above, a business does not create value for its owners simply by producing owner earnings; rather, a business creates value only when it generates excess returns (returns above its cost of capital). We need to be more precise with the terms when we discuss growth, however. Growth in owner earnings creates incremental value only if the growth generates positive excess returns. And because essentially all growth requires additional investment, any incremental growth in owner earnings needs to be netted against the capital charge associated with the additional investment necessary to support the growth. Consequently (and at the risk of being repetitive), the perceived value of growth can be misleading because, counterintuitively, nominal incremental growth in owner earnings does not always increase the incremental value of the business, as we demonstrate in the following examples.

- Since virtually all growth requires incremental investment, the return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) can be thought of as the nominal speed. The associated capital charge (WACC * incremental invested capital) from the incremental investment can be thought of as the speed of the sidewalk moving in the opposite direction. The difference between the ROIIC and the cost of capital (WACC) can be thought of as the real speed, which is the net forward progress or, in the case of a business, the incremental value created from growth.

- As the table shows, the difference between the nominal ROIIC and the WACC is the real or excess return, which will be positive when the ROIIC is greater than WACC, zero when the ROIIC equals WACC, and negative when the ROIIC is less than WACC. Therefore, growth creates negative incremental value if the incremental investment earns only 3%, no incremental value if the investment earns 8.5%, and positive incremental value if the investment earns 20%.

- What is “Intrinsic Value”? One might ask: “Isn’t the definition of intrinsic value simply the value of the business?” Yes and no. While Benjamin Graham and David Dodd introduce the term intrinsic value in their seminal work Security Analysis, first published in 1934, surprisingly, the authors never provide a specific definition. ([Location 3406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=3406))

- Rather, they discuss the concept in more general terms. For instance, the first1 mention of the phrase intrinsic value appears on page 16: [In 1922] Wright Aeronautical Corporation stock was selling on the New York Stock Exchange at only $8, although it was paying a $1 dividend, had for some time been earning over $2 a share, and showed more than $8 per share in cash assets in the treasury. In this case analysis would readily have established that the intrinsic value of the issue was substantially above the market price [emphasis added].2 Why doesn’t Graham provide the reader with a clear definition? One could surmise that this decision was intentional as it is likely Graham wanted to force the reader to develop the concept in their own minds.3 Therefore, instead of offering a precise definition, Graham discusses intrinsic value more abstractly: The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of ([Location 3411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=3411))

- a given security. It needs only to establish either that the value is adequate—e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase—or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient. To use a homely simile, it is quite possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote without knowing her age, or that a man is heavier than he should be without knowing his exact weight [emphasis added].4 Graham also emphasizes that it is not easy to calculate intrinsic value: We must recognize, however, that intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts, e.g., the assets, earnings, dividends, [and the company’s] definite prospects . . . and that, it is a great mistake to imagine that intrinsic value is as definite and as determinable as is the market price.5 Like so many things in life, after the more than 80 years since Security Analysis was written, nuance has been lost in the retelling. We can infer that Graham never intended for intrinsic value to be thought of as a single-point estimate of value. Rather, he thought of it as more of a concept of value.

- Graham’s most famous student, Warren Buffett, echoes the same observations in Berkshire’s Owner’s Manual: The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover—and this would apply even to Charlie and me—will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures [emphasis added].

- determined.10 Since value cannot be determined precisely it is unrealistic to attempt to derive a single-point estimate of intrinsic value. Rather, the goal is to estimate a range of approximate values. We have two choices at this point. We can either keep the definition of intrinsic value intentionally vague or forge ahead with the goal of getting closer to a working/practical definition. We chose the second opinion. However, before providing a specific definition, we want to review comments by Buffett, Klarman, and Murray. Buffett provides a succinct definition of intrinsic value in his 1999 Owner’s Manual: Let’s start with intrinsic value, an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.11 Klarman makes a parallel statement in Margin of Safety: While a great many methods of business valuation exist, there are only three that I found useful. The first is an analysis of the going-concern value, known as net present value (NPV) analysis. NPV is the discounted value of all future cash flows that a business is expected to generate.

- Why is it so difficult to beat the market? For starters, generating alpha in the stock market is a zero-sum game,5 meaning that one participant’s gains result only from other participants collectively losing an equivalent amount.

Money itself isn’t lost or made, it’s simply transferred from one perception to another.6 ([Location 3865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=3865))

- William Sharpe, who won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics for his theories of pricing financial assets, published a paper in the Financial Analysts’ Journal titled, “The Arithmetic of Active Management,” in which he demonstrates that the stock market is also a zero-sum game, like the Friday night poker game.

- Sharpe’s argument starts with the simple observation that the holdings of all investors in a particular market aggregate to form that market. In other words, all investors taken together are the market. Therefore, for every investor who wins, there is at least another investor who loses. In the aggregate, it is impossible for the collective of all investors to beat the market. In fact, active investment management is worse than a zero-sum game; it is actually a negative-sum game because of transaction costs and the fees active managers charge their clients.

- The Rules of Market Efficiency There are three conditions that sufficiently describe a market where all available information has been fully reflected in the price of a stock: All available information is (or has been) disseminated to a sufficient number of investors. The information is processed by a sufficient number of investors without any systematic error. The information is expressed and thereby incorporated into the market price by a sufficient number of investors trading the security.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For the purposes of market efficiency, we use the concept of a threshold dose, which equates to the number of investors required to reach the threshold for information to be adequately disseminated, properly processed, and fully incorporated in the stock price. Although it is often impossible to know when this threshold is met, and the number of investors is sufficient to satisfy the rules, we explain in the next chapter how the market gets closer to the threshold level as the number of market participants increases.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The following discussion foreshadows what we cover in the next few chapters as we explore what happens when the tenets do not hold: Rule 1: Dissemination For the market to arrive at an efficient price, all available information must be disseminated to a sufficient number of market participants. This rule necessitates that investors have the information or are aware that it exists. A stock may become mispriced if critical information has not been fully disseminated. Rule 2: Processing The market participants need to process the information to determine what impact it has on their estimate of the stock’s intrinsic value. The rule necessitates that this calculation be done without any widespread systematic error among investors. Although investors have processed the information and have calculated their respective estimates as to the stock’s intrinsic value, these estimates are not yet reflected in the stock price until they are incorporated. A stock may become mispriced if there are not a sufficient number of investors processing the information, resulting in some form of neglect, ([Location 4118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4118))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- or there are a sufficient number of investors, but they have all been influenced by a similar bias resulting in systematic error in in their intrinsic value estimate and that error has become incorporated into the stock price. Rule 3: Incorporation These estimates must be expressed in the marketplace for the information to be fully reflected and incorporated in the stock price. As we discuss more fully later in the book, the only way for an estimate to be incorporated is through trading activity. For example, if there is a research report recommending the purchase or sale of the stock, or someone expresses their opinion on a company in another venue such as on TV, a blog, or an investing website, their opinion will only be incorporated if other market participants take action and trade on the information. A stock may become mispriced if there are impediments preventing investors from trading the stock and incorporating their estimates. If these estimates are not expressed, the information contained in those estimates will not be incorporated into the stock price.

- The Mechanism That Implements the Rules of Market Efficiency While we have outlined the rules that describe market efficiency, we have not explained the mechanism by which those rules are implemented to produce an efficient market price. The Individual’s Process In practice, individuals purchase a stock because they believe its price will increase in the future, which implies that their estimate of intrinsic value is greater than the market price. By simple correlation, investors must have their own estimate of the stock’s intrinsic value to make this determination. Figure 5.10 illustrates a rudimentary process by which an individual calculates their estimate of a stock’s intrinsic value. We expand on this model in more detail in later chapters.

- thousands, of investors all over the world (which we refer to as the collective or the crowd), into a single market price that represents the consensus estimate of the company’s value. When the tenets of the efficient market hypothesis are satisfied, this collective produces an efficient stock price, which we represent in Figure 5.11.

- This collective process is the mechanism governing the three tenets of market efficiency. When this process functions properly, the stock market produces an efficiently priced stock, eliminating any mispricings, which makes it impossible to outperform the market and generate alpha.

We explain in the next chapter how the theory operates and demonstrate how the crowd implements the rules of market efficiency to produce an efficient stock price.

- The Wisdom of Crowds Is Critical to Market Efficiency As we discuss in the previous chapter, when the mechanism governing the three tenets of market efficiency is functioning properly, a stock will be efficiently priced. Why do we care so much about the wisdom of crowds? Because the wisdom of crowds serves as the governing mechanism that implements the three tenets of market efficiency. We explain later in this chapter that when the wisdom of crowds process is functioning properly: Information will be adequately disseminated: market participants will observe, extract, and aggregate information. Information will be processed: market participants will evaluate and make estimates without bias. ([Location 4384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4384))

- For the wisdom of crowds to arrive at an accurate estimate, the first condition states that information must be available and observed by a sufficient number of investors.

- For the wisdom of crowds to function properly, a sufficient number of investors must process information without systematic bias, which implies that the crowd is diverse and independent. The second condition requires that a sufficient number of investors in the group have an adequate level of domain-specific knowledge to form the mental model they need to process the information. In other words, if no one in the group has a clue, the wisdom of crowds will not produce an accurate answer. In his book The Difference, Scott Page uses a simple example to make this point. If 10,000 first graders are asked to guess the weight of a Boeing 747, no one would expect their collective estimate to be close to the aircraft’s actual weight for the simple reason that the children have absolutely no idea, or reference point from which to guess, how much the 747 weighs. The crowd’s guess will not be accurate because none of the children in the crowd has any relevant domain-specific knowledge. In fact, the ([Location 4450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4450))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- children might think the 747 is a toy and guess that it weighs only a few pounds! On the other hand, imagine a group of commercial pilots who fly 747s professionally are asked to guess the plane’s weight, instead of the group of first graders. Because the pilots have deep domain-specific knowledge about 747s, we would expect them to have a general idea as to what the plane weighs. Alternatively, think of a group of aeronautical engineers who might not know the weight of a 747 off the top of their head, but have the expertise to estimate its weight accurately. As we show later in this discussion, members of the crowd do not need to have specific knowledge like the pilots or even relevant expertise like the aeronautical engineers for the crowd to produce an accurate estimate. Even a crowd composed of adults from different walks of life—such as a doctor, a lawyer, and Indian chief; a tinker, tailor, soldier, and spy; a butcher, baker, and candlestick maker—can produce an accurate estimate. While these individuals do not have the expertise that the pilots or the aeronautical engineers possess, they have domain-specific knowledge about the weight of different objects such as a truck or a cargo ship. Using this knowledge, they might be able to arrive at a reasonable guess as to what a 747 weighs. When all of the guesses of this diverse group are averaged, assuming no systematic bias, this “less knowledgeable” crowd will produce a surprisingly accurate estimate of the weight of a 747. However, while exact information is not required, if there is not a sufficient number of individuals in the group with the requisite level of domain-specific knowledge, the process will produce a suboptimal answer, like when the first graders attempted to guess how much a 747 weighs, as shown in Figure 6.4.

- The third condition, diversity, requires that a sufficient number of individuals in the crowd have different backgrounds, education, experiences, or analytical approaches, and use different models to process their observations.

- If too many participants are influenced by the same factor, the crowd’s consensus view collapses to what is essentially a single view or the view of only a few individuals, similar to what happens when a crowd loses its diversity, as described previously. If too many members of the crowd become influenced by the views of others and discount or set aside their own information in reaction to an observation, they are said to be caught in an information cascade, which we discuss in more detail the following chapter. If the crowd is influenced systematically, it will likely produce an inefficiency in pricing. In the extreme, the collapsing of independence can cause a mania, where everyone believes an overly optimistic view of the situation, or a panic, where the crowd believes a doomsday scenario is likely to unfold. Both examples demonstrate how the lack of independence can feed on itself to produce a significant aberration in a stock’s price. Going back to Murray’s magnet analogy, we see the effect in Figure 6.9. ([Location 4536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4536))

- Because diversity and independence are extremely important concepts for understanding the functioning, or potential malfunctioning, of the wisdom of crowds and, in turn, market efficiency, we will further emphasize their difference and interrelation with a simple example.11 ([Location 4550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4550))

- Our next two conditions require that estimates and opinions are expressed, aggregated, and incorporated without significant impediments, and that incentives exist, to ensure that the processed information is fully incorporated into the stock price. If an investor arrives at an estimate but that estimate is not incorporated, the situation will be equivalent to a vote that is not cast. It should be noted that if enough estimates are not incorporated, the private information and domain-specific knowledge contained in an individual’s estimate will not be aggregated with the consensus, which is like the proverbial tree that falls in the woods. If no one is around to hear it, the falling tree does not make a sound. For instance, if someone guessed 12 of 12 correctly in the Academy Awards contest but did not hand in their ballot, their guesses would not be tallied with the results and not incorporated into the consensus view. It would be as if they had never guessed. Also, if there is not a critical mass of people expressing ([Location 4609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4609))

- their answers, the crowd will not be a crowd and the consensus view will reflect only the opinions of the small group of individuals who expressed their opinion, which often results in a suboptimal answer. In the case of the stock market, that suboptimal answer often results in a mispriced stock. We show in Figure 6.12 what happens when an individual goes through the process of arriving at an estimate, but is not incorporated because they are unwilling or unable to express their estimate.13 ([Location 4619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4619))

- The last rule, incentives, is important because individuals will match their effort to the reward offered. For instance, if the prize for guessing the correct number of beans in a jar is $10, then individuals will have less of an incentive to invest time and effort to increase the accuracy of their estimate than if the prize is $10,000. For $10, someone may quickly guess a number because they have only a small incentive to be accurate and win the prize, but for $10,000, the same person will work significantly harder and use much more sophisticated techniques to estimate the correct answer. ([Location 4628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4628))

- Interestingly, incentives do not have to be monetary; they can be in the form of professional recognition or an enhanced reputation, which can be thought of as psychic income or bragging rights. Negative incentives, if present, will keep individuals from making wild, off-the-cuff guesses because there will be a penalty for being wrong. The last two conditions satisfy the third rule of the efficient markets hypothesis: That information is incorporated into the market price by a sufficient number of investors through trading. When all six conditions of the wisdom of crowds are working properly, the result is a wise crowd, which in the stock market results in an efficiently priced stock, one that fully reflects all available information, as shown in Figure ([Location 4634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4634))

- The most popular example of the wisdom of crowds is based on an article written by Sir Francis Galton titled Vox Populi that appeared in Nature magazine’s March 7, 1907, issue. Galton, an accomplished English polymath and statistician, published his analysis of an ox-weighing contest held at the 1906 West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition in Plymouth, England. Each participant in the contest paid 6 pence17 (US$3.84 adjusted for inflation in 2016 dollars) to enter a guess as to what would be the ox’s weight after being slaughtered. The person with the closest guess won a prize. Galton calculated that the average of the 787 guesses was 1,19718 pounds, which was only 1 pound off the actual weight of 1,198 pounds. Even the 86-year-old Galton was surprised by the accuracy of the consensus and the crowd’s “ability” to estimate the slaughtered ox’s true weight.

- While this story has been repeated ad nauseam in just about every book, article, or paper concerning the wisdom of crowds, we felt it important to include it here because the story illustrates certain concepts that are vitally important to the discussion. Many people incorrectly infer from this story that a crowd can generate an accurate guess to just about any question asked, even if the individuals in the crowd know little about the situation (however, as we discuss with the first graders guessing the weight of a Boeing 747, there must be sufficient domain-specific knowledge in the crowd for it to arrive at an accurate answer). Scott Page understood the fallacy of that assumption and points out in his book, The Difference, that “in 1906 people knew a lot about steers.” He goes on to state, “More likely, each had some primitive model of what a steer weighed. These models led to predictions of the steer’s weight. The predictions were not naive shots in the dark.”19 Karl Pearson in his biography of Galton said, “The judgments were unbiased by passion . . . The six-penny fee deterred practical joking, and the hope of a prize and the joy of competition prompted each competitor to do his best. The competitors included butchers and farmers, some of whom were highly expert in judging the weight of cattle.”20 It is also logical to infer that people attending an event titled the “West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition” would probably have a lot more interest in and knowledge about steers than the general population. There would likely be a high level of diversity among attendees at the fair, including a wide range of young and old people, each possessing different levels of knowledge and experience. The fairgoers would be comprised of butchers, cattle ranchers, cattle auctioneers, produce farmers, veterinarians, horse trainers, pig farmers, cooks, and other consumers. This example underscores the importance of domain-specific knowledge and incentives. It should also be noted that there were 800 tickets sold, although, as Galton wrote in his article, “After weeding thirteen cards out of the collection as being defective or illegible, there remained 787 for discussion.” This observation highlights a subtle although important point.

- If an estimate is made by an individual but is not incorporated, it adds nothing to the collective answer—it is as though the guess never existed. This point highlights the importance of an estimate being expressed and included in the aggregation mechanism to be properly incorporated. Using the rudimentary process model in Figure 6.16 to represent how an individual would make a guess in an ox-weighing contest shows that she would first collect data by simply observing the ox. She would process this information to determine how much she believes the ox weighs (drawing from her… ([Location 4718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4718))

- As we mention previously, for the wisdom of crowds to arrive at an accurate answer, the individuals in the crowd must be diverse in their approaches and independent from each other in their analysis and conclusions. To dive deeper into the importance of diversity and independence, we introduce the potentially intimidating diversity prediction theorem, presented in Figure 6.17. The theorem, first introduced by Scott Page in 2007, offers important insight into how crowds produce accurate predictions, such as in the ox-weighing contest. ([Location 4730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4730))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The theorem holds that crowd error (the accuracy of the crowd’s prediction) is a function of average individual error (the accuracy of the average individual) and diversity (the diversity of the crowd’s predictions). Another way to think about this concept is that individual ([Location 4739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4739))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- error is offset by diversity, resulting in a low crowd error. The formula is not nearly as scary as it first appears.22 The first term, to the left of the equal sign, represents the crowd’s error and measures the difference between the crowd’s prediction and the actual value. In the ox-weighing contest, for example, the crowd’s prediction was 1,197 pounds and the actual weight was 1,198 pounds, producing a crowd error of only 1 pound. The second term, just to the right of the equal sign, represents the average individual error and measures how far each individual guess is from the true value. In the ox-weighing contest, each person was, on average, approximately 74 pounds away from the true value of 1,198 pounds. This term captures the crowd’s independence. The third term represents diversity and measures how far each individual’s prediction was, on average, from the crowd’s prediction. This term captures the differences in domain-specific knowledge of individuals within the crowd. Again, these differences include different levels of facts and expertise. The formula shows that diversity offsets the average individual error, which reduces the crowd error. For instance, diversity reduced the average individual error significantly in Galton’s experiment, resulting in a crowd’s error of only 1 pound, as shown in the following analysis: ([Location 4742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4742))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As the calculation shows, the crowd’s error was surprisingly low, at just 1 pound, despite a relatively high average individual error of approximately 74 pounds, because the group’s individual guesses were diverse. We present these results graphically in Figure 6.18, which shows each individual’s error, the average individual error, and the crowd error. The gray area in the chart represents the reduction in the average individual error resulting from the crowd’s diversity.

- Challenges like guessing the weight of an ox are difficult for individuals to estimate and, as a result, have a high level of average individual error. The crowd’s composition plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of the collective estimate in these situations because without diversity, the crowd’s prediction will reflect the high average individual error. In other words, without diversity, all individual guesses will be similar and, most likely, wrong. At the risk of being repetitive, the crowd error in the ox-weighing contest would have equaled the individual error of 74 pounds without diversity. However, because the crowd was diverse, the large individual errors were offset by their wide range (above and below the actual answer), resulting in a low crowd error. If, on the other hand, a problem is easy to estimate accurately, then the individual guesses will be close to the actual answer and the average individual error will be low. The crowd’s diversity also will be low, but not a factor in these situations because all the individual guesses will be similar and accurate, resulting in a low crowd error. To demonstrate this point further, let’s say that it was easy to estimate the ox’s weight and assume that the individual guesses were off from the actual weight by no more than ±1%. The crowd error would be zero, in this case, as it would equal the ox’s actual weight of 1,198 pounds. The ([Location 4769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4769))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- average individual error would be small at just 7 pounds (in contrast to approximately 74 pounds in the actual contest). Diversity reduced the average individual error in the easy-to-estimate scenario by only a small aggregate amount.23 ([Location 4782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4782))

- We show graphically in Figure 6.19 that there is not much of a difference between the crowd’s error and the average individual error in this example when we plot the results using the same scale as we used in Figure 6.18.

- What happens if we introduce a bias and put strain on the second condition, independence? Let’s pretend that there had been a well-known steer-weighing expert (a “steer seer”) at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition who announced to the crowd, “I think that steer weighs 1,400 pounds, so that will be my guess.” Although the steer seer’s estimate is incorrect, his proclamation would introduce a bias if it influences at least some of the individual guesses, thereby reducing the crowd’s independence and increasing its error, as we show in the following example. Let’s assume in this scenario that individuals listen to the steer seer and believe that he may have a more accurate guess than their own. Instead of completely ignoring their original estimate, each individual decides to average their guess with the seer’s prediction,24 as sort of a hedge. As a result, the crowd’s prediction increases to 1,298 pounds. The crowd’s error now overestimates the ox’s actual weight by approximately 100 pounds, which makes sense since the seer’s stated estimate was roughly 200 pounds higher than the correct answer, and the average individual error increases from 74 pounds to 106 pounds. Diversity narrowed the difference between the average ([Location 4794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4794))

- individual error and the crowd error significantly in the original contest. Contrast this result to Figure 6.20, which shows that diversity cannot compensate for the increased individual errors caused by the steer seer’s prognostication, which introduced a bias and reduced the crowd’s independence.

- The second condition of the three market efficiency tenets states that there must be a sufficient number of individuals in the group who have the requisite level domain-specific knowledge, either in the form of facts or expertise. It probably seems counterintuitive, but it is possible for the crowd to arrive at an accurate answer even if most of the crowd has no factual knowledge about the situation. What is required is that some individuals within the crowd have some factual knowledge, even if it is only partial knowledge. As we demonstrate in the pen example, when individuals with only partial information are aggregated together, they can produce accurate answers. Not one person had all the information in that example, yet the crowd produced a highly accurate aggregate answer. We show in the next example that the crowd can have a majority of clueless individuals, a few individuals with some factual knowledge, no individuals with all the factual knowledge, and still produce an accurate answer. The example also demonstrates that as individuals with more information are added to the crowd, the aggregate answer gets even more accurate. We borrow an example from Scott Page’s book to illustrate this facet of the wisdom of crowds, although we modify the story a bit. Page uses the Monkees, an American rock band from the late 1960s, to illustrate this point in his book, while we use the Beatles. In this example, we ask 800 people, “Who on the following list was not a member of the Beatles?”25 Ringo Starr ([Location 4818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4818))

- For anyone raised on the Beatles’ music,26 this is an easy, and perhaps trivial, question. In this example, the participants in the survey have different levels of knowledge about the Beatles. A few of them know a lot about the band and can answer the question easily and quickly, some recognize a band member or two but do not know the correct answer, and 75% of the participants have never heard of the band and will basically have to guess the impostor blindly (which we assume they do randomly). Intuitively, it probably seems unlikely that we ([Location 4835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=4835))

- would get much wisdom from a crowd where most of the people have little or no idea who the Beatles are. The participants’ knowledge of the Beatles breaks down as follows: 2.5%, or 20 people, know all four Beatles 5.0%, or 40 people, know three of the four Beatles 7.5%, or 60 people, know two of the four Beatles 10%, or 80 people, know one Beatle 75%, or 600 people, have no idea who was in the band We use this example to show how the correct answer emerges from the crowd and at the same time show how little knowledge is required for the crowd to get the right answer. Let us assume for the moment that of the first 600 people we surveyed, not one of them had heard of the Beatles. Like the first graders having no clue about the weight of a 747, the participants in the survey cannot determine the correct answer because they simply do not know it. Let us further assume that their pick of the non-Beatle from the five possible choices is random. In this case, each of the five possible band members on the list would get the same number of guesses (120) and no consensus would emerge from the first 600 participants, as shown in Figure 6.21.

- We must emphasize that randomness is critical for the process to work properly. We show with the example of the neon nose and the steer seer that independence is critically important, and any bias will result in an incorrect answer. We assume that since individuals in this group have never heard of the Beatles they will simply pick randomly, as if they each rolled a five-sided die.27 For instance, the rule could be that if one comes up on the die, they pick Ringo, if two comes up they pick Paul, and so on. The probability of any individual number on the die coming up is 20%; therefore, if the crowd picks randomly, then each band member on the list will receive 120 votes.

- Let’s assume that the next 80 people we ask coincidentally each know just one of the four Beatles. Because they know one of the band members, they can eliminate that person from the list, leaving four names from which to choose. For example, let’s say that the first person we ask knows that Ringo is a Beatle but does not know who the non-Beatle is among the remaining four names. Let’s assume he acts independently and picks randomly from the remaining four choices (like rolling a four-sided die28), and identifies George incorrectly as the non-Beatle, as shown in Figure 6.23.

- Assuming the group is independent, this process would continue for the remaining 78 people in the group who each know one of the actual Beatles. At the end of that round, the 80 people will have identified Clarence most often as the non-Beatle, although by only a slim margin. He will receive 140 of the guesses, or 20.6% of the total, versus the other four names each getting 135 of the guesses, or 19.9% of the total, as shown in Figure 6.25.

- Let’s now assume that the next 60 people we ask each know two of the four Beatles, which means that they can eliminate the two band members they know, leaving three names to choose from.

No clear consensus emerges when people have no clue about the correct answer, as the first example shows. Because the individuals guess randomly, each potential band member receives 20% of the guesses. However, as we demonstrate with the subsequent examples, the correct answer emerges quickly as the number of knowledgeable people and their level of knowledge increases, which the charts show clearly.

- As we demonstrate, the crowd correctly identifies Clarence Walker as the non-Beatle even though most the participants (75% of the total) do not know anything about the band. This example shows that we do not need many participants with knowledge for the crowd to arrive at the correct answer. While it may seem incredible, in fact no one in the crowd needs to have complete knowledge for the crowd to make the correct identification, as shown in Figure 6.31, where not a single person knows all four Beatles, yet ([Location 5006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5006))

- Clarence is still outed by a margin of 180 guesses versus the 150 guesses for each of the other band members. However, if no one has any knowledge, there is no wisdom to be extracted from the crowd, as shown in Figure 6.21, where no determination was made. The Beatles experiment demonstrates the fourth condition of the market efficiency tenets, that there must be a sufficient number of individuals in the group who have the requisite level domain-specific knowledge—in the form of either facts or expertise—for the crowd to be wise. How the Crowd Becomes Skewed We can modify the Beatles story to demonstrate what happens if there is a breakdown in independence within the crowd, similar to the example with the steer seer in Galton’s ox-guessing contest. To break the independence and induce a bias, we show the participants the fake album cover (the lost Beatles, Aloha from Hawaii album) before we ask them to pick the non–band member. We then ask the original question, “Which individual from the following list was not a member of the Beatles?” ([Location 5011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5011))

- Although the 20 people who know all four Beatles (and probably know the Beatles never recorded a Hawaiian album) will be amused by the fake cover, they will not be influenced by it and will correctly identify Clarence as the non-Beatle, as they did before. Let’s say that the remaining 780 people we asked are swayed by the fake cover and believe that since Clarence is sitting in the center of the picture, that not only is he a true Beatle, but is also the most prominent member of the band. Let’s assume that when we survey the group of 600 people who have never heard of the Beatles, they all believe Clarence is a real Beatle because of the bias and eliminate him as a choice. If there is no other bias, they will then ([Location 5024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5024))

- The same mistake happens with the 60 people in the group who know two of four and the 40 people in the group who know three of four. They all pick incorrectly. Figure 6.36 shows that the four real Beatles will be identified as a non-Beatle by 780 people who were influenced by the fake cover, while Clarence, the real non-Beatle, will get only the 20 votes from the small group who know all four of the real band members. Although this example is overly simplistic, it demonstrates how breaking independence by introducing a bias can turn the wise crowd into a dumb one.

- Similarly, normal human emotions can introduce biases that may pollute diversity and independence in the stock market and gum up the works of the wisdom of crowds. These biases can undermine the efficient market hypothesis, thus creating distortions and potentially mispriced stocks. These distortions are problematic for some but create opportunities for others. We discuss this in much greater detail in the next chapter. The Wisdom of Crowds Applied to the Stock Market As we discuss earlier in this chapter, the efficient market hypothesis lays out the rules the markets must follow to ensure an efficient market price, while we show that the wisdom of crowds is the governing mechanism by which those rules are implemented. To demonstrate the power of the wisdom of crowds applied to the stock market, we present an example that shows how a crowd of individuals predicted Apple’s 2015 fourth-quarter earnings more accurately than a group of experienced sell side analysts. As we state throughout the book, the estimated intrinsic value of any asset is the sum of the cash flows expected to be produced by that asset, over its useful life, discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows. Since Apple’s reported earnings are a reasonable proxy for the company’s cash flow, we can use this number in the following example.

- The Crowd Is Smarter Than the Experts Most of the Time To illustrate how the wisdom of crowds arrives at an accurate earnings estimate, we use a unique data set provided by Estimize.com, a company founded by Leigh Drogen, that aggregates quarterly earnings estimates from individuals. The Estimize website attracts a broad spectrum of participants, including Wall Street professionals (analysts and portfolio managers), students, academics, industry professionals, and various other interested parties. Estimize uses an aggregation mechanism similar to Galton’s in that they simply tally up the guesses and calculate the average of all the individual estimates. The average earnings estimate for Apple from the 1,183 individual estimates on the Estimize website for the quarter ending September 2015 was $1.91 per share.31 By comparison, the Wall Street consensus estimate of 42 sell-side analysts for the same period was $1.88.32 Apple’s reported earnings for the quarter was $1.96. The Estimize prediction of $1.91 was off by only $0.05, while the average of the 42 professional sell side analysts was off by almost twice as much at $0.08 per share. The crowd was clearly more accurate than the experts in this instance. We show the range of estimates for Estimize and for the Wall Street analysts, graphed against the actual results, in Figure 6.37.

- We should emphasize that this example is not a one-off result. In fact, as we discuss throughout this chapter, the wisdom of crowds process beats experts most of the time, which is supported by academic research showing that the earnings estimates produced by the Estimize collective are more accurate than Wall Street analysts 74% of the time.33 The Apple example also demonstrates how diversity produces a more accurate result. If we run the Estimize estimates for Apple through Scott Page’s diversity prediction theorem, the crowd error equals $0.05, which is the difference between the crowd’s prediction of $1.91 and the actual earnings of $1.96. The crowd’s average individual error (which measures how far the average individual is off from the actual earnings) is $0.09, implying that diversity (how far away the average individual was from the crowd) improved the crowd ([Location 5087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5087))

- Table 6.3. The individual categories include academics, financial professionals, students, and nonprofessionals, with the remaining participants placed in a category labeled “unknown.” Estimize also collected data for the 42 sell-side analysts who published earnings estimates for that quarter. The results (which are sorted by declining crowd error) are surprising. Table 6.3 Apple: Earnings Estimates by Subgroup What is most striking to us is that the Wall Street sell-side analysts produced the highest crowd error at $0.080 ($1.96 actual earnings versus $1.88 average estimate). Their average individual error was $0.094, which means that diversity counteracted the average individual error by only $0.014, or 15%, implying that the group was not particularly diverse. The fact that 42 Wall Street analysts are not that diverse should not be surprising. Analysts have little incentive to be far away from their consensus34 and, because they have much greater access to company management than individual investors, their estimates are probably skewed by management’s guidance, which is a form of bias similar to what we discuss in the ox- ([Location 5107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5107))

- weighing contest. Also, remember that they are sell side analysts, so they are selling more than researching. Finally, because they all receive the same story from the company’s management and do not have a lot of time to do additional research, it should not shock anyone that the individual analysts produce estimates similar to each other and, almost by definition, the group is not all that diverse. The subgroup labeled “financial professionals” is probably the most interesting. This subgroup, which includes professional analysts and portfolio managers, had the highest average individual error at $0.104, which is what we would expect from a complex problem that is difficult to estimate accurately. However, their crowd error was only $0.047, meaning that diversity offset the individual error by $0.057, or 55%, which was the greatest benefit from diversity realized by any of the subgroups. This result might seem counterintuitive at first glance. We would not expect this group to be diverse since we would assume that they would all talk to each other, read the same periodicals, and research reports, and, in turn, produce similar estimates. It is important to remember that these… ([Location 5121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5121))

- them on the website. These analysts are probably independent, competitive, and have incentives to be right. Some of them are likely submitting their estimates for the psychic income of being right; therefore, they will work harder, do more research, and think independently. When we think about this group in that light, their results are not all that surprising. The Apple example not only shows that the crowd beat the experts, but also shows that when a group is homogeneous and lacks independence, such as the Wall Street analysts, it produces estimates with high individual errors and, because of the group’s lack of diversity, also produces a high crowd error. In contrast, a diverse and independent group, such as the financial professionals, has high individual errors, but its crowd error will be low because of the group’s diversity. What happens to the consensus results if we introduce a bias and put a strain on the crowd’s independence?

- because of slowing smartphone sales and that management expected earnings per share for the September quarter to be 10% less than current consensus estimate. It is safe to assume that investors in Apple stock monitor news on Samsung to glean insights into the smartphone market (Samsung was the largest producer of smartphones at the time). Let’s say that the individuals on Estimize are influenced by the Samsung news, although they reduce their earnings estimate by only 5%, rather than Samsung’s 10% shortfall. The crowd’s estimate on Estimize would fall from $1.91 to $1.82 as a result. The Samsung news in this example is like the bias we introduced with the steer seer in the 1906 West of England ox-guessing contest. The average individual error would increase from $0.09 to $0.16, because of the bias, and the crowd would underestimate Apple’s quarterly earnings by $0.14 rather than by $0.05 in the original example.

For instance, in the first edition of Security Analysis, published in 1934, Graham states, “Investment theory should recognize that the merits of an issue reflect themselves in the market price not by any automatic response or mathematical relationship but through the minds and decisions of buyers and sellers.” He also understood the importance of feedback loops, stating “the investors’ mental attitude not only affects the market price but is strongly affected by it.”1 ([Location 5299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5299))

- Returning to the definition of the value of an asset: The estimated value of any asset is the sum of the cash flows expected to be produced by that asset, over its useful life, discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows. We need to emphasize the word expected in the definition. Investors make their decisions based on their expectations about the future. Using this definition, we can say that under most conditions, Mr. Market’s expectations for the company’s future cash flows will be “plausible and justified by business developments and prospects.” However, there will be times when Mr. Market’s fear or greed unduly influences his expectations of future events and alters the value he places on the company. The overreaction drives the market price away from the company’s intrinsic value producing a mispricing. ([Location 5324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5324))

- When the Wisdom of Crowds Becomes the Madness of Crowds As we discuss in the previous chapter, if the market processes information absent any systematic error, then the stock will be efficiently priced. On the other hand, if we can identify a systematic bias in the market, then there is a reasonable likelihood that the consensus has overreacted and produced a pricing error. However, any apparent error in the market price must be linked to either the dissemination, processing, or incorporation of information because a systematic bias that results in an error can only occur if there is a failure in at least one of the following conditions of the wisdom of crowds: Information is either not available or not being observed by a sufficient number of investors. There is an insufficient amount of domain-specific knowledge within the collective. The crowd lacks diversity. There is a breakdown in the crowd’s independence.

- It is important to state up front that behavioral finance can cause mispricings in only three of the six factors just listed: diversity, independence, and incorporation. As we demonstrate with the pen contest, Galton’s ox, Beatles, and Apple examples in the prior chapter, the crowd will arrive at an accurate estimate even if information is available and observed by only a small portion of individuals in the crowd. Interestingly, there are few situations in the stock market where the lack of domain-specific knowledge or insufficient incentives causes significant mispricings. Therefore, if Mr. Market has allowed his emotions to get the better of him, the systematic bias produces an error if it either reduces the crowd’s diversity, results in a breakdown in the crowd’s independence, or produces a limitation in the crowd’s ability to incorporate its view into the stock price.

- In other words, we are genetically programmed to be lazy. As with our bodies, we are also conditioned to be lazy with our minds, striving to minimize our mental effort, which is also known by its more academic title—cognitive load. Here, too, we have evolved to rely on mental shortcuts whenever possible. Evolutionary psychology teaches us that humans developed conditioned reflexes, which were driven by our need for self-preservation. For example, when our ancestors on the savanna heard a rustling in the bushes, they feared for their lives and ran away, driven by fright, confusion, and stress. Those who weren’t afraid and didn’t respond quickly enough were eaten. To survive, humans evolved different heuristics—mental “hacks” or shortcuts—to help us navigate our ancestral environment, while conserving as much energy as possible. Unfortunately, the heuristics that allowed humans to survive and flourish thousands of years ago are potentially harmful to our health in modern society and specifically our “financial health” in the stock market. Human feelings fall into two broad categories. When our needs are satisfied, we have positive feelings—we are happy, excited, peaceful, confident, hopeful, and engaged. On the other hand, when our needs are not being met, we have negative feelings—we are angry, afraid, confused, fatigued, stressed, embarrassed, jealous, sad, and vulnerable.

- These positive and negative feelings often drive individual behavior and can result in any number of cognitive biases, which are defined as mistakes in reasoning, evaluating, remembering, or some other cognitive process. In investing, these biases often express themselves as fear and greed, which can lead individuals to make suboptimal investment decisions.

- Behavioral finance has flourished in the 40 years since Kahneman and Tversky first published their research and established its theoretical foundation. It is important to recognize that behavioral finance comprises two distinct, albeit interrelated disciplines: micro behavioral finance, which deals with decision making and the behavior of individuals, and macro behavioral finance, which deals with the behavior of the collective.5 Although actions of the individual can influence the actions of the collective, the relationship is not a direct one, which appears to cause a fair amount of confusion among many people. Behavioral finance holds that investors may not always act rationally, and investment decisions may be driven more by human emotions than classical economics predicts. This insight leads many people to jump to the conclusion that because men are irrational and markets are made of men (and women),6 markets are also irrational. In turn, many individuals believe that the behaviors of individual market participants (micro behavioral finance) can be scaled up to represent the behavior of the collective (macro behavioral finance). ([Location 5457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5457))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This belief is an incorrect conclusion, however. Just as we cannot predict the direction of the economy (macroeconomics) by predicting only the behavior of individuals (microeconomics), even though the two disciplines are interrelated, we cannot predict the movements of the stock market by predicting the behavior of individual investors. The primary reason why individual behavior does not aggregate to explain group behavior is that the stock market is a complex adaptive system. The most important characteristic of complex adaptive systems is that they exhibit emergent behavior, meaning that when individual actions are aggregated, patterns emerge that cannot be predicted from analyzing individual behavior. Simply put, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. To reiterate, we cannot predict how the collective will behave by analyzing only individual behavior.

- Shiller believes that market movements are influenced substantially by social psychology. Instead of a crowd of rational decision makers, he sees the crowd as “investors who do not pay much attention to fundamental indicators of value”9 and who are emotionally driven by animal spirits. It is interesting that Shiller won the Nobel Prize for his work on behavioral finance yet only mentions the work of Kahneman and Tversky twice, and then only briefly, in his 33-page acceptance lecture. Shiller’s apparent disregard for micro behavioral finance is consistent with the statement that one cannot predict how the collective will behave by analyzing the individual behaviors within the collective. In fact, individual behavior does not matter unless that behavior produces a systematic error in the collective. And, as we discuss at length in the previous chapter, the only way errors are created in the collective is by a reduction in the crowd’s diversity or a breakdown in its independence. Individual errors offset each other if the models individuals use are diverse and will not affect the crowd error if the individuals act independently. Therefore, although individuals can, and will, make errors and may appear to act irrationally, the individual errors will cancel out each other and have no impact on the crowd’s error as long as the individual errors are not systematically correlated.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We define lack of diversity within the collective as when investors think the same way because they use the same, or similar, models to arrive at their estimates of intrinsic value. With a lack of diversity, the crowd’s view will reflect nothing more than the view of a select few or a single individual, rather than different views from multiple individuals. Under these circumstances, the crowd produces an answer that often is only a small deviation from the average individual estimate, as we show in the wisdom of the crowd examples in the previous chapter. On the other hand, a breakdown of independence occurs when a diverse group of investors is influenced by the same external stimuli and sets aside its prior estimate or private information when expressing its views. The individuals may be diverse because they use different models to arrive at their estimate of intrinsic value, but they lose their independence when they imitate or adopt the views of other investors. In other words, diversity is a function of the variety of models used, while independence is compromised if the model outputs are systematically influenced by external stimuli ([Location 5508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5508))

- However, it is important to note that although the crowd has lost its diversity that alone does not mean that a mispricing exists. The paragraph above contains an important qualifier, “If you have confidence that your analysis is correct.” The implication is that, in your opinion, the consensus is wrong. To you there appears to be a genuine mispricing and the stock seems “like a bargain.” The crowd’s bias may have created a mispricing, but then again, that is not a foregone conclusion just because of the crowd’s lack of diversity.

- When the shareholder base is diverse and includes investors following different disciplines, most often the collective is wise and the stock will be efficiently priced. If, on the other hand, the shareholder base lacks diversity and is comprised mostly of investors from a single group, the collective is less wise and the stock less efficiently priced. While this statement is an oversimplification, we can use it to make an important point about investor diversity. There have been many situations in the real world where crowding or herding among investors exists in an individual stock or market sector, resulting in a lack of diversity among the market participants in that particular area of the market. Because most of the market ([Location 5586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5586))

- participants in these situations are using similar models in their analysis, a small, seemingly innocuous event can trigger a stampede, causing Mr. Market to become manic. We want to emphasize that an “appropriate” reaction to an event by an otherwise diversified shareholder base can easily turn into an overreaction to the same event when the shareholder base lacks diversity. One such incident was the Quant Crisis of 2007. Quantitative investors use computer models to identify patterns in securities prices and then buy or sell thousands of different securities to capture small mispricings. It has been an enormously successful strategy over the years and has made billionaires of investors like James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, Ken Griffin of Citadel, and Cliff Asness of AQR Capital. However, sometimes a successful strategy breaks down and causes pandemonium. Several large hedge funds and proprietary trading desks on Wall Street began losing billions of dollars over a matter of a few days in early August 2007 and no one knew exactly why. Because the majority of these funds were implementing a similar strategy (using the same models) and employing significant amounts of leverage, many of them received margin calls simultaneously when prices started to decline (the securities they held were the collateral for their loans) and were forced to sell at least some of their holdings. Unfortunately, because many of the portfolios were similarly constructed, the margin calls created a ripple effect, and the selling begat more selling, which resulted in a “death spiral” in many of the widely-owned assets. In his excellent book The Quants, Scott Patterson describes events during those days in August that seem more fitting for a John Grisham suspense novel than a Wall Street trading desk. The following are a few excerpts: The market moves PDT and other quant funds started to see early that week defied logic. The fine-tuned models, the bell curves and random walks, the calibrated correlations—all the math and science that had propelled the quants to the pinnacle of Wall Street—couldn’t capture what was happening. It was utter chaos driven by pure human fear, the kind that can’t be captured in a computer model or complex algorithm. This wasn’t supposed to happen! [emphasis original] The quants did their best to contain the damage, but they were like firefighters trying to douse a raging inferno with gasoline—the more they tried to fight the flames by selling, the worse the selling became. The downward-driving force of the deleveraging market seemed unstoppable. It made no sense. A true believer in market efficiency who’d studied under Eugene Fama at Chicago, Rothman expected the market to behave according to the strict quantitative patterns he lived to track. But the market was acting in a way that defied any pattern Rothman—or any other quant—had ever seen. Everything was losing money. Every strategy was falling apart.

- While similar to a lack of diversity, a breakdown of independence has subtle but important differences. Although members of the crowd might use different models to arrive at their own independent estimates, thus preserving the crowd’s diversity, a breakdown of independence occurs when some external influence causes them to alter or set aside their original estimate. This phenomenon is known as an information cascade. This subtlety bears repeating to ensure clarity. When there is a breakdown of independence, individuals fixate on some external factor, set their model aside, and follow the crowd. In Chapter 6, we defined private information as an individual’s knowledge of facts and experiences that represents their domain-specific knowledge and forms their information processing model, which we show in Figure 6.6 and reproduce in figure 7.9: ([Location 5623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5623))

- As we mention throughout the book, each investor has their own unique private information, which impacts their estimate of intrinsic value. If the investor arrives at their estimate without any bias, then their estimate is said to be independent. Absent a genuine informational advantage, however, the investor’s private information is usually imperfect. Consequentially, the investor might not have a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of their estimate. ([Location 5636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5636))

- The classic example of an information cascade involves choosing where to eat when traveling to a city you don’t know well. Imagine you are planning on spending a few days in London on business. You have never been to London before and would like to find a nice restaurant for one of your dinners. Before leaving on your trip, you research options by reviewing the Michelin guide and reading online Yelp reviews. You arrive in London, drop your bags at your hotel, and head out to dinner. As you approach the restaurant you chose through your research, you see that it is empty. When you look at the restaurant next door, however, it is packed and looks like a nice place to eat. At that instant, you change your plans and select the new restaurant for dinner without any additional research or information. What you have done is set aside the private information you obtained from your earlier research in response to observing the actions of other individuals. An information cascade will unfold if other people decide to eat at the crowded restaurant for the same reasons you did when you made your impromptu decision. We can illustrate how information cascades occur in the stock market with another simple example. Bob is an investment adviser and manages separate accounts for high-net-worth individuals on a discretionary basis.12 Bob closely follows Biotech Inc., a company that is developing a drug for neon nose syndrome. The company is currently waiting for the results of the FDA Phase II trials for their drug. After talking with several doctors and patients aware of the trial, Bob believes the drug is effective and will get Phase II approval. He purchased Biotech’s stock in 20 of his client accounts at an average price of $15.37. A few weeks later the stock price has increased to $17.04. Judd is a well-known and highly regarded biotech investor. He appears regularly on CNBC and has an impressive investment record. Since Judd is a successful investor, many market participants track his fund’s holdings through its 13G filings.13 Bob notices in a new amended 13G filing with the SEC that Judd’s firm no longer holds a position in Biotech Inc., which shocks Bob because he knows Judd’s fund previously owned 6.2% of the company’s shares. Bob’s heart sinks as he infers that if Judd’s fund sold its Biotech Inc. stock, Judd must believe that the company will not get FDA approval for its neon nose drug. If the drug is not approved, Biotech stock could easily fall in half to $8.50, or possibly even lower. Since Bob’s accounts own a lot of the stock, he panics and sells the shares for his 20 clients pushing Biotech Inc. stock down from $17.04 to $16.23 in the process. He also notices that there are postings on Twitter also speculating that if Judd’s fund sold its Biotech Inc. position, it signals that the company is unlikely to get FDA approval. Reading the negative Tweets further reinforces Bob’s decision. By the time the market closes a few hours later, Biotech Inc.’s… ([Location 5642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5642))

- The pricing error can be corrected in two ways. First, unbiased investors could enter the market to exploit the profit opportunity and correct the mispricing, in effect diluting the biased consensus. We can think of these investors entering the market as the equivalent of turning up the power on the electromagnet at the top of the distribution curve (where the price equals intrinsic value). This action overpowers the magnets representing the behavioral bias and pulls the stock back to its intrinsic value, as shown in Figure 7.13. The other way the mispricing could correct is if the bias dissipates or recedes. In the magnet analogy, this action would be equivalent to the behavioral bias magnets losing their strength. Often mispricings are corrected by a combination of the two forces. ([Location 5828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5828))

- Albeit overly simplified, the description illustrates how the efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance together influence the movement of stock prices. A stock will be efficiently priced unless some type of systematic bias, driven by human emotions, pulls the price away from its true value, as shown in the various charts.

- Despite the Nobel Committee’s decision to recognize both theories in the same year, blending the theories of behavioral finance with the efficient market hypothesis may still appear to be heresy to many academics and most practitioners. However, the merged theory provides us with a more effective mental model to proceed with in the discussion. It is important to note that the overwhelming evidence supports the claim that the efficient market hypothesis is the prevailing force most of the time, although in “normal” market conditions, behavioral finance will skew pricings with some frequency. On the rare occasion, during extreme times of manias and panics, when investor emotions take over and create systematic errors, behavioral finance gets the upper hand.

- The third tenet of market efficiency states that for the stock to be efficiently priced, information must be expressed, aggregated, and incorporated into the market price by a sufficient number of investors, which only happens when investors trade the stock and affect the market price. Investor opinions must be expressed and aggregated without significant impediments for the market price to incorporate the information and satisfy the third tenet.

- Even if the first two tenets of market efficiency are met—the information is adequately disseminated and then processed absent any systematic error—an inefficiency can result if the estimate is not incorporated into the price through trading. What impediments might exist that would prevent an investor from trading? The Nobel committee termed these as “institutional constraints and conflicts of interests.” These impediments fall into two broad categories, which in both cases prevent an investor from taking or holding a position. The first category is referred to as liquidity constraints, which can limit an investor’s ability to execute a trade. The second category relates to anticipated or actual redemptions from clients that prevent an investor from taking a position in the first place or holding a position long enough for the gap between the market price and their estimate of intrinsic value to close. When making a buy or sell decision, most investors want to execute the trade immediately. The problem is that buyers and sellers are not always in the market at the exact same time, willing to transact the same number of shares, at the same price. A stock is considered liquid when these three factors—time, price, and number of available shares—all line up, allowing investors to fill their order without moving the stock price. Conversely, a security is considered illiquid if filling the order would cause the stock price to move. ([Location 5916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=5916))

- To address the question, “Is the market efficient?” we must realize that no model is perfect. Fama reaffirms this insight in his 1998 paper: “Like all models, market efficiency is a faulty description of price formation.”27 The main question we continue to ponder is, “Are the exceptions to the efficient market hypothesis highlighted by academics, in favor of behavioral finance, large enough that it makes sense to reject the theory completely?” We believe the answer is no. In fact, Richard Thaler, a well-known proponent of behavioral finance, had an interesting response when asked the question, “How can behavioral finance help us consistently beat the stock market?” He responded with an unequivocal, “Two words . . . it can’t.” Even if we ignore Thaler’s comment, we can ask, “If we discard the market efficiency hypothesis, is there a better model of market behavior to replace it?” We believe that the answer to this question is, as of today,28 not yet. Fama raises an excellent point in the next sentence from his article, “Following the standard scientific rule, however, market efficiency can only be replaced by a better specific model of price formation.” Since no such model yet exists, the efficient market hypothesis remains the king of the hill. Nonetheless, the fact remains that there are anomalies in the market that can, and will, persist. Although we know that Fama’s efficient market hypothesis is less than perfect, we are reminded of Winston Churchill’s famous quote about democracy, “No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”29 To echo Churchill’s ([Location 6016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=6016))

- We care about market efficiency because, ironically, we need the markets to be efficient to generate alpha. If we can identify an error, such as a temporary inefficiency or mispricing, the only way for that mistake to be corrected is if the market is eventually efficient. The market must realize it has made a mistake and then correct that mistake for investors to generate alpha and outperform. The alternative view would be a market where a mispricing could persist forever. In such a world, no one could reliably outperform. If we can identify information that has not been properly disseminated, a situation where diversity or independence has been compromised by some type of systematic error, or where there are impediments to incorporation, there is potentially a mispricing we can exploit. For this reason, understanding how market efficiency works and, perhaps more important, when the rules become distorted or even break can help investors determine where to look for mispriced securities, how they might be able to get an edge over other investors, and when to exploit those advantages.

- As we state in Chapter 4, the estimated intrinsic value of an asset is the sum of the cash flows expected to be produced by that asset, over its useful life, discounted for the time value of money and the uncertainty of receiving those cash flows. Therefore, to have a true variant perspective, you must have a different outlook from the consensus for the company’s future cash flow. These diverging expectations must translate into a different estimate of the company’s magnitude, duration, timing, or growth of cash flows, as we show in Figure 8.3.

Your estimate of value must be more accurate than the consensus because you either possess better information or have performed superior analysis. What is the market missing?

These advantages fall into three categories, which mirror the market inefficiencies we discuss in Chapter 5: An informational advantage is present when you have information other investors do not have and, as a result, has not been adequately disseminated. With an informational advantage the investor can state, “I know this is true.” An analytical advantage is present when you see things others do not see because there is some type of systematic error (lack of diversity or breakdown in independence) that obscures other investors’ views.

- A catalyst is an event that increases the dissemination or availability of information, restores the crowd’s diversity and/or independence, or alleviates any trading limitations.

Simply put, the catalyst can be additional information the market does not have, an event that forces investors to observe and process the information without bias, or a change that increases investors’ ability to express and incorporate their view by trading the stock. In the end, a catalyst removes the inefficiency in the stock price. ([Location 6685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=6685))

- Confusing uncertainty with risk is a common investor mistake. For instance, most investors will avoid investment opportunities with a high degree of uncertainty, even if the potential return is high and the actual risk is low, because they (as human beings) hate uncertainty. Investors often process these opportunities incorrectly because they confuse uncertainty for risk and price the security accordingly. Shrewd investors, on the other hand, view these types of situations as opportunities because the actual risk is mispriced by the consensus.

- Uncertainty, to us as distressed investors, is our friend, because uncertainty is something investors will pay to avoid—sometimes pay a large amount. We love situations like Lehman which we call “high uncertainty, low risk.”3 Krueger explained further that there was a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Lehman bonds because of the “hundreds of unanswered questions,” which he knew “would eventually get answered over the coming months, quarters or years.” He added that “occasionally you’ll be given an opportunity to buy something at a price where even though you have a hundred unanswered questions, you realize that regardless of what the answers are, you probably cannot lose a lot of money, and most of the time you will make a little or a lot.” Exploiting other investors’ confusion of risk and uncertainty can be highly profitable and is one of the key reasons we feel the need to distinguish between the two concepts.

- Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is one of the grandmasters4 of exploiting situations where investors have mistakenly priced uncertainty as risk. Buffett uses Berkshire’s insurance operations as a vehicle to benefit from these opportunities, which often happen in situations with a high degree of uncertainty. For instance, Berkshire demonstrated its prowess in the summer of 2003, when Pepsi ran a promotion called “Play for a Billion,” in which consumers had a chance to win $1 billion at the contest’s grand finale. Pepsi, fearing the possibility of losing $1 billion, sought to insure the loss to protect itself from this (very remote) outcome. The mechanics of the contest were as follows: Pepsi issued 1 billion bottle caps with special codes on them and a total of 4 million people eventually entered the sweepstakes. Of the 4 million entrants, 100 people were chosen randomly to appear on a live ([Location 6809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=6809))

- gameshow-style television special. Each of the 100 individuals was given a random six-digit number. A person affiliated with Pepsi then rolled a 10-sided die to select six numbers, each of which was written on a billiard ball and placed into a bag. A chimp named Kendall drew the balls out of the bag, one at a time, to determine the sequence of the six-digit number. A contestant won $1 billion if their numbers were an exact match to the six-digit number that Kendall generated. The odds of winning the contest, which is the chance of matching the six-digit number exactly, is one in a million (actually, it is 1 in 999,999 as 1,000,000 is a seven-digit number). The expected loss to Pepsi (if the game was played an infinite number of times) is $1,000, which equals $1,000,000,000/999,999 possible winning… ([Location 6817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=6817))

- $10 million a year for the next 20 years, and finally a $700 million payment in year 41. If the lump sum was chosen, which is usually the case in lottery-type contests, then the real expected loss to Pepsi was $250,000,000/999,999, or $250. It is rumored that Berkshire charged Pepsi a premium of $10 million to insure against the potential loss. If Pepsi’s potential loss of $250 million is divided by the $10 million premium it paid to Berkshire, the implied odds of the potential loss are 1 in 25, while the actual odds of losing were 1 in 1,000. Pepsi clearly mispriced the risk of loss. Although there was the possibility of someone winning the $250 million, the probability was extremely low.

- As the phrase implies, nonverbal communication is communication between people that does not involve spoken words. It includes body language, facial expressions, and posture. It also includes the tone, pitch, speed at which you speak, and other qualities in the way you express yourself. It is not what is being said, but how it is being said. Nonverbal communication comprises everything in the pitch except for the actual message itself (the content), which is why we believe it is important to separate the delivery of the pitch from its content. Academic studies show that a high percent of the information conveyed when individuals communicate is nonverbal. Alfred Mehrabian, a professor at UCLA, performed several experiments in the late 1960s, where he concluded that communication was 7% words, 38% inflection and tone, and 55% body language. These observations have morphed into the widespread, and commonly repeated, belief that more than 90% of communication is nonverbal, which is known as the 7- ([Location 8658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0754XYZPY&location=8658))

Todorov concludes in one study that “faces perceived as distinguished, intelligent, and determined were older, had thin lips, and had wrinkles at the eye corners.”9 Apparently, wrinkles are not necessarily a bad thing! We do not discuss these physical attributes in detail because individuals cannot change them, although we mention it to increase awareness that these biases exists.
