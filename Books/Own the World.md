- So it’s clear US investors are catching on to the fact global investing is both possible and beneficial, yet most are simply dipping their toes in the ocean when they should be going for a swim. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=110))

- In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it’s a weighing machine. —Benjamin Graham ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=664))
- You might have heard Benjamin Graham’s famous quote and thought he was offering a stock tip about a company producing bathroom scales. But what he was really talking about was supply and demand. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=666))
- Stocks are like anything else bought and sold in a free market—their prices are determined by supply and demand. In the short term, demand has the upper hand in determining prices. Why? The supply of many ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=668))

And just about anything electronic can be delivered almost instantaneously via the Internet. But the supply ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=670))
- of stocks isn’t so malleable. New stocks usually come to market via initial public offerings (IPOs) or secondary offerings, which don’t happen overnight. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=671))
- The Weighing Machine. However, in the long ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=686))
- term, supply takes over. Crafty investment bankers, venture capitalists, and corporate executives can see when a particular category of stocks gets hot and want to participate in the fun by issuing shares there, too! And they don’t want to participate in not-so-hot categories, so fewer shares are issued there. Strong demand can keep prices rising, even though new supply is hitting the market. And the higher prices rise, the more supply gets created! Eventually supply ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=686))

- The most common metric ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=752))

In investing, we use ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=755))
- standard deviation to measure risk. By definition, risky stocks have high standard deviations, and less risky stocks have low standard deviations. That doesn’t mean one is necessarily going to be better than the other going forward. It ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=757))
- means returns on risky stocks are more likely to veer from what you expect than less risky stocks. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=759))
- So thinking of return as good and risk as bad oversimplifies the relationship because it ignores the necessity of risk to achieve returns. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=762))
- In any given day, week, month, or year, some stocks are moving up while others are moving down. And even stocks moving in the same direction do so in different magnitudes. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=771))
- The relationships between the movements of different stocks are known as their correlations.   Definition Correlation ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=772))
- Coefficient One of the most commonly used measures of the relationships between stocks is their correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficients always fall into a range of +1 to -1. A correlation of +1 ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=775))
- means the stocks are perfectly correlated—they always move in the same direction. A correlation of -1 means the stocks are perfectly negatively correlated—they always move in opposite directions. A correlation close to ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=777))
- zero means the movement of one stock doesn’t tell you anything about the other. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=778))
- In reality, no two stocks are perfectly positively or negatively correlated because all ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=780))

- single stock is as little diversification as you can get in a stock portfolio. And owning every stock on the planet is the most diversification possible. But there’s more to diversification than just the number of stocks. A portfolio ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=805))
- with 50 stocks in the same country in the same type of business is probably less diversified than a portfolio with half as many stocks from different countries in different business lines. Diversification is a key component of risk ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=807))

- In statistics parlance, returns are linear, but risks are non-linear. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=833))
- More simply—you can add returns together, but you can’t add risks. Any individual stock impacts portfolio performance in direct proportion to its weight in the portfolio. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=834))
- To calculate portfolio ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=835))
- return over some time period, you simply calculate the weighted average return of all the stocks in the portfolio. This means multiplying each stock’s return by the stock’s weight in the portfolio to determine the impact of each stock on the portfolio’s return. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=835))
- Calculating Weighted Average Return Calculating a weighted average return is really quite simple. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=841))
- Imagine you have a four-stock portfolio of $100,000, in these amounts: • Stock A—$15,000 (15% of the portfolio) • Stock B—$20,000 (20% of the portfolio) • Stock C—$25,000 ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=842))
- (25% of the portfolio) • Stock D—$40,000 (40% of the portfolio). Over a year, each stock rises a different amount: • Stock A rises 60% ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=845))
- Stock B rises 20% • Stock C rises 35% • Stock D rises 5% You can’t just add those percentages and divide by four. The smallest stock, A, rose ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=848))
- the most, but it had the smallest weight and therefore the smallest impact. The same in reverse for D, the largest stock. To get the correct, weighted average, you simply multiply each stock’s return by its weight in the portfolio, ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=850))
- and add them together to get the return of the entire portfolio. For example: (15% * 60%) + (20% * 20%) + (25% * 35%) + (40% * 5%) = 23.75% Your portfolio ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=852))
- overall rose 23.75 percent! That’s the weighted average return. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=855))
- But risk doesn’t work the same way. Imperfect correlations among stocks ensure the risk associated with a multi-stock ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=856))
- portfolio will be lower than the weighted average risk of the individual components. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=857))

- The Global View So there you have it: The benefits of global diversification in one tidy chapter. Keep in mind, looking at historical risk and return won’t tell you exactly what the future holds, ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=949))
- but they don’t have to. Returns, standard deviations, and correlations change over time. At some times, foreign stock markets will be more highly correlated with US stocks than others. As a result, the diversification benefits you ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=950))
- receive from global investing won’t be constant. But stock markets globally have never been perfectly correlated and they never will be. And there will always be innumerable investment opportunities overseas. Therefore, ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=952))
- the benefits of global diversification will persist indefinitely. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=953))

- total value of all the goods and services produced within a country. Most countries release GDP statistics quarterly, although some do it monthly. In the US, we take the quarter-over-quarter change in GDP and turn that into an ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=975))
- annualized number. So if one quarter’s GDP increases 1.0% from the previous quarter, GDP is said to have grown at an annualized pace of 4.1% (notice it’s not 4.0% since it’s a compound annual rate). Some countries focus ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=977))
- on just quarter-over-quarter GDP growth without annualizing the data. And others use year-over-year changes in GDP. No matter how you slice it, GDP is intended to measure the same thing just about everywhere. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=978))
- The GDP calculation includes only finished goods to avoid double ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=983))
- counting. If a farmer sells cotton to a textile company, and the textile company sells fabric to a tailor, who turns it into a suit, only the suit counts toward GDP since it should theoretically include the value of all the materials and labor along the way. Even so, ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=984))
- figuring out the value of everything a country produces is no small task. Fortunately, economists have come up with a fairly simple equation that aims to do just that. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=986))

If the nominal interest rate on a bond is 5 percent and inflation is at 3 percent per year, the “real” interest rate on the bond is 2 percent. If the nominal return ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=1034))

That’s where the top-down approach comes ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=1358))

- If you were investing at the turn of the millennium, you know a thing or two about euphoric sentiment. As the stock market roared into 2000, the talk was about a “new economy.” Old rules ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001U5VJSQ&location=1451))
