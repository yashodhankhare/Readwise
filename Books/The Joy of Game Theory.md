## Highlights
- In this book, a game will mean a situation characterized by three components: (1) a set of people involved called players, (2), a set of allowable moves that each player can make, known as strategies, and (3) a description of how each player feels about ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=58))

- the possible outcomes mathematically described by a payoff or utility function. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=59))

- In fact, that is how price matching is often reported in the news. For example, an article in The Wall Street Journal on November 2013 claimed: “And in electronics, where the products are the same from store to store, the one real competitive weapon is price. Four of the country's biggest consumer electronics retailers—Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and Staples Inc.—are all pledging to match their rivals' in-store prices during most of the holidays if shoppers ask.” But does price matching always mean lower prices? One would have to do a detailed study of prices to understand the full effects of price matching. But even without that, a game theory model can suggest how price matching might affect prices. One game paradoxically suggests price matching can do the opposite: it can help prices stay high! ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=158))

- In game theory, when a player's action (like her yelling) leads to a worse outcome than another action (her hailing the other cab going by), for every possible way other players decide to act (in each situation, the chance I would give her the cab), the action is said to be dominated. There is an obvious lesson from game theory: never choose a dominated action. If you learn one thing from this book, let this be the lesson: please, never, never play dominated strategies. Dominated strategies are not just bad decisions; they are the worst possible decisions. Buying lottery tickets is a losing bet and generally not smart, but even then you have a chance to win. So you can think of playing a dominated strategy as worse than buying a lottery ticket. You are always better off avoiding dominated strategies.

- A focal point is a time or strategy that ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=325))

- is natural or special in some way. Focal points are important because they allow people to coordinate without communication. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=325))

- A pattern is emerging from the past few examples. My friend Jamie and the retailer JC Penney both lost money when participating in a Prisoner's Dilemma. It is generally bad to be a player in a Prisoner's Dilemma as selfish motives, and dominant strategies, lead to a destructive outcome for the group. On the other hand, Snooki accidentally engaged Coach and Gucci in a Prisoner's Dilemma and she benefited tremendously. Similarly, The Economist advertising is enticing new readers to play Prisoner's Dilemma, hoping to increase subscriptions. The general lesson is that you do not want to play the Prisoner's Dilemma. What you want to do is create a situation where others have to play it and you can profit. The players' loss can be your gain. This is a very important business lesson that will be illustrated in this section. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=808))

- It was a long time ago I figured out how to beat these people. You should not try to beat them at their own game. If you're not winning the game you are playing, you must change the game and play by your own rules. A few strategies for these games are: --Wait for a movie to get less popular and lines die down. --Forget movie theaters altogether, just wait for home video. --Ignore fashion and avoid high heels. --Study a specified amount of time, then have fun.

- Learn for its own sake, not for the grade. None of these strategies is mind-blowing or would appeal to the masses. But they allow you to spend time productively while others waste time in lines, hurt their bodies, and lose their memorized facts. Perhaps you can win if you play your own game. I play for the long run, and I will find a way to win this game. ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H69CQ4Q&location=1851))

- In game theory, economics, or business, we often choose the option that brings us the highest profit in absolute terms. All things equal, we would rather have $1,000 than $100. But people do not always think in absolute success. They can sometimes think in terms of relative success: the goal is not to maximize payout, but rather, in the researchers' words, “to maximize the difference between one's self and the other player.” There is further experimental evidence of this idea, as explained on Michael Shermer's blog. Consider a hypothetical situation where you could earn $50,000 when other people earned $25,000. Would you prefer that, or would you prefer a situation where you earned $100,000 and others earned $250,000? You might think it is better to earn $100,000 since that means you can enjoy twice as many goods. However, Shermer points out, “Surprisingly—stunningly, in fact—research shows that the majority of people select the first option; they would rather make twice as much as others even if that meant earning half as much as they could otherwise have....In this case, relative social ranking trumps absolute financial status.” The point is that relative thinking, and jealousy of other people's success, factors into how people think about money.
