## Highlights
- Baruch’s speculative genius was his trader’s flexibility. What he said ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=85))

- (or was quoted as saying) was less important than how he acted. That he was able to regain his bearings and salvage the greater part of his fortune during the long bear market of the early 1930s was a feat of discipline that every investor must admire.

- Anyone who made $1 million in the stock market then put that first million at risk to earn a second, less important million, and so on until he accumulated roughly $25 million, as Baruch did, obviously was willing to climb out on a limb.

- By necessity, a successful stock trader holds no brief with lost causes. If he’s wrong on the market, he must cut losses or risk financial extinction. Baruch brought this trader’s flexibility to national politics. In general he believed in the old-time Democratic tenets of hard money, low tariffs, and individual liberty, but when the political trend changed during the New Deal he bowed to the new age. In public life he was the least audacious, most risk-averse of men. As a young man he grew rich by taking chances, but as an old man he became famous by playing it safe.

- When prices go up, two processes will set in—an increased production and a decreased consumption. The effect will be a gradual fall in prices. If prices get too low, two processes will set in—decreased production, because a man will not continue to produce at a loss, and, second, increased consumption. These two forces will tend to establish the normal balance. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=403))

- On the one hand, Political Economy, by Francis A. Walker, was defensive about moneymaking and cool to slightly hostile toward Baruch’s future vocation, stock trading. On the other hand, it stated some things that Baruch might have advocated himself a few decades later. Thus, concerning capital: “It arises solely out of saving. It stands always for self-denial and abstinence.” Many years later, when John Maynard Keynes floated the idea that the way out of a depression was through spending instead of self-denial ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=412))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- denial and abstinence, Baruch rejected both the idea and the economist. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=415))

- Phrenology, a pseudoscience then in vogue, was the practice of deducing human aptitudes by an examination of the bumps and ridges of the skull. Shortly after they arrived in New York, Baruch and his mother had paid a call on a practitioner named Fowler. The phrenologist asked Mrs. Baruch what she intended to do with her son. “I am thinking of making him a doctor.” “He will make a good doctor,” Fowler agreed, passing his hands appraisingly over the boy’s glabella, “but my advice to you is to take him where they are doing big things—finance or politics.” ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=447))

- gold shipments, world agricultural news, and especially developments on the London Stock Exchange. In the boom summer of 1897 some three hundred British dealers made markets in US stocks and bonds. On both sides of the Atlantic, arbitrageurs kept odd hours (rising before dawn in New York and working into the evening in London) in hopes of buying stocks cheap in one market and selling them dear in the other. The first thing that Baruch and his colleagues asked when they walked into the office was “What’s London?” ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=905))

- A question sometimes before the courts in those years was whether an insider, knowing what he did, was bound to divulge it before buying or selling his company’s stock in the open market. Out of some sixteen cases that dealt with the issue from the mid-nineteenth century until 1909, the verdict in eleven was no. Fraud and “active or intentional” concealment of information were illegal, but directors and other insiders could generally trade as they liked with ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=933))

- the knowledge uniquely at their disposal. (Baruch later described his objections to this doctrine, but he too traded often and profitably on the basis of inside information.) Henry O. Havemeyer, president of American Sugar, was especially successful in his own company’s stock. “It has been a saying on Wall Street,” a New York Herald reporter wrote in 1897, “that each up and down movement in ‘sugar’ provided profits for Mr. Havemeyer to put up a new ‘skyscraper.’ ” ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=937))

- Another source of competition for the Stock Exchange was the bucket shop, in which the house offered to bet the public on the short-term movement of stock prices. No actual securities changed hands, a condition that satisfied the Stock Exchange’s definition of gambling. Furthermore, the shops pirated Stock Exchange quotations, which were copyrighted, and deprived the members of commission revenue, which was unforgivable. Despite occasional legal action against them, however, the shops managed to flourish, and in 1905 the Stock Exchange heard complaints that sixty such dens of iniquity did a lively business in Pittsburgh. In Milwaukee the bucketing clientele included some of the city’s leading bankers. At the turn of the century the Stock Exchange opposed gambling but condoned certain forms of price manipulation. Nowadays the Securities and Exchange Commission, principal arbiter in such matters, condones gambling but prohibits manipulation; a speculator may lay a bet on prices in the options market but he may not willfully jiggle them. In its day the Stock Exchange drew a subtle distinction. It banned fictitious transactions, so-called wash sales. However, it permitted another manipulative device called “matched orders” in which an order to buy a stock was given to one broker and an order to sell the same stock was given to another. The purpose of the feint was to create the illusion of market activity where none really existed, and so to entice the public. To the governors of the Exchange the practice had the redeeming feature that commissions were paid both coming and going. Moreover, the manipulator was at some risk, since the rules forbade him from telling his brokers that they were working at cross-purposes; thus he might buy too high through broker A and sell too low through broker B. No rules checked short selling, however, and stocks could be hammered just as they could be bulled, by brokers acting singly or in pools. Operations on either side of the market were facilitated by margin requirements (as noted) of as little as 10 percent. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=965))

- One of the oddest of failed manipulations had a literary inspiration. Friday the Thirteenth, a novel by Thomas W. Lawson that was published early in 1907, was about a man who managed to sell so many shares of stock short that he brought down the market. Lawson did more than dream up this fanciful yarn; he also declared it a foolproof formula for real-life success. Either the book or the author’s guarantee impressed a Philadelphia broker and accused bank wrecker named Albert E. Appleyard. On June 12, 1907, Appleyard, imitating art, sold short thousands of shares of stock, but there was no collapse except of his own finances. “Appleyard has disappeared,” The New York Times reported on the fourteenth from Philadelphia, “but it is not believed that he has gone to Boston to claim the $5,000 reward ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=997))

- offered by Lawson for a practical demonstration that his theory would not work, although it is considered here that his demonstration was clear and convincing.” Such was the neighborhood in which Bernard Baruch made his fortune.

- In keeping with the Wall Street maxim that money is more easily got than kept, Baruch next managed to lose most of what he had gained. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1120))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It might be noted here that the possibilities for error in the stock market are vast, and that the trail of every Wall Street fortune is crossed with wrong turns. One can buy and sell too early and too late. One can be right but unlucky. Baruch, in the spring of 1901, had the good fortune to be wrong but lucky. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1202))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One cause of his dissatisfaction was the irritant of having to deal with other people’s money. It was becoming Baruch’s view that a speculator should not be a stockbroker, bank director, or any other kind of fiduciary. He should be his own man, exclusively. For another thing, now that he had made a lot of money, he began to wonder what it meant. ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1379))

- “Let unswerving integrity always be your watchword.” ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1413))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “Unswerving integrity” is no easy standard to uphold, no matter what one’s father adjures, and Baruch apparently did veer from it. Once he was led into temptation by some Baltimore men who somehow had met him when he was still a partner at A. A. Housman and described an accountant’s report that they had at their disposal. The report concerned the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, a giant Manhattan streetcar line that was then in the formative stages of crookedness. Early in 1902, Harry Content, Baruch’s favorite broker, filed a stockholder’s suit ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1423))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- alleging that a certain Metropolitan leasing scheme was “born in iniquity.” Eventually the directors, including Thomas Fortune Ryan, were accused (though never indicted or convicted) of looting, and the belief gained currency that the company trafficked in jurors and politicians. In the fall of 1902, before most of this dirty laundry had been aired, the Baltimoreans brought their inside information to Baruch. The accountant’s report must have been negative, because it was supposedly understood that Baruch would sell the stock short: selling first and buying later, it was hoped at a lower price. He would risk his capital and take half the profits. His informants—by name, Barreda Turner, Frank G. Turner, and Motz Prag—would share the other half. Nothing was written down and no deadline was set, but it was agreed that Baruch would deal in at least 10,000 shares of stock. Such were the Baltimoreans’ recollections. In October 1902, when the deal was allegedly struck, the price of a share of Metropolitan was $142. A year later it was $105 (a decline almost exactly in line with the fall of the Dow Jones Rail index). At the end of September 1903 Prag sued Baruch, charging that he had held back huge profits. Just $4,271 had been accounted for, the complaint charged, although Baruch had earned half a million. Baruch denied even trading on the basis of an “expert accountant’s report,” much less hiding his profits. However, he ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1427))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- agreed to settle out of court for $9,000, “as a matter of compromise,” he later explained, “and to avoid the personal inconvenience of being made a party to an unfounded litigation.” This was in 1904. Probably if Prag had been cheated to the extent he claimed he wouldn’t have settled for $9,000 (which, in point of fact, was a pretty good sum in 1904). On the other hand if Baruch were absolutely innocent he probably wouldn’t have paid any tribute. In 1901 he had litigated a suit that had been brought against him on account of his chauffeur and appealed a $1,000 verdict, a record that suggests a certain legal pugnaciousness. In any case, neither Baruch nor Prag breathed a word of the suit to the Turners, the other alleged partners. (Frank G. Turner was the son of a Lutheran minister, a lawyer, and the treasurer of the Maryland State Bar Association; Barreda, who may or may not have been related, was a court clerk; and Prag was apparently an insurance and stock broker.) But nine years later they did find out, cried foul, filed suit and settled too.

- by the rest of the governors. As mentioned, the Stock Exchange elicited a certain amount of information from listed companies years before the Securities and Exchange Commission was in business to demand it. Corporations seeking the privilege of full-fledged listing after the turn of the century were obliged to conform with the disclosure requirements of the Committee on Stock List.

- It was Baruch’s settled opinion that nobody could know all investments thoroughly and that it was best to stick to what one knew best. For himself, he said that he had never understood commodities. “My self-confidence,” he confessed, “suffers a very real shock when I contemplate the sum total of my operations in coffee, sugar, cotton, and other commodities. . . . It always seemed to me, in fact it never failed where I was concerned, that what I bought suddenly became something else again when I paid for it, especially when I wanted to deliver it.” ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1544))

- Two more children came along after the birth of Belle in 1899: Bernard Jr. in 1903 and Renée in 1905. Baruch always accounted himself a parental failure, and his advice was to enjoy one’s children while they are young, as the trouble starts later on. He was an absentee father—besides business travel, golf, and nights out, he sailed to Europe in the summer with ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=1838))

- “Yes, sir. When the market is very weak I want to buy things which I believe in the most from their intrinsic standpoint, and when the market goes down I try to sell those things which I think will have the least intrinsic merit, or if their technical position is the least valuable as to trading possibilities of any other security.” ([Location 2684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=2684))

- Whether a given increase in the money supply is inflationary depends on the rigor of business, just as whether a given number of calories is fattening depends on the metabolism of the diner. In the case of America in World War I, the extra money was, on the face of it, inflationary, because civilian production fell. Inasmuch as people had more money to spend on fewer things, the cost of living went up. Thus retail prices, which had risen by 17 percent in 1916, rose by 17 percent again in 1917 and by 15 percent in 1918. Probably the moderation in the rate of rise owed something to the WIB’s informal price controls, as did the reduction in the rate of gain in wholesale prices to 12 percent in 1917 and 6 percent in 1918 (from the astronomical 37 percent of 1916). But after controls were relaxed, prices climbed all over again.[31] For reasons more closely related to Baruch’s arrival in Washington than to his departure from Wall Street, financial markets suffered a sinking spell in early 1917. Interest rates on long-term, high-grade bonds, for instance, rose ([Location 2821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=2821))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- from about 4 percent in January to 5 percent in October. It followed that the prices of existing bonds, including the ones that Baruch had just bought, fell. (When Charles G. Dawes, chairman of the Liberty Loan Drive, was informed that some people thought the 4 percent interest rate on Liberty Bonds skimpy, he suggested: “Anybody who declines to subscribe for that reason, knock him down.”) That much was only to be expected, since inflation from time immemorial has caused higher interest rates. What was puzzling was the action in stocks. By late 1917, the market was just about where it had been on July 30, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange was closed against waves of European selling. “Easy money, and industrial activity wholly unparalleled in the country’s history,” wrote Alexander Dana Noyes, The New York Times’s learned financial editor, “were accompanied by financial markets such as in other days would have indicated financial panic.” ([Location 2829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=2829))

- 31. By the close of the war, the War Industries Board (of which Baruch was then in command) was reduced to exhorting the nation at large to bring down the cost of living. Thus a proclamation dated August 1, 1918: Whereas the high cost of living is daily increasing, which is causing great hardships on the working man and his family and the public generally; and Whereas the abnormal prices charged the consumer for common necessities is creating a condition that is arousing a spirit of unrest and dissatisfaction which tends to demoralize the unity, harmony, and confidence of the public; and Whereas there is grave danger of continued unrest and labor disturbances which greatly interferes with the National War Program; and Whereas the determining factor in the winning of the war is that public confidence must be firmly established so that the fullest cooperation be obtained and maintained in support of the national policies: Therefore be it Resolved by the War Industries Board, That we strongly urge that the prices of commodities be fixed at a fair rate to the consumer, and plans for this purpose will be made to carry out at once the aims and purposes of this resolution.

- It must be emphasized that the available trading records for 1930 and beyond are meager. At least they show a sharp curtailment in trading and, contrary to the rumors that were credited at the Hoover White House, little or no short selling.[47] When, in March ([Location 4330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4330))

- 1930, George Armsby wrote to ask for a stock tip, explaining that he needed some money to pay his late mother’s doctor bills, Baruch obliged with the confidential information that American Smelting’s earnings were running at 60 percent of the 1929 rate, but that if the price of the stock got below 70, he planned to buy some. (That year, it got as low as 37½.) Early in June 1930, he purchased blocks of Radio Keith Orpheum, Public Service Company of New Jersey, and Coca-Cola for the account of Cary Grayson. In September Baruch himself sold 1,000 shares of Westinghouse and 2,000 of General Electric. On the other hand, later in 1930 he bought approximately $100,000 (at par value) worth of the bonds of the unsteady Interborough Rapid Transit Company and 3,700 shares of Warren Pipe & Foundry. On October 24, he wrote Churchill that business had reached its nadir. At a B&O directors’ meeting on January 21, 1931, he seconded a motion to raise the president’s salary. Baruch bore his losses stoically, confessing only to a few friends that he had suffered at all. “I can tell you,” he wrote Senator Joe Robinson, in November 1930, “that the drop in my securities has been very severe, but I can still live in comfort and peace as I have done before. But I may not be able to help out in many of the directions I have heretofore until the ship floats anew on the incoming tide, which, of course, it will do some time.”[48] The tardiness of that tidal movement ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4333))

- evidently prompted some introspection. A memo to himself on the basics of investment and speculation, dated only 1930, was found among his papers. It went as follows: PERSONAL EQUIPMENT SELF-RELIANCE: Do your own thinking. Don’t let your emotions enter into it. Keep out of any environment that may affect your acting on your reason. JUDGMENT: Consider all the facts—meditate on them. Don’t let what you want to happen influence your judgment. COURAGE: Don’t overestimate the courage you will have if things go against you. ALERTNESS: To discover any new facts that change the situation; or which may affect public opinion. PRUDENCE: Be pliable or you won’t be prudent. Become more humble as the market goes your way. It is not prudent to buy when you think the bottom has been reached. It is better to wait and see, and buy too late. It is not prudent to wait for the top of the market to sell—it is better to sell “too soon.” (Never buy so that your margin will be less than 85, or hold if it drops below 80. In a particularly “clear sky” situation with[out] “buts” or “ifs,” one can lower these margins to 80–75%.) ([Location 4344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4344))

- PLIABILITY: Consider and reconsider the facts, and your opinions. Stubbornness as to opinions—“cockiness”—must be entirely eliminated. A determination to make a certain amount within a certain time absolutely destroys pliability. When you decide, act promptly—don’t wait to see what the market will do. THE FACTS A.

- PSYCHOLOGY Nearly all men are controlled by their emotions: they become alternately over optimistic and over pessimistic. After you have your facts and opinions, wait for the current. Have an opinion on what the market should do, but don’t decide what the market will do. The more the public becomes stock minded the greater it’s [sic] power. Don’t try to go against the mob on the one hand, and don’t go with it in it’s [sic] excesses. Don’t sell short if it is bullish, but don’t stay long if there is a chance that it may turn and rend you, and conversely. In a panic the best stocks may not be salable at any reasonable price. Be alert for anything which the public will greet with enthusiasm or fear. When the market is high beware of thinking of things that will make it go higher; think of adverse possibilities, and remember history; and conversely. Watch for the main currents, but be fearful of too much company. “Stop… ([Location 4375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4375))

- nevertheless, you must at times consider the action of the market, in making your plans. In comparing any situation with a previous one be sure you have the facts of both, so make allowances in psychology. Over action is always followed by overreaction. The Unforeseen:—Always make allowances for chance. Keep a financial and mental and physical reserve. ---------------------------- In general run quickly. At first not seeing what one was supposed to be running from, Baruch was slow to make his retreat, but by 1931, at least, he had done some significant selling. Certainly he lacked for no facts concerning the state of the nation. In August 1931 Hugh Johnson returned from a national inspection to report having seen “distinct signs of under-nourishment.” He said that real estate was moribund, the farm-implements business was worse than it had been even in 1921, and that prospects for construction, autos, and railroads… ([Location 4384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4384))

- good, but I am so firmly convinced of the prolongation of this depression, that I have been unable to make up my mind. In the third week of November Baruch directed Miss Boyle to take financial inventory.[49] Millions were out of work, England was off gold, banks were failing, and investment-grade bonds were falling along with common stocks. The National Lead Company, which was better off than many, declared an extra 25-cent-per-share “emergency relief” dividend which it asked its stockholders to pass on to the needy. On November 11, 1931, at a reunion of the War Industries Board alumni at which optimism was de rigueur, Baruch could venture not much further than to say, after his old stock-market mentor Middleton Schoolbred Burrill, that “. . . we have disrupted the continuity of pessimism.” On November 18 he joined his colleagues at the B&O board in a unanimous resolution to halve their… ([Location 4394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00935UR74&location=4394))
