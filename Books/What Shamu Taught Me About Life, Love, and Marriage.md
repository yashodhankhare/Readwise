## Highlights
- I’m an altogether different person than I was three years ago. My friends and family may not have noticed, but I am almost unrecognizable to myself at times. My outlook is more optimistic. I’m less judgmental. I have vastly more patience and self-control. I’m a better observer. I get along better with people, especially my husband. I have a peace of mind that comes from the world making so much more sense to me. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=59))

- But not even he really understood at first what I was up to—that I had begun to use the animal training techniques, only I was using them on my fellow species, and on no one more than my handsome husband. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=77))

- Eventually, I wrote a column for The New York Times about how I had improved my marriage by thinking like an animal trainer. To my surprise, the whole world sat up and took notice. After being ignored by my friends, I was suddenly besieged with interview requests from around the globe—Brazil, Ireland, Spain, Canada. Four reporters called me from Australia alone. My in-box filled up with congratulatory e-mails. I landed on the Today show. Hollywood called. My column shot to the top of the list of most e-mailed stories at the Times, where it remained for days, then weeks, and eventually became the most e-mailed story of 2006. When the dust settled, I had a movie deal and a contract to make my Times column into a book. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=79))

- I learned to teach Dixie what I wanted rather than what I didn’t want. I learned not to take anything she did personally, not even when she ripped my shorts in a fit of overexcitement. All this from a six-week puppy training class. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=151))

- I can’t say the instant it happened, but eventually it dawned on me that if trainers could work such wonders with spotted eagle rays and baboons and dolphins, might not their methods apply to another species—humans? It was not much of a leap for me. By just watching, thinking, and reading about animal behavior, I had discovered a good deal about the behavior of my own species. In a kind of reverse anthropomorphism, I couldn’t help seeing parallels, especially with the primates, but with all the animals, even the turkey vulture, which, like us, sunbathes. True, people are more complicated than animals, but maybe not as much as we assume. As the relatively nascent field of animal behavior continues to grow, more and more research shows that animals are anything but mindless organisms driven solely by instinct. Traits that were considered unique to humans, such as tool use and collaboration, have been found among other primates and now birds and fish. Turns out groupers and moray eels hunt together, and crows are quite handy with a bit of wire. Complicated or not, we Homo sapiens, the highest of the primates, the tippy-top of the food chain, a frighteningly successful species, are, in the end, members of the animal kingdom, like it or not. Animal trainers showed me that there are universal rules of behavior that cut across all species. Why should we be any different? I began to take home what I learned at the teaching zoo. If my husband did something that annoyed me, I thought, “How would an exotic animal trainer respond?” If I got into a squabble with a relative, I did the same. If the clerk at the post office gave me a hard time, likewise. That may sound ridiculous. I admit it. In fact, at the start I thought of it as a kind of goofy experiment, but the early results were so convincing that I kept at it.

- Instead of thinking, “Don’t call him a space shot,” I’d ask myself, “What would a dolphin trainer do?” That is what I’m doing right now as my agitated husband looks for his keys. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=212))

- The answer is “nothing.” Dolphin trainers, in fact all progressive trainers, reward the behavior they want and ignore the behavior they don’t. So I’m ignoring behavior I don’t want—Scott’s rising temper. I don’t even call out places to look. Rather, I, lips sealed, keep at the task at hand, rinsing a plate. At the sink, I hear my husband bang a closet door shut, rustle through papers on a chest in the front hall, and thump upstairs. I pop the plate into the dishwasher and rinse another. Then, sure enough, all goes quiet. A moment later, Scott strides into the kitchen, keys in hand, and says calmly, “Found them.” Without turning, I call out, “Great, see you later.” Off he goes with our much-calmed pup. The drama averted, I feel like I should toss him a mackerel, maybe toss myself one too. It’s not easy thinking like an exotic animal trainer.

- Any interaction is training. Translation: Every time you have any kind of contact with an animal—when you leave food on the floor, talk to it, pass its enclosure—you are teaching it something whether you mean to or not.

- All of us, whether consciously or not, spend a good chunk of our day trying to alter each other’s behavior. When you tailgate someone, you hope to make the car ahead speed up or get the hell out of the way. When you help someone, say, by explaining the appropriate length for toenails to your spouse or teasing a friend for obsessively tracking the underwear habits of Britney Spears, you are, to some extent, trying to change them. When you do something just right, say, organize your recycling bin perfectly or keep your lawn just so, you offer a model, consciously or unconsciously, in hopes your neighbors will do things your way. When you sigh with the drama of a movie star while waiting for a table at a restaurant, you are trying to get the host to seat you immediately. We may be direct or indirect, polite or pushy, but we are all aiming for the same bird. This bent, I think, is most obvious between parents and children, who are typically caught in such a dizzying behavioral cycle you can’t tell who is training whom, but it goes on as well between mates, friends, coworkers, relatives, and strangers nonstop. Along the way, we teach plenty of behaviors by accident. How many times has a spouse whined, “But I thought you liked it when I (fill in the blank).” Parents unintentionally teach their kids to resist going to bed, as the more the youngsters dig in their heels, the more mom and dad negotiate, plead, and bribe. People who respond to lunch and dinner invitations with breathless e-mails listing their busy schedules train their friends not to invite them to anything. Many employers encourage the exact opposite of what they want—doing the bare minimum—by not rewarding workers who go the extra mile and by heaping lots of attention, albeit negative, on the slackers. Even institutions are in on the game. The airlines may have saved themselves financially in recent years, but along the way they have taught a nation that loved flying to hate it. I am no exception. I had been unwittingly training people my whole life, none more than my husband, Scott, and he me. My techniques were nagging, occasional diplomatic overtures, pleading, sarcasm, and a personal favorite, the cold shoulder. His were spousal deafness, occasional snarls, edicts (“No more loud nose-blowing,” he proclaimed once), and more spousal deafness. We rarely got the results we wanted. Along the way, I had, by mistake, trained him to take refuge in the bathroom every time I mentioned gardening. He had trained me to honk my nose even louder (it was fun to see him cringe). Though none of our techniques worked all that well, we persisted like old-school circus trainers who knew only one way to work an animal, mostly a negative way. So if I was already essentially trying to change my husband, not to mention friends, relatives, coworkers and whomever, why not do so consciously, not to mention effectively? Why not think like an animal trainer, like a progressive animal trainer? Why not ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=281))

- change behavior on purpose rather than by accident? This is just how purposeful animal trainers are. They pick a behavior they want to train, say, a sea lion’s balancing a ball on its nose, a classic. Next they come up with a step-by-step procedure to that end: Hold the ball out for the sea lion to feel with its strong blond whiskers, hold the ball overhead so the animal stretches its rubbery neck and whiskers straight up, get the animal to hold that position, and finally, set the ball on its moist nose. Trainers write all these steps down. Then they note their progress from one training session to the next. Marine mammal trainers especially can churn out page after page of this stuff, even lovely graphs. Now, I’m not nearly that organized, so a written training plan was not realistic for me. And my training would always be on the fly as I rushed through the day. Animal trainers have a big advantage that I don’t: It is their job. When they train, that is all they are doing. They aren’t answering the phone, looking for a yogurt in the fridge, or paying bills while checking to see if a dolphin correctly slapped the water with its pectoral flipper. With all the distractions of everyday life, I would never have the concentration of a pro. Not to mention that my animals could talk back, saying things like “Are you using animal training on me?” But it was still worth a try. So, plan or no, like a trainer, I needed to set a few specific goals, to think of what I wanted and didn’t want, not just keep stumbling along. As it was, I was working like a trainer who just tosses a ball to a sea lion to see what will happen. If I wanted the ball balanced on that whiskered nose, figuratively, I needed to be far more deliberate. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=303))

- Progressive trainers take a fundamentally opposite approach. They think of training as communication. They teach rather than tame. They don’t make animals do anything, but rather entice them. Their goal is to make animals not obedient, but engaged. They want animals to like—no, love—training. That rules out pinches, cracks, and zaps. Purists won’t even use the word “no.” It’s not that these trainers wouldn’t pull back on the leash or shout if a dog lunged for the ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=336))

- Thanksgiving turkey, but they don’t use punishment as a teaching tool. They motivate animals only with rewards. Cue a dog to sit. If his bottom hits the floor, he earns a treat. If he doesn’t take a seat, there are no repercussions except not getting kibble. This way, an animal never has anything to lose.

- These are the kind of trainers I spent hours and hours with by various tanks and enclosures. This is why, for me, “training” is a magical word, so magical in fact that I can forget how negative it is for other people. If I do, forgive me.

- Why not just be direct, as some people put it to me, and tell people what you want or don’t? First, why speech is automatically considered a more direct means of communication than behavior is a mystery to me. Second, talk isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=356))

- That we can talk gives us an edge over animals in communication, but we so often sabotage ourselves with our own language. Despite all that evolution has endowed us with in the speech department, we are sloppy, even lazy, when it comes to expressing ourselves. We say one thing meaning another, then attempt to clear it all up with more words. We let our minds drift like wayward hot air balloons while we rattle on. “What was I talking about?” we mumble to each other. We drag the great emotional weight of our past and our fears for the future into the simplest of verbal exchanges, like what to get for takeout. We say one thing while our body language or volume broadcasts the exact opposite. “I’m sorry,” countless spouses through the ages have screamed at each other, to which countless spouses have responded with a bit of body language—slamming a door. Speech can be such a crutch that we focus on what somebody says when what they’re doing says it all. As expert trainer Karen Pryor points out in Don’t Shoot the Dog!, when human couples argue, what they say steals the show rather than what they are doing—fighting. Humans are so sloppy, I think, because we can later explain ourselves, put it another way, or apologize to our fellow higher primates. There’s no explaining anything to an animal. If a trainer’s timing is off and he unintentionally teaches a dolphin to jump when he meant it to flip, there’s no explaining to the marine mammal, “Oh, jeez, sorry, what I meant was…” If a trainer unnerves an animal by getting too close too fast, he doesn’t get to explain that he just wants to be friends. When a trainer falls down in front of a big cat, he doesn’t get to explain it was an accident, that he’s not a prey animal. That animals take the world literally, connect the behavioral dots on the spot, and respond so clearly, drives home this fact: What you do is communication. If it wasn’t so, we couldn’t train animals. But we can, and without one word. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=366))

- I asked Wells his general approach to working with animals. He answered in his lush Hungarian accent, “If something doesn’t work, try to think of something else.” I took his advice to heart. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=392))

- As I describe a problem I’m having with a student in my class who consistently turns in papers late, Scott responds, “Is there a way you can shamu it?” Shamu the proper noun has become an all-purpose verb in our house. It’s shorthand for using the principles of animal training to solve a behavioral riddle. We shamu friends, family, and neighbors. We shamu each other. “Did you just shamu me?” one of us will ask the other. Even a couple of our friends have begun to shamu, and call it that. In fact, it was our friend Kirsten, a high school teacher, who first conjugated the word. She shamued us into using it. Shamu the noun has also become an adjective, as in “I just had a profoundly unshamu moment.” That means I just blew it, as in the time I snapped at the driver of the recycling truck for blocking my car in the driveway. Or we might shake our heads over someone’s hysterical behavior and mutter, “That’s not very shamu.” ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=395))

- Trainers must also learn to do the opposite of what their instincts tell them to. Should a killer whale grab you in his mouth, go limp. That way he will grow bored and let go. If a big cat attacks, roll into a ball and don’t struggle. Struggling will make the cat bite harder. If a snake sinks its fangs into your hand, don’t jerk away. Its teeth, which angle inward, can easily break off in your flesh, where they will fester. A snake bite won’t kill you, but the infection might.

- I needed most, if not all, of the same qualities of a trainer to work with human animals. Though I will never have the composure of a monk, I had found, working with my dogs, wells of self-control and patience. Couldn’t I do the same with the humans in my life?

- The primary lesson trainers taught me was this: I had to look in the mirror. That’s what thinking like an exotic animal trainer ultimately meant. I had to change myself. The onus, like it or not, was on me. I began to analyze my own behavior. I considered how my actions might contribute to my husband’s, my sister’s, or those of the huffy young thing at the ATM. What could I do differently, I asked myself? Typically, I would have concentrated exclusively on what I should say to someone. Like a diplomat, or a writer for that matter, I would ponder the exact word choice to ask my husband to unpack his suitcase, which languished on the floor long after we had returned from a weekend trip. Or parse out a sentence to explain to a neighbor why I didn’t appreciate his keeping his stuff in my backyard. It’s not that I wouldn’t use words anymore, but they wouldn’t be all I used. Instead of obsessing over the right thing to say, I would also consider how to say it, my timing, and my accompanying body language. I adopted the trainers’ motto: “It’s never the animal’s fault.” That’s easier to apply when the animal is not a human animal, because sometimes it is the human animal’s fault; but it forced me to think of how I could use my behavior, the only behavior I can control. This mental shift demanded a lot of me, but suddenly, I had a new tool to work with—me. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=462))

- If I was going to think like an animal trainer, then I needed to stop anthropomorphizing too, only I needed to stop anthropomorphizing humans. This meant not taking others’ actions so personally, especially my husband’s. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=504))

- Good trainers think of behavior as just that—behavior. They don’t think about who’s right or wrong, who cares or doesn’t, who’s smarter or better looking. They avoid shoulds, stated or implied, as in “The animal should want to sit and stay for me.” They don’t project their own motivations, moods, or neuroses on the animal. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=507))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I gave up shoulds, as in “Scott should want to pick up his clothes,” or, as Jennifer Aniston’s character in The Break-up demanded, “I want you to want to do the dishes.” I detached in a good way. Instead of asking why Scott would do something to me, now I asked why he would do something, period, no me in the equation. I came up with new answers, some so obvious as to be surprising.

- Not taking your spouse’s actions personally is liberating but no easy task. Mates have a big effect on each other’s lives, and, obviously, some behavior is meant as a slight and should be taken personally. But I realized that I, like many mates, took way too much personally, that I saw offenses where none were intended.

- This is yet another reason a trainer must be an astute observer. She must also be self-aware, because setting your animal up for success goes both ways. Both animals, the trainer and the trainee, need to be set up for success. To that end, trainers don’t train when they themselves are sick, distracted, grouchy, or just emotional. They won’t be on their toes. Their timing will likely be off, or worse, they might miss a subtle bit of body language broadcasting, “I’m going to take a swipe at you.” ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=563))

- Like Stark, so many of us figuratively go into the cage when we shouldn’t. Can you reason with a tired, hungry, or upset kid? Not from what I’ve seen. Can you reason with a tired, hungry, sick, upset, or hungover friend, spouse, parent, employee, or boss? Not from my experience, but so many people persist. We often pick the worst moment, say, when someone is frantic over a lost pet, purse, or paycheck, to drive home a point (“If you just used a leash, or kept track of your stuff, or deposited the check like I told you, this wouldn’t have happened!”). We may mean well, but that point typically falls on deaf ears and can provoke a swipe. People, like animals, aren’t wired to learn lessons when they are out of sorts. I know I’m not.

- The best animal trainers learn all they can about a species: its natural history, feeding habits, anatomy, social structure, and native habitat. They want to know what might spook it, if it’s up and at ’em at 6 A.M. or 6 P.M., whether it prefers privacy, if it hunts for dinner or is dinner or both.

- Inspired, I turned a trainer’s eye to the lovable but sometimes baffling species known as American Husband. They are hierarchical and territorial animals, especially in matters concerning who holds the remote control or adjusts the bass settings on the stereo receiver. They are keen-sighted but have neither night vision nor refrigerator-light vision. They are unable to hear higher decibels, especially those that make up spousal speech. Many eat a largely carnivorous diet, which includes cows, pigs, birds, bird eggs, and some grains, preferably fermented or in chip form. Some hibernate in the cold season, otherwise known as the football/basketball/hockey season. Some also hibernate in the hot season, otherwise known as the baseball season. They can be crack tool users, though many are satisfied just to have the tools. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=629))

- Instinctive behaviors can cut both ways, making training easier or harder. Then they just are a fact of life. Trainers know that some behaviors are so hardwired, they may never be trained away. Good luck stopping a camel from spitting or a homing pigeon from homing. A fox was born to burrow and a parrot to preen. Even the best trainers will have a tough time convincing either animal otherwise. In fact, doing so may be a big waste of their time.

- What gave me food for thought was how trainers look to their animals to decide what qualifies as punishment and what does not. If a toy that seems totally innocuous to the trainer makes a monkey nervous, then it’s punishment for that animal. It’s not whether the trainer thinks the toy is scary but whether the animal does. If turning your back to a dog during a training session makes her cringe, that is punishment, even if it seems meaningless to you. We humans typically take the opposite approach with each other. What qualifies as punishment, its scale and method, is typically decided by the punisher. That approach produces some ineffective, out-of-proportion, and even accidental penance. That’s because people tend to reprimand each other in ways that would be punishing to themselves. If you hate to be yelled at, chances are you’ll yell at someone to set them straight. But not everyone hates to be shouted at or hates it as much. A select few love a good screaming match. Along those lines, if you don’t mind roaring, you might not realize how punishing it is for someone else. You might let loose with both barrels thinking it’s not that big a deal, but the person you’re yelling at might burst into tears. If you think like an animal trainer, you’ll note the tears and hush. Well, if you were a progressive animal trainer, you wouldn’t even be yelling. I developed general rules for behavior I labeled “instinctive,” which didn’t mean it absolutely couldn’t be changed, but did mean it would be hard going and probably not worth the effort. My first rule had to do with the relative age of the behavior. Generally, the longer a behavior has been around, the harder it is wired. For example, even back when my husband was my boyfriend, he needed a GPS to locate his wallet. That’s a good fifteen years of wallet losing right there. My guess is he’s been misplacing his wallet since he got his first one in eighth grade. Next I ask, Does the behavior stem from a fundamental trait? My husband is a bit dreamy, thinky, which makes him a good writer but inclined to go through the motions of daily life without paying attention, such as noting where he set down his wallet as he came into the house. That detail was lost while he hashed out a paragraph in his head or plotted the course for a bike ride later that day. Given that two of my rules applied to Scott’s wayward wallet, I gave up any notions of changing that about him. In this game, two strikes and the behavior is out, as in, no training plan for that.

- Lastly, if someone is completely unaware they do something, my motto is “Beware.” Whistlers, table drummers, change-in-the-pocket jinglers, most don’t even know they are making a commotion until someone yells “Cut it out!” We all have these little habits that are so deeply rooted in our subconscious that we are oblivious to them. When people point out these little quirks, we respond, “I do?” ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=735))

- Now, we could both think up brilliant training strategies to change these behaviors we find annoying in each other, but the jobs would be long and uphill, like trying to train a raccoon to stop washing its food. Just as I want to set my animal up for success, I want to do the same for myself, so best not to set my sights on the next-to-impossible, especially if in the scheme of things the behavior is a relatively small thing. So I don’t mention the curtains anymore. Writing this, I realized that Scott doesn’t mention the drawers anymore either. It’s not worth bugging me, he says. Animal training may finally have taught us how to pick our battles. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=747))

- A big part of what makes humans humans is that we aren’t perfect. We have quirks, tics, little genetic blips that makes us us. To know your animal is also to accept it, instincts and all. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=753))

- I noticed trainers did not get a sea lion to salute by nagging. Nor did they teach a baboon to flip by carping, nor an elephant to paint by pointing out everything the elephant did wrong. In fact, the trainers I followed rarely, if ever, even corrected their animals. Progressive animal trainers reward the behavior they want and, equally importantly, ignore the behavior they don’t.

- The early dolphin trainers had a toothy, flannel-gray puzzle on their hands. How do you train an animal you can’t get your hands on? They couldn’t rein the marine mammals or leash them. If a dolphin didn’t like training, it could swim off or sink below the water’s surface. Even though they were in captivity, the dolphins could not be made to train. They had to be enticed. How? The answer was found in operant conditioning, which was hashed out by psychologist B. F. Skinner at Harvard University in the 1930s. In his lab, Skinner demonstrated that behavior is affected by its consequences. A good result encourages an act, making it likely a living thing will repeat it. If a pigeon pecks a piano key and a seed appears, that bird will play on. Enough well-timed seeds, and you should have a winged Rachmaninoff on your hands. That all creatures will repeat what gets them the goods seems obvious, but Skinner proved this to be scientifically true and to be fundamental to the way all animals, including humans, learn. Skinner found a negative result can change behavior, too. If the pigeon pecks a piano key and gets a shock, it would seem a pretty safe bet the bird will give up dreams of a concert career. But the behavioral equation gets a little tricky with punishment. Skinner’s experiments showed correction had an effect but not a predictable one. The pigeon might just come up with a way to peck the ivory, maybe very lightly, pianissimo, and avoid the shock. Or if he is a rare bird, the Glenn Gould of pigeons, he may decide that his art is worth occasional, even regular, pain. Eventually, he may become desensitized and stop noticing the pain at all. He could even come to like the buzz. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=776))

- Habituation is one of the ways trainers introduce animals to anything new that might unnerve them or to accustom them to something that clearly does unnerve them. For example, trainers might wear crisp white vet shirts to help animals get used to what a vet looks like. Or they might use counterconditioning, an active way to desensitize an animal to something unnerving. When you countercondition, you take a negative experience and make it a positive one by pairing it with something good.

- What I personally could use more of is counterconditioning. If someone handed me a candy bar, preferably with caramel and nuts, each time I went a floor higher in a skyscraper, I might get over my fear of heights. If a nurse gave me a pair of earrings each time I got a shot in the arm, I might get over my needle phobia. As it is, some lab techs seem to relish waving the needle in my face. That’s like chasing a skittish cavy around its cage. Human animals, with our love of drama and our innate impatience, like to conquer fears in one huge, dramatic leap. The television show Fear Factor is premised on this flawed notion. Afraid of heights? Jump out of a plane with a parachute. Bugs freak you out? Stick your hand in a jar of spiders. Scared of tight, dark places? Go spelunking. The only reward is having survived the experience, and that may be no reward at all if you come out of it twice as scared. There’s a kinder, more productive way to face our fears. Just ask the cavy. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=815))

- Skinner’s research showed that positive reinforcement is the surer way to get the behavior you want. Positive reinforcement is how Skinner taught his research pigeons to walk in figure eights, to play Ping-Pong, and even to guide a missile (during World War II, the U.S. Defense Department gave Skinner $25,000 for this purpose but later discontinued Project Pigeon). Progressive trainers today use it too. Not because they are sainted souls vying for the Nobel Peace Prize, but because they are exceedingly practical creatures. They use positive reinforcement not because it is politically correct, though it is, but because it works better. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=833))

- This is another big advantage of using positive reinforcement. It builds trust. If a trainer is a source of all things good to an animal, that makes for a pleasant, uninhibited working relationship. Training guru Karen Pryor puts it this way: An animal does something and either gets rewarded, or nothing happens. With no punishment, an animal has nothing to lose, no reason not to trust the trainer. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=857))

- Lastly, with positive reinforcement, you teach an animal what you want it to do. You encourage rather than discourage. The problem with discouraging is that it only stops a behavior you don’t want. It does not automatically encourage or teach what you want. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=865))

- The slap, which was meant to startle, not hurt, the buffalo, did the trick. As with the cheetah, the punishment was immediate, fit the crime, and stopped the moment Walter quit eating grass and returned to the road. Still, the teacher warned the students to use the smack judiciously. First, because Walter would become desensitized to it, which would force the trainers to hit the buffalo harder to get his attention. Second, because whenever you use discipline, no matter how judicious, you draw down the trust account. And third, because punishment may provoke nasty side effects: apathy, fear, and aggression. None of those are conducive to learning. A scared or anxious animal doesn’t make a good student. An apathetic dolphin at the bottom of the tank can’t be taught a thing. A raging buffalo is in no mood for instruction. Trainers don’t want any of punishment’s side effects, especially the horn-in-human-flesh kind, but whenever they use it, they crack open this behavioral Pandora’s box. Even revenge might fly out.

- “Get your animals to like you,” Priest counseled. “Don’t punish them.” That’s an extreme example, but punishment produces the same behavioral problems in humans, to lesser and greater degrees, plus another: hatred, a potent cocktail of fear, aggression, and apathy. How you mix it is up to you. I, like many members of my species, have been known to respond to punishment with small acts of revenge. When I waited tables, should a customer treat me rudely, say, snap his fingers at me or bark some directive, I’d smile and say I was sorry, behaviors the customer wanted. Then I would go to the dish room and scan the mugs. At this restaurant we served clam chowder in the same mugs we used to serve coffee. Little chunks of dried chowder often stuck to the bottom after they’d gone through the dishwasher, and so we waiters examined the mugs before filling them up to make sure they were chunk-free. Whiny, pushy, or drunk customers got the reverse treatment from me. I would round up mugs with globs and pour their coffee straight in. I’d be sure to keep their cups topped off, appearing extra attentive, so that they would not see what lurked at the bottom. On occasion, the hot coffee would loosen a calcified chowder chunk and it would bob to the top. I might get stiffed, but it was worth every forgone dollar, especially when the customers were businessmen who shrieked like little girls. Don’t use punishment with your waitress. As Skinner and I proved, it could provoke unwanted behaviors, not to mention dishware. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=907))

- What typically keeps punishment from working that well is our love of it. It’s the first thing we humans think of. We discipline too reflexively, too absentmindedly, too lazily, and, typically, too much. We’re not always clear what we are punishing someone for. Our timing is often terrible. We chastise long after an offense has been committed, sometimes when the offender is doing exactly what we’d like, when we should be rewarding them. We jump on one small behavior for a long list of grievances that might stretch over years. We batter and berate in the heat of the moment or merely because we are in a bad mood. Grouchy or emotional, we don’t match the penalty to the crime, so the trespasser ends up feeling not contrite but wronged. That can make the punisher angry, and thus the punishment grows exponentially. We may not be interested in curbing behavior at all. We may find fault to punish out of revenge, or because we dislike someone, or to gain the upper hand. We, like other members of the animal kingdom, punish to settle who’s the boss. We higher primates, perhaps the most social of social creatures, are big on hierarchy. We want to know who’s in charge. The answer is ever shifting, but the question is there in many of our relationships, fleeting and permanent, at work, school, and home. Dominance is in the details. This is why spouses, parents, siblings, and bosses bother themselves with the littlest things. A friend of mine’s husband blew up at her early in their marriage because, while making cookie dough, she creamed the butter with the flour instead of the sugar. The sugar is the way to go, but she hadn’t ruined the recipe, nor the world. They had another knock-down drag-out over how she peeled carrots. What were they really arguing over? Who was in charge. I, like my friends and lots of other spouses, unwittingly skirmished to win control of my own marriage by thrusting “my” way on Scott, such as taking what I thought was the quickest route to our favorite beach. I thought I was helping my husband by showing him how to chop onions, but what I was really doing was planting my flag. No wonder he so often resisted what I thought was well-intended advice, and why, when he resisted, I snarled. I would even, I realized, overlook something nice Scott did because it wasn’t what I thought he should do. He once painted the inside of our coat closet a cheerful yellow. He rearranged the shelves. He hung up nifty pegs. This really pissed me off. I thought he should have cleaned the basement first. Worse, I told him so.

- The human equivalent of food deprivation would be to cut back someone’s daily required diet of affection, fun, approval, whatever they generally need to be happy. Examples would be parents who withhold all privileges until a child brings home a sterling report card, a spouse who gives the other the cold shoulder until every single chore on a long list is checked off, a boss who expects his employees to run themselves ragged for the least little pleasure, say, a fifteen-minute lunch break. These are ways to motivate someone with punishment, in this case by generally making them miserable to some degree. Any progressive trainer can explain why this approach is not effective, and that if you use it, your human animals will grow anxious, cranky, even bitey. Like underfed birds, they may, if you’re not careful, simply waste away. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=961))

- Our humanness, our blind faith in punishment, is a central reason why Skinner did not achieve his ultimate hope, that operant conditioning would improve the life of his own species. He did, however, revolutionize the world of animal training as pioneering marine mammal trainers took his principles and went to work with buckets of fish. Karen Pryor was one of those early dolphin trainers. When she draped a whistle around her neck in 1963, she had worked only with dogs and ponies, using traditional methods. Training the dolphins with positive reinforcement, she found she could accomplish so much more. The method opened an exhilarating cross-species channel of communication. Moreover, this style made for a more enjoyable way of working, for the animal and for her. In addition to the dolphins, Pryor began using rewards with birds, red-footed boobies, at the park, then with her pets at home. Then something magical happened to her. Dolphin training began to creep into her everyday life. “I stopped yelling at my kids,” she writes in Don’t Shoot the Dog! “because I was noticing that yelling didn’t work. Watching for behavior I liked, and reinforcing it when it occurred, worked a lot better and kept the peace too.” ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=987))

- That is what trainers do when animals make mistakes or misbehave or do anything they don’t want to reinforce. They ignore it. There are some behaviors they can’t disregard, such as a raging elephant, but if nobody or nothing is about to get hurt, a progressive trainer will typically look the other way. This shocks many people because it is so counterintuitive to how we normally deal with each other. We human animals are prone to the reverse, heaping attention on bad behavior and ignoring the good. Parents don’t notice children who are riding in the car quietly, but let it rip when the little ones pipe up. Spouses don’t think to say thank you for small tasks, but should someone forget to take out the trash, bloody murder may ensue. Employers take hard work for granted, but write employees up for the smallest infractions. Animal trainers turn that thinking on its head.

- The trick is that ignoring unwanted behavior is only half the equation. The other half is noticing and rewarding what you want. The two go hand in hand. I trained my eye to notice when someone was doing what I wanted, whether it be airline ticket agents checking me in quickly or a friend asking me to lunch. It was beside the point whether someone was doing their job or their duty. Either they were doing something I wanted or not. If yes, then I smiled, made eye contact, and was sure to ask the friend out to lunch in return. I also realized some people were doing things I wanted that I thought I didn’t want. I don’t like to talk on the phone when I’m writing, so I rarely answered it during the day. Then I realized I was discouraging my friends and family from more than just telephoning me during the workday. I was discouraging them from staying in touch with me. I want them to stay in touch, and so I began to interrupt my writing and answer the phone occasionally, or at least make more of a point to call them back as soon as I could. At home, I realized my husband was doing many things I wanted him to—washing the dinner dishes, keeping the car running, bringing in the mail—that I was taking for granted. I started thanking him. The same if he took out the trash. If he eased off the gas pedal, again, I thanked him. Likewise if he threw one dirty T-shirt into the hamper, even if our bedroom chair was buried under half his wardrobe. The point was to reward what I liked and ignore what I didn’t. I kept mum about his five o’clock shadow. I would step over unpacked suitcases on the floor without one sharp word, though I did sometimes kick them out of sight under the bed. I slipped up here and there, but my complaints and criticisms plummeted dramatically. At first it was hard to hold my tongue, but I got results pretty quickly, and good results reinforced my own efforts. As Scott basked in my growing appreciation, he shaved more and tailgated a little less. Moreover, the more positive I was with my husband, or, more importantly, the less critical I was, the faster his husbandly defensiveness faded away. When I asked Scott to do something, he was more responsive. His spousal deafness miraculously improved. He seemed more at ease. Maybe, in a way he hadn’t before, he began to trust me.

- Trainers use rewards for a reason. If they don’t, positive reinforcement loses its pop, or worse, can work against them by teaching a behavior they never intended to. A carrot in a trainer’s hand can be just a pointy orange vegetable, or it can be a tasty morsel offered in friendship, or, if cannily used, the means to teach a rhino to back up on command. That is why I did not morph into Ms. All-Around Nicey Nice, showering anyone and everyone with smiles, compliments, gifts, and gratitude. Nor did I become a model 1950s wife, greeting Scott every evening with a kiss, a martini, and a home-cooked meal. However, I became more pleasant, to some extent, just by ignoring behavior I didn’t like, especially my husband’s. No nagging (well, almost none) equals nicer.

- The principles of positive reinforcement are simple, but as any animal trainer will tell you, applying them is slippery business. I’ve seen student trainers freeze, chicken neck in hand, as they did the math of a behavioral equation in their head, one that had seemed so obvious until they actually stood before a lion. The students had to learn the finer points of using positive reinforcement, and so did I. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1045))

- Animal training is in the timing. You can have all your hand cues down and know the natural history of your species backward and forward, but if you are even a hair slow, you’re going to have a problem teaching even the most willing animal to do a trick. Good trainers let animals know the exact moment they get a behavior right. Not a second before and not a second after. When a trainer teaches an elephant to trumpet on command, the second it hits a note, bang, the trainer lets the elephant know “That’s it, that’s what I want.” ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1057))

- Superstitious behaviors are basically accidentally reinforced behaviors. The term, to me, underscored how easy it is to teach something you didn’t mean to, to yourself or someone else. If a behavior seems to produce a good result, whether it actually did or didn’t, that behavior is going to stick. If the sky looks iffy, I take my umbrella, because if I don’t, the heavens always seem to open and shower down upon my bare head. I know my umbrella has nothing to do with whether it will rain or not, but somewhere in the recesses of my brain, my past experience has linked the two (umbrella in purse = no rain, umbrella not in purse = monsoon).

- a response, but an immediate one. This is the reason writing is not such a thrill. The reward comes months, even years later, if then, but certainly never when you are actually writing. By the time an article or book has been published, I’m typically gnashing my teeth over a new project and the former is a distant memory. That’s like giving a dolphin a big tuna about two years after a flip. Humans, of course, don’t need the immediacy animals do. We are accustomed to getting a payoff down the road; still, the sooner the better, especially when learning something new. Sooner is tough to do because human animals do things you like when you’re not around. You can’t help rewarding them after the fact. My policy became to reward behavior I wanted the very first chance I got. To do this, I had to give up some of my natural dithering. I RSVP to dinner invitations ASAP. If someone e-mails me a compliment about my work, I e-mail back a thank-you note right away instead of letting it languish in my in-box. If a present arrives in the mail, I open it up and then phone the giver. And when given the rare chance to reinforce someone in the moment, I jump on it.

If my mother told me she was trying to quit smoking, I praised her. If a friend or relative mentioned changing careers, I’d root them on.

- In these two cases, what each animal is doing is what is called self-reinforcing behavior. Put simply, a self-reinforcing behavior is gratifying in itself. They come in all sizes for animals and people alike, from sailing across the Atlantic to popping bubble-wrap bubbles. (Even my dog Penny Jane enjoys the latter. She squeezes the sheet between her paws and bursts the bubbles with her teeth.) If you enjoy the mere act of doing something, whether shopping at Chanel or clearing your throat, it is self-reinforcing. The more self-reinforcing a behavior, the harder it is to stop or distract someone or something from it. You’ll need a reward that is more reinforcing than the behavior. That goes for the entire animal kingdom. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1183))

- The more reinforcers the better, because even prizes, if predictable, can lose their shine. A variety ensures that an animal won’t get tired of any one kind of reward. It also keeps training, as well as the animals’ lives, from becoming routine. Nonfood reinforcers, such as a rub on the chin, add to the variety but also have the advantage of extending a training session past when an animal’s stomach is full.

- As anyone who has gambled, from the bingo table to the fifty-dollar window at the track, knows, a schedule of variable reinforcement is mighty powerful. Just a very occasional win keeps you betting. In all the times I’ve gone to the track, I’ve had maybe one or two days when I came out ahead. Still I study my racing form, examine the horses and the jockeys in the paddock, make my bet, then step up to the rail and hold my breath. Any race might deliver a pellet, potentially a really big one, like the time I won back-to-back races at Santa Anita for a total of forty-eight dollars. Variable reinforcement is a double-edged sword, in that it maintains behavior you don’t want as well as behavior you do. People unwittingly use variable schedules of reinforcement to teach dogs to beg (giving in to that pathetic stare every once in a while), kids to pitch fits (giving in to the screaming every once in while), and spouses to nag (giving in to the badgering every once in a while). That is why I kept nagging my husband, because every once in a great while it worked, and Scott would unpack a suitcase or shave.

- When an animal won’t do a behavior, won’t take the next step, then it is probably too big. Likewise, expecting someone to change overnight is entirely too big an approximation. Humans, unfortunately, put a lot of stock in the gigantic leap, the turnaround, the overnight success, the total makeover, especially when it comes to ourselves. Every year we write up a list of gargantuan approximations, also known as our New Year’s resolutions, and we all know how well those work out. We just can’t go from being person A to person B suddenly, as much as we’d like to believe we can. Why not is very obvious to an animal trainer.

- The trial-by-fire approach is not only an unreasonable approximation, but an awfully lazy way to teach. It’s not teaching, it’s “Just do it because I say so.” There’s something in it that smacks of dominance to me. We wouldn’t expect a sea lion to understand if, out of the blue, a trainer commanded the animal to salute. “Come on, you’re a marine mammal. Figure it out.” Spouses soften that approach to “Do it because I asked you to” or “because you love me.” Bosses say do it because it’s your job. Parents say do it because I say so. You can ask or order, but if you demand too much all at once, you’re not likely to get what you want. Slobs cannot instantly become neatniks, procrastinators cannot overnight become time hounds, and speed demons cannot suddenly become cautious drivers no matter how much they respect, like, even love you.

- Number three is to train one aspect of a behavior at a time. In other words, if you are using successive approximations, keep them successive. It’s not enough just to break a behavior into small steps. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1383))

- I also stopped raising the bar midbehavior, meaning no more “thanks-butting,” as I call it, as in “Thanks for getting the groceries, but you didn’t get the exact kind of milk I wanted,” or “Thanks for visiting, but I wish you could stay longer.” Raising the bar midbehavior may not only confuse people as to what exactly you want from them but can also punish them. In that case, you may lose the behavior (grocery shopping, visiting) you thought you were reinforcing, and the grocery shopping may fall to you and the houseguests may never return.

- Even the most thoroughly trained animal can be distracted by a new setting. When dolphins are moved to different tanks, the marine mammals often come down with a case of temporary amnesia as they absorb their new digs. This is what trainers call new tank syndrome, rule number four. ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1404))

- If one training method is not working, try another. This is rule number five on my list, and it’s the one that has meant the most to me in a big-picture kind of way. “There are as many ways to get behaviors as there are trainers to think them up,” Pryor writes. It’s so simple, so obvious, but so contrary to the way we humans go about so much of life, especially our relationships. We are so inclined to dig in, to deepen the rut. I often have. And when I finally am neck-deep in the rut I throw my hands up in surrender. If a technique isn’t working, a trainer would not persist like that, at least a good one wouldn’t. And they wouldn’t take it as a personal failure or blame it on the animal. They would just think up a plan B.

- LURING In the morning, the giraffes won’t leave their night quarters. In the evening, the gorillas won’t go inside. At any time of day, a rhino hovers endlessly in the doorway between his two enclosures. Moving animals from their night quarters to their daytime exhibits, what is called shifting, is often a huge headache at zoos. Many animals balk, for hours in some cases, frozen by a bad case of “should I stay or should I go.” To get the animals to decide, some keepers proffer bananas and carrots—positive reinforcement technically, but in this use called luring or baiting.

- Luring is putting the carrot before the horse. It is essentially showing your hand positive-reinforcementwise, saying “You will get this if you do that.” It’s also promising a reward rather than reinforcing a behavior. Hairsplitting, I know, but there is a difference. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1441))

- Least Reinforcing Scenario (LRS), which is what caught my attention. As she put it, when a dolphin does something wrong, say, squirts water when asked to wave a pectoral fin, the trainer doesn’t bat an eye. She stands still for a few beats, remains expressionless, nary a frown nor a sigh, and then resumes training. The idea is that any response, positive or negative, might fuel a behavior. If a behavior provokes no reaction, it typically dies away or, as trainers say, goes extinct. In the margin of my notes I wrote, Try on Scott!

- This method helped me ignore behavior I didn’t want, which is no easy task. The human urge to respond runs deep. Not doing so is counterintuitive. We are social animals, after all. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1531))

- My point is, I always responded somehow, and my responding fueled, or reinforced, his outburst, as it had all the others. When nothing else had, animal training got me to stop. I finally realized how I contributed to fights with my brother, my coworker, and my husband. I might have gone on with this behavior the rest of my life. My marriage certainly would have suffered. I might finally have stood up to the wrong irate stranger and gotten punched in the nose or worse. Giving an LRS, ignoring behavior I don’t like, demands self-control, buckets of it. I cannot give one in a pique. It is not the silent treatment nor a cold shoulder. Rather, an LRS is a head-to-toe poker face. It demands that at times I not be helpful or sympathetic—maybe, in some people’s eyes, not even polite. More than anything it means that I have to hold my tongue, which does not come naturally to me, a fundamentally highly communicative animal. But when I pull off an LRS, tempers wane, complaining fizzles, and pushiness abates. The positive results make having that much self-control utterly self-reinforcing.

- Animals can lose a behavior if they go too long without doing it or being rewarded for it. If a jump or a wave produces nada, the animal thinks, “Why bother?” The behavior gets rusty and then seemingly vanishes.

- The point is that behaviors—except for self-reinforcing ones—will vanish for all intents and purposes if they are not reinforced enough. If you don’t want a behavior, that’s dandy. If you do, it’s not. So whatever you want to keep, be sure to reward it, no matter how big a brain your animal has.

- This is an example of what trainers call an “incompatible behavior,” a simple but brilliant concept. The essential premise of the incompatible behavior is to teach an animal to do something else rather than stop something. The twist is that trainers pick another action that makes the first impossible to do. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1657))

- The beauty of incompatible behaviors, it struck me, is that they tap a natural phenomenon: that it takes more energy to stop a moving object than to change its direction, meaning it may be easier to get someone to do something else than to stop them from doing something. The technique requires some creativity, even a sense of fun. It also pays to know your species, because you can easily shape instincts, or things your animals naturally like to do, into incompatible behaviors.

- Parents especially make use of this approach, not realizing it has a name and a parallel in the animal training world. My mother rarely quieted us down. Rather, she’d send us outdoors to play, where we would not raise the decibels in the house. “It’s not raining that hard,” she’d say as she helped us find our slickers. A lot of mothers in our neighborhood had the same idea, so we had lots of company when playing in the rain, snow, or whatever. The bonus was we grew up to be a very hardy lot.

- If Rodriguez sees even the smallest sign, what trainers call an antecedent, that a cougar might get aggressive, she redirects it. That is, she distracts the cat, with a command, a change of direction if she’s walking it, or even a pop on the nose, as if to say, “Snap out of it, pal!” Or she leaves the cage. She does something immediately to stop the behavior before it gains any traction. You may be able to distract a big cat in those first few seconds after it’s just begun thinking about attacking, but not once its feline mind is made up.

- This is what trainers call displaced aggression. You won’t find it just at the zoo. I see it every day, in my rearview mirror as an SUV pulls close to my bumper or from the sales clerk who snaps over a twenty-dollar bill. Spouses of either gender regularly feel the claws of displaced aggression. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1836))

- is why I pointedly avoid it now. When my husband is wrestling with his bike, say, the saddle won’t go on right or another greasy gizmo won’t cooperate, I do not talk to him, not even to pass on the most fundamental bit of info, such as “Your toast is ready” or even a simple “Hello.” I would break this rule only, maybe, to yell “Leopard!” By the reverse, if I feel like taking a swipe at someone, typically my husband, I look for a log to swat instead. This fall, when I couldn’t find a parking sticker we needed for our car, I went to pieces. It had been a bad day, preceded by a bad week. The lost sticker was the last straw, the stuck drawer of silverware. Scott offered to help me look for it, which inexplicably made me want to divorce him on the spot. So with what little self-discipline I could muster, I marched myself upstairs and threw myself on the bed to rant and rave about stupid parking stickers, marriage, life. Somehow I managed all this while also paging through a catalog. Eventually the images of carefully folded comforters and brightly colored sheets calmed me. As my fit of temporary insanity lifted, Scott called upstairs, “I found the sticker.” ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1847))

- The trick was not just in seeing the cue but in jumping on it. It occurred to me that I might do the same with my human animals: start paying attention to cues, and, moreover, like a trainer, respond to them. It might save me from some figurative bites, solve a nagging behavioral conundrum or two. One quickly came to mind. Most nights, Scott beats me to the bathroom. That done, I can wait a good half hour before I can wash my face as he studies entries in the Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll. I’ve rapped on the door and asked how long he’ll be. I’ll hear a page turn as he calls out “Just a few more minutes.” As in fifteen more minutes. Let’s put it this way: The man has read so long on the toilet that his legs have fallen asleep. Ignoring that he was in the bathroom didn’t work; neither did getting huffy. I needed to stop the behavior before it started, meaning I had to get to the bathroom first, scrub, slough, floss, and brush. Then he could read from Aerosmith to Frank Zappa without bothering me. Typically, however, I would be sprawled across the couch with our pups watching Animal Planet and considering calling it a night at the next commercial break, when I’d hear the thump of the bathroom door upstairs and realize I’d missed my chance again. What would an animal trainer do? Respond to the early cues that my husband is headed for the bathroom to read. Those would be a magazine in his hand as he wanders toward the staircase or an end-of-evening request such as “Have you seen my bike catalog?” Seeing or hearing such a cue, I now make a break for it, calling, “All I need is a minute!” Thus redirected from going into the bathroom, Scott reads in the comfort of an upholstered chair, where his legs do not fall asleep. The biggest breakthrough for me was learning to read and react to my own body’s cues. I have mild asthma. I’ve never rushed to the emergency room; still, even mild asthma is worrisome, because mild can always morph into major asthma, as a number of allergists have lectured me over the years. “Use your inhaler, use your inhaler,” they all chanted. I’d nod but go on disregarding all the signs, hoping my lungs would just cool it. Huffing and puffing to keep up with my dogs, I’d finally track down my inhaler. Usually by then my asthma would be so entrenched that I’d have to reach for the big gun, my steroid inhaler, and it would take days, even weeks, to tame my lungs. If my asthma were a lion, I’d be dead. SCENARIOS Say my asthma was a lion: What was the earliest sign my lungs might aggress? That was when I should redirect my asthma with a couple of puffs on my inhaler. I had no idea. I had to pay attention. The next few times my lungs cramped, I took note. It was the slightest sense of something pushing on my chest. ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1866))

- That is what animal trainers would do. Sometimes, to learn what leads to or provokes a behavior, they have to let the behavior happen. Then they watch for the early signals an animal gives off, the antecedents, so they know what those are next time. Trainers also note the events or circumstances that prompt the behavior, which they call precursors. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SI7WNC&location=1888))

- The trick is to see more than just the behavior, to see what comes before it, what surrounds it, the scenario. The scenario is everything that leads up to a behavior—all the precursors and antecedents, the whole ball of wax.

- People ask me what was the most important lesson I learned from the trainers and their animals. To consider what you are reinforcing, I answer. To ignore what you don’t like, I add. Oh, and to use incompatible behaviors and to know your species. Also, maybe not to act like a prey animal around a predator. I can’t make up my mind. Truth is, it’s hard to say, to boil it down to the one thing. I suppose if I must, it is that the trainers and their animals showed me how to look at the world anew.
