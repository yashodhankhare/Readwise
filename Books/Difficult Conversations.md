## Highlights
- Why is it so difficult to decide whether to avoid or to confront? Because at some level we know the truth: If we try to avoid the problem, we’ll feel taken advantage of, our feelings will fester, we’ll wonder why we don’t stick up for ourselves, and we’ll rob the other person of the opportunity to improve things. But if we confront the problem, things might get even worse. We may be rejected or attacked ; we might hurt the other person in ways we didn’t intend; and the relationship might suffer.

- To make the structure of a difficult conversation visible, we need to understand not only what is said, but also what is not said. We need to understand what the people involved are thinking and feeling but ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=425))

- not saying to each other. In a difficult conversation, this is usually where the real action is. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=426))

- The first insight, then, is a simple one: there’s an awful lot going on between Jack and Michael that is not being spoken. That’s typical. In fact, the gap between what you’re really thinking and what you’re saying is part of what makes a conversation difficult. You’re distracted by all that’s going on inside. You’re uncertain about what’s okay to share, and what’s better left unsaid. And you know that just saying what you’re thinking would probably not make the conversation any easier.

- Each Difficult Conversation Is Really Three Conversations ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=437))

- Every difficult conversation involves grappling with these Three Conversations, so engaging successfully requires learning to operate effectively in each of the three realms. Managing all three simultaneously may seem hard, but it’s easier than facing the consequences of engaging in difficult conversations blindly. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=457))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The point is this: difficult conversations are almost never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values. They are not about what a contract states, they are about what a contract means. They are not about which child-rearing book is ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=482))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- most popular, they are about which child-rearing book we should follow. They are not about what is true, they are about what is important. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=484))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Interpretations and judgments are important to explore. In contrast, the quest to determine who is right and who is wrong is a dead end. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=487))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What I think about your intentions will affect how I think about you and, ultimately, how our conversation goes. The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but profound : we assume we know the intentions of others when we don’t. Worse still, when we are unsure about someone’s intentions, we too often decide they are bad. The truth is, intentions are invisible. We assume them from other people’s behavior. In other words, we make them up, we invent them. But our invented stories about other people’s intentions are accurate much less often than we think. Why? Because people’s intentions, like so much else in difficult conversations, are complex. Sometimes people act with mixed intentions. Sometimes they act with no intention, or at least none related to us. And sometimes they act on good intentions that nonetheless hurt us. Because our view of others’ intentions (and their views of ours) are so important in difficult conversations, leaping to unfounded assumptions can be a disaster. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=495))

- But talking about fault is similar to talking about truth — it produces disagreement, denial, and little learning. It evokes fears of punishment and insists on an either/or answer. Nobody wants to be blamed, especially unfairly, so our energy goes into defending ourselves. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=511))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But in situations that give rise to difficult conversations, it is almost always true that what happened is the result of things both people did — or failed to do. And punishment is rarely relevant or appropriate. When competent, sensible people do something stupid, the smartest move is to try to figure out, first, what kept them from seeing it coming and, second, how to prevent the problem from happening again. Talking about blame distracts us from exploring why things went wrong and how we might correct them going forward. Focusing instead on understanding the contribution system allows us to learn about the real causes of the problem, and to work on correcting them. The distinction between blame and contribution may seem subtle. But it is a distinction worth working to understand, because it will make a significant ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=518))

- The problem with this reasoning is that it fails to take account of one simple fact: difficult conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings. Feelings are not some noisy byproduct of engaging in difficult talk, they are an integral part of the conflict. Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. You’ll get the plot but miss the point. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=538))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In the short term, engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings may save you time and reduce your anxiety. It may also seem like a way to avoid certain serious risks – to you, to others, and to the relationship. But the question remains: if feelings are the issue, what have you accomplished if you don’t address them? Understanding feelings, talking about feelings, managing feelings – these are among the greatest challenges of being human. There is nothing that will make dealing with feelings easy and risk-free. Most of us, however, can do a better job in the Feelings Conversation than we are now. It may not seem like it, but talking about feelings is a skill that can be learned. Of course, it doesn’t always make sense to discuss feelings. As the saying goes, sometimes you should let sleeping dogs lie. Unfortunately, a lack of skill in discussing feelings may cause you to avoid not only sleeping dogs, but all dogs – even those that won’t let you sleep.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Arguing creates another problem in difficult conversations: it inhibits change. Telling someone to change makes it less rather than more likely that they will. This is because people almost never change without first feeling understood. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=681))

- Of course, in advance, we don’t know what we don’t know. But rather than assuming we already know everything we need to, we should assume that there is important information we don’t have access to. It’s a good bet to be true. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=752))

- 2. We Have Different Interpretations ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=754))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Two especially important factors in how we interpret what we see are (1) our past experiences and (2) the implicit rules we’ve ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=759))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- learned about how things should and should not be done. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=759))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We Apply Different Implicit Rules. Our past experiences often develop into “rules” by which we live our lives. Whether we are aware of them or not, we all follow such rules. They tell us how the world works, how people should act, or how things are supposed to be. And they have a significant influence on the story we tell about what is happening between us in a difficult conversation. We get into trouble when our rules collide. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=777))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It helps to clarify the implicit rules that each is unconsciously applying. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=785))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our implicit rules often take the form of things people “should” or “shouldn’t” do: “You should spend money on education, but not on clothes.” “You should never criticize a colleague in front of others.” “You should never leave the toilet seat up, squeeze the toothpaste in the middle, or let the kids watch more than two hours of TV.” The list is endless. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=788))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There’s nothing wrong with having these rules. In fact, we need them to order our lives. But when you find ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=791))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- yourself in conflict, it helps to make your rules explicit and to encourage the other person to do the same. This greatly reduces the chance that you will be caught in an accidental duel of conflicting rules. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=792))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our colleague Roger Fisher captured this phenomenon in a wry reflection on his days as a litigator : “I sometimes failed to persuade the court that I was right, but I never failed to persuade myself!” This tendency to develop unconsciously biased perceptions is very human, and can be dangerous. It calls for a dose of humility about the “rightness” of our story, especially when we have something important at stake. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=804))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There’s only one way to come to understand the other person’s story, and that’s by being curious. Instead of asking yourself, “How can they think that?!” ask yourself, “I wonder what information they have that I don’t?” Instead of asking, “How can they be so irrational?” ask, “How might they see the world such that their view makes sense?” Certainty locks us out of their story; curiosity lets us in. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=808))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What’s Your Story? One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that you’ve thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious about what you don’t know about yourself. This may sound like an odd thing to worry about. After all, you’re with yourself all the time; wouldn’t you be pretty familiar with your own perspective? In a word, no. The process by which we construct our stories about the world often happens so fast, and so automatically, that we are not even aware of all that influences our views. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=828))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It can be awfully hard to stay curious about another person’s story when you have your own story to tell, especially if you’re thinking that only one story can really be right. After all, your story is so different from theirs, and makes so much sense to you. Part of the stress of staying curious can be relieved by adopting what we call the “And Stance.” We usually assume that we must either accept or reject the other person’s story, and that if we accept theirs, we must abandon our own. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=845))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The answer is that the question makes no sense. Don’t choose between the stories; embrace both. That’s the And Stance. The suggestion to embrace both stories can sound like double-talk. It can be heard as “Pretend both of your stories are right.” But in fact, it suggests something quite different. Don’t pretend anything. Don’t worry about ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=850))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- accepting or rejecting the other person’s story. First work to understand it. The mere act of understanding someone else’s story doesn’t require you to give up your own. The And Stance allows you to recognize that how you each see things matters, that how you each feel matters. Regardless of what you end up doing, regardless of whether your story influences theirs or theirs yours, both stories matter. The And Stance is based on the assumption that the world is complex, that you can feel hurt, angry, and wronged, and they can feel just as hurt, angry, and wronged. They can be doing their best, and you can think that it’s not good enough. You may have done something stupid, and they will have contributed in important ways to the problem as well. You can feel furious with them, and you can also feel love and appreciation for them. The And Stance gives you a place from which to assert the full strength of your views and feelings without having to diminish the views and feelings of someone else. Likewise, you don’t need to give up anything to hear how someone else feels or sees things differently. Because you may have different information or different interpretations, both stories can make sense at the same time. It may be that as you share them, your stories change in response to ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=853))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- new information or different perspectives. But they still may not end up the same, and that’s all right. Sometimes people have honest disagreements, but even so, the most useful question is not “Who’s right?” but “Now that we really understand each other, what’s a good way to manage this problem?” ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=863))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Two Exceptions That Aren’t You may be thinking that the advice to shift from certainty and arguing to curiosity and the And Stance generally makes sense, but that there must be exceptions. Let’s look at two important questions that may look like exceptions, but aren’t: (1) What about times when I absolutely know I’m right? and (2) Does the suggestion to “understand the other person’s story” always apply, even when, for example, I’m firing or breaking up with someone? ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=866))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The question of who intended what is central to our story about what’s happening in a difficult situation. Intentions strongly influence our judgments of others: If someone intended to hurt us, we judge them more harshly than if they hurt us by mistake. We’re willing to be inconvenienced by someone if they have a good reason; we’re irritated if we think they just don’t care about the impact of their actions on us. Though either blocks our way just as surely, we react differently to an ambulance double-parked on a narrow street than we do to a BMW. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=916))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There is a way out. Two crucial mistakes in this conversation make it infinitely more difficult than it needs to be — one by Lori and one by Leo. When Lori says “You have this need to control me or put me down,” she is talking about Leo’s intentions. Her mistake is to assume she knows what Leo’s intentions are, when in fact she doesn’t. It’s an easy – and debilitating – mistake to make. And we do it all the time. Leo’s mistake is to assume that once he clarifies that his intentions were good, Lori is no longer justified in being upset. He explains that he “wasn’t trying to hurt” Lori, that in fact he was trying to help. And having explained this, he thinks that should be the end of it. As a result, he doesn’t take the time to learn what Lori is really feeling or why. This mistake, too, is as common as it is crippling. Fortunately, with some awareness, both mistakes can be avoided. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=937))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The First Mistake: Our Assumptions About Intentions Are Often Wrong Exploring “Lori’s mistake” requires us to understand how our minds ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=945))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- work when devising stories about what others intend, and to learn to recognize the set of questionable assumptions upon which these stories are built. Here’s the problem: While we care deeply about other people’s intentions toward us, we don’t actually know what their intentions are. We can’t. Other people’s intentions exist only in their hearts and minds. They are invisible to us. However real and right our assumptions about other people’s intentions may seem to us, they are often incomplete or just plain wrong. We Assume Intentions from the Impact on Us Much of the first mistake can be traced to one basic error: we make an attribution about another person’s intentions based on the impact of their actions on us. We feel hurt; therefore they intended to hurt us. We feel slighted; therefore they intended to slight us. Our thinking is so automatic that we aren’t even aware that our conclusion is only an assumption. We are so taken in by our story about what they intended that we can’t imagine how they could have intended anything else. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=946))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We attribute intentions to others all the time. With business and even personal relationships increasingly conducted via e-mail, voice mail, faxes, and conference calls, we often have to read between the lines to figure out what people really mean. When a customer writes “I don’t suppose you’ve gotten to my order yet . . . ,” is he being sarcastic? Is he angry? Or is he trying to tell you that he knows you’re busy? Without tone of voice to guide us, it is easy to assume the worst.   We Treat Ourselves More Charitably. What’s ironic — and all too human — about our tendency to attribute bad intentions to others is how differently we treat ourselves. When your husband forgets to pick up the dry cleaning, he’s irresponsible. When you forget to book the airline tickets, it’s because you’re overworked and stressed out. When a coworker criticizes your work in front of department colleagues, she is trying to put you down. When you offer suggestions to others in the same meeting, you are trying to be helpful. When we’re the ones acting, we know that much of the time we don’t intend to annoy, offend, or upstage others. We’re wrapped up in our own worries, and are often unaware that we’re having any negative impact on others. When we’re the ones acted upon, however, our story too easily slides into one about bad intentions and bad character.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We Assume Bad Intentions Mean Bad Character. Perhaps the biggest danger of assuming the other person had bad intentions is that we easily jump from “they had bad intentions” to “they are a bad person.” We settle into judgments about their character that color our view of them and, indeed, affect not only any conversation we might have, but the entire relationship. Once we think we have someone figured out, we see all of their actions through that lens, and the stakes rise. Even if we don’t share our view with them, the impact remains. The worse our view of the other person’s character, the easier it is to justify avoiding them or saying nasty things behind their back. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=982))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Accusing Them of Bad Intentions Creates Defensiveness. Our assumptions about other people’s intentions can also have a significant impact on our conversations. The easiest and most common way of expressing these assumptions is with an accusatory question: “How come you wanted to hurt me?” “Why do you ignore me like this?” “What have I done that makes you feel it’s okay to step all over me?” We think we are sharing our hurt, frustration, anger, or confusion. We are trying to begin a conversation that will end in greater understanding, perhaps some improved behavior, and maybe an apology. What they think we are doing is trying to provoke, accuse, or malign them. (In other words, they make the same mistaken leap in judging our intentions.) And given how frequently our assumptions are incomplete or wrong, the other person often feels not just accused, but ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=990))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- falsely accused. Few things are more aggravating. We should not be surprised, then, that they try to defend themselves, or attack back. From their point of view, they are defending themselves from false accusations. From our point of view, they are just being defensive – we’re right, they just aren’t big enough to admit it. The result is a mess. No one learns anything, no one apologizes, nothing changes. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=997))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Attributions Can Become Self-Fulfilling. Our assumptions about the other person’s intentions often come true, even when they aren’t true to begin with. You think your boss isn’t giving you enough responsibility. You assume that this is because she ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1005))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- doesn’t trust you to do the work well. You feel demotivated by this state of affairs, figuring that nothing you do will change your boss’s mind. Your work suffers, and your boss, who hadn’t been concerned about your work before, is now quite worried. So she gives you even less responsibility than before. When we think others have bad intentions toward us, it affects our behavior. And, in turn, how we behave affects how they treat us. Before we know it, our assumption that they have bad intentions toward us has come true. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1007))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The problem with focusing only on clarifying our intentions is that we end up missing significant pieces of what the other person is trying to say. When they say, “Why were you trying to hurt me?” they are really communicating two separate messages: first, “I know what you intended,” and, second, “I got hurt.” ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1017))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Another problem with assuming that good intentions sanitize a negative impact is that intentions are often more complex than just “good” or “bad.” Are Leo’s intentions purely angelic? Is he just trying to help Lori with her diet? Perhaps he himself is embarrassed by Lori’s tendency to overeat and felt compelled to say something. Or maybe he wants her to lose weight not so much for herself, but for him. If he really cares about her, as he says he does, shouldn’t he be more aware of how his words affect her? ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1032))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Interestingly, when people take on the job of thinking hard about their own intentions, it sends a profoundly positive message to the other person about the importance of the relationship. After all, you’d only do that kind of hard work for somebody who matters to you. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1041))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Avoiding the Two Mistakes The good news is that the two mistakes around intentions and impact are avoidable. Avoiding the First Mistake: Disentangle Impact and Intent How can Lori avoid the mistake of attributing intentions to Leo that he may not have? Her first step is simply to recognize that there is a difference between the impact of Leo’s behavior on her and what Leo intended. She can’t get anywhere without disentangling the two. Separating impact from intentions requires us to be aware of the automatic leap from “I was hurt” to “You intended to hurt me.” You can make this distinction by asking yourself three questions: 1. Actions: “What did the other person actually say or do?” 2. Impact: “What was the impact of this on me?” 3. Assumption: “Based on this impact, what assumption am I making about what the other person intended?” ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1057))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Hold Your View as a Hypothesis. Once you have clearly answered these three questions, the next step is to make absolutely certain that you recognize that your assumption about their intentions is just an assumption. It is a guess, a hypothesis. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1068))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When we find ourselves in Leo’s position – being accused of bad intentions – we have a strong tendency to want to defend ourselves: “That is not what I intended.” We are defending our intentions and our character. However, as we’ve seen, starting here leads to trouble.   Listen Past the Accusation for the Feelings. Remember that the accusation about our bad intentions is always made up of two separate ideas: (1) we had bad intentions and (2) the other person was frustrated, hurt, or embarrassed. Don’t pretend they aren’t saying the first. You’ll want to respond to it. But neither should you ignore the second. And if you start by listening and acknowledging the feelings, and then return to the question of intentions, it will make your conversation significantly easier and more constructive.

- Focusing on blame is a bad idea because it inhibits our ability to learn what’s really causing the problem and to do anything meaningful to correct it. And because blame is often irrelevant and unfair. The urge to blame is based, quite literally, on a misunderstanding of what has given rise to the issues between you and the other person, and on the fear of being blamed.

You can’t move away from blame until you understand what blame is, what motivates us to want to blame each other, and how to move toward something else that will better serve your purposes in difficult conversations. That something else is the concept of contribution. The distinction between blame and contribution is not always easy to grasp, but it is essential to improving your ability to handle difficult conversations well.

- When we ask the question “Who is to blame?” we are really asking three questions in one. First, did this person cause the problem? Did your assistant’s actions (or inaction) cause you to have the wrong storyboards? Second, if so, how should her actions be judged against some standard of conduct? Was she incompetent, unreasonable, unethical? And third, if the judgment is negative, how should she be punished? Will she be yelled at? Warned? Perhaps even fired?

- Contribution asks a related but different set of questions. The first question is “How did we each contribute to bringing about the current situation?” Or put another way: “What did we each do or not do to get ourselves into this mess?” The second question is “Having identified the contribution system, how can we change it? What can we do about it as we go forward?” In short, contribution is useful when our goal is to understand what actually happened so that we can improve how we work together in the future. In the worlds of both business and personal relationships, too often we deal in blame when our real goals are understanding and change.

- The blame frame creates a difficult burden. You have to feel confident that others are at fault, and that you aren’t, to feel justified in raising an issue. And since, as we’ve described, there are always ways in which you’ve contributed, you’re likely to end up failing to raise important issues. That would be a shame, because you’ll lose the opportunity to understand why communication between you isn’t working well, and how it might be improved.

- contribution. Misconception #1: I Should Focus Only on My Contribution Advice that you should search for joint contribution to a problem is sometimes heard as “You should overlook the other person’s contribution and focus on your own.” This is a mistake. Finding your contribution doesn’t in any way negate the other person’s contribution. It has taken both of you to get into this mess. It will probably take both of you to get out. Recognizing that everyone involved in a situation has contributed to the problem doesn’t mean that everyone has contributed equally. You can be 5 percent responsible or 95 percent responsible — there is still joint contribution. Of course, quantifying contribution is not easy, and in most cases not very helpful. Understanding is the goal, not assigning percentages. Misconception #2: Putting Aside Blame Means Putting Aside My Feelings Seeking to understand the contribution system rather than focusing on blame doesn’t mean putting aside strong emotions. Quite the contrary. As you and the ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1281))

- other person look at how you have each contributed to the problem, sharing your feelings is essential. Indeed, the very impulse to blame is often stimulated by strong emotions that lie unexpressed. When you learn of your wife’s infidelity, you want to say, “You are responsible for ruining our marriage! How could you do something so stupid and hurtful?!” Here, you are focusing on blame as a proxy for your feelings. Speaking more directly about your strong feelings – “I feel devastated by what you did” or “My ability to trust you has been shattered” – actually reduces the impulse to blame. Over time, as you look ahead, it frees you to talk more comfortably and productively in terms of contribution. If you find yourself mired in a continuing urge to blame, or with an unceasing desire for the other person to admit that they were wrong, you may find some relief by asking yourself: “What feelings am I failing to express?” and “Has the other person acknowledged my feelings?” As you explore this terrain, you may find yourself naturally shifting from a blame frame to a contribution… ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1291))

- Misconception #3: Exploring Contribution Means “Blaming the Victim” When someone blames the victim, they are suggesting that the victim “brought it on themselves,” that they deserved or even wanted to be victimized. This is often terribly unfair and painful for both the victim and others. Looking for joint contribution is not about blame of any kind. Imagine that you are mugged while walking alone down a dark street late at night. Blame asks: “Did you do something wrong? Did you break the law? Did you act immorally? Should you be punished?” The answer to all of these questions is no. You didn’t do anything wrong; you didn’t deserve to be mugged. Being mugged was not your fault. Contribution asks a different set of questions. Contribution asks: “What did I do that helped cause the situation?” You can find contribution even in situations where you carry no blame; you did contribute to being mugged. How? By choosing to walk alone at night. If you’d been somewhere else, or in a group, getting mugged… ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1301))

- Finding Your Fair Share: Four Hard-to-Spot Contributions “The concept of contribution makes sense,” you may be thinking. Even so, as you reflect on your own most pressing entanglement, you are baffled: “In this particular situation, I just don’t see how I have any contribution.” Spotting your own contribution becomes easier with practice. But it helps to be familiar with four common contributions that are often overlooked. 1. Avoiding Until Now One of the most common contributions to a problem, and one of the easiest to overlook, is the simple act of avoiding. You have allowed the problem to continue unchecked by not having addressed it earlier. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1325))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 2. Being Unapproachable The flip side of not bringing something up is having an interpersonal style that keeps people at bay. You contribute by being uninterested, unpredictable, short-tempered, judgmental, punitive, hypersensitive, argumentative, or unfriendly. Of course, whether you are really any of these things or intend this impact is not the point. If someone experiences you this way, they are less likely to raise things with you, and this becomes part of the system of avoidance between you. 3. Intersections Intersections result from a simple difference between two people in background, preferences, communication style, or assumptions about relationships.

- The first step in moving away from blame is to reorient your own thinking about the situation. You can begin to diagnose the system by looking for the contributions you’ve each made to create the problem. Some of us are prone to focus on the other person’s contribution and have a harder time seeing our own. As “shifters” we tend to see ourselves as innocent victims – when something goes wrong, it’s always because of what someone else did. Others of us have the opposite tendency: we are all too aware of the negative consequences of our own actions. In the face of this, others’ contributions seem insignificant. An “absorber” tends to feel responsible for everything. Knowing your predisposition can help you fight it, enabling you to get a balanced picture of what each person is contributing. To understand a contribution system, you have to understand all its components. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1431))

- For better or worse, this conversation will not go well unless these feelings are surfaced. Why? Because you can’t have an effective conversation without talking about the primary issues at stake, and in this conversation feelings are at the heart of what’s wrong. No matter how skillfully dad and daughter negotiate about how much money to spend, the outcome will not leave them feeling satisfied unless they also talk about how they are feeling.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is a common pattern: we frame the problem exclusively as a substantive disagreement and believe that if only we were more skilled at problem-solving, we’d be able to lick the thing. Solving problems seems easier than talking about emotions. Framing feelings out of the problem is one way we cope with the dilemma of whether to raise something or avoid it. The potential costs involved in sharing feelings makes raising them feel like too big a gamble. When we lay our feelings on the table, we run the risk of hurting others and of ruining relationships. We also put ourselves in a position to get hurt. What if the other person doesn’t take our feelings seriously or responds by telling us something we don’t want to hear? By sticking to the “business at hand,” we appear to reduce these risks. The problem is that when feelings are at the heart of what’s going on, they are the business at hand and ignoring them is nearly impossible. In many difficult conversations, it is really only at the level of feelings that the problem can be addressed. Framing the feelings out of the conversation is likely to result in outcomes that are unsatisfying for both people. The real problem is not dealt with, and further, emotions have an uncanny knack for finding their way back into the conversation, usually in not very helpful ways.

- For some of us, the problem is not that we are unable to express our feelings, but that we are unable not to. We get angry and show it in ways that are embarrassing or destructive. We cry or explode when we would rather act composed and capable. Of course, there are many possible explanations for anger or tears, some of which have deep psychological roots. One common explanation, however, is just the opposite of what we might expect. We don’t cry or lose our temper because we express our feelings too often, but because we express them too rarely. Like finally opening a carbonated drink that has been shaken, the results can be messy. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1561))

- A colleague of ours has two rules for expressing feelings. He begins by explaining rule number two: try to get everything you are feeling into the conversation. Most people are horrified by this rule. Surely, we think to ourselves, there are plenty of feelings that are better left unexpressed. Which brings our friend to rule number one: before saying what you are feeling, negotiate with your feelings. Most of us assume that our feelings are static and nonnegotiable, and that if they are to be shared authentically, they must be shared “as is.” ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1746))

- ourselves that is giving rise to how we feel? What is our story missing? What might the other person’s story be? Almost always, an increased awareness of the other person’s story changes how we feel. Next, we need to explore our assumptions about the other person’s intentions. To what extent are our feelings based on an untested assumption about their intentions? Might the other person have acted unintentionally, or from multiple and conflicting intentions? How does our view of their intentions affect how we feel? And what about our own intentions? What was motivating us? How might our actions have impacted them? Does that change how we feel? Finally, we should consider the contribution system. Are we able to see our own contribution to the problem? Are we able to describe the other person’s contribution without blaming? Are we aware of the ways that each of our contributions forms a reinforcing pattern that magnifies the problem? In what way does this shift how we feel?

- Once you have found your feelings and negotiated with them, you face the task of deciding how to handle those feelings. There will be times when you decide that sharing your feelings is unnecessary or unhelpful. At other times, of course, your feelings will take center stage in the conversation. Too often we confuse being emotional with expressing emotions clearly. They are different. You can express emotion well without being emotional, and you can be extremely emotional without expressing much of anything at all. Sharing feelings well and clearly requires thoughtfulness. Below are three guidelines for expressing your feelings that should help ease your anxiety and make an effective conversation more likely.

- What does it mean to acknowledge someone’s feelings? It means letting the other person know that what they have said has made an impression on you, that their feelings matter to you, and that you are working to understand them. “Wow,” you might say, “I never knew you felt that way,” or, “I kind of assumed you were feeling that, and I’m glad you felt comfortable enough with me to share it,” or, “It sounds like this is really important to you.” Let them know that you think understanding their perspective is important, and that you are trying to do so: “Before I give you a sense of what’s going on with me, tell me more about your feeling that I talk down to you.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1851))

- Ben’s predicament highlights a crucial aspect of why some conversations can be so overwhelmingly difficult. Our anxiety results not just from having to face the other person, but from having to face ourselves. The conversation has the potential to disrupt our sense of who we are in the world, or to highlight what we hope we are but fear we are not. The conversation poses a threat to our identity – the story we tell ourselves about ourselves – and having our identity threatened can be profoundly disturbing.

- Vulnerable Identities: The All-or-Nothing Syndrome Getting better at managing the Identity Conversation starts with understanding the ways in which we make ourselves vulnerable to being knocked off balance. The biggest factor that contributes to a vulnerable identity is “all-or-nothing” thinking: I’m either competent or incompetent, good or evil, worthy of love or not. The primary peril of all-or-nothing thinking is that it leaves our identity extremely unstable, making us hypersensitive to feedback. When faced with negative information about ourselves, all-or-nothing thinking gives us only two choices for how to manage that information, both of which cause serious problems. Either we try to deny the information that is inconsistent with our self-image, or we do the opposite: we take in the information in a way that exaggerates its importance to a crippling degree. All-or-nothing identities are about as sturdy as a two-legged stool. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1929))

- And the bigger the gap between what we hope is true and what we fear is true, the easier it is for us to lose our balance. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1948))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Exaggeration The alternative to denial is exaggeration. In all-or-nothing thinking, taking in negative feedback requires us not just to adjust our self-image, but to flip it. If I’m not completely competent, then I’m completely incompetent: “Maybe I’m not as creative and special as I thought I was. I’ll probably never amount to anything. Maybe I’ll even get fired.”   We Let Their Feedback Define Who We Are. When we exaggerate, we act as if the other person’s feedback is the only information we have about ourselves. We put everything up for grabs, and let what they say dictate how we see ourselves. We may turn in a hundred memos on time, but if we are criticized for being late with the 101st memo, we think to ourselves, “I can never do anything right.” This one piece of information fills our whole identity screen. This example may seem ridiculous, but we all think like this on occasion, and not only around dramatic or traumatic events. If the waitress gives you a funny look as she collects her tip, you’re cheap. If you don’t help your friends paint their house, you’re selfish. If your brother says you don’t visit his children enough, you’re an uncaring aunt. It’s easy to see why exaggeration is such a debilitating reaction.

Step One: Become Aware of Your Identity Issues Often during a difficult conversation we are not even aware that our identity is implicated. We know we feel anxious, fearful, or tentative, and that our ability to communicate skillfully has deserted us. Usually articulate, we stumble and stammer; usually empathetic, we can’t stop interrupting and arguing; usually calm, we boil over with anger. But we aren’t sure why. The connection to our identity is not obvious. It’s easy to think, “I’m talking with my brother about how he treats his wife. What does this have to do with my identity?” What triggers an identity quake for you may not trigger one in someone else. We each have our own particular sensitivities.

Everyone else might be quick to fly off the handle, but not Jimmy. He’d be rational to a fault. But after years on his own, Jimmy changed. He began to see the value of acknowledging and sharing his emotions, and doing so with friends and colleagues added to the richness of his life. He wanted to reveal this change to his family, but was afraid. The patterns of who he was with them were deeply etched and, though far from perfect, were comfortable and predictable. His detachment had costs, but they were familiar costs. He discussed his fears with a friend, who asked Jimmy some hard questions: “What are you really afraid of? What’s the downside?” Jimmy’s first response was that he was acting out of obligation to his family: “Someone in my family has to be the rational one. Otherwise, it will be chaos. The way things are now, everything more or less works.” All true, but Jimmy continued to consider his friend’… ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1972))

He determined he would show greater emotion around his family, and at first, the going was not smooth. There were awkward moments, and some members of his family wondered why he was acting differently. But Jimmy persisted, and in time a more genuine set of relationships replaced the old ones. Step Two: Complexify Your Identity (Adopt the And Stance) Once you’ve identified which aspects of your identity are most important to you or seem most vulnerable, you can begin to complexify your self-image. This means moving away from the false choice between “I am perfect” and “I am worthless,” and trying to get as clear a picture as you can about what is actually true about you. As for everyone, what is true about you is going to be a mix of good and bad behavior, noble and less noble intentions, and wise and unwise… ([Location 1982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=1982))

- is always anything. We each exhibit a constellation of qualities, positive and negative, and constantly grapple with how to respond to the complicated situations life presents. And we don’t always respond as competently or compassionately as we’d like. Ben’s fear of telling his boss that he has accepted another job is a good example of this. Is Ben loyal or is he a sellout? Both of those are simplifying labels that can’t capture the complexity of the endless interactions Ben has had with the many people in his life. He has made many sacrifices for his family and many for his boss. He has worked weekends, turned down other job offers, worked hard to help the company recruit top talent. The list of things Ben has done that indicate loyalty is long indeed. And, Ben is leaving his job for higher paying work elsewhere. It’s reasonable for his boss to feel abandoned. That doesn’t mean Ben is a bad person. It doesn’t mean Ben has made a choice based on greed. He wants to put his children through college; he has been under-compensated for years and not complained. What, then, is the bottom line on Ben? The bottom line is that there is no bottom line. Ben can feel good about many of his actions and choices, and ambivalent or regretful about others.

If you are busy trying to shore up your “no mistakes, no failures” identity, you won’t be able to engage in a meaningful learning conversation. And if you can’t do that, you are likely to make the same mistakes again. One reason people are reluctant to admit mistakes is that they fear being seen as weak or incompetent.

- “You are wrong,” O Sensei replied. “I am constantly losing my balance. My skill lies in my ability to regain it.” So it is with difficult conversations. Working through your identity issues is extremely helpful. And still, the conversation will bring its share of surprises, testing your self-image in ways you hadn’t counted on. The question is not whether you will get knocked over. You will. The real question is whether you are able to get back on your feet and keep the conversation moving in a productive direction. Four things you can do before and during a difficult conversation to help yourself maintain and regain your balance include: letting go of trying to control their reaction, preparing for their response, imagining the future to gain perspective, and if you lose your balance, taking a break.

Ask for some time to think about what you’ve heard: “I’m surprised by your reaction to this and would like some time to think about what you’ve said.” Even ten minutes can help. Take a walk. Get some air. Check for distortions. Spend some quiet time weighing their attack on your judgment or arrogance against other information you have about yourself. Check for denial. In what ways is what they are saying true? Check for exaggerations. What is the worst that could happen here?

- Find the Courage to Ask for Help Sometimes life deals us a blow that we can’t cope with on our own. What constitutes such a blow is different for each of us. It may be something as undermining as rape or as horrifying as war. It may be a physical or mental illness, an addiction, or a profound loss. Or it may be something that would not disturb most other people but does disturb you. We sometimes ascribe valor to those who suffer in silence. But when suffering is prolonged or interferes with accomplishing what we want with our lives, then such suffering may be more reckless than brave. Whatever it is, if you’ve worked to get over it and can’t, we encourage you to ask for help. From friends, from colleagues, from family, from professionals. From anyone who might be able to offer a hand. For many of us, that’s not easy. Our Identity Conversation tells us loud and clear that asking for help is not okay – that it is shameful or weak and creates burdens on others. These thoughts are powerful, but ask yourself this: If someone you loved – an uncle or daughter, a favorite colleague ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2135))

If part of your identity is believing that you don’t need help, then asking for it is never going to be easy. And when you do ask, not everyone will come through for you, and that will be painful. But many people will. And by trusting them enough to ask, you offer them an extraordinary opportunity to do something important for someone they care about. Then one day, you may have the opportunity to return the favor. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2144))

- You can’t have every difficult conversation you come across. Life is too short, the list too long. So how do you decide when to have a conversation, for the first time or the fifteenth? And how do you let go of the issues you decide not to raise? These are the questions that torment us as we lie awake listening to that barking dog next door. We’ve spent the first half of this book talking about what you might raise. We’ll spend the next half outlining how. But before we get to that, is there anything we can say about when?

So don’t spend your time looking for the one right answer about what to do. It’s not only a useless standard, it’s crippling. Instead, hold as your goal to think clearly as you take on the task of making a considered choice. That is as good as any of us can do.

- Imagine asking the head of NASA about the purpose of a particular space mission, and getting the answer: “Um, I don’t know. We thought we’d launch someone into space and figure things out from there.” Not likely. Yet we often launch into our conversations in much the same way. We find ourselves in the middle of the conversation, and neither person is quite sure what the point is or what a good outcome would look like.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Remember, You Can’t Change Other People. In many situations, our purpose in initiating a conversation is to get the other person to change. There’s nothing wrong with hoping for change. The urge to change others is universal. We want them to be more loving, to show more appreciation for our hard work, to give us more personal space, or to be more social at parties. To accept our career choice or our sexual orientation. To believe in our God or our views on important issues of the day. The problem is, we can’t make these things happen. We can’t change someone else’s mind or force them to change their behavior. If we could, many difficult conversations would simply vanish. We’d say, “Here are the reasons you should love me more,” ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2247))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and they’d say, “Now that I know those reasons, I do.” But we know things don’t work that way. Changes in attitudes and behavior rarely come about because of arguments, facts, and attempts to persuade. How often do you change your values and beliefs – or whom you love or what you want in life – based on something someone tells you? And how likely are you to do so when the person who is trying to change you doesn’t seem fully aware of the reasons you see things differently in the first place? We can have an influence, but here we need to be especially careful. The paradox is that trying to change someone rarely results in change. On the other hand, engaging someone in a conversation where mutual learning is the goal often results in change. Why? Because when we set out to try to change someone, we are more likely to argue with and attack their story and less likely to listen. This approach increases the likelihood that they will feel defensive rather than open to learning something new. They are more likely to change if they think we understand them and if they feel heard and respected. They are more likely to change if they feel free not to.

- Don’t Hit-and-Run. Often, when we have something important to say, we say it now because now is when it’s causing us frustration. Most of us are thoughtful enough to avoid the most egregious errors of bad timing. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2285))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, there’s another error around timing that we do make. It’s the hit-and-run. An employee wanders into work late, something you’ve been meaning to talk to them about, so you say, “Late again, eh?” and leave it at that. Or you visit your son for the weekend, notice the empty beer bottles in the garbage, and say, “I see you’re still drinking up a storm.” These comments are intended to help. You hope your employee or your son will take the message to heart. But while your comments may help you feel a bit better (“At least I’ve said something”), they make the other person defensive and frustrated, which is unlikely to produce the kind of change you had in mind. A good rule to follow is: If you’re going to talk, talk. Really talk. And if you’re really going to talk, you can’t do it on the fly. You have to plan a time to talk. You have to be explicit about wanting ten minutes or an hour to discuss something that is important ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2288))

You’ll make better decisions about when bringing something up just doesn’t make sense, at least until you’ve sorted through some of your own issues or tried changing your own contribution. And when you choose to engage, you’ll slowly get better at staying out of your own way – spotting and side-stepping the ways you used to trip yourself up. Over time, you’ll lessen your own anxiety and deepen your most important relationships. ([Location 2298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2298))

- who we are as a community is often defined in terms of who we are not, who we are against, and what hardships we’ve endured. Tragically, we can feel threatened by the prospect of reconciliation, because it can rob us not only of our role, but also of our communal identity. These kinds of situations are notoriously difficult to manage because we don’t want to give up who we are unless there is something better to replace it. If you find yourself being swallowed up by a conflict, if you begin to see your very identity as tied to the fight, try to take a step back and remember why you are fighting. You are fighting for what is right and fair, not because you need the conflict to survive.   Letting Go Doesn’t Mean I No Longer Care. Often we are unable to let go because we fear that if we do, it will mean we no longer care.

- We’ve talked about purposes that will get you into trouble. But how about purposes that make sense? The gold standard here is working for mutual understanding. Not mutual agreement, necessarily, but a better understanding of each of your stories, so that you can make informed decisions (alone or together) about what to do next. Anytime you think a conversation might be difficult, keep the following three purposes front and center in your consciousness.

- Exploring the other person’s perspective takes us into each of the Three Conversations. What information do they see that we missed or don’t have access to? What past experiences influence them? What is their reasoning for why they did what they did? What were their intentions? How did our actions impact them? What do they think we are contributing to the problem? What are they feeling? What does this situation mean to them? How does it affect their identity? What’s at stake? 2. Expressing Your Views and Feelings Your goal should be to express your views and feelings to your own satisfaction. You hope that the other person will understand what you are saying, and perhaps be moved by it, but you can’t count on that.

Each of you, in short, has your own story. You need purposes that can reckon with this reality. These are the purposes that emerge from a learning stance, from working through the Three Conversations and shifting your internal orientation from certainty to curiosity, from debate to exploration, from simplicity to complexity, from “either/or” to “and.” They may seem simple – perhaps even simplistic.

- When we jump into conversations we typically begin inside our story. We describe the problem from our own perspective and, in doing so, trigger ([Location 2420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2420))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- just the kinds of reactions we hope to avoid. We begin from precisely the place the other person thinks is causing the problem. If they agreed with our story, we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation in the first place. Our story sends up flares, warning them to defend themselves or to counterattack. ([Location 2421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2421))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The question is what to do instead. Below, we lay out two powerful guidelines for starting the conversation off in the right direction: (1) begin the conversation from the “Third Story,” and (2) offer an invitation to explore the issues jointly. ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2432))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In addition to your story and the other person’s story, every difficult conversation includes an invisible Third Story. The Third Story is the one a keen observer would tell, someone with no stake in your particular problem. For example, in the battle between bicycles and cars for the streets of the city, the Third Story would be the one told by city planners, who can understand each side’s concerns and see why each group is frustrated with the other. When tensions arise in a marriage, the Third Story might be the one offered by a marriage counselor. In a dispute between friends, the Third Story may be the perspective of a mutual friend who sees each side as having valid concerns that need to be addressed. Think Like a Mediator ([Location 2436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2436))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Not Right or Wrong, Not Better or Worse - Just Different The key is learning to describe the gap – or difference – between your story and the other person’s story. Whatever else you may think and feel, you can at least agree that you and the other person see things differently. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2451))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Clearly, there is a difference, and in the Third Story there is no judgment about who is right or even whose view is more common. The Third Story simply captures the difference. That’s what allows both sides to buy into the same description of the problem: each feels that their story is acknowledged as a legitimate part of the discussion. ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2466))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Importantly, you don’t have to know what the other person’s story entails to include it in initiating the conversation this way. All you have to do is acknowledge that it’s there: that there are probably lots of things you don’t understand about their perspective, and that one of the reasons you want to talk is that you want to learn more about their view. You can begin from the Third Story by saying, “My sense is that you and I see this situation differently. I’d like to share how I’m seeing it, and learn more about how you’re seeing it.” ([Location 2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2472))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Stepping out of your story doesn’t mean giving up your point of view. Your purpose in opening the conversation is to invite the other person into a joint exploration. In the course of that exploration you’ll spend time in each side’s perspective, and then come back to adjust your own views based on what you’ve learned and what you’ve shared. ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2493))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Of course, you won’t always have the chance to reflect on how you want to begin the conversation. Sometimes difficult conversations will simply descend upon you – presenting themselves in your office or on your doorstep – whether you are ready for them or not. You can follow the Third Story guidelines even when you are not the initiator of the conversation. Here’s what you do. You take whatever the other person says and use it as their half of a description from the Third Story. Since the Third Story includes their story, starting the conversation ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2508))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Step Two: Extend an Invitation The second step in getting off to a good start is to offer a simple invitation: I’ve described the problem in a way we can each accept. Now I want to propose mutual understanding and problem-solving as purposes, check to see if this makes sense to you, and invite you to join me in a conversation. Describe Your Purposes If the other person is going to accept your invitation, they need to know what it is they are agreeing to do. Letting them know up front that your goal for the discussion is to understand their perspective better, share your own, and talk about how to go forward together makes the conversation significantly less mysterious and threatening. Knowing that their perspective has a place in the conversation, and that this isn’t a campaign to change them, makes it more likely that they will accept your invitation. Invite, Don’t Impose An invitation, of course, can be turned down. Neither person can force the other to engage in a conversation. If you conceptualize your task as “setting the description of the problem and purposes for the conversation,” even a well-crafted opening may meet with some resistance, because this is now your version of the Third Story. So your offer should be open to modification by the other person. ([Location 2521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2521))

- Some Specific Kinds of Conversations In addition to the general advice to open the conversation from the Third Story, we can offer more specific advice on getting started, depending on the nature of the difficult conversation you are anticipating.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What to Talk About: The Three Conversations As you share your stories, each of the Three Conversations offers a useful path to explore. You can talk about the past experiences that have led each of you to see the current situation the way you do: “I think the reason I reacted so strongly is that the last time we didn’t receive payment from a vendor, the situation only went from bad to worse.” You can ask about the other person’s intentions, and share the impact of their behavior on you: “I don’t know whether you realize this or not, but when you didn’t call, I was frantic with worry.” You can empathize with how they might be feeling: “If I were you, I’d be pretty frustrated at this point.” Or share what’s going on with your Identity Conversation: “I think the reason I find this so hard is that being fair is so important to me. It’s upsetting to think that the way I handled this situation might not have been fair to you.” Ultimately, what you choose to share will depend upon the context and the relationship and what feels appropriate and helpful.

- not, but don’t much care. If you’re in either group you might be tempted to skip this chapter. Don’t. Listening well is one of the most powerful skills you can bring to a difficult conversation. It helps you understand the other person. And, importantly, it helps them understand you. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2652))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One of the most common complaints we hear from people engaged in difficult conversations is that the other person won’t listen. And when we hear that, our standard advice is “You need to spend more time listening to them.” When the other person is not listening, you may imagine it is because they’re stubborn or don’t understand what you’re trying to say. (If they did, they’d understand why they should listen to it.) So you may try to break through that by repeating, trying new ways to explain yourself, talking more loudly, and so forth. On the face of it, these would seem to be good strategies. But they’re not. Why? Because in the great majority of cases, the reason the other person is not listening to you is not because they are stubborn, but because they don’t feel heard. In other words, they aren’t listening to you for the same reason you aren’t listening to them: they think you are slow or stubborn. So they repeat themselves, find new ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2700))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- ways to say things, talk more loudly, and so forth. If the block to their listening is that they don’t feel heard, then the way to remove that block is by helping them feel heard – by bending over backwards to listen to what they have to say, and perhaps most important, by demonstrating that you understand what they are saying and how they are feeling. If you don’t quite believe this, try it. Find the most stubborn person you know, the person who never seems to take in anything you say, the person who repeats himself or herself in every conversation you ever have – and listen to them. Especially, listen for feelings, like frustration or pride or fear, and acknowledge those feelings. See whether that person doesn’t become a better listener after all.

- The problem is this: you are taught what to say and how to sit, but the heart of good listening is authenticity. People “read” not only your words and posture, but what’s going on inside of you. If your “stance” isn’t genuine, the words won’t matter. What will be communicated almost invariably is whether you are genuinely curious, whether you genuinely care about the other person. If your intentions are ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2725))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- false, no amount of careful wording or good posture will help. If your intentions are good, even clumsy language won’t hinder you. Listening is only powerful and effective if it is authentic. Authenticity means that you are listening because you are curious and because you care, not just because you are supposed to. The issue, then, is this: Are you curious? Do you care? ([Location 2728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2728))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You can tell what’s going on inside of you by listening to yourself. Finding and paying attention to your own internal voice – what you’re thinking but not saying – is the crucial first step in overcoming the biggest barrier to inauthentic listening. Left unattended, that voice blocks good listening; to the extent you’re listening to your own internal voice, you’re at best only half listening to the other person. Take a moment to locate the commentator in your head. It’s saying something like “Hmm,… ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2732))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Perhaps surprisingly, our advice is not to turn off your internal voice, or even to turn it down. You can’t. Instead, we urge you to do the opposite – turn up your internal voice, at least for the time being, and get to know the kinds of things it says. In other words, listen to it. Only when you’re fully aware of your own thoughts can you begin to manage them and focus on the other person. There are endless thoughts and feelings you might have while you’re listening, but by now you know the patterns: your voice will be chattering away in each of the Three Conversations. In the “What Happened?” Conversation, you’ll find yourself thinking things like “I’m right,” “I did not intend to hurt you,” and “This isn’t my fault.” You’ll also notice plenty of feelings (“I can’t believe she thinks that about me! I’m so furious!”) and identity issues (“Was I really that thoughtless? I couldn’t have been”). Or not uncommonly, you may simply be daydreaming (“I… ([Location 2738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2738))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- How then can you give the other person your full attention and listen with curiosity when your internal commentator is chattering away? You can try two things. First, see if you can negotiate your way to curiosity. See if you can get your internal voice into a learning mode. If this doesn’t work, and sometimes it won’t, you may first have to express your internal voice before trying to listen to the other person.   Negotiate Your Way to Curiosity. It’s a mistake to think your internal voice can’t change. If you find your curiosity failing, you can work to rev it up. Remind yourself that the task of understanding the other person’s world is always harder than it seems. Remind yourself that if you think you already understand how someone else feels or what they are trying to say, it is a delusion. Remember a time when you were sure you were… ([Location 2749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2749))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Another way to rekindle your curiosity is to keep focused on your purpose in the conversation. If your purpose is to persuade or win or get the other person to do something, your internal voice will be saying things in line with those purposes, such as, “Why don’t you just do this – it’s obviously the best answer.” If, instead, you hold as one of your primary purposes understanding the other person, it motivates your internal voice to ask questions, such as “What else do I need to know for that to make more sense?” or “I wonder how ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2764))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I can understand the world in such a way that that would make sense?”   Don’t Listen: Talk. Sometimes you’ll find that your internal voice is just too strong to take on. You try to negotiate your way to curiosity, but you just can’t get there. If you’re sitting on feelings of pain or outrage or betrayal, or, conversely, if you’re overcome with joy or love, then listening may be a hopeless task.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- At times, to be able to listen they’ll need first to speak. When you find yourself in this situation, let the other person know that you want to listen and that you care about what they have to say, but that you can’t listen right now. Often it’s enough to give a headline of what you’re thinking: “I’m surprised to hear you say that. I think I disagree, but say more about how you see it,” or “I have to admit that as much as I want to hear what you have to say, I’m feeling a little defensive right now.” With that on the table, you can get back to listening, knowing that you’ve signaled your difference and will get back to your view in time. In some cases, you may decide that you can neither listen nor talk. This may be because you’re too upset or confused, or simply because you need to be doing something else. Rather than give the other person half your attention, it’s better to say, “This is important to me, I want to find a time to talk about it, and right now I’m not able to.” Managing your internal voice is not easy, especially at first. But it is at the heart of good listening. ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2779))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- While your internal stance is the key to good listening, there are some specific techniques we can pass along, some how-tos that people find helpful. In addition to the stance of curiosity, there are three primary skills that good listeners employ: inquiry, paraphrasing, and acknowledgment. Below are some dos and don’ts relating to each.

- Inquire to Learn The heading says it all: inquire to learn. And only to learn. You can tell whether a question will help the conversation or hurt it by thinking about why you asked it.

- meant was “I’m feeling restless” or “I wish we were there” or “This is a long trip for me.” Any of these would likely elicit a more productive response from Mom and Dad. This illustrates an important rule about inquiry: If you don’t have a question, don’t ask a question. Never dress up an assertion as a question. Doing so creates confusion and resentment, because such questions are inevitably heard as sarcastic and sometimes mean-spirited.

- say into an attack – a sarcastic question – can feel safer. But this safety is an illusion, and we lose more than we gain. Saying “I’d like you to pay more attention to me” is more likely to produce a conversation (and a satisfying outcome) than “Is it impossible for you to focus on me just once?” Why? Because instead of hearing the underlying feeling or request, the other person focuses on the sarcasm and the attack. Instead of hearing that you feel lonely, they hear that you think they are thoughtless. The real message doesn’t get through, because they are distracted by the need to defend themselves. In fact, they are likely to respond in kind: “Well, sure, I can focus on you just once.” And things deteriorate from there.

- Don’t Use Questions to Cross-Examine A second error that gets us into trouble is using questions to shoot holes in the other person’s argument. For example: “You seem to think this is my fault.

- that Kate was able to make the sale so soon after you gave up?” These questions are wrong-footed from the start. They emerge from a purpose of trying to persuade the other person that you are right and they are wrong, rather than trying to learn. To use the ideas in these questions constructively, pull out the statements embedded in the questions and express them — but not as facts. Rather than asserting them as true, share them as open questions or perceptions, and ask for the other person’s reaction. Rather than assuming that this is an argument they have ignored, assume that they have thought about it and have reason to tell a different story. You might say, for example, “I understand that you feel you did everything you could to make the sale. To me, that seems inconsistent with the fact that Kate made the sale right after you gave up.

- Ask Open-Ended Questions Open-ended questions are questions that give the other person broad latitude in how to answer. They elicit more information than yes/no questions or offering menus, such as, “Were you trying to do A or B?” Instead ask “What were you trying to do?” This way you don’t bias the answer or distract the other person’s ([Location 2826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2826))

- thinking by the need to process your ideas. It lets them direct their response toward what is important to them. Typical open-ended questions are variations on “Tell me more” and “Help me understand better . . . .” Ask for More Concrete Information To understand where the other person’s conclusions came from and enrich your understanding of what they envision going forward, it helps to ask them to be more explicit about their reasoning and their vision. “What leads you to say that?” “Can you give me an example?” “What would that look like?” “How would that work?” “How would we test that hypothesis?” ([Location 2829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2829))

- Make It Safe for Them Not to Answer Sometimes even the most skillful question provokes defensiveness. You ask a question out of genuine caring toward the other person and a genuine desire to learn, and still they react by shutting down, defending, counterattacking, accusing you of bad intentions, or changing the subject. One response is to say that you are trying to help and that there is no need to be defensive, and then continue to press for an answer. But this can be experienced as an attempt to control them, provoking further resistance.

This offers a greater sense of safety and, especially if the other person declines to respond and your reaction makes that okay, it builds trust between you. Whether you are talking with your boss or your eight-year-old daughter, giving them the choice of whether to answer increases the chance that they will respond and respond honestly. Even if they don’t answer now, they may later, after they think about it. Knowing that it’s their choice underscores your caring intent and frees them to think about the question.

- Paraphrase for Clarity The second skill a good listener brings to the conversation is paraphrasing. Paraphrasing is when you express to the other person, in your own words, your understanding of what they are saying. There are two significant benefits to paraphrasing. Check Your Understanding First, paraphrasing gives you a chance to check your understanding. Difficult conversations are made harder when an important misunderstanding exists, and such misunderstandings are more common than we imagine. ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2882))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Paraphrasing gives the other person the chance to say, “No, that’s not quite what I meant. What I really meant was . . . .” Show That You’ve Heard Second, paraphrasing lets the other person know they’ve been heard. Usually the reason someone repeats himself or herself in a conversation is because they have no indication that you’ve actually taken in what they’ve said. If you notice that the other person is saying the same thing over and over again, take it as a signal that you need to paraphrase more. Once they feel heard, they are significantly more likely to listen to you. They will no longer be absorbed by their internal voice, and can focus on what you have to say.

- Acknowledge Their Feelings Notice that Ron begins paraphrasing by responding not to what Rachel says, but to what she doesn’t say: that she’s frustrated. It is a fundamental rule: feelings crave acknowledgment. Like free radicals, feelings wander around the conversation looking for some acknowledgment to hook onto. They won’t be happy until they get it, and nothing else will do. Unless they get the acknowledgment they need, feelings will cause trouble in the conversation – like a kid desperate for attention, positive or negative. And if you provide that acknowledgment, you give the other person and the relationship something quite precious, something, perhaps, that they can only get from you. Answer the Invisible Questions Why is acknowledgment so important? Because attached to each expression of feelings is a set of invisible questions: “Are my feelings okay?” “Do you understand them?” “Do you care about them?” “Do you care about ([Location 2924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=2924))

- me?” These questions are important, and we have trouble moving on in the conversation until we know the answers. Taking time to acknowledge the other person’s feelings says loud and clear that the answer to each question is yes. How to Acknowledge An acknowledgment is simply this: any indication that you are struggling to understand the emotional content of what the other person is saying. If the other person says to you, “I’m confused by the fact that you lied to me,” you might say any of the following: Well, it won’t happen again.   I should explain that I did not lie.   It sounds like you’re overreacting a bit here. Each of these is an understandable response. The first two respond to the substance of what is being said; the third judges the feeling. But none simply acknowledges the feeling, or responds to the invisible questions. In contrast, any of the following would count as an acknowledgment: It sounds like you’re really upset about this.   This seems really important to you.

- Order Matters: Acknowledge Before Problem-Solving Ultimately, of course, people want their problems addressed. Questions like “What are we going to do about this?” “Why did you do what you did?” “How do you explain what happened?” are important. But order matters. Whether they say it or not, often people need some acknowledgment of feelings before they can move on to the “What Happened?” Conversation. Too often in difficult conversations and with the best of intentions, we skip right to problem-solving without acknowledging, and the loss is significant. “You’re working too hard,” says your husband. “I never see you anymore.” You realize he’s right, and say, “Well, for the next month, my workload is a lot lighter.

- imagining what it feels like to be you on the inside, wrapped in your skin with your set of experiences and background, and looking out at the world through your eyes. As an empathetic listener, you are on a journey with a direction but no destination. You will never “arrive.” You will never be able to say, “I truly understand you.” We are all too complex for that, and our skills to imagine ourselves into other people’s lives too limited. But in a sense this is good news. Psychologists have found that we are each more interested in knowing that the other person is trying to emphathize with us – that they are willing to struggle to understand how we feel and see how we see – than we are in believing that they have actually accomplished that goal. Good listening, as we’ve said, is profoundly communicative. And struggling to understand communicates the most positive message of all.

- Sometimes, you’ll find yourself wishing you didn’t have to be explicit. You wish the other person already knew that there was a problem and would do something about it. This is a common and understandable fantasy – our ideal mate or perfect colleague should be able to read our mind and meet our needs without our having to ask. Unfortunately, such people don’t exist. Over time, we may come to know better how we each think and feel, but we will never be perfect. Being disappointed that someone isn’t reading our mind is one of our contributions to the problem.   Avoid Easing In. A related and often destructive way to communicate through subtext is what Professor Chris Argyris of Harvard Business School has called easing in.

This is all too common in performance reviews: “So, how do you think you’ve done?” “Do you think you’ve really done as much as you could have?” “I have the same problem, but it probably would have been a little better to . . . . Wouldn’t you agree?” Easing in conveys three messages: “I have a view,” “This is too embarrassing to discuss directly,” and “I’m not going to be straight with you.” Not surprisingly, these messages increase both sides’ anxiety and defensiveness. And the recipient’s imagination almost always conjures up a message worse than the real one. A better approach is to make the subject clear and discussable by stating your thoughts straight out, while also indicating, honestly, that you are interested in whether the other person sees the situation differently and, if so, how: “Based on what I know, it seems to me that you might have gotten more done. However, you know more about what happened. In what ways would you see it differently?” Then if you disagree, you can talk directly about how to test or otherwise reconcile or deal with your different views.

- we say clear and simple. Fair enough, as far as it goes. The problem is this: What’s going on in our heads is often a jumble of complex thoughts, feelings, assumptions, and perceptions. When we try to be simple, we often end up being incomplete. Imagine that you receive a memo from a co-worker that leaves you confused. You are thinking, “This memo shows incredible creativity, and at the same time is so badly organized that it makes me crazy.” In your attempt to be clear, you say, “Your memo is so badly organized it makes me crazy,” or worse, “Your memo makes me crazy.” You can avoid oversimplifying by using the Me-Me And. The And Stance recognizes that each of various perceptions, feelings, and assumptions is important to talk about. This is true of the other person’s perceptions and your perceptions, the other person’s feelings and yours. It’s also true of the various perceptions, feelings, and assumptions that are going on just inside you. The “and” in this case is connecting two aspects of what you think or feel.

If this is the fear, share it along with your argument: “I have a view on this that I want to share, and I have to say that I’m nervous about doing so because I’m afraid it may sound self-serving.

- Telling Your Story with Clarity: Three Guidelines Obviously, how you express yourself makes a difference. How you say what you want to say will determine, in part, how others respond to you, and how the conversation will go. So when you choose to share something important, you’ll want to do so in a way that will maximize the chance that the other person will understand and respond productively. Clarity is the key. 1. Don’t Present Your Conclusions as The Truth Some aspects of difficult conversations will continue to be rough even when you communicate with great skill: sharing feelings of vulnerability, delivering bad news, learning something painful about how others see you. But presenting your story as the truth – which creates resentment, defensiveness, and leads to arguments – is a wholly avoidable disaster. It is an easy mistake to make. It’s based on an error of thought: we often experience our beliefs, opinions, and judgments as facts. When you’re arguing about a favorite movie or food or sports hero, sharing judgment as the truth is fine. But in difficult conversations it doesn’t wash. Facts are facts. Everything else is everything else. And you need to be scrupulously vigilant about the distinction. If you and your friend disagree about whether it is ever okay to spank your child, you add to the conflict if you state your view as the truth: “Spanking children is just plain wrong.” This statement muddies the already turbulent waters, and your friend may hear it as accusatory or presumptuous. Instead of engaging you on the issue, your friend may react by saying, “Who are you to proclaim what’s right and wrong?!” Far better to say any of these: “I believe spanking children is wrong,” “I’ve read several books that say spanking children is harmful to them,” “I was spanked as a child and I feel sad and frightened when I hear of a child being spanked,” or even “I’m not sure why I feel this way, but I just feel so strongly that spanking children is wrong.” Each of these clearly distinguishes between what your view or feeling is and what the facts are. Some words – like “attractive,” “ugly,” “good,” and “bad” – carry judgments that are obvious. But be careful with words like “inappropriate,” “should,” or “professional.” The judgments contained in these words are less obvious, but can still provoke the “Who are you to tell me?!” response.

It’s an important age and I know we can come up with the money.” You say in response, “I think she’s doing fine in public school. I think we should keep her there.” If this conversation is going to get anywhere, the two of you need to share where these conclusions come from: What specific information is in your heads? What past experiences influence how you’re thinking about this? You need to share your own experience in private school – the fear you felt the first few months, the sense of never quite fitting in. How guilty you felt that your parents weren’t able to buy a car because they were paying your tuition for so many years. Tell that story with all the vividness and detail that’s in your head as you discuss your concerns about the decision.

- anything from you is when there’s something wrong!” “Always” and “never” do a pretty good job of conveying frustration, but they have two serious drawbacks. First, it is seldom strictly accurate that someone criticizes every time, or that they haven’t at some point said something positive. Using such words invites an argument over the question of frequency: “That’s not true. I said several nice things to you last year when you won the interoffice new idea competition” – a response that will most likely increase your exasperation. “Always” and “never” also make it harder – rather than easier – for the other person to consider changing their behavior. In fact, “always” and “never” suggest that change will be difficult or impossible. The implicit message is, “What is wrong with you such that you are driven to criticize my clothes?” or even “You are obviously incapable of acting like a normal person.” A better approach is to proceed as if (however hard it may be to believe) the other person is simply unaware of the impact of their… ([Location 3189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3189))

- Skills for Leading the Conversation If your conversations are going to get anywhere, you’re going to have to take the lead. There are a set of powerful “moves” you can make during the conversation – reframing, listening, and naming the dynamic – that can help keep the conversation on track, whether the other person is being cooperative or not. When the other person heads in a destructive direction, reframing puts the conversation back on course. It allows you to translate unhelpful statements into helpful ones. Listening is not only the skill that lets you into the other person’s world; it is also the single most powerful move you can make to keep the conversation constructive. And naming the dynamic is useful when you want to address a troubling aspect of the conversation. It is a particularly good strategy if the other person is dominating the conversation and seems unwilling to follow your lead. Reframe, Reframe, Reframe Reframing means taking the essence of what the other person says and “translating it” into concepts that are ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3239))

- A second reframing move you can make is from “either/or” to “and.” If the other person is setting up a choice between what you think and what they think, between how you feel and how they feel, you can reject that choice by moving to the And Stance.

- It’s Always the Right Time to Listen No matter how good you get at reframing, the single most important rule about managing the interaction is this: You can’t move the conversation in a more positive direction until the other person feels heard and understood. And they won’t feel heard and understood until you’ve listened. When the other person becomes highly emotional, listen and acknowledge. When they say their version of the story is the only version that makes sense, paraphrase what you’re hearing and ask them some questions about why they think this. If they ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3315))

- Be Persistent About Listening We often assume that the listener is playing a passive role in the conversation, but that’s not necessarily true. You can use listening to direct the conversation. ([Location 3322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3322))

- You have to find a way to be persistent, while remembering that you are in a two-way conversation. Persistence in a difficult conversation means remaining as stubbornly interested in hearing the other person’s views as you are in asserting your own.

- Name the Dynamic: Make the Trouble Explicit Reframing and listening involve leading the conversation in the direction you want it to go. These tools are powerful, and most of your conversations will call on both. Sometimes, though, they are not enough. No matter how well you listen, no matter how many times you reframe, the other person will continue to interrupt, attack, or dismiss you. Every time you begin to get somewhere, they have another reason why the problem isn’t a problem after all. Or perhaps they’re acting upset, but each time you ask about it, they say, “No, no, I’m fine. I’m not upset at all.” At times like these, naming the dynamic can help. You put on the table as a topic for discussion what you see happening in the conversation itself. In a sense, you are acting as your own “conversation doctor,” diagnosing the problem and prescribing a way back to health. These kind of diagnoses, and suggestions, sound like this: I’ve noticed that we keep running out of time whenever we start talking about this. Maybe we should designate an hour when we can both really focus on this and address it then. ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3354))

- I’ve tried to say what I was thinking three times now, and each time you’ve started talking over me. I don’t know whether you’re aware that it’s happening, but I’m finding it frustrating. If there’s something important about what you’re saying that I’m not understanding, please share it. And then I want to be able to finish what I’m saying. Here’s what I’m noticing. I ask you if you are feeling hurt by what I said, and you say, “No, no, no, of course not. I’m not that kind of person.” But then you keep acting toward me in ways that people act when they’re hurt or mad at me. At least that’s how I’m seeing this. It seems to me the best thing to do is to try to figure out what I’m doing that might be upsetting to you. Otherwise, I don’t think we’re going to get anywhere. Hang on a second. Several times now, when I’ve said the things that are important to me, you’ve gotten very angry to the point where I feel threatened. I don’t know what’s causing your response. If you’re upset, I’m interested to hear why. If you’re trying to intimidate me into changing my mind, it won’t work. I really do want to know what’s upsetting you, and I want us to find a way to talk about it that doesn’t feel intimidating to me. Naming the dynamic between you can be enormously helpful in clearing ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3364))

- the air. It draws what you are each really thinking and feeling but not saying onto the table for honest discussion. And it can stop frustrating interactions in their tracks; often the other person is not aware that they are doing something that is upsetting to you. However, it does take the conversation off the substance, and sometimes, it can escalate tension. So naming the dynamic is probably best thought of as something to try when nothing else has worked. Now What? Begin to Problem-Solve Often simply sorting out the Three Conversations and bringing to light the heart of the matter for each person clears up the issues between you. But not always. You’ve come a long way in understanding each other’s stories, and untangling what’s happened. You have a better grasp on the feelings involved. But at the end of the day, you still need to decide how to go forward together, and you may not agree on how… ([Location 3374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3374))

- trying to find fair ways to resolve the difference. It Takes Two to Agree Difficult conversations require a certain amount of compromise and mutual accommodation to the other’s needs. If you find problem-solving difficult and anxiety producing, it may be because you are focused on persuading them. Those caught in this trap struggle like a fish on a hook, desperately trying to satisfy the seemingly insatiable demands of the other and reach some reasonable agreement on how to move forward. And no wonder. This frame gives the other side total control – until and unless they are satisfied, you must continue to struggle. Describing the pattern this way illuminates its flaw: there are two people involved, and there will be no agreement unless both concur. You need to persuade them no more and no less than they need to persuade you. Thus, you always have the option to turn the tables, to invite them to persuade you and insist that they do. As long as you are open to persuasion, and… ([Location 3384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3384))

- Ask What Standards Should Apply Generally the best way to manage conflict in a way that safeguards a relationship is to look for standards or fair principles to guide a resolution, rather than trying to haggle with or intimidate the other person. If you can’t find a creative way to solve the problem, ask what standards of fairness should apply, and why. In the case of the dog, there may be a local ordinance pertaining to noise, or a method other dog owners in ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3441))

- the neighborhood have used to keep their pooches quiet. Industry or local practices, legal precedents, and ethical principles all offer ways to settle the matter without anyone having to back down or lose face. Not all standards are equally persuasive, of course. Some will seem more directly on point, more widely accepted, or more immediately relevant in terms of time, place, or circumstance. This is one more topic for discussion as you explore the relative fairness of different standards.   The Principle of Mutual Caretaking. One dynamic to remember at this stage of a difficult conversation is the tendency we all have to believe that our way of doing things is the “right” way. This can lead us to ascribe the problem to something wrong with “the way they are,” and to suggest a “solution” that boils down to doing it our way: “If you would just change, there wouldn’t be a problem.” The frustration is understandable, but the argument is not persuasive. Both the challenge and the spice of relationships is in people’s differences. Occasional frustration is the price of admission. And as we’ve noted, no relationship will endure if one party always gives in to the other. A good resolution will usually require each party to accommodate somewhat to the other’s differences, or perhaps to reciprocate – going one way on some issues and the other way on ([Location 3445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3445))

- If You Still Can’t Agree, Consider Your Alternatives Not every conflict can be resolved by mutual agreement. Sometimes, even after highly skilled communication, you and the other person will simply fail to come up with an option that works for both of you. Then you’re faced with a decision: Should you accept less than what you want, or should you accept the consequences of not agreeing?

- A Difficult Conversations Checklist Step 1: Prepare by Walking Through the Three Conversations 1. Sort out What Happened. • Where does your story come from (information, past experiences, rules)? Theirs? • What impact has this situation had on you? What might their intentions have been? • What have you each contributed to the problem? 2. Understand Emotions. • Explore your emotional footprint, and the bundle of emotions you experience. 3. Ground Your Identity. • What’s at stake for you about you? What do you need to accept to be better grounded? ([Location 3699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004CR6ALA&location=3699))

- Step 2: Check Your Purposes and Decide Whether to Raise the Issue • Purposes: What do you hope to accomplish by having this conversation? Shift your stance to support learning, sharing, and problem-solving. • Deciding: Is this the best way to address the issue and achieve your purposes? Is the issue really embedded in your Identity Conversation? Can you affect the problem by changing your contributions? If you don’t raise it, what can you do to help yourself let go? Step 3: Start from the Third Story 1. Describe the problem as the difference between your stories. Include both viewpoints as a legitimate part of the discussion. 2. Share your purposes. 3. Invite them to join you as a partner in sorting out the situation together. Step 4: Explore Their Story and Yours • Listen to understand their perspective on what happened. Ask questions. Acknowledge the feelings behind the arguments and accusations. Paraphrase to see if you’ve got it.

- how the two of you got to this place. • Share your own viewpoint, your past experiences, intentions, feelings. • Reframe, reframe, reframe to keep on track. From truth to perceptions, blame to contribution, accusations to feelings, and so on. Step 5: Problem-Solving • Invent options that meet each side’s most important concerns and interests. • Look to standards for what should happen. Keep in mind the standard of mutual caretaking; relationships that always go one way rarely last. • Talk about how to keep communication open as you go forward.
