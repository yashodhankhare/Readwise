## Highlights
- I told Andy that Dell was really in four businesses now. First came the client business, which was itself transforming with all that was going on in mobility and client virtualization—which in turn brought new needs in terms of security. Next came the enterprise data center. I reminded Andy that we’d built a tremendous business in storage and networking, fueled by all those acquisitions—about twenty-five in the last three or four years. I said that in case anyone had forgotten, about one-third of the servers in North America were made by Dell. Cloud and virtual infrastructure had become very big for us. Then there was our software business, centering around systems management and IT security. I said we were seeing around twenty-nine billion security events per day; we were protecting tens of trillions of dollars of assets for the biggest banks and financial services firms in the world. I called Andy’s attention to the fact that of the 110,000 people at Dell, almost half—a full 45,000—were in our fourth business, services, helping companies capture value from all the IT needs out there. “So we’re right in the middle of some of the stickiest challenges out there,” I told Andy. “How do you connect older applications to cloud applications? How do you secure and modernize IT environments and ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=199))

- bring them off mainframes and onto the X86 platforms? Put them in the Dell Cloud and do it more efficiently.” Dell, I said proudly, was a much different company than it had been four or five years ago. Andy looked a little bemused. “Am I wrong, or did I not hear you mention PCs at all in that little soliloquy?” he asked. Even smart people, it seemed, were hung up on that one subject. Andy then put a polling question up on the screen behind us: “Last year desktops and laptops accounted for 54 percent of Dell’s revenue, down from 61 percent in 2008. How big will Dell’s PC business be in five years?” Possible answers were: (a) 50–54 percent (about same as today); (b) 40–50 percent; and (c) 39 percent or less. Choice C got the most votes by far. The correct answer was A. I told Andy that with all due respect to his poll, a better way to think about the question of our PC business vis-à-vis our other businesses was in terms of revenue and profit. Let’s say (I said) you sell a billion dollars’ worth of PCs, versus a billion dollars’ worth of software: those two transactions would have very different characteristics in terms of free cash flow and margin. Therein lay some of the difficulty in looking ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=209))

- at Dell strictly from a revenue standpoint. Our business mix was definitely shifting, I repeated. Hoping the message was starting to sink in. I believed passionately in everything I told Andy at Aspen. And in the days, weeks, and months that followed, the business press kept pushing the narrative that Dell equaled PC, and the PC was dying. And our stock continued to swoon. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=219))

- But—from a capital-structure finance perspective, if your company has a lot of cash, its equity can’t appreciate nearly as much because in a sense it’s weighed down by the cash. Cash doesn’t appreciate. If, on the other hand, you use the cash to buy back stock, the stock can appreciate far more. Now, doing that inserts risk: stock prices can always fall, for all kinds of unanticipated reasons. But if you have a business that generates lots of cash flow very consistently, a stock buyback could turn out to be a very good thing.

And almost immediately, I observed three things: first, that if you sounded like the people you were trying to sell a subscription to, they were much more likely to buy ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=610))

The second thing I noticed was that people who were moving into a new residence were more likely to subscribe to the paper. And the third thing I observed, kind of a corollary of the second, was that people who were getting married were much more likely to buy a subscription—maybe out of some kind of excitement at settling down and beginning grown-up life.

- But I didn’t think we were screwed; not at all. The whole reason I’d first thought about going private back in 2010, and the reason I was all in on it now, was that where the world (and the stock market) saw vulnerability, I saw opportunity. Where the experts saw gloom and doom, I saw thrilling possibilities. I knew that opportunities often come from looking at things differently—from having a contrarian perspective. It would have been unimaginable for me to move ahead with a go-private if everybody, including industry forecasters, was saying, “The PC is going to be fine.” ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=782))

- Some people brag about their ability to multitask—I’m not sure how well I can do that, but one thing I know I’m good at is compartmentalizing. When you’re leading a team with 110,000 members, focusing intensely on one thing at a time really is a survival skill, and this was a period when the stakes were unusually high.

- From the outset, it was clear that the Silver Lake team understood aspects of our business that KKR had barely asked about: the importance of acquisitions, the value of intellectual property, the nature of operating-system cycles. Because they’d been born as a technology-focused private equity firm they actually knew something about technology. So when we talked about virtualization or microprocessors or NAND-flash (a type of nonvolatile storage memory that doesn’t require power to retain data) or any kind of intricate thing in our industry, they would understand exactly what we were talking about. And Silver Lake knew what I knew: that even if Windows 8 didn’t do as well as I expected, Microsoft would eventually create a version that customers wanted—and our PC business would rebound accordingly. They understood how building sales capacity and adding new customers would work for us. And when we talked about how new developments in cloud, storage, security, and the Internet of Things, aka IOT (interrelated computing devices operating without human interaction) would affect our product strategy, the SLP team understood far more of what we were saying than KKR appeared to.

- On October 23, twelve days after the Silver Lake meeting, both KKR and SLP submitted preliminary nonbinding proposals to acquire Dell Inc. KKR proposed a purchase price of $12–$13 per share for all our outstanding shares, other than those held by me and Southeastern (all of which they assumed ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=883))

- would be rolled over in the transaction) and contemplated an additional $500 million investment by me. Silver Lake proposed a purchase price of $11.22–$12.16 per share for all our outstanding shares, other than those held by me (again, all of which they assumed would be rolled over in the transaction), and indicated that I was the only party they were interested in partnering with. I felt both firms could do considerably better. My job as CEO, after all, was to do everything I could to increase the value of the company on behalf of all the shareholders. And so, by letter and in subsequent meetings at my house, I encouraged KKR and Silver Lake to improve their offers. I stressed every detail about Dell’s ongoing transformation that might’ve been omitted or underemphasized at the due-diligence meetings. I asked each firm to put forward its best possible offer, knowing that the board would reject any offer it felt was inadequate. In the meantime, the special committee retained a major firm, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), to explore those potential strategic alternatives they kept talking about. Also in the meantime, Windows 8 came out. To say the least, Microsoft’s vaunted new operating system performed contrary to my expectations. The hoopla had been all about the new tablet-oriented user interface: as it turned out, users… ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=885))

- Now, part of the reason for this was that we were in the midst of our transformation—we were investing in all these new areas that we believed in deeply. But investors were saying, “Why are you investing in these new areas? They’re not generating any earnings! Plus, you’ve got this PC business that’s struggling—we don’t really think much of the company.” On November 15, 2012, our financial results for the third quarter of the 2013 fiscal year came out. The numbers weren’t pretty. Our revenue of $13.72 billion was $260 million below the midpoint of the third-quarter guidance range we’d projected in August. The following day, the market price of Dell common stock fell 7.3 percent, to $8.86 per share. — A whole bunch of different emotions were swirling around in me. In one way, I’ll admit—I’m human!—I felt abandoned by the public shareholders. It seemed like they’d just totally missed the whole thing; they didn’t understand what we were doing. They didn’t appreciate the company. They didn’t value it correctly. In my worst moments I’d say, “They’re too stupid to work here.” I probably shouldn’t admit that—I apologize, Dell shareholders!—but at the time, with so much going on, my compartmentalizing skills notwithstanding, my feelings were pitched high. It should be pretty clear to you by… ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=898))

I reemphasized my strong opinions on both counts to KKR and Silver Lake, but both firms were having reservations, if not second thoughts, about what (in the Dell proxy statement’s words) was becoming a litany: “the Company’s recent failure to achieve its projections, the increasing weakness in the PC market, the Company’s loss of market share in emerging markets,… ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=911))

- The press has called me lots of things over the years: an enfant terrible, a wunderkind, a genius, an idiot, whatever else—I’ve developed a thick skin where name-calling is concerned. Most of the critiques don’t bother me very much for very long, partly because I know that over time, the press has become more interested in creating controversy than in presenting objective facts. I find most things to be overstated in either direction, either positive or negative, and the truth always closer to the middle. And—funny, I never had the slightest desire to turn Dell into the next Apple or Samsung. All I really wanted to do was turn today’s Dell into tomorrow’s Dell—and we’d already made a pretty good start on that.

- He liked to present himself as a great defender of the common man, the ordinary shareholder; in fact he was the great defender of Carl Icahn. Sometimes he would simply strip out and sell a target company’s assets with little concern for employees or stockholders but at great financial gain to himself. Sometimes—and this got more and more effective as his reputation and wealth grew—all he had to do was threaten to take over a company in order to get it to buy out his shares at a big markup: this charming practice was known as greenmail. He seemed to have little to no interest in what a target corporation made or did: the game was everything to him.

We were unique—and so under the radar that our biggest competitors, IBM and Compaq, failed to notice us. To them we were just a mail-order company. They didn’t think we were doing real engineering. Didn’t think we really had a supply chain. Didn’t think we had a business model that was superior. And so they didn’t have to worry about us. But of course, we just kept growing and growing and growing. Being underestimated by IBM and Compaq was a powerful motivating force.

Many people don’t reach their greatest potential because they fear failure. In avoiding failure, they deprive themselves of a great teacher. Many others fall short because of lack of opportunity, capital, knowledge, or skills. Persistence is an all-important quality on the road to success. (And success presents its own challenges, avoiding complacency being the first and biggest. Which is why, along with kaizen, PBNS—pleased but never satisfied—has been part of our culture since the beginning.)

- We’d hired the consulting firm Bain & Co. to help us navigate this crisis, and one of their partners, Kevin Rollins, especially impressed me. Kevin was a strategy guy more than a product guy—his experience was mainly with aerospace companies—and from the beginning he understood our business more deeply than anyone I’d ever worked with before. And there was one piece of our strategy that he immediately homed in on: our now three-year-old decision to sell our PCs through big-box chain stores like Sam’s Club and Walmart. Kevin felt strongly right away that the dollars these retail sales added to our revenues weren’t worth the trouble. He argued that with the resellers effectively acting as a barrier between us and the people who bought our computers in stores, a vital line of communication between Dell and these consumers was lost: we could learn nothing from those buyers about what they thought of our products’ performance.

- Things were coming together in all kinds of ways. It began long before the go-private. The advent of the internet in the late ’90s had given humanity access to more data than anyone had ever imagined. By the early 2000s the world of technology was changing at warp speed. We’d started succeeding in the server business in the mid-1990s, and the higher margins there had been great for our bottom line. But as the quantity of data in the world expanded exponentially, it became clearer and clearer that physical servers alone, no matter how powerful, weren’t going to be able to handle it all. A solution existed already. Virtualization is a concept that predates microprocessor-based systems—you could find it on IBM mainframes back in the late 1960s. The idea was to install software within the host computer that mimicked the host, thus creating any number of virtual mainframes within the actual mainframe. These virtual computers, isolated from each other to prevent contagious crashes, could perform specific tasks and then be deactivated. Or workloads could be moved around from one to ([Location 3719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VWFW56N&location=3719))

- the other. All of this took place in milliseconds, and the actual computer hosts could be thousands of miles apart. As microprocessors became more powerful, more and more virtual computers could be housed inside the mainframe. And out in Silicon Valley, tech companies were starting to figure out how to virtualize both PCs and servers. A little Palo Alto start-up called VMware was a pioneer in the field. Its breakthrough product was virtualization software that let a user run multiple operating systems on a PC: you could work with both Unix and Windows on your desktop, or two different versions of Windows, or Windows on your Mac system. And in July 2001 VMware became one of the first commercially successful companies to virtualize the x86 architecture—opening the door to the development of virtual servers. In early 2002 Dell led a $20 million investment in VMware, along with Goldman Sachs and several other partners. On the other coast, a Massachusetts-based company called EMC had become the world leader in networked information storage systems. EMC’s big product was a powerful hardware-software data storage array called Symmetrix, which was having great success among enterprise-class corporations—the top hundred to two hundred companies in the world. In October 2001, on the basis of my longtime friendship with EMC’s brilliant CEO Joe Tucci, Dell and EMC entered into a strategic alliance, in a market that was projected to reach $100 billion by 2005. I’d first met Joe back in 1994, when he was chairman and CEO of Wang Laboratories—this was five years before he joined EMC—and I had great respect for him as a business leader and strategist. I was thrilled to be working with him. For EMC, the partnership provided a powerful new distribution channel to access customers beyond the enterprise companies they were used to selling to. Because their products sold at a high margin, adding Dell as a channel contributed significantly to EMC’s revenue stream. It also helped EMC compete better with other storage companies, like NetApp, that had developed sales channels to sell beyond the top 100/200 corporations. And their alignment with us meant we would not align with NetApp or one of the other storage companies. And last, the relationship let EMC use Dell’s massive procurement power to help lower their material costs for components like disk drives, further improving their margins. For Dell, the alliance allowed us to add EMC’s high-performing storage products to our rapidly growing server business. It gave us an important new customer, as EMC agreed to use our servers inside their storage systems. And it helped us move further into the data centers of those enterprise customers—and positioned both us and EMC to advance on our mutual competitors: the server and storage businesses of IBM, Compaq, and HP. Then, in January 2004, EMC bought VMware. (They would later take it public in 2007, reducing their ownership to 81 percent.)
