- Reinventing Your Life addresses eleven of these chronic, self-defeating personality patterns, known in the book as lifetraps. This book takes very complicated material and makes it simple and understandable. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=136))

- At this point I read Dr. Aaron Beck’s book, Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders, and became excited again. Beck was combining the practicality and directness of behavior therapy with the richness of patients’ thoughts and beliefs.

- What I found in trying to distinguish difficult patients from the ones who responded quickly was a revelation to me. The most difficult patients tended to have less severe symptoms; in general, they were less depressed and anxious. Many of their problems concerned intimacy: these patients had patterns of unsatisfactory relationships. Furthermore, most of these resistant patients had experienced their problems for ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=178))

- most of their lives. They were not coming to therapy because of a single life crisis, like divorce or the death of a parent. These patients all had self-destructive life patterns. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=181))

- A lifetrap is a pattern that starts in childhood and reverberates throughout life. It began with something that was done to us by our families or by other children. We were abandoned, criticized, overprotected, abused, excluded, or deprived—we were damaged in some way. Eventually the lifetrap becomes part of us. Long after we leave the home we grew up in, we continue to create situations in which we are mistreated, ignored, put down, or controlled and in which we fail to reach our most desired goals. Lifetraps determine how we think, feel, act, and relate to others. They trigger strong feelings such as anger, sadness, and anxiety. Even when we appear to have everything—social status, an ideal marriage, the respect of people close to us, career success—we are often unable to savor life or believe in our accomplishments.

- This is a baffling phenomenon. Why do we do this? Why do we reenact our pain, prolonging our suffering? Why don’t we build better lives and escape the pattern? Almost everyone repeats negative patterns from childhood in self-defeating ways. This is the strange truth with which therapists contend. Somehow we manage to create, in adult life, conditions remarkably similar to those that were so destructive in childhood. A lifetrap is all the ways in which we recreate these patterns. The technical term for a lifetrap is a schema. The concept of a schema comes from cognitive psychology. Schemas are deeply entrenched beliefs about ourselves and the world, learned early in life. These schemas are central to our sense of self. To give up our ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=289))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- belief in a schema would be to surrender the security of knowing who we are and what the world is like; therefore we cling to it, even when it hurts us. These early beliefs provide us with a sense of predictability and certainty; they are comfortable and familiar. In an odd sense, they make us feel at home. This is why cognitive psychologists believe schemas, or lifetraps, are so difficult to change. Let us now look at how lifetraps affect the chemistry we feel in romantic relationships. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=295))

- The basic premise of cognitive therapy is that the way we think about events in our lives (cognition) determines how we feel about them (emotions). People with emotional problems tend to distort reality. For example, Heather was taught by her mother to view everyday tasks such as riding a subway as dangerous. Lifetraps lead us to view certain kinds of situations in an inaccurate manner. They push our cognitive buttons.

- 9.   I have not had someone to nurture me, share him/herself with me, or care deeply about what happens to me.     10. People have not been there to meet my emotional needs for understanding, empathy, guidance, advice, and support.     11. I feel like I do not belong. I am different. I do not really fit in.

- Emotional Deprivation is the belief that your need for love will never be met adequately by other people. You feel that no one truly cares for you or understands how you feel. You find yourself attracted to cold and ungiving people, or you are cold and ungiving yourself, leading you to form relationships that inevitably prove unsatisfying. You feel cheated, and you alternate between being angry about it and feeling hurt and alone. Ironically, your anger just drives people further away, ensuring your continued deprivation. When patients with emotional deprivation come to see us for therapy sessions, there is a loneliness about them that stays with us even after they have left the office. It is a quality of emptiness, of emotional disconnection. These are people who do not know what love is. • SOCIAL EXCLUSION • Social Exclusion involves your connection to friends and groups. It has to do with feeling isolated from the rest of the world, with feeling different. If you have this lifetrap, as a child you felt excluded by peers. You did not belong to a group of friends. Perhaps you had some unusual characteristic that made you feel different in some way. As an adult, you maintain your lifetrap mainly through avoidance. You avoid socializing in groups and making friends. You may have felt excluded because there was something about you that other children rejected. Hence you felt socially undesirable. As an adult you may feel that you are ugly, sexually undesirable, low in ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=537))

- status, poor in conversational skills, boring, or otherwise deficient. You reenact your childhood rejection—you feel and act inferior in social situations. It is not always apparent that someone has a Social Exclusion lifetrap. Many people with this lifetrap are quite comfortable in intimate settings and are quite socially skilled. Their lifetrap may not show in one-to-one relationships. It sometimes surprises us to realize how anxious and aloof they may feel at parties, in classes, at meetings, or at work. They have a restless quality, a quality of looking for a place to belong. The two lifetraps that relate to your self-esteem are Defectiveness and Failure. • DEFECTIVENESS • With Defectiveness, you feel inwardly flawed and defective. You believe that you would be fundamentally unlovable to anyone who got close enough to really know you. Your defectiveness would be exposed. As a child, you did not feel respected for who you were in your family. Instead, you were criticized for your “flaws.” You blamed yourself—you felt unworthy of love. As an adult, you are afraid of love. You find it ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=549))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- difficult to believe that people close to you value you, so you expect rejection. • FAILURE • Failure is the belief that you are inadequate in areas of achievement, such as school, work, and sports. You believe you have failed relative to your peers. As a child, you were made to feel inferior in terms of achievement. You may have had a learning disability, or you may never have learned enough discipline to master important skills, such as reading. Other children were always better than you. You were called “stupid,” “untalented,” or “lazy.” As an adult, you maintain your lifetrap by exaggerating the degree of your failure and by acting in ways that ensure… ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=558))

- If you are in the Unrelenting Standards lifetrap, you strive relentlessly to meet extremely high expectations of yourself. You place excessive emphasis on status, money, achievement, beauty, order, or recognition at the expense of happiness, pleasure, health, a sense of accomplishment, and satisfying relationships. You probably apply your rigid standards to other people as well and are very judgmental. When you were a child, you were expected to be the best, and you were taught that anything else was failure. You learned that nothing you did was quite good enough. • ENTITLEMENT • The final lifetrap, Entitlement, is associated with the ability to accept realistic limits in life. People who have this lifetrap feel special. They insist that they be able to do, say, or have whatever they want immediately. They disregard what others consider reasonable, what is actually feasible, the time or patience usually required, and the cost to others. They have difficulty with self-discipline. Many of the people with this lifetrap were spoiled as children. They were not required to show self-control or to accept the restrictions placed on other children. As adults, they still get very angry when they do not get what they want. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=572))

- 1. They are lifelong patterns or themes. 2. They are self-destructive. 3. They struggle for survival. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=587))

- As we said in the first chapter, a lifetrap is a pattern or theme that starts in childhood and repeats throughout life. The theme might be Abandonment or Mistrust or Emotional Deprivation or any of the others we described. The end result is that, as an adult, we manage to recreate the conditions of our childhood that were most harmful to us. A lifetrap is self-destructive. This self-defeating quality is what makes lifetraps so poignant for us as therapists to watch. We see someone like Patrick get abandoned again, or someone like Madeline get abused. Patients are drawn to situations that trigger their lifetraps, like moths to flame. A lifetrap damages our sense of self, our health, our relationships with others, our work, our happiness, our moods—it touches every aspect of our lives. A lifetrap struggles hard for survival. We feel a strong push to maintain it. This is part of the human drive for consistency. The lifetrap is what we know. Although it is painful, it is comfortable and familiar. It is therefore very difficult to change. Furthermore, our lifetraps were usually developed when we were children as appropriate adaptations to the family we lived in. These patterns were realistic when we were children; the problem is that we continue to repeat them when they no longer serve a useful purpose.

- A number of factors contribute to the development of lifetraps. The first is temperament. Temperament is inborn. It is our emotional makeup, the way we are wired to respond to events. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=599))

- 7. Your parents criticized you. Nothing was ever good enough. 8. Your parents overindulged you. They did not set limits. 9. You were rejected by peers, or felt different. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=623))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Heredity and environment interact. The destructive influences of our childhood interacted with our specific temperament in the formation of our lifetraps. Our temperament may partially determine how we were treated by our parents. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=625))

- To develop a sense of connection, we need love, attention, empathy, respect, affection, understanding, and guidance. We need these things from both our family and our peers. There are two forms of connection to others. The first involves intimacy. Usually intimate relationships are those with family, lovers, and very good friends. They are our closest emotional ties. In our most intimate relationships, we feel the kind of connection that one feels with a mother or father. The second form involves our social connections. This is a sense of belonging, of fitting into the larger social world. Social relationships are those with circles of friends and with groups in the community.

- with everyday tasks and having a separate sense of self are other aspects. These last two have more to do with the Dependence lifetrap. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=695))

- A third indication of problems in Self-Expression is having a great deal of unexpressed anger. Chronic resentment may simmer underneath, occasionally erupting unexpectedly, almost out of your control. And you may feel depressed. You are trapped in an unrewarding routine. Your life seems empty. You are doing everything you should, yet there is no pleasure in it. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=756))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But perhaps your childhood did not foster realistic limits. Your parents may have been overly indulgent and permissive. They gave you whatever you wanted. They rewarded you for manipulative behavior—whenever you threw a temper tantrum you got your way. They did not adequately supervise you. They permitted you to express anger without restriction. You never learned the notion of reciprocity. You were not encouraged to understand the feelings of others, nor to take the feelings of others into account. You were not taught self-discipline and self-control. All of these errors can lead to an Entitlement lifetrap. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=772))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You developed a sense of Entitlement later in life to make up for, or escape, the deprivation and devaluation. Entitlement can be damaging to your life. Eventually people get fed up with you. They either leave you or retaliate. Your partner breaks up with you, your friends stop spending time with you, you are fired from your job. If your Limits problems include difficulty with self-discipline and self-control, even your health can be affected. You might smoke too much, become addicted to drugs, get too little exercise, overeat. You might even commit criminal acts, such as losing your temper and assaulting someone or getting arrested for drunken driving. Self-discipline problems may also cause you to fail to reach your goals in life. You may have too much trouble disciplining yourself to do the necessary work. People with Limits problems tend to be very blaming. Instead of recognizing themselves as the source of their problems, they blame others. Therefore it is unlikely that someone with Limits problems would be reading this book. They believe that other people have problems, not them. However, it is likely that many people reading this book are involved with someone who has Limits problems. None of the five patients in Chapter 1 had Limits problems. However, many were ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=777))

- Alex consistently distorts or misperceives situations so that they reinforce his lifetrap. His view of situations is inaccurate: he feels people are attacking and humiliating him even when they are not. He has a strong bias to interpret events as proving he is defective, exaggerating the negative and minimizing the positive. He is illogical. When we surrender, we continually misinterpret and misconstrue people and events in ways that maintain our lifetraps. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=833))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Many people escape whole areas of life where they feel vulnerable or sensitive. If you have the Defectiveness lifetrap, like Brandon you may avoid intimate relationships altogether, never letting anybody get too close. If you have the Failure lifetrap, you may avoid work, school tasks, promotions, or taking on new projects. If you have the Social Exclusion lifetrap, you may avoid groups, parties, meetings, conventions. If you have the Dependence lifetrap, you may avoid all situations that require you to be independent. You may be phobic about going into public places alone. It is natural that Escape becomes one of the ways we cope with lifetraps. When a lifetrap is triggered, we are flooded with negative feelings—sadness, shame, anxiety, and anger. We are moved to escape from that pain. We do not want to face what we really feel because it is too upsetting to feel it. The disadvantage of Escape is that we never overcome the lifetrap. Since we never confront the truth, we are stuck. We cannot change things that we do not admit are problems. Instead, we continue the same self-defeating behaviors, the same destructive relationships. In trying to coast through life without feeling pain, we rob ourselves of the chance to change the things that are causing us pain. When we escape, we strike a bargain with ourselves. We will not feel pain in the short run, but in the long run we will suffer the consequences of having avoided the issue year after year. As long as he escapes, Brandon will never get what he wants most—to love and be loved by another human being who really knows him. Love is what Brandon was denied in childhood. With Escape we give up our emotional life. We do not feel We walk around numb—unable to experience real pleasure and pain. Because we avoid confronting problems, we often end up hurting those around us. We are also prone to the terrible consequences of addictions like alcohol and drugs. MAX: HE COUNTERATTACKS TO COPE WITH HIS FEELINGS OF DEFECTIVENESS. Max is a thirty-two-year-old stockbroker. On the surface he is self-confident and assured. In fact, he is a snob. He has an air of superiority. He is very critical of others while rarely acknowledging any faults in himself. Max came to therapy because his wife was threatening to leave him. He insisted their problems were all her fault. THERAPIST: So your wife is pretty angry with you? MAX: If you ask me, she’s the one who’s causing all the problems. She blows things out of proportion, and she demands too much from me. She’s the one who needs to be in therapy. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=868))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In fact, Max chose a very passive, self-sacrificing wife who worshiped him. Through the years, he had become so verbally abusive and selfish that she had finally insisted that either they start therapy or she would leave. Max creates situations where he is one up. He chooses friends and employees who will flatter him, rather than challenge and confront him. He enjoys feeling superior. He devotes most of his energy to gaining prestige and status. He manipulates and uses people in any way necessary to achieve these ends. He tried to stay one up in therapy as well. He questioned our credentials, approach, competence, level of success, and age. And he kept reminding us how successful he was. When we told him we thought he was treating his wife badly, he became infuriated. He insisted we did not understand his feelings. He insisted that we should be willing to give him appointments whenever he wanted them because he is an important person. When we refused, he again became angry. He felt he was not getting the special treatment he deserved. Max is not in touch with his lifetrap yet it is very much with him. In feeling superior, Max experiences the opposite of what he felt as a child. He is trying to be as different as possible from the worthless child that his parents made him feel he was. We might say he spends his whole life trying to keep that child at bay ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=890))

- and to fight off the attacks of those he expects to criticize and abuse him. When we Counterattack, we try to make up for the lifetrap by convincing ourselves and others that the opposite is true. We feel, act, and think as if we are special, superior, perfect, infallible. We cling to this persona desperately. Counterattack develops because it offers an alternative to being devalued, criticized, and humiliated. It is a way out of that terrible vulnerability. Our counterattacks help us cope. But when these counterattacks become too extreme, they often backfire and end up hurting us. Counterattackers can appear healthy. In fact, some of the people we admire most in society are counterattackers—some movie stars, rock stars, and political leaders. But although they fit in well with society and are successful in the eyes of other people, they are usually not at peace with themselves. They frequently feel defective underneath. They deal with these feelings of inadequacy by putting themselves in… ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=899))

- Our counterattacks isolate us. We become so invested in appearing to be perfect that we stop caring who gets hurt in the process. We continue to counterattack, no matter how much it costs other people. There are bound to be some negative effects. Eventually people leave us or retaliate in some way. Our counterattacks also get in the way of real intimacy. We lose the ability to trust, become vulnerable, and connect at a deeper level. We have met some patients who would rather lose everything—including their marriage, a relationship with someone they love—than risk becoming vulnerable. Eventually, no matter how perfect we try to be, we are going to fail at something. Counterattackers never really learn to cope with defeat. They do not take responsibility for their failures or acknowledge their limitations. However, when there is a major setback, the counterattack collapses. When this happens, they often fall apart and become very depressed. Underneath, counterattackers are usually very fragile. Their superiority is easily deflated. Eventually there is a crack in the armor, and the whole world… ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=909))

- feel worthless, unlovable, and defective. Yet they cope with their feelings of defectiveness in completely different ways. Alex, Brandon, and Max are relatively pure types. Each one uses one primary coping style. In fact such pure types are rare. Most of us use a combination of Surrender, Escape, and Counterattack. We must learn to change these coping styles in order to overcome our lifetraps and become healthy again.

- This change step involves attacking your lifetrap on an intellectual level. In order to do this, you must prove that it is not true, or at least that it can be changed. You must cast doubt on the validity of your lifetrap. As long as you believe that your lifetrap is valid, you will not be able to change it. To disprove your lifetrap, you will first list all the evidence pro and con regarding the lifetrap throughout your life. For example, if you feel Socially Undesirable, first you will list all the evidence that supports your lifetrap—that you are undesirable. Then you will make a separate list of all the evidence against your lifetrap—that you are socially desirable. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=987))

- WRITE LETTERS TO THE PARENT, SIBLING, OR PEER WHO HELPED CAUSE YOUR LIFETRAP. • It is important to ventilate your anger and sadness about what happened to you. One thing that keeps your inner child frozen is all your strangled feelings. We want you to give your inner child a voice—to allow your inner child to express his or her pain. We will ask you to write letters to all the people who hurt you. We realize you will probably have to overcome a lot of guilt to do this, particularly in regard to your parents. It is not easy to attack our parents. They may not have been malicious. They may have had good intentions. But we want you to put aside such considerations for a time, and just tell the truth. Express your feelings in the letter. Tell them what they did that was hurtful, and how it made you feel. Tell them they were wrong to behave as they did. Tell them how you wished it could have been instead. You will probably decide not to send the letter. It is the writing and expressing of your feelings that is most important. It is often not possible to change the feelings or behavior of your parents, anyway. You should know this from the start. The purpose of the letter is ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=1030))

- 8. FORGIVING YOUR PARENTS. • Forgiving your parents is not required. Particularly if there was severe abuse or neglect, you may never be able to forgive them. This is totally your choice. But we have found that, in most cases, forgiving one’s parents is something that happens naturally, as the healing process progresses. Patients gradually come to see their parents less and less as giant, negative figures in their mind, and more and more as just people with problems and concerns of their own. They see that their parents were caught within their own lifetraps, and were in fact more like children than giants. They become able to forgive them. Again, this does not always happen. It may or may not happen to you. Depending upon what happened in your childhood, you may decide never to forgive them. In fact, you may even decide the opposite—to cut off all contact. At the end of your path there may or may not lie forgiveness, but you have to do what is right for you. We will support you either way.

- OBSTACLE #2: YOU ESCAPE FROM EXPERIENCING YOUR LIFETRAP. • Escape is a common problem. Many patients have trouble giving up their escape routes. You may find that you have a similar difficulty. You do not allow yourself to think about your problems, your past, your family, or your life patterns. You keep cutting off feelings or dulling them by drinking or taking drugs.

- Solution 1: You must allow yourself to think through your problems and feel your childhood pain before you can change. Force yourself to try some of the childhood memory exercises we describe in your lifetrap chapter. Write down some criticisms of your parents or some of your flaws and vulnerabilities. Keep doing this every day. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=1132))

- OBSTACLE #5: YOU REALIZE YOUR LIFETRAP IS WRONG ON A RATIONAL LEVEL, BUT EMOTIONALLY YOU STILL FEEL IT IS VALID. • This happens a lot. Most patients tell us that for many months they still feel deep down that the lifetrap is true, regardless of what logic and evidence tell them. Patrick—the man whose wife kept having affairs—would say this. Even when he was in a healthy relationship with a stable woman who could be there for ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=1171))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- him, he would still feel like she was going to abandon him. If she seemed momentarily preoccupied or withdrawn, he became alarmed and began desperately trying to get her back. He would not allow the woman any space. Patrick finally had to experiment by letting go. He had to learn to give her some space. He was not going to lose her. He had to learn that it was safe to let her go. Solution 1: Remind yourself that insight comes quickly, but change comes slowly. Your healthy side will become stronger and stronger, and your lifetrap side will become weaker. Be patient. Your feelings will change. Solution 2: You can speed up the process somewhat by doing more experiential exercises. Write dialogues between your healthy side and your lifetrap. Get angry at your lifetrap. Cry about the way you were treated as a child. Let yourself feel the injustice. Solution 3: You can also speed up the process by working harder to change the behaviors that reinforce your lifetrap. As you change old patterns, you will see new evidence that contradicts your lifetrap. This new evidence will have a powerful effect on the way that you feel.

- • OBSTACLE #6: YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SYSTEMATIC AND DISCIPLINED ABOUT CHANGING. • You may approach change in a hit-or-miss fashion. Perhaps you only work on it once in a while. You miss steps. You skip from lifetrap to lifetrap. You resist doing all the writing that is required. In this we are advocates of the cliché, “Slow and steady wins the race.” Your lifetrap is like a rock which you must chip away with a hammer. If you only hammer it sporadically, sometimes on one part and sometimes on another, with half-hearted taps, the rock is going to be there for a long time. It is much more efficient and effective to hammer away systematically with hard, decisive taps. Solution 1: Go back through the chapter on the lifetrap and make sure you have completed all the exercises. Did you do imagery? Did you list the evidence pro and con? Did you write a flashcard? Write a letter to your parents? Make a plan for behavior change? Do all the exercises in writing, not just in your head? Solution 2: Set aside a few minutes every day to review your progress. Reread your flashcards. Was your lifetrap activated today? Did you do anything to surrender to your pattern? Push yourself to think, feel, or act differently each day. • OBSTACLE #7: YOUR PLAN IS MISSING AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. • Perhaps you do not fully understand all the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that reinforce your lifetrap. You are missing a change step that is necessary to making progress. Carlton illustrates this. Despite becoming more assertive with his wife and children, he remained quite angry and unhappy. He would calmly tell them when he was angry, he would say “no” to unreasonable requests, he would ask them to change their behavior when it disturbed him. But he still felt subjugated and angry.

It is when they have little success at self-help that they start therapy. This may happen to you. Even if you follow all the steps outlined in this book, you may still be unable to change. Despite all your efforts, the lifetrap still rules your life. It may be that you cannot change alone. If this happens, seek out therapy.

- wanted something from her, she would say, “Be quiet, go to sleep, you need a nap,” and go on with what she was doing as if I wasn’t there. For Elizabeth, the deprivation was more subtle. Her mother was a responsible person and would not neglect her child. However, like Jed’s mother, she was narcissistic. Instead of viewing her child as a separate person with needs of her own, she viewed her child as an extension of herself. She saw Elizabeth as an object, to be used for her own gratification. What Elizabeth’s mother wanted, what she had failed to achieve in her own life, was to be rich. She wanted Elizabeth to marry a rich man. ELIZABETH: She taught me to be pretty and charming. It was the price of her love. She taught me to perform for company. She took me shopping. She dressed me up like a doll. But when we were done shopping and the company was gone, she ignored me. I just wasn’t relevant anymore. As we know, Elizabeth grew up to fulfill her mother’s wishes. She married a rich man. Now she is the executive’s wife. He expects her to be pretty and charming for company. When the company is gone, he ignores her. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=2265))

- Dustin, the man who keeps falling in love with unavailable women, seemingly had a good mother. She did all the right things. She gave Dustin the best toys, the best clothes, the best schools, the best vacations. Yet there was a sense of coldness. Dustin’s mother was a successful lawyer. She had built a career at a time when it was a rarity to find women working in the professions. She focused her attention almost exclusively on her work. At home she was self-absorbed and withdrawn. Although she did not admit it to herself, in her heart she regarded Dustin as a nuisance, as a demanding child who distracted her from matters of true importance. And she was simply not a warm woman. She had difficulty showing affection, even to people whom she appreciated more than Dustin. Secretly, she blamed Dustin for the low intensity of her feelings toward him. It was not her fault that he aroused so little love. Dustin grew up with a core of grief over the absence of a nurturing mother. He covered his grief with a hard shell of anger. This is an example of the Counterattacking coping style we discussed in Chapter 4. On the surface, he seemed very much the spoiled, petulant boy. Now, as an adult, Dustin reenacts his Emotional Deprivation lifetrap in his numerous romantic relationships with unavailable women. He pursues one doomed relationship after another. Inevitably, each woman frustrates him and he becomes increasingly demanding. It always ends with the woman breaking his heart. DUSTIN: Before I started therapy I really had no idea I was caught in this process. Each time I thought I just happened to fall in love with a woman who just happened to be unavailable. Although his mother was emotionally depriving, Dustin was fortunate in one respect. He had a loving father. If not for the relationship with his father, Dustin might have sealed himself off forever from intimate human contact. The love Dustin’s father gave him partly healed the damage done by his mother, so that the lifetrap developed in a more limited way. He was able to form other healthy relationships outside the family. Dustin’s lifetrap has a restricted range in his adult life. He does not view everyone as depriving—only the women with whom he falls in love. Dustin has satisfying relationships with many people. He has many good friends, both male and female, to whom he pours out the misery of his stormy… ([Location 2275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=2275))

- Emotional deprivation, therefore, can be a difficult lifetrap for you to recognize. Unless you experienced extreme neglect, it might take some exploration to determine whether you were deprived as a child. You might recognize the lifetrap in yourself only after you have asked yourself specific questions: “Did I feel close to my mother, did I feel she understood me, did I feel loved, did I love her, was she warm and affectionate, could I tell her what I felt, could she give me what I needed?” In therapy, many people with the Emotional Deprivation lifetrap at first say things like, “Oh, I had a normal childhood. My mother was always there.” Dustin began therapy saying, “My mother gave me everything. I had everything I wanted.” However, when people with this lifetrap describe their past and current relationships, something is wrong. A disturbing pattern emerges. There is a feeling of disconnection. Perhaps the person is… ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=2304))

- When Margaret first walks into our office there is a frightened look in her eyes. It raises a protective impulse in us and we move to take care of her. When we tell her she seems frightened, she tells us that she does not even like to think about her problems, let alone talk about them. Margaret feels trapped in a relationship that she is too afraid to leave. She is afraid to be alone. Anthony, her husband, is verbally abusive. He has been unemployed for two years and blames her. In fact, he blames her for all his problems. Margaret is agoraphobic: she has panic attacks and avoids many situations for fear that she will have an attack—trains, restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls, crowds, movie theaters. On some days she is so anxious that she is afraid to leave her home. She has come to therapy because coping with her marriage and her phobias has become too much for her. As you might imagine, aside from making day-to-day functioning difficult, Margaret’s agoraphobia sharply decreases her pleasure from her leisure time. Activities that other people find enjoyable, she experiences as onerous tasks. ([Location 3004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=3004))

- Our first impression of Eliot is one of tight self-control. Throughout the session, we glimpse a kind of cold anger underneath. Eliot has come to therapy with his wife, Maria, to focus on marital problems. Eliot and Maria have been married for seven years and have one child. Maria has just found out that Eliot has been having an affair. She threatened to leave the marriage unless he agreed to come to therapy. In that first session, he told us, “I really don’t think that I need to be here,” and “If you ask me, she’s the one who has problems.” It is almost as if he expected us to work with him to solve her problems. Throughout the session, Eliot is critical of Maria and critical of us. It is difficult to connect with him. He keeps a distance. After we explain lifetrap therapy to them, he says, “It sounds incredibly simple-minded,” and “Is that all there is to this therapy?” We know he is testing us, and we tell him so. “You want to make sure we can handle you.” He wants to see if he can put us one-down—if he can make us defensive. When he sees that he cannot, we gain some of his respect. ([Location 3982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=3982))

- The emotion that is most connected to the Defectiveness lifetrap is shame. Shame is what you feel when your defects are exposed. You will do almost anything to avoid this feeling of shame. Consequently you go to great lengths to keep your defectiveness hidden. You feel that your defectiveness is inside you. It is not immediately observable. Rather, it is something in the essence of your being—you feel completely ([Location 4022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4022))

- unworthy of love. In contrast to the Social Exclusion lifetrap, which concerns superficial or observable characteristics, Defectiveness is an inner state. While we usually know fairly quickly whether someone has a Social Exclusion lifetrap, Defectiveness is not so obvious. Certainly it is one of the most common lifetraps, but it is often hard to detect. Because your imagined defect is internal—unseen—you suffer even more from the terror of being exposed. Almost half our patients have Defectiveness as one of their primary lifetraps. However, on the surface, these patients look very different. Each copes with feelings of shame in different ways. Some lack confidence and look insecure (Surrender). Some look normal (Escape). And some look so good you would never believe they had the lifetrap (Counterattack). Alison is an example of someone who surrenders to her sense of defectiveness. She is in touch with feelings of being inherently flawed. ALISON: I have always felt there is something wrong with me, deep inside where no one can see. And that I would live my whole life without anyone loving me. THERAPIST: When you think of someone loving you, how does it feel? ALISON: It makes me cringe. ([Location 4025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4025))

The best she can do is hide it, and try to postpone the inevitable moment when someone gets close enough to find out.

- Eliot is at the opposite end of the spectrum. He has a quality of invulnerability. No one can touch him. He has developed the Counterattacking style of coping so effectively that most people never suspect; in fact, Eliot himself is largely unaware of his own deep feelings of shame. Eliot is an example of a fragile narcissist. A narcissist is someone who lacks empathy, blames others for problems, and has a strong sense of entitlement. People like Eliot have developed this narcissism to ([Location 4053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4053))

- fight back against their underlying feelings that no one will ever love or respect them. It is as if they are saying to the world: “I will be so demanding, act so superior, and become so special that you will never be able to ignore or criticize me again.” (This is an example of the Counterattack coping style we describe in Chapter 4. You can read more about narcissism and how it can be changed, in the chapter on Entitlement.) Narcissists will hold onto their self-centeredness at almost all costs. Eliot was watching his marriage to a woman he loved deeply disintegrate, yet he was unable to admit that he had problems. He would rather lose everything than risk making himself vulnerable. This is often the case. Until their backs are against the wall, narcissists will not change. As with Eliot, the threat of abandonment is one thing that can sometimes motivate a narcissist to change. MARIA: No matter how much he hurt me, no matter how much pain I was in, it didn’t make any difference. I could cry a thousand tears, and he would keep seeing that woman. It was only when he saw I was really leaving that he agreed to stop seeing her. Eliot and Maria both have the Defectiveness lifetrap. He counterattacks his underlying shame through narcissism, while she surrenders to her sense of worthlessness. He rejects her, and she is the victim of rejection. Together they reenact their original drama of rejection by the parent. If you have the Defectiveness lifetrap, you probably lie somewhere between the two extremes represented by Alison and Eliot. Perhaps you allow yourself to be quite vulnerable in some areas but not in others. We have many patients like this. They come in very willing to talk about their lives, but when certain topics arise, they skirt the issue. These topics make them feel ashamed or defective. It is relatively unusual for patients to come in knowing that they feel defective. Most patients mask or avoid these feelings in some way because it is so painful to experience the extraordinary self-hatred and shame connected with this lifetrap. Without realizing it, people strive to keep themselves unaware of their feelings of shame. They come to therapy complaining of other things, of relationship problems or depression. You may experience a chronic, vague unhappiness without being able to explain why. You do not realize that your depression is a function of your negative view of yourself. Feeling unworthy and angry at yourself is a large part of depression. You may feel that you have been depressed your whole life—a kind of low-level depression lurking in the background.

- Defectiveness is a global feeling. It is the sense of being unworthy of love. You felt so flawed or inadequate that even your parent could not love you or value you for who you are. You almost certainly felt that your parent was right to criticize you, devalue you, reject you, or not give you love. You felt that you deserved it. As a child, you blamed yourself. Everything happened because you were so worthless, inadequate, flawed, and defective. For this reason, you probably did not feel angry about the way you were treated. Rather, you felt ashamed and sad. Alison’s lifetrap is largely the result of her father’s criticalness. He made it clear very early that she was a disappointment.

- Abuse often go hand-in-hand. While it is possible for a child who is abused to feel that it is unfair and to be angry without feeling defective, this is seldom the case. Far more often, the child accepts responsibility. The child feels guilt and shame. Many children find some way to make up for their feelings of defectiveness. This is where the lifetrap starts to blend with Entitlement and Unrelenting Standards. Many people who have grown up being criticized and made to feel defective compensate by trying to be superior in some area. They set high standards and strive for success and status. They may act arrogant and entitled. With money and recognition, they try to allay that inner feeling of defectiveness.

- We pay a high price for burying our true self in the way Eliot did. It is a great loss, like a death. Spontaneity, joy, trust, and intimacy are all lost, and they are replaced by a guarded, shut-down shell. The person constructs a false self. This false self is harder, less easily wounded. But no matter how hard the exterior, deep inside there is pain about losing one’s true self. The advantage of building this protective shell is that you often feel better day-to-day. At least on the surface, you seem to be doing well. But it is an illusion. Inside you still feel defective and unloved. The problem with the shell is that you never really address the core issue. A true self that stays hidden cannot heal. You have to stop settling for illusion and start going for the real thing. It is very important to realize that the Defectiveness lifetrap is not usually based on a real defect. Even people who have serious physical or mental handicaps do not necessarily develop this lifetrap. The crucial factor is not the presence of a defect, but rather how you are made to feel about yourself by your parents and the other members of your family. If you are loved, valued, and respected by your family members—regardless of your actual strengths and weaknesses—you will almost certainly not feel worthless, ashamed, or defective.

This is the old Groucho Marx line, “I never would want to belong to a club that would have me as a member.” It is as if, in loving you, your partner does something wrong.

- Like Eliot, you may have learned to hide your feelings of jealousy, but inside you probably feel as they do: that the world is filled with more desirable competitors for your lover. You may also find it difficult to tolerate criticism. You are probably hypersensitive to it. Even a slight criticism can lead you to feel enormous shame. You may vehemently deny that you have done anything ([Location 4242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4242))

- wrong, or put down the person who is criticizing you. This is because to acknowledge any flaw is to let in a flood of painful feelings related to Defectiveness. Thus, you protect yourself by denying any flaw, mistake, or error. Your defensiveness and inability to take criticism can be a serious problem. As we have noted, you are likely to feel the most chemistry toward partners who trigger your Defectiveness lifetrap. The flip side is that you tend to get bored with people who treat you well. This is your paradox: you want love so much, but the more your partner gives you love, the less attracted you feel. This is exactly what happened with Eliot and Maria. ELIOT: When we first met, I was madly in love with her. I really thought this was it for me, I would never need anybody else. But, after we got married, I just lost it for her. I stopped wanting to sleep with her. We haven’t slept together in over a year. You have the most chemistry in situations that reinforce your defectiveness. It is consistent with your self-image. It somehow feels alien to have someone you value value you. These are the two sides of the swing for you. At one extreme you pursue someone you desire highly. You feel one-down. The chemistry is high and the fear is high. At the other extreme, you pursue someone who ([Location 4245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4245))

- loves and accepts you. You are less afraid, but you soon devalue your partner and lose the chemistry. Defectiveness is present in other close relationships as well. One danger we mentioned earlier is that you may try to allay your own feelings of shame by becoming critical and rejecting of your own children. You do to them what was done to you. You scapegoat them. They are vulnerable and innocent and cannot stop you. ([Location 4255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=4255))

- Eliot’s life is devoted to gaining success and status. He does it to impress people. When he is with a woman, it is all he talks about. This is his way of proving himself worthy of love. The end result, though, is that he has status and success, but he still does not have love. He is looking for love but settling for admiration. His success never touches his core feeling of defectiveness. It just provides temporary relief. Success and status often become addictions. You try to get more and more, but you can never get enough to make you feel good. Success is a pale substitute for finding one person who really knows and loves you.

List all the situations that trigger Defectiveness for you. We realize that this will be hard. We all devote considerable energy in life trying not to feel painful things.

My wife is threatening to leave me, my kids are miserable, and I’m working myself sick trying to just feel like a worthwhile person.

- How quickly you can change your Defectiveness lifetrap depends in part on how punitive your parent was. The more punishing and dramatic your parent’s rejection was, and the more hatred and violence there was connected to it, the harder it is to change. You may need help from a therapist. Get help if you need it; there is no shame involved in getting help to treat your problem. Changing your lifetrap involves gradually improving how you treat yourself, how you treat others, and how you allow others to treat you. With the exception of patients who are in truly abusive relationships, changing does not usually involve sudden, dramatic shifts. Rather it is an incremental process. Patients gradually feel better about themselves. They become less defensive and more able to take in love. They feel closer to people. They feel more valued and more loved.

As we have noted, most of the time, like Kathleen, you will have a lot of realistic evidence. You have in fact failed relative to your peers. But sometimes, like Brian, your perception of failure is inaccurate, and you will find little evidence to support your view. List a range of people with whom you went to high school, college, or graduate school. Be sure to choose people from the bottom, middle, and top of your class. Write down what each person has accomplished within their chosen fields. How far have they progressed? How much are they paid? How much responsibility do they have at work?

You may feel chronically angry, and certainly you feel high levels of anxiety. You obsess about the next thing you have to do right. A major focus of your anxiety is time: You have so much to do and so little time. You are always aware of time and feel a constant sense of time pressure. And you can feel depressed at the grimness of your life and at the emptiness of what you have achieved. You might ask why you continue to push yourself this way. As exhausted as you are, instead of slowing down, you accelerate, taking on more and more responsibility. It is as though you believe that one of the things you do is finally going to bring you satisfaction. You do not realize that the way you approach everything makes genuine pleasure impossible.

My fear is not of failing, but of being merely mediocre, of not standing out from the crowd. The Unrelenting Standards lifetrap can sometimes lead to a sense of failure. If your unrelenting standards are so high that you cannot come close to meeting them, then you may begin to feel incompetent, a failure. It may be that you fall so far short of your goals that you feel you have not achieved anything at all. ([Location 5695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=5695))

You cannot really relax, but at least your life is not totally consumed with work. And you may be a workaholic about things other than your job.

- Once you are in a relationship, you can be extremely critical and demanding. You expect other people (especially those closest to you, like your spouse or children) to live up to your standards. And without realizing it, you probably devalue them for not meeting the standards you set. Of course, because these standards do not seem high to you, you feel that your expectations are normal and justified. You may be attracted to perfectionistic partners who have their own Unrelenting Standards, or you may be attracted to partners who are the opposite, relaxed and easygoing. You might choose someone who offsets your pressured life—who brings to your life all the things you have lost. This kind of relationship can become your one avenue of relief and enjoyment. You probably have little time left to spend with the people you love. If you are single, you neglect your friends and lovers; if you are married, you neglect your family. You just do not have the time. You are too busy working, or putting the house in order, or advancing your status. You keep thinking that the time will come when you can relax and find a partner or spend time with your spouse and children. Meanwhile life slips by, and your emotional life is empty. When you do spend time with the people you love, you are apt to do so in that same pressured, relentless way.

- Like Nina, you may have a tendency to procrastinate. When you finally do the task, you do it half-heartedly or passive-aggressively. You just cannot get yourself to focus and persevere. Even when you want to stick to something it is hard for you. You have a problem with short-term versus long-term gratification. Your difficulty postponing short-term gratification may also take the form of addictions such as overeating, smoking, drinking, drugs, or compulsive sex. However, problems with addictions do not necessarily indicate that you have this lifetrap. Addictions are only one of several indicators. For you to have the Entitlement lifetrap, the addictions must be part of a more general pattern of problems with self-control and self-discipline. You may have trouble controlling your emotions, particularly anger. Although you may have some depression, anger is your predominant emotion. You are not able to express your anger in a mature way. Rather, you are like an enraged child. You get impatient, irritable, angry. KATIE: The way he yells, it’s so embarrassing. He doesn’t care where we are or who’s listening. All of a sudden he’ll start screaming. We can be in public, at a friend’s house, anyplace. MEL: That’s right. When I’m angry, I want people to know it.

- Unlike many of the other lifetraps—which cause you to suppress your needs—the Entitlement lifetrap involves the excessive expression of your needs. You lack a normal degree of restraint. Whereas other people inhibit and discipline themselves appropriately, you do not. Most patients with Entitlement do not feel any real distress about their pattern. This sets Entitlement apart from all the other lifetraps in this book. We have never had a patient come to us saying that he or she was in pain as a result of feeling entitled or special. However, many of our patients have partners with serious Entitlement issues. This is how an entitled person shows up most often in therapy—as the partner of one of our patients. (We often ask the partners of our patients to come to some sessions as well.) To put it bluntly, rather than seeking therapy yourself, more often you are the person who drives others to seek therapy. Your life becomes painful only when you are no longer able to avoid the serious negative consequences that result from your Entitlement—for example, when you actually lose your job because you cannot complete the work properly, or when your spouse threatens to leave you. Only then will you acknowledge that other people are not happy with your ([Location 6078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=6078))

- behavior and that your entitlement is a problem. You finally realize that the lifetrap has a cost—that it can really damage your life. ([Location 6087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=6087))

- ORIGIN 2: DEPENDENT OVERINDULGENCE The origin of Dependent Entitlement is parents who overindulge their children in ways that make the children dependent on them. The parents take on everyday responsibilities, decisions, and difficult tasks for the child. The environment is so safe and protected and so little is expected of the child that the child comes to demand this level of care.

- As we were writing this chapter, we kept commenting upon a certain sense of futility. We recognize that few people with the Entitlement lifetrap will ever read this chapter. People with this lifetrap rarely want to change. They usually do not read self-help books. They resist going to therapy. Instead, they blame others for their problems and fight to stay the same. If you are an exception—a person with an Entitlement lifetrap who is reading this chapter—it is probably because your lifetrap is proving so costly to you that you cannot ignore the issue anymore. Your spouse has asked for a divorce, your lover is about to abandon you, or you are about to lose your job. Something has happened to throw you into crisis. We realize that many of the patterns associated with Entitlement that we discussed earlier in this chapter do not really matter to you. You probably do not care, for example, that your Entitlement is unfair to other people. You do not care that you are bringing other people pain. You are self-centered. You care only about yourself. This is a great drawback in terms of building motivation. We have divided this change section into two parts. The first part is directed toward those of you who have the lifetrap and want to change.

- However, we believe that the majority of people reading this chapter are victims of entitled people. That is, you are not entitled yourself. You are reading this to try to understand an entitled person—your lover, spouse, or parent. We have included a section for you too.

- Studies have shown that the more distress patients display when they come for therapy, the more likely they are to change. For your sake, we hope you are in some distress. We hope you find some reason to overcome your Entitlement. Until you do, you will never fulfill your potential for love and work.

- We have developed a term to describe what we consider to be a healthy attitude toward change: empathic self-confrontation. Show compassion for yourself, while continually pushing yourself to change. Many people either criticize themselves too harshly when they do not feel they have changed enough, or they are too lenient and make excuses to let themselves off the hook.

- Unfortunately, turning to family and friends may not be an option for you. You may not have close family and friends, or they may be too disturbed themselves to be of much help to you. Often family members reinforce your lifetraps, rather than help you change. If this is the case, consider seeking professional help. There are other times to consider seeing a professional. When your symptoms are so severe that they interfere with your functioning; when you have been stuck for a long time and do not know how to change; when change feels hopeless—these are times to consider getting professional help. Consider it when you are going through a life crisis, such as the break-up ([Location 6574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=6574))

- of a long-term relationship or the loss of a job; at these times, you need support and may be more receptive to change. Consider help if you had a traumatic childhood that included emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. Finally, if you are hurting other people because of your problems, then professional help is clearly indicated. If your symptoms are very serious, psychiatric medication might help you. For example, you might be seriously depressed: you feel worthless, your eating and sleeping are disturbed, you feel slowed down, you cannot concentrate, you have lost interest in things that used to give you pleasure, or you are actually doing less. You may even be considering suicide. If you have symptoms of depression, especially if you feel suicidal, seek professional help immediately. You may have serious symptoms of anxiety, such as panic attacks, multiple phobias, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or intense generalized anxiety. You may be so fearful of social situations that you avoid them, wreaking havoc on your social and work lives. If these symptoms of anxiety characterize you, getting professional help is advisable. You may be addicted to alcohol or drugs. You may have “post traumatic stress disorder,” in which something from your past is haunting you. You may have flashbacks or nightmares, or you may feel numb and detached. Or you may have a serious eating disorder, ([Location 6579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=6579))

- such as bulimia or anorexia. Your desire to lose weight is so intense that you binge on foods and then somehow purge them, or you eat less and less, becoming dangerously thin. By all means, seek out a professional if you suffer from these serious disorders. ([Location 6589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0776JJ6L8&location=6589))
