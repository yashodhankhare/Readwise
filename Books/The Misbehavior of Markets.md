## Highlights
- Three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas—have long been known. An analogous distinction between three states of randomness—mild, slow, and wild—arises from the mathematics of fractal geometry. Conventional financial theory assumes that variation of prices can be modeled by random processes that, in effect, follow the simplest “mild” pattern, as if each uptick or downtick were determined by the toss of a coin. What fractals show, and this book describes, is that by that standard, real prices “misbehave” very badly. A more accurate, multifractal model of wild price variation paves the way for a new, more reliable type of financial theory.   Understanding fractally wild randomness, also exemplified by such diverse phenomena as turbulent flow, electrical “flicker” noise, and the track of a stock or bond price, will not bring personal wealth. But the fractal view of the market is alone in facing the high odds of catastrophic price changes. This book presents this view in a highly personal style, with many pictures and no mathematical formula in the main text.

- As a scientist, Mandelbrot’s fame rests on his founding of fractal geometry, and on his showing how it applies in many fields. A fractal, a term he coined from the Latin for “broken,” is a geometric shape that can be broken into smaller parts, each a small-scale echo of the whole. The branches of a tree, the florets of a cauliflower, the bifurcations of a river—all are examples of natural fractals. The math eschews the smooth lines and planes of the Greek geometry we learn in school, but it has astonishingly broad applications wherever roughness is present—that is, nearly everywhere. Roughness is the central theme of his work. We have long had precise measurements and elaborate physical theories for such basic sensations as heat, sound, color, and motion. Until Mandelbrot, we never had a proper theory of the irregular, the rough—all the annoying imperfections that we normally try to ignore ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=160))

- in life. Roughness is in the jagged edge of a metal fracture, the rugged coastline of Britain, the static on a phone line, the gusts of the wind—even the irregular charts of a stock index or exchange rate. As he puts it, “Roughness is the uncontrolled element in life.” Studying roughness, Mandelbrot found fractal order where others had only seen troublesome disorder. His manifesto, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, appeared in 1982 and became a scientific bestseller. Soon, T-shirts and posters of his most famous fractal creation, the bulbous but infinitely complicated Mandelbrot Set, were being made by the thousands. His ideas were also embraced immediately by another scientific movement, chaos theory. “Fractals” and “chaos” entered the popular vocabulary. In 1993, on receiving the prestigious Wolf Prize for Physics, Mandelbrot was cited for “having changed our view of nature.” ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=166))

- The standard theories, as taught in business schools around the world, would estimate the odds of that final, August 31, collapse at one in 20 million—an event that, if you traded daily for nearly 100,000 years, you would not expect to see even once. The odds of getting three such declines in the same month were even more minute: about one in 500 billion. Surely, August had been supremely bad luck, a freak accident, an “act of God” no one could have predicted. In the language of statistics, it was an “outlier” far, far, far from the normal expectation of stock trading. Or was it? The seemingly improbable happens all the time in financial markets. A year earlier, the Dow had fallen 7.7 percent in one day. (Probability: one in 50 billion.) In July 2002, the index recorded three steep falls within seven trading days. (Probability: one in four trillion.) And on October 19, 1987, the worst day of trading in at least a century, the index fell ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=280))

- 29.2 percent. The probability of that happening, based on the standard reckoning of financial theorists, was less than one in 1050—odds so small they have no meaning. It is a number outside the scale of nature. You could span the powers of ten from the smallest subatomic particle to the breadth of the measurable universe—and still never meet such a number. So what’s new? Everyone knows: Financial markets are risky. But in the careful study of that concept, risk, lies knowledge of our world and hope of a quantitative control over it.

- If reward and risk make a ratio, the standard arithmetic must be wrong. The denominator, risk, is bigger than generally acknowledged; and so the outcome is bound to disappoint. Better assessment of that risk, and better understanding of how risk drives markets, is a goal of much of my work. My life has been a study of risk. I learned about it firsthand in the brutal school of World War II, as a Polish refugee hiding in the French countryside with a borrowed identity and touched-up ration coupons, masquerading (badly) as a simple country boy in an occupied land. I faced it in my career, rejecting the safety of French academia for the intellectual wanderings of an industrial scientist in a more free-wheeling America. As a scientist, all of my research has, in one way or another, veered between the two poles of human experience: deterministic systems of order and planning, and stochastic, or random, systems of irregularity and unpredictability. My key contribution was to found a new branch of mathematics that perceives the hidden order in the seemingly disordered, the plan in the unplanned, the regular pattern in the irregularity and roughness of nature. This mathematics, called fractal geometry, has much to say in the natural sciences. It has helped model the weather, study river flows, analyze brainwaves and seismic tremors, and understand the distribution of galaxies. It was immediately embraced as an essential mathematical tool in the 1980s by “chaos” theory, the study of order in the seeming-chaos of a whirlpool or a hurricane. It is routinely used today in the realm of man-made structures, to measure Internet traffic, compress computer files, and make movies. It was the mathematical engine behind the computer animation in the movie, Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan. I believe it has much to contribute to finance, too. For forty years in fits and starts, as allowed by my personal interests, by unfolding events, and by the availability of colleagues to talk to, the development of fractal geometry has continually interacted with my studies of financial markets and economic systems. I have investigated them not as an economist or financier, but as a mathematical and experimental scientist. To me, all the power and wealth of the New York Stock Exchange or a London currency-dealing room are abstract; they are analogous to physical systems of turbulence in a sunspot or eddies in a river. They can ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=299))

- be analyzed with the tools science already has, and new tools I keep adding to the old ones as need and ability allow. With these tools, I have analyzed how income gets distributed in a society, how stock-market bubbles form and pop, how company size and industrial concentration vary, and how financial prices move—cotton prices, wheat prices, railroad and Blue Chip stocks, dollar-yen exchange rates. I see a pattern in these price movements—not a pattern, to be sure, that will make anybody rich; I agree with the orthodox economists that stock prices are probably not predictable in any useful sense of the term. But the risk certainly does follow patterns that can be expressed mathematically and can be modeled on a computer. Thus, my research could help people avoid losing as much money as they do, through foolhardy underestimation of the risk of ruin. Thinking about markets as a scientific system, we may eventually craft a stronger financial industry and a better system of regulation.

- And I hope readers of this book, whether they agree or disagree with everything I say, will forsake, at least for a moment, the practical details of why. Instead, I hope they emerge from the book’s pages with a greater fundamental understanding of how financial markets work, and of the great risk we run when we abandon our money to the winds of fortune.

- There are many ways of handling risk. In the financial markets, the oldest is the simplest: “fundamental” analysis. If a stock is rising, seek the cause in a study of the company behind it, or of the industry and economy around it. Study harder, and predict the stock’s next move. “Because” is the key word here: The price of a stock, bond, derivative, or currency moves “because” of some event or fact that more often than not comes from outside the market. World wheat prices rise because a heat wave desiccates Kansas or Ukraine. The dollar sinks because talk of war raises oil prices. This is all common sense. Financial newspapers thrive on it; they sell news and rank the importance of all the “becauses.” Financial firms make an industry of it; they employ thousands of fundamental analysts, classified by genus into macroeconomic and sectoral, “top-down” and “bottomup.” Regulators codify and enforce it; they dictate what a company must tell its investors. The implicit assumption in all this: If one knows the cause, one can forecast the event and manage the risk. Would it were so simple. In the real world, causes are usually obscure. Critical information is often unknown or unknowable, as when the Russian economy trembled in August 1998. It can be concealed or misrepresented, as during the Internet bubble or the Enron and Parmalat corporate scandals. And it can be misunderstood: The precise market mechanism that ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=337))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- links news to price, cause to effect, is mysterious and seems inconsistent. Threat of war: Dollar falls. Threat of war: Dollar rises. Which of the two will actually happen? After the fact, it seems obvious; in hindsight, fundamental analysis can be reconstituted and is always brilliant. But before the fact, both outcomes may seem equally likely. So how can one base an investment strategy and a risk profile entirely on this one dubious principle: I can know more than anybody else? In response, the financial industry has developed other tools. The second-oldest form of analysis, after fundamental, is “technical.” This is a craft of recognizing patterns, real or spurious—of studying reams of price, volume, and indicator charts in search of clues to buy or sell. The language of the “chartists” is rich: head and shoulders, flags and pennants, triangles (symmetrical, ascending, or descending). The discipline, in disfavor during the 1980s, expanded in the 1990s as thousands of neophytes took to the Internet to trade stocks and insights. It truly thrives, however, in currency markets. There, all major “forex” houses employ technical… ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=347))

- technical analysts, and then pull back as if hitting a solid wall—or accelerate as if bursting through a barrier. But this is a confidence trick: Everybody knows that everybody else knows about the support points, so they place their bets accordingly. It beggars belief that vast sums can change hands on the basis of such financial astrology. It may work at times, but it is not a foundation on which to build a global risk-management system. And so was born what business schools now call “modern” finance. It emerged from the mathematics of chance and statistics. The fundamental concept: Prices are not predictable, but their fluctuations can be described by the mathematical laws of chance. Therefore, their risk is measurable, and manageable. This is now orthodoxy to which I subscribe—up to a point. Work in this field began in 1900, when a youngish French mathematician, Louis Bachelier, had the temerity to study financial markets at a time “real” mathematicians did not touch money. In the very different world of the seventeenth century, Pascal and Fermat (he of the famous “last… ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=357))

- French government bonds. His key model, often called the “random walk,” sticks very closely indeed to Pascal and Fermat. It postulates prices will go up or down with equal probability, as a fair coin will turn heads or tails. If the coin tosses follow each other very quickly, all the hue and cry on a stock or commodity exchange is literally static—white noise of the sort you hear on a radio when tuned between stations. And how much the prices vary is measurable. Most changes, 68 percent, are small moves up or down, within one “standard deviation”—a simple mathematical yardstick for measuring the scatter of data—of the mean; 95 percent should be within two standard deviations; 98 percent should be within three. Finally—this will shortly prove to be very important—extremely few of the changes are very large. If you line all these price movements up on graph paper, the histograms form a bell shape: The numerous small changes cluster in the center of the bell, the rare big changes at the edges. The bell shape is, for mathematicians, terra cognita, so much so that it came to be called “normal”—implying that other shapes are “anomalous.” It is the well-trodden field of… ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=367))

- inches tall; 95 percent between 66 and 74 inches; 98 percent between 64 and 76 inches. The mathematics of the bell curve do not entirely exclude the possibility of a 12-foot giant or even someone of negative height, if you can imagine such monsters. But the probability of either is so minute that you would never expect to see one in real life. The bell curve is the pattern ascribed to such seemingly disparate variables as the height of Army cadets, IQ test scores, or—to return to Bachelier’s simplest model—the returns from betting on a series of coin tosses. To be sure, at any particular time or place extraordinary patterns can result: One can have long streaks of tossing only “heads,” or meet a squad of exceptionally tall or dim soldiers. But averaging over the long run, one expects to find the mean: average height, moderate intelligence, neither profit nor loss. This is not to say fundamentals are unimportant; bad nutrition can skew Army cadets towards shortness, and inflation can push bond prices down. But as we cannot predict such external influences very well, the only reliable crystal ball is a probabilistic one. Genius, in any time or clime, is often unrecognized. Bachelier’s doctoral dissertation was largely ignored by his contemporaries. But his work was translated into English and republished in 1964, and thence was developed into a great edifice of modern economics and finance (and five Nobel Memorial Medals in economic science). A broader variant of Bachelier’s thinking often goes by the title one of my doctoral students, Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago, gave it: the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The hypothesis holds that in an ideal market, all relevant information is already priced into a security today. One illustrative possibility is that yesterday’s change does not influence today’s, nor today’s, tomorrow’s; each price change is “independent” from the last. With such theories, economists developed a very elaborate toolkit for analyzing markets, measuring the “variance” and “betas” of different securities and classifying investment portfolios by their probability of risk. According to the theory, a fund manager can build an “efficient” portfolio to target a specific return, with a desired level of risk. It is the financial equivalent of alchemy.

- can now see. The old financial orthodoxy was founded on two critical assumptions in Bachelier’s key model: Price changes are statistically independent, and they are normally distributed. The facts, as I vehemently argued in the 1960s and many economists now acknowledge, show otherwise. First, price changes are not independent of each other. Research over the past few decades, by me and then by others, shows that many financial price series have a “memory,” of sorts. Today does, in fact, influence tomorrow. If prices take a big leap up or down now, there is a measurably greater likelihood that they will move just as violently the next day. It is not a well-behaved, predictable pattern of the kind economists prefer—not, say, the periodic up-and-down procession from boom to bust with which textbooks trace the standard business cycle. Examples of such simple patterns, periodic correlations between prices past and present, have long been observed in markets—in, say, the seasonal fluctuations of wheat futures prices as the harvest matures, or the daily and weekly trends of foreign exchange volume as the trading day moves across the globe. My heresy is a different, fractal kind of statistical relationship, a “long memory.” This is a delicate point to which a full chapter will be devoted later. For the moment, think about it by observing that different kinds of price series exhibit different degrees of memory. Some exhibit strong memory. Others have weak memory. Why this should be is not certain; but one can speculate. What a company does today—a merger, a spin-off, a critical product launch—shapes what the company will look like a decade hence; in the same way, its stock-price movements today will influence movements tomorrow. Others suggest that the market may take a long time to absorb and fully price information. When confronted by bad news, some quick-triggered investors react immediately while others, with different financial goals and longer time-horizons, may not react for another month or year. Whatever the explanation, we can confirm the phenomenon exists—and it contradicts the random-walk model. Second, contrary to orthodoxy, price changes are very far from following the bell curve.

- The Power of Power Laws Examine price records more closely, and you typically find a different kind of distribution than the bell curve: The tails do not become imperceptible but follow a “power law.” These are common in nature. The area of a square plot of land grows by the power of two with its side. If the side doubles, the area quadruples; if the side triples, the area rises nine-fold. Another example: Gravity weakens by the inverse power of two with distance. If a spaceship doubles its distance from Earth, the gravitational pull on it falls to a fourth its original value. In economics, one classic power law was discovered by Italian economist… ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=420))

- very few; a bell curve would be more equitable, scattering incomes more evenly around an average. Now we reach one of my main findings. A power law also applies to positive or negative price movements of many financial instruments. It leaves room for many more big price swings than would the bell curve. And it fits the data for many price series. I provided the first evidence in a 1962 research report, summarized by a brief published paper. The report showed that in the distribution of cotton price movements over the past century, the tails followed a power law; there were far too many big price swings to fit a bell curve. The same report continued with wheat prices, many interest… ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=426))

- On the facing page you see four price charts of the kind you would find in a brokerage-house report, but with the identifying dates and values removed. Two of the charts are real chronicles of the price of a real financial instrument—name also removed. Two are forgeries, entirely fictitious series of numbers, generated using different theoretical models of how markets work. Ignore whether they trend up or down. Focus on how they vary from one moment to the next. Which are real? Which fake? What rules were used to draw the fake?

- Four charts: Which are real, which are fake? All fairly similar, many readers will say. Indeed, stripped of legends, axis labels, and other clues to context, most price “fever charts,” as they are called in the financial press, look much the same. But pictures can deceive better than words. For the truth, look at the next set of charts. These show, rather than the prices themselves, the changes in price from moment to moment. Now, a pattern emerges, and the eye is smarter than we normally give it credit for—especially at perceiving how things change. The worst fake stands out from the rest, like a criminal in a police line-up. It is the second chart, which shows prices varying more or less uniformly over time. It was generated by the orthodox random-walk model. The size of most price changes varies within a narrow range, corresponding to the central portion of the bell curve mentioned earlier. True, the chart also shows bigger fluctuations, or outliers—but they barely stand up from the bulk of changes, as taller strands of grass rise above the average height… ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=471))

- real charts, price swings are highly erratic. The large ones are numerous and cluster together. Here, the appropriate analogy is no longer to grass, but to a forest of trees of all sizes—some gigantic. Another analogy is to the distribution of stars. They are not uniformly distributed throughout the universe. Instead they cluster into galaxies, then into galaxy clusters, in a hierarchy both random and ordered. Mathematically speaking, much the same thing is going on in these stock-price charts. That leaves Chart No. 4—the ringer in this game. It is a fictitious series of price changes generated using my latest model of how financial markets work. It faithfully simulates the “volatile volatility” of the real charts—and, whether in financial modeling or weather forecasting, the proof of any model lies in its results. In times past, the predictions of models were expressed in a few numbers or diagrams. I pioneered the use of the computer to express the predictions of my models in… ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=481))

- The “daily changes” in the four charts. Again, which are fake? How does it work? It is based on my fractal mathematics, which subsequent chapters will elucidate. It is a model still in development. What I know cannot yet be used to pick stocks, trade derivatives, or value options; time, and further research by others, will determine whether it ever can. But to be able to imitate reality is a form of understanding, and as such, the multifractal model already offers some immediate insights into how markets work. Like the popular-finance press, I can boil some of them down to five “rules” of market behavior—concepts that, if grasped and acted upon, can help lessen our financial vulnerability. Rule I. Markets are risky. Extreme price swings are the norm in financial markets—not aberrations that can be ignored. Price movements do not follow the well-mannered bell curve assumed by modern finance; they follow a more violent curve that makes an investor’s ride much bumpier. A sound trading strategy or portfolio metric would build this cold, hard fact into its foundations. Exactly how depends on the resources,… ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=491))

- “what-if?” games on paper, before committing hard cash to a trading strategy. Thus, a cautious investor can build a portfolio with greater security than the standard models suggest. An aggressive trader can be better prepared to pounce on moments of high volatility. And a prudent market regulator can be more alert to urgent problems—thereby averting financial catastrophe and macroeconomic harm. Some commentators have called for a “Richter scale” of market turbulence; like that famous measure of earthquake intensity, its financial analog would rank market tremors and provide a scale for regulators to judge the severity of impending problems. Forewarned is forearmed. Rule II. Trouble runs in streaks. Market turbulence tends to cluster. This is no surprise to an experienced trader. In financial dealing-rooms across the world, the first fifteen minutes of trading each morning are critically important; it is when experienced traders, staring at their screens, take the temperature of the market. They know that when a market opens choppily, it may well continue that way. They know that a wild Tuesday may well be followed by a wilder Wednesday. And they also know that it is in those wildest moments—the rare but recurring crises of the financial world—that the biggest fortunes of Wall Street are made and lost. They need no economists to tell them all this. But their intuition, not included in the standard model of efficient markets, is entirely validated by the multifractal model. Rule III. Markets have a personality. Prices are not driven solely by real-world events, news, and people. When investors, speculators, industrialists, and bankers come together in a real marketplace, a special, new kind of dynamic emerges—greater than, and different from, the sum of the parts. To use the economists’ terms: In substantial part, prices are determined by endogenous effects peculiar to the inner workings of the markets themselves, rather than solely by the exogenous action of outside… ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=501))

- mechanism varies. Wrong. A striking example: My analysis of cotton prices over the past century shows the same broad pattern of price variability at the turn of the last century when prices were unregulated, as there was in the 1930s when prices were regulated as part of the New Deal. Rule IV. Markets mislead. Patterns are the fool’s gold of financial markets. The power of chance suffices to create spurious patterns and pseudo-cycles that, for all the world, appear predictable and bankable. But a financial market is especially prone to such statistical mirages. My mathematical models can generate charts that—purely by the operation of random processes—appear to trend and cycle. They would fool any professional “chartist.” Likewise, bubbles and crashes are inherent to markets. They are the inevitable consequence of the human need to find patterns in the patternless. Rule V. Market time is relative. There is what one may call a relativity of time in financial markets. Early on, but mostly when developing the multifractal model, I came to think of markets as operating on their own “trading time”—quite distinct from the linear “clock time” in which we normally think. This trading time speeds up the clock in periods of high volatility, and slows it down in periods of stability. Mathematically, I can write an equation showing how one time frame relates to the other and use it to generate the same kind of jagged price series that we observe in real life. This is how the successful forgery shown among the previous charts was made. It is almost as if dealing rooms need, besides the standard row of wall clocks showing the time in Tokyo, London, and New York, a fourth clock showing “Greenwich Market Time.” This last point highlights an important subtext of this book: Market professionals know far more than they even realize. Professional traders often speak of a “fast” market or a “slow” one, depending on how they judge the volatility at that moment. They would quickly recognize, and… ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=520))

- anecdote, of course, cannot confirm the multifractal model; only rigorous statistical analysis can do that. But the folklore does signal that the model is on the right track. The multifractal model also has many implications for practical finance. As indicated, portfolio theory needs rethinking; options need revaluing; trading strategies need review. A small example: “stop-loss” orders are imperfect, to put it mildly. Many investors or traders leave instructions to close a position when a price hits a particular target. But as many have learned to their grief, when prices are really flying, they typically whiz past the target so fast that even the most attentive broker cannot execute the “sell” orders fast enough. Result: Greater losses, or smaller profit, than the investor intended. Another example: the mathematics of this model offers some potentially new yardsticks to measure volatility and risk. Instead of the standard deviations and “betas” of conventional finance, one can imagine new scales based on two new variables to be described later in this book: the H exponent of price dependence, and the α parameter characterizing volatility.

If it fits any genre, it is that of popular science. It explains a new, and important, way of looking at the world—in this case, the financial world. It attempts to do so using common English, with as few formulae and as little mathematical jargon as possible—or at least, with no jargon unexplained. That is because I aim to stimulate broader debate about financial-market modeling. It is a debate that has, hitherto, been confined to the rarefied circles of economics-minded mathematicians, or of mathematically inclined economists. The underlying mathematics is, frankly, forbidding—the primary reason why, when I first began publishing in the 1960s and 1970s, few mainstream economists were inclined to listen. But the extraordinary tumult and noise of this fin de siècle market turmoil are opening the ears of many who previously affected deafness. Research in this field has far to go.

For centuries, shipbuilders have put care into the design of their hulls and sails. They know that, in most cases, the sea is moderate. But they also know that typhoons arise and hurricanes happen.

- FOR MOST PEOPLE, chance is a familiar but unexamined idea, a word with many separate meanings. They speak of the chance of winning the lottery, or the chance of being in a plane crash; they mean a simple number, the odds of something happening. Or they speak of a chance encounter, by which they mean unplanned, unanticipated. When they are investing, they have yet another meaning. They speak of the chance of losing money; here, chance is a menace, a risk. It is the thing that upsets their investment plans, makes them poor where they hoped to be rich. They try to weigh risks, comparing stocks with bonds, real estate with Treasuries. Most people have no idea how to do that systematically and numerically, but they accept that chance is, somehow, involved in their personal investments.

- some. We live in the real world of brokers, investors, and hard cash, not abstract probability. IBM stock rose by $1 a share because the company announced it signed more computer-service contracts than expected, and so 5,218 real people, some calculating and some impulsive, some greedy and some prudent, ordered 12,542,300 real IBM shares with $768,016,733 in real cash. It is cause-and-effect, the very model of determinism. No luck about it, whatsoever. Sure, it is difficult to reconstruct who did what and why to make the price rise, and harder still to forecast whether it will keep rising; that is what brokers are for. But it is nonsense to suggest that IBM stock rose by chance. Dice fall by chance. Roulette wheels spin by chance. But IBM shares, the euro-dollar exchange rate, and wheat prices do not rise or fall by the mathematical rules of chance. Indeed, they do not—but they can be described as if they do. And that subtle distinction, of thinking about prices as if they were governed by chance, has been the dominant, fructifying notion of financial theory for the past one hundred years. On its foundation was built the modern, global financial industry. Portfolio management, trading strategy, corporate finance—all have been shaped by the chain of assumptions and deductions that succeeding generations of economists and mathematicians have forged from this paradoxical notion of chance. I am, of course, a true believer in the power of probability. I have seen it and applied it in economics, physics, information theory, metallurgy, meteorology, neurology, anatomy, taxonomy, and many other seemingly improbable fields. As a graduate student at the University of Paris more than fifty years ago, I wrote my doctoral thesis on an ignored byway of applied probability: the power law that rules the mathematical frequency with which individual words occur in common language. With such a background I would hardly be one to refute the usefulness of probability theory in yet another field, finance. In financial markets, God can appear, anyway, to play with dice. What I know is that the ruler of chance can create what I call several distinct “states” or types of chance. And what I contest is the way today’s financial theorists, in their classrooms and their writings, calculate the odds. It may seem to some an academic quibble—but as will be seen, it can be the… ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=574))

- Seeing nature through the lens of probability theory is what mathematicians call the stochastic view. The word comes from the Greek stochastes, a diviner, which in turn comes from stokhos, a pointed stake used as a target by archers. We cannot follow the path of every molecule in a gas; but we can work out its average energy and probable behavior, and thereby design a very useful pipeline to transport natural gas across a continent to fuel a city of millions. If the physical world is so uncertain, so difficult to know precisely, then how much more uncertain and unknowable must be the world of money? Finance is a black box covered by a veil. Not only are the inner workings hidden, but the inputs are also obscured, by bad economic data, conflicting news reports, or outright deception. What coefficient of correction should I apply to a broker’s self-serving stock tip? And then there is the most confounding factor of all, anticipation. A stock price rises not because of good news from the company, but because the brightening outlook for the stock means investors anticipate it will rise further, and so they buy. Anticipation is a feature unique to economics. It is psychology, individual and mass—even harder to fathom than the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Anticipation is the stuff of dreams and vapors.

- Still, the idea of chance in markets is difficult to grasp, perhaps because, unlike the anonymous particles in a magnet or molecules in a gas, the millions of people who buy and sell securities are real individuals, complex and familiar. But to say the record of their transactions, the price chart, can be described by random processes is not to say the chart is irrational or haphazard; rather, it is to say it is unpredictable. Again, word derivations are helpful. The English phrase “at random” adapts a medieval French phrase, à randon. It denoted a horse moving headlong, with a wild motion that the rider could neither predict nor control. Another example: In Basque, “chance” is translated as zoria, a derivative of zhar, or bird. The flight of a bird, like the whims of a horse, cannot be predicted or controlled. We can think of financial prices in much the same ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=631))

- way: not predictable, not controllable. Under such circumstances, the best we can do is evaluate the odds for or against some outcome: a stock rising a certain amount this year, an option coming into the money, or an exchange rate holding steady through the next corporate budget cycle. To use the tools of probability is not to say chance governs global commerce and finance. Sure, after the fact, with enough time and effort, we can piece together a tolerable cause-and-effect story of why a price moved the way it did. But who cares? It is too late by then. Fortunes have been gained and lost. Before the fact, in the real world of fast markets, veiled motives, and uncertain outcomes, probability is the only tool at our disposal.

- For example, consider the old game of tossing a coin. It has been popular among theoreticians since the days of the Bernoulli brothers, a prolific family of eighteenth-century mathematicians from Basel whose studies helped found the field of probability. Imagine that Harry wins a Swiss franc on heads, and his brother Tom wins one on tails. (Past mathematicians called them Peter and Paul. But I could never remember which was which.) Each toss is pure luck. But after these three centuries of playing the game, millions and millions of times, each brother has every reason to expect to have won half of the time. Such is the dictate of the law of large numbers, a common-sense notion also approved by mathematicians: If you repeat a random experiment often enough, the average of the outcomes will converge towards an expected value. With a coin, heads and tails have equal odds. With a die, the side with one spot will come up about a sixth of the time. This is what Kolmogorov meant. But other aspects of the game get more complicated. At any particular moment, one brother may have accumulated far more winnings than the other. Look at the full record of a coin-tossing experiment on the following page—10,000 simulated tosses. It is due to an eminent mathematician I knew well, Willy Feller, who in 1950 wrote a probability textbook widely used at one time. After each toss, he charted Harry’s cumulative winnings or debts. An erratic, but pronounced, pattern appears: A few long, up-and-down cycles stand out, while many shorter cycles ride on top of them. The “zero-crossings”—the moments when the imaginary purses of Harry or Tom go back to the empty state at which they started—are not uniformly spread but cluster together. It is structure of an irregular kind. All those years ago, when this diagram was first published, few readers heeded it. But I spent hours examining it, dreaming on it, trying to discern the chance patterns and processes behind it. At first glance, how much like a stock chart is this? “Chartists” spend their days studying financial graphs, spotting head-and-shoulder patterns, identifying compression periods or support levels, and then confidently advising their clients to buy or sell. Would they spot the difference if I slipped one of these coin-tossing charts into their folders? Should I expect a call from one, advising me to buy?

- The record of 10,000 coin tosses. These charts, adapted from Feller 1950, show how far a coin-tosser’s winnings can rise or fall from the expected average of zero (the horizontal lines). The top diagram shows the first 500 throws in detail. The lower two, placed end to end, cover 10,000 throws. The main point: A complex pattern can appear to emerge from even the simplest random process. A key point in my work: Randomness has more than one “state,” or form, and each, if allowed to play out on a financial market, would have a radically different effect on the way prices behave. One is the most familiar and manageable form of chance, which I call “mild.” It is the randomness of a coin toss, the static of a badly tuned radio. Its classic mathematical expression is the bell curve, or ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=666))

- “normal” probability distribution—so-called because it was long viewed as the norm in nature. Temperature, pressure, or other features of nature under study are assumed to vary only so much, and not an iota more, from the average value. At the opposite extreme is what I call “wild” randomness. This is far more irregular, more unpredictable. It is the variation of the Cornish coastline—savage promontories, craggy rocks, and unexpectedly calm bays. The fluctuation from one value to the next is limitless and frightening. In between the two extremes is a third state, which I call “slow” randomness. Think about the three—mild, slow, and wild—as if the realm of chance were a world in its own right, with its own peculiar laws of physics. Mild randomness, then, is like the solid phase of matter: low energies, stable structures, well-defined volume. It stays where you put it. Wild randomness is like the gaseous phase of matter: high energies, no structure, no volume. No telling what it can do, where it will go. Slow randomness is intermediate between the others, the liquid state. I first proposed some of my views of chance in 1964 in Jerusalem, at an International Congress of Logic and Philosophy of… ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=672))

- If you study that bell curve, as did Gauss, some surprising facts arise. First, assume several games are going at once. While Harry and Tom play with the coin, their cousins are throwing dice and their friends are dealing cards. The players in each game expect a different average outcome; but for each, the graph of how their winnings per set differ from that average has the same general bell shape. Some bells may be squatter, and some narrower. But each has the same mathematical formula to describe it, and requires just two numbers to differentiate it from any other: the mean, or average, error, and the variance or standard deviation, an arbitrary yardstick that expresses how widely the bell spreads. Now, this is all very convenient, in fact, simpler than most situations that occur in physics. One formula that includes two numbers as parameters can describe a vast range of human experience. Indeed, the common IQ test is deliberately designed to produce a bell curve of scores. The average IQ is, by definition, 100 points, the center of the bell. Then, 68 percent of the population has an IQ within ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=723))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- one ten-point standard deviation of the mean, or between 90 and 110 points. About 95 percent are within two standard deviations of the mean, between 80 and 120 points. And 98 percent are within three standard deviations, also called sigma for the Greek letter, σ, used to write it. As sigma grows, the odds of being inside the bell rapidly approach 100 percent, while the odds of being outside—an “outlier”—approach zero; an equation can estimate those odds. But that is not all. If you charted the IQ of every other person in a country rather than the entire population, you would still get a bell curve. If the verbal and mathematical test scores are independent and each follows a bell curve, so does the sum of the scores. Of course, the combined average score and its spread would have changed, but the basic properties of the curve would be the same. In short, the normal curve is indestructible. It is mathematical alchemy. It is what you inevitably get if you combine lots of little variations, each one independent from the last, and each one negligible when compared to the total. No one individual matters much to the total IQ curve; no one coin toss matters much to Harry and Tom’s game. But cumulatively, over time or across a population, the way the results vary forms a regular and predictable pattern. The data points are grains of sand on a shoreline, blades of grass in a lawn, electrons moving along a copper wire.

- Late in his long life, the nineteenth-century French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy thought of an especially tricky one. It was, when I was younger, viewed as interesting—but unrealistic and contrived. My work made it very real. I think the theory best imagined in terms of an archer standing before a target painted on an infinitely long wall. He is blindfolded and consequently shoots at random, in any direction. Most of the time, of course, he misses. In fact, half of the time he shoots away from the wall, but let us not even record those cases. Now, had his recorded misses followed the mild pattern of a bell curve, most would be fairly close to the mark, and very few would be very wide of it. Suppose he shot arrows long enough, in successive “sets.” For each set, he could calculate an average error and standard deviation—even give himself a score for blindfolded archery. But our archer is not in the land of the bell curve; his… ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=743))

- his average target score. In the Gaussian environment, even the wildest shots have a negligible contribution to the average. After a certain number of strikes, the running average score will have settled down to one stable value, and there is practically no chance the next shot will change that average perceptibly. But the Cauchy case is completely different. The largest shot will be nearly as large as the sum of all the others. One miss by a mile completely swamps 100 shots within a few yards of the target. His scores for blindfolded archery never settle down to a nice, predictable average and a consistent variation around that average. In the language of probability, his errors do not converge to a mean. They have infinite expectation, hence also infinite variance. Cauchy’s is a totally different way of thinking of the world than Gauss’s. The errors are not distributed as near-uniform grains of sand; they are a composite of grains, pebbles, boulders, and mountains. The practical importance of the distinction first became recognized through my work, but its existence was noted long ago. In 1853, the weekly printed proceedings of the French Academy of Sciences record a debate on the subject between Cauchy and another mathematician, Irénée… ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=751))

- Cauchy’s fanciful error formula, he argued, was an unnatural oddity; if it ever occurred, a scientist would spot it immediately: The observations themselves would warn the least attentive observer. As the large-value errors would have to have a noticeably large probability, from the start they would present themselves, if not as often as the others, then at least in as large a proportion. Thus, you would have frighteningly discordant observations. And there is no doubt that they would be rejected and that the instruments, or the observation process, would be submitted to profound correction....

- Wild randomness is uncomfortable. Its mathematics is unfamiliar and in many cases remains to be developed. It looks difficult, often requiring elaborate computer simulations rather than a quick punch on a calculator. Unfortunately, the world has not been designed for the convenience of mathematicians. There is much in economics that is best described by this wilder, unpleasant form of randomness—perhaps because economics is about not just the physics of wheat, weather, and crop yields, but also the mercurial moods and unmeasurable anticipations of wheat farmers, traders, bakers, and consumers. This makes for strange conundra. Suppose you are asked to calculate the average size of companies in the software industry. So you go down a list, counting the firms, adding up their reported revenues, and dividing one number into the other to get a simple average. But how long should the list be? Just the top fifty publicly traded firms? Every company in an industry directory? Every firm that files a tax return and says it is in software?

But if you exclude it, you ignore the most important company in the industry. In short, the distribution of company size is wild—Wild West, in the view of Microsoft’s critics.

- Back to Finance Now, having wandered rather far, we come to financial markets. Suppose you can simulate on your computer an artificial stock market. Based on your ideas about how one piece of the economy connects to another, you build an elaborate econometric model. It inputs data you give it about the weather, population, inflation, economic growth, industry specialization, and the companies being traded; and it calculates what its algorithms tell it is the optimal, “fundamental” value of a company’s stock. To that value, it adds millions of small random changes—perhaps reflecting fictitious news events, or fickle investor preferences, some taken separately, some added together. So, what kind of variability generator will you use? If mild, the resulting price charts will vary within a certain well-defined range; their trace will be the product of many ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=803))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- small computer-generated events. Very different is wild variability, even though it can be “tuned down” to be less extreme than Cauchy’s. Wild price charts will be a hair-raising record, mixing small movements with very, very large dislocations, many computer-generated news items with a few cataclysmic bulletins, many small transactions with large, institutional block trades—all, a mix of the small and routine with the large and rare. In such a wild world, an imaginary investor participating in this econometric simulation could be wiped out overnight. Alas, this is not a computer fantasy. Hitherto, standard financial theory has followed the first, mild path. How it got on that mistaken path, and how it can get off it, will be seen in subsequent chapters.

- IN MARCH 1900, the academic equivalent of a trial by fire was convened at the University of Paris. The judges included Henri Poincaré, one of the most celebrated mathematicians of all time. He was a genius whose restless energy had led him across virtually every field of mathematical inquiry and beyond: probability, function theory, topology, geometry, optics, and, above all, celestial mechanics. He was a widely read popularizer of math and science, and his collected columns fill several books read to this day.

- Before Poincaré on that day in 1900 was one of his doctoral students, Louis Bachelier.1 Jobs for Ph.D.’s were scarce; and so the award of a doctorate in France was a formal, trying process. The young mathematician’s schooling had been mediocre, at best. Now he had to pass two final tests before Poincaré and the doctoral “jury.” The lesser one was an oral examination on a standard topic, chosen and approved beforehand. Bachelier’s was on fluid mechanics; and it tested both his knowledge and oratory—an important consideration for a man who hoped to become a professor. The subject was a specialty of one of Poincaré’s fellow judges, Joseph Boussinesq; so it cannot have been an easy test for Bachelier. But, according to the panel’s final report, he demonstrated that it was a topic he “grasped deeply.” The main test was the defense of his original research; and the subject was not calculated to win easy approval. His thesis, “Théorie de la Spéculation,” was not on complex numbers, function theory, ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=828))

- differential equations, or other topics then in mathematical vogue. Nor was the spéculation to which it referred some form of speculative thought—no polite monograph on the philosophy of chance, this. It was about the money-grubbing form of speculation, the trading of government bonds on the Paris exchange, or Bourse, a thriving den of capitalism modeled after a Greek temple and located on the opposite river bank, geographically and intellectually, from the famed Sorbonne. Then as now in France, unbridled speculation had an unsavory reputation. While investment was socially desirable, pure gaming, or agiotage, was not. Futures trading on the exchange had been legalized only fifteen years earlier. And “shorting”—selling securities with borrowed money, to profit from a falling price— was beyond the pale. While there had been some books on financial markets by 1900, its study was not yet an academic discipline, much less an appropriate topic for a provincial seeking approval and patronage from the great Faculté des Sciences de l’Université de Paris. The professors were underwhelmed. Poincaré, reporting on the dissertation, observed that “the subject chosen by M. Bachelier is a bit distant from those usually treated by our candidates.” He praised some of the “original” insights in the thesis, and suggested the most unusual one should have been more fully developed. But it was not the kind of paper that ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=835))

- An interest in the history of ideas is good for the scientist’s soul. Hence, my books often devote a portion to the contemplation of individual scientists, physical or social, and their vicissitudes. To understand why the orthodox theory of financial markets and investment is so flawed, it first helps to review it—and there is no better way than by portraying a few men of the twentieth century who stand out as especially influential, regardless of whether one agrees with them or not. They are Louis Bachelier, Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe, and the duo of Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. The first, hero of this chapter, was a maverick, a lone visionary who overcame the general apathy and occasional opprobrium of his contemporaries and doggedly pursued his unique view of the financial world.

In a 1921 curriculum vitae for a job application, he described his by-then voluminous writings, including two books and journal articles, as no mere academic scribbling; they were nothing less than “the renewal of a science that, born in France, had become the exclusive property of the Germans and English.” His 526-page book on probability “surpassed the great treatise of Laplace.” And he described another work as “absolutely unique to the author; he got the original idea from no one; no other work of the same type has ever been ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=879))

- The Bourse, the bustling Paris exchange, was at that time a world capital of bond trading. After the French Revolution, the government made restitution to some of the returning nobility by issuing a billion francs in perpetual bonds—a certificate that pays fixed interest indefinitely but never repays the principal. These rentes, as they were called, became a financial hit, widely held and actively traded: By 1900, 70 billion francs of domestic and international bonds were outstanding, compared to a government budget of four billion francs. As with U.S. Treasury bonds and U.K. Gilts today, such was the depth of the French bond market that parallel trading developed in related futures, options, and other derivatives with such exotic jargon as “call o’ more’s,” “put o’ more’s,” “spreads,” and “contangoes.” Bachelier was intimately familiar with the arcana of these markets, and he devoted part of his sixty-eight-page thesis to a detailed description of them. Indeed, some historians suggest he may have worked at the exchange for a while. His goal was to develop formulae to price these complicated derivatives. For that, he needed first to work out how the underlying bond prices themselves moved. Such “a formula which expresses the likelihood of a market fluctuation does not appear to have been published to date,” he wrote. And for good reason: The factors that determine activity on the Exchange are innumerable, with events, current or expected, often bearing no apparent relation to price variation. Beside the somewhat natural causes for variation come artificial causes: The Exchange reacts to itself, and the current trading is a function, not only of prior trading, but also of its relationship to the rest of the market. The determination of this activity depends on an infinite number of factors: It is thus impossible to hope for mathematical forecasting. Contradictory opinions about these variations are so evenly divided that at the same instant buyers expect a rise and sellers a fall. The calculus of probability can doubtless never ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=910))

- be applied to market activity, and the dynamics of the Exchange will never be an exact science. But it is possible to study mathematically the state of the market at a given instant—that is to say, to establish the laws of probability for price variation that the market at that instant dictates. If the market, in effect, does not predict its fluctuations, it does assess them as being more or less likely, and this likelihood can be evaluated mathematically Opening lines of “Théorie de la Spéculation” Now, there had been a few earlier mathematical sorties at the market. A French stockbroker, Jules Regnault, had observed in 1863 that the longer you hold a security, the more you can win or lose on its price variations. He even worked out a formula for it. But most market analysis looked at stock and bond prices in the conventional way: Something happens and prices react—a story of cause and effect, easy to work out afterwards, difficult to forecast beforehand. But this approach was futile; one can never know everything. Instead, Bachelier tried to estimate the odds that prices will move—then, a novel approach. And he did so brilliantly by observing “a strange and unexpected” analogy between the “diffusion” of heat through a substance and how a bond price wanders up and down. Both, he saw, are processes that you cannot precisely forecast. At the level of particles in matter or of individuals in markets, the details are just too complicated; you can never discriminate and describe every relevant factor or analyze exactly how they all interrelate to spread energy or energize spreads. But in both fields, you can back away from the messy details of how or who and see the broad pattern of probability that describes the whole system. So, in the most specific of his models, Bachelier adapted the equations of one field to the problems of another. In this model, he started by looking at the bond market as what he called “a fair game.” Recall the old pastime of tossing a coin, discussed earlier. If the coin is fair, or unweighted, it is as likely to come up heads as tails on each toss. If you win a dollar for every head and lose a dollar for every tail, at the end of a string of tosses the language of probability says you should “expect” a profit… ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=925))

- resultant formulae used to make probabilistic statements about what could happen next. That was another of Bachelier’s key insights. He assumed the split-brain thinking so common among economists today, two different ways of looking at the same event. One was after the fact or ex post facto, and the other before the fact or ex ante. After a price move, you can examine it and deduce a cause-and-effect “story” of why it happened; for instance, bond prices fell because of a new, gloomy inflation report, or because of new rumors that a big bond dealer was insolvent. But before the price move, it would have been difficult to predict those news events and even harder to forecast how the market would react. So, in your ignorance, you would have simply looked at the then-current bond prices and assumed they were fair, that the market had already taken account of all relevant information, and that prices were in equilibrium with supply matched to demand, and seller paired with buyer. Unless some new information came along to change that fine balance, you would have no reason to expect any change in price. The next move would as likely be up as down,… ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=945))

- gotten? Well, he could go two steps left, three right, four backwards, and so on in an aimless, jagged path. On average—just as in the coin-toss game—he gets nowhere. So if you consider only that average, his random walk across the field will be forever stuck at his starting point. And that would be the best possible forecast of his future position at any time, if you had to make such a guess. The same reasoning applies to a bond price: In the absence of new information that might change the balance of supply and demand, what is the best possible forecast of the price tomorrow? Again, the price can go up or down, by big increments or small. But, with no new information to push the price decisively in one direction or another, the price on average will fluctuate around its starting point. So again, the best forecast is the price today. Moreover, each variation in price is unrelated to the last, and is generated by the same unchanging but mysterious process that drives the markets. The price-changes, in the language of statistics, form a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. In fact, it is even simpler… ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=956))

- the whole kit of common mathematical tools for the normal, or Gaussian, distributions mentioned earlier. And thus, through the agency of Bachelier, Gauss’s theoretical curve came to be applied to the analysis of financial markets. But Bachelier also ventured into new mathematical territory. Nearly a century before, the great French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier had devised equations to describe the way heat spreads. Bachelier knew the formulae well from his physics lectures. He adapted them to calculate the probability of bond prices moving up or down, and called the technique “radiation of probability.” Strangely, it worked. Also, as fate would have it, very different motivations had sent other scientists on this trail. Long before, the invention of the microscope led to observations of the erratic way that tiny pollen grains jiggled about in a sample of water. A Scottish botanist, Robert Brown, studied this motion, observed that it is not a manifestation of life but a physical phenomenon, and received (possibly inflated) credit for the discovery through the term “Brownian motion.” In 1905, Albert Einstein developed for it… ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=965))

He was uncannily close: Looking back at real trading data, he found 39 percent of such options had in fact yielded a… ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=976))

- The Efficient Market Alas, Bachelier’s economic insights went largely unnoticed for many years. In those days, finance theory was an oxymoron; finance was a distasteful trade, not a subject fit for academic inquiry. That attitude did not start changing until the Crash of 1929. Then, more economists began trying to understand financial markets. Independently of Bachelier, some started to think about a random walk. Alfred Cowles III, a wealthy investor frustrated by the imprecision of what passed for financial… ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=980))

- Among twenty-four stock-market forecasters whom Cowles systematically studied, he found “no evidence of skill.” They might as well have been shooting craps. Twenty years later, a British statistician, Maurice G. Kendall, took a long look at London shares, New York cotton, and Chicago wheat—more than a century of data—in search of conventional patterns upon which an investor could turn an easy buck or quid. “On the whole,” he laconically concluded after pages of fruitless regression analysis, “I regard this experiment as a failure. ... There is no hope of being able to predict movements on the exchange.” But it was not until 1956 that Bachelier’s name reappeared in economics, this time, as an acknowledged forerunner, in a thesis on options-pricing by a student of MIT economist Paul A. Samuelson. Bachelier’s idea of a “fair game” caught on; and economists recognized the practical virtues of describing markets by the laws of chance and Brownian motion. They were, in the 1960s and 1970s, put into a broader theoretical framework by Eugene F. Fama. As a student at the University of Chicago, Fama contacted me at IBM and Harvard; I became his thesis adviser, by telephone, mail, and repeated visits. His dissertation was on my views of market dynamics (of which more, later). But we often discussed Bachelier’s ideas beyond the model of independent increments, and in subsequent years Fama elaborated them into what is now called the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. It is the intellectual bedrock on which orthodox financial theory today sits. At its heart: In an ideal market, security prices fully reflect all relevant information. A financial market is a fair game in which buyer balances seller. Given that, the price at any particular moment must be the “right” one. Buyer and seller may differ in opinion; one may be a bear, and another a bull. But they both agree on the price, or there would be no deal. Multiply this thinking by the millions of daily deals of a bustling market, and you conclude that the general market price must be “right,” as well—that is, that the published price reflects the market’s overall best guess, given the information to hand, of what a stock is likely to profit its owner. And if that is true—and here is the bitterest pill for an investor to swallow—then you cannot beat the… ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=985))

- months that it ceases to be noticeable. The trend has vanished, killed by its very discovery. In fact, in 1976 some economists spotted just such a pattern of regular January rallies in the stocks of small companies. Many investors close their losing positions towards the end of the year so they can book the loss as a tax deduction—and the market rebounds when they reinvest early in the new tax year. The effect is most pronounced on small stocks, which are more sensitive to small money movements. Alas, before you rush out to trade on this trend, you should know that its discovery seems to have killed it. After all the academic hoopla over it, it no longer shows up as clearly in price charts. Second case: Suppose a financial analyst, poring over France Telecom’s annual reports and chatting with its bankers and competitors, concludes that the company’s debt is getting too large. To keep paying it, it will have to cut its dividend, borrow more, or sell an important asset. Can the analyst get rich on that insight? Not if the market is efficient. Other analysts will swiftly spot the problem, too, and advise their clients to… ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1006))

- Third and final case: Suppose the France Telecom CEO starts cashing in his stock options, because he knows the debt is a time bomb. How long can he profit on his inside information? In an efficient market, not very long. Traders will notice the captain is abandoning ship, and figure something bad is about to happen. So they sell, too, and the stock falls. That is the theory, anyway. In all three cases—reading price charts, analyzing public information, and acting on inside information—the market quickly discounts the new information that results. Prices rise or fall to reach a new equilibrium of buyer and seller; and the next price change is, once again, as likely to be up as down. That does not mean you cannot win, ever. In fact, by the simple odds of a fair game, you can expect to win half the time and lose half the time. And if you have special insights into a stock, you could profit from being the first in the market to act on it. But you cannot be sure you are right or first; after all, the market is full of people at least as smart as you. So, in sum, it may not be worth your while to spend all that time and money getting the information in the first place. Cheaper and safer to ride with the market. Buy a stock index fund. Relax. Be passive. Or as Samuelson at MIT put it: “They also serve who only sit and hold.” His advice, then: A respect for evidence compels me to incline toward the hypothesis that most portfolio decision makers should go out of business—take up plumbing, teach Greek, or help produce the annual GNP by serving as corporate executives. Even if this advice to drop dead is good advice, it obviously is not counsel that will be eagerly followed. Few people will commit suicide without a push.

- IN 1999, two economists from Duke University engaged in what you might, at first glance, think a tedious bit of research. They surveyed the chief financial officers of the largest U.S. corporations to ask them how, exactly, they do their jobs. How do they decide which factories, acquisitions, or new ventures to fund, and which to kill? How do they determine whether it would be cheaper to issue stock, sell bonds, or just borrow from the bank? The questionnaire was three pages long and took about seventeen minutes to fill out; and seventeen minutes is rather a lot of time to ask of the paymasters of the universe that most big-company CFOs imagine themselves to be. Still, 392 responded. The answer that came back: When it comes to estimating their cost of capital—an essential ingredient in any… ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1037))

- CFOs in sixteen European countries in 2001 found the same acronym, CAPM, on the lips of 77 percent. It is also in the political phrase-books. When Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. wanted to raise its electricity prices in New York in 2001, CAPM was part of the rationale argued to the regulator. By contrast, when the utility regulator in Northern Ireland wanted instead to cut electricity prices in his jurisdiction, part of his rationale: CAPM. Clearly, a double-edged sword. So what is this strange acronym? Why does it feed into so many financial decisions upon which prices, jobs, and mergers depend? More important: Are these decisions right? The professors, grading the questionnaires, tartly noted that the CFOs did not seem to be using the model correctly—or, at least, not the way it is taught in business schools. Most of them seemed to be using some other techniques, as well. And, the professors added: “Even if it is applied properly, it is not clear that the CAPM is a very good model.” But the model remains, they concluded, “widely used.” Its origin goes back to Bachelier.

- The first big step in applying Bachelier’s ideas was taken by a Chicago grocer’s son, Harry Markowitz. His was a comfortable background—perhaps not as wealthy as Bachelier’s but, as he later recalled, “we lived in a nice apartment, always had enough to eat, and I had my own room. I was never aware of the Great Depression.” Still, it was the economics of uncertainty that most interested Markowitz when he got to the economics department at the University of Chicago. How do you decide to invest in a new factory or stock when you cannot know beforehand exactly how the investment will turn out? In the stock market, the conventional wisdom in Markowitz’s day was simple: Become a good stock-picker, or hire one. Whether through experience, inside information, long research, or hard number-crunching, some people are just good at it. Of course, there were plenty of books on how to do it. You could analyze how much cash a company might generate, how much profit it would report, how much it had borrowed—and, massaging the numbers, come up with a guess for what each share, in an ideal world, “should” be worth. If the market price is lower,… ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1064))

- So went the theory. Markowitz was studying in the university library in 1950 when his “eureka” moment came. The young economist was hunting a good topic for a doctoral thesis; and a chance meeting with a broker had led him to look at the stock market. “I had not taken any finance courses, nor did I own any securities,” he recalled later. He had read some books, such as a 1934 classic on stock-picking, Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. And he was in the library reading another, Theory of Investment Value by John Burr Williams. It argued that, to estimate a stock’s value, you start by forecasting how much in dividends it will pay; then adjust the prediction for inflation, foregone interest, and other factors that make the forecast uncertain. A straightforward rule. But surely, Markowitz thought to himself, real investors do not think that way. They do not look only at their potential profit; if they did, most people would buy just one stock, their best pick, and wait for the winnings to roll in. Instead, people also think about diversification. They judge how risky a stock is, how much its price bounces… ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1074))

Merchant of Venice, Act I, Scene I So Markowitz pondered: How to translate those two concepts, risk and reward, into equations you can work with? Well, your hoped-for profit—the expected return—depends on what you think the stock price most likely will be when it comes time to sell. “Most likely,” if you go back to the familiar bell curve, would mean the average, or mean, of all the prices you expect it might hit before you sell. Risk is more difficult to define. Perhaps, he thought, risk depends on how much the stock price swings up or down around the mean—or, to put it another way, the odds that you guessed wrong about the final price. Again, back to the bell curve: The most common measures of volatility are called variance and standard deviation; the latter is just the square root of the former. So Markowitz went back to the bookshelves, and pulled down a 1937… ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1084))

- had some critics. At the defense of his doctorate, he later recalled, one of Chicago’s best-known economics professors, Milton Friedman, argued that “they could not award me a Ph.D. degree in Economics for a dissertation which was not in Economics.” Markowitz added that he assumed Friedman was “only half serious,” as the degree was granted. And his ideas spread. They had practical appeal. Markowitz was saying that the prospects for every stock can be described by just two numbers, the reward and the risk—or, mathematically speaking, the mean and the variance of what you expect the stock will pay back by the time you sell. You predict the first number, the average expected selling price, with standard stock-analyst tools: Make earnings forecasts, estimate dividend growth, or ask the chairman’s bartender. You conclude, say, that in one year General Motors stock will be about 10 percent higher because you think that its earnings will grow nearly that much. You predict the second number, the variance, by using the bell curve as a yardstick when looking back at how the stock did in the past: On two-thirds of the trading days in the previous year, GM’s stock moved by less than its 17 percent standard deviation, so chances are it will do the same in the next year. Conclusion: You expect GM stock will give you a 10 percent profit, with two-to-one odds that you will not be wrong by more than 17 percent; that is, you are unlikely to lose more than 7 percent, and you may make as much as 27 percent. That is precision—or the appearance of it, anyway. With it, you can systematically compare stock with stock, GM with Ford, IBM with GE. Plot them all on a graph. They will scatter across the page in a spectrum of mean and variance, profit and risk, risky losers in one corner and safe winners in another. Then the final step: Combine the stocks to build portfolios. But how? Each possible combination of stocks will give a different overall return and a different overall risk—and estimating them is not a simple matter of adding all the numbers for all the stocks together. Portfolio risk is more complicated than that: The whole can be greater, or less, than the sum of the parts. Stocks have a tendency to move up and down together. If a recession is looming, many stocks across the whole… ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1095))

- broke. Stocks are a bit like that. Each stock, depending on the company sector or strategy, is correlated more or less with other stocks. So—and here comes the trick of Markowitz’s portfolio theory—if you mix some stocks that flip tails with others that flip heads, you can lower the risk of your overall portfolio. If you do it right, you need not sacrifice too much profit. GM stock, with its heavy dependence on consumer spending, tends to rise when the economy booms and fall when it sours. Lilly stock is more stable—even, perhaps, a bit contrarian, because more people may get sick and buy medicine when the economy suffers. The two stocks are uncorrelated. So if you buy a bit of each, you will profit both when the economy grows and when it contracts. Next step: Add more and more stocks in different combinations to build what Markowitz called an “efficient” portfolio. Efficient is a cheerful word put to many uses. A good pump is efficient; it moves the most water for the least energy. A portfolio is efficient if it produces the most profit with the least risk. Thus, with Markowitz’s math, for each level of risk you contemplate, you can devise an… ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1115))

- safe ones down below. So which do you buy? That depends on your appetite for risk. If you are greedy and fearless, go for a racy portfolio near the top of the graph. If you are timid, take a sleepy one near the bottom. The choice also depends on the rest of the economy—specifically, how attractive the stock market’s main competitor, safe Treasury bills, appear to be. If interest rates are high and T-bills pay well, then you will not touch stocks unless you think they will pay more; but to get more, you may have to accept more risk. By contrast, if rates are low, a duller, safer stock portfolio may suffice. Another economist, James Tobin, saw portfolio-building as a two-step dance. First devise the optimum, efficient stock portfolio for the economic and market climate. Then decide how much of a gambler you are. If you are a risk-averse widow, leave most of your money in the bank and invest only a little in the efficient stock-market portfolio. If you are a typical investor, put at least half into the efficient portfolio and leave the rest in the bank. And if you are a high-roller with a death wish, put everything you have into the stocks—and… ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1125))

- course. First, as Markowitz himself pointed out, it is not certain that using the bell curve is the best way to measure stock-market risk; it is easy, but not necessarily right. Second, to build efficient portfolios you need good forecasts of earnings, share prices, and volatility for thousands of stocks. Otherwise, garbage in, garbage out. Finally, for each stock, you must laboriously calculate its “covariance” with, or how it fluctuates against, every other stock. For a thirty-stock portfolio, about the minimum needed to make the numbers work well, that means 495 different calculations of mean, variance, and covariance. For the entire New York Stock Exchange: 3.9 million calculations. And, because prices change, the exercise needs constant repetition.

Another suggested he go visit Markowitz, who had left Chicago and was working near UCLA at a well-known think-tank, the RAND Corp. “I introduced myself to him and said I was a great fan of his work,” Sharpe recalled later. And, of course, Markowitz had a good thesis idea, for which he became Sharpe’s unofficial adviser: Simplify the portfolio model. For that, Sharpe asked a question: What happens if everybody in the market plays by Markowitz’s rules? The answer was surprising.

First decide what you mean by “the market”: just the thirty industrial stocks in the Dow, or the hundred shares in the British FTSE index? Should you include bonds? What about other risky assets, like home equity? And, whatever the market, you will still need to keep re-tuning the fund to track it. Buy or sell too much or at the wrong time, and you lose money. But there is more. If all that matters is the market portfolio, then the value of an individual stock depends only on how it compares to the rest of the market. Of course, the performance of the market overall flows with the economic tides. Treasury bills are safe and dull; since 1926, they have paid an average 3.8 percent with very little risk in good times and bad. The stock market, by contrast, is risky and exciting; in the same period, the Standard & Poor’s 500 stocks have paid an average 13 percent, but with huge swings around that average, through bear and bull, crash and boom.

- more nor less than the market overall. But a stock that plummets 4 percent when the market falls 2 percent is unattractive. It is twice as volatile as the market; you will not touch it unless you think that, despite the risk in bad times, it could still double your money in good times. Similarly, a stock that slips only 1 percent when the market falls 2 percent—or better still, rises when the market falls—may be very attractive. It is half as volatile as the market; you will pay more for it, and be content to make a smaller but safer profit. The amount by which the stock reacts to the market is the stock’s “beta” or β, a Greek letter commonly used in mathematical equations. In plain English: To buy a stock, you have to expect it will pay you more than safe and sound T-bills. That “more” is proportional to how closely the stock mirrors the overall market’s performance. Take an example. The stock of Hot TechCo may have a β of 1.5, which means it is very sensitive to the state of the market and economy. Plug the numbers into Sharpe’s formula. Start with what T-bills are paying: 2 percent.

- The concept is straightforward. It says the more you risk, the more you expect to get paid. It says the most important risk you face as a stock-market investor is the general state of the economy, reflected in how the market is doing. It says that if you are rational you would not normally want a stock that is going to die just as a recession arrives and you are about to get laid off; so to buy that stock, you have to be thinking it will rise so far in the good times that it will more than pay its losses in the bad times. And now a practical point, which helps explain why this formula became so popular in the world of finance. It takes all of Markowitz’s tedious portfolio calculations and reduces them to just a few. Work up a forecast for the market overall, and then estimate the β for each stock you want to consider. From 495 calculations for a thirty-stock portfolio with Markowitz and portfolio theory, you simplify to thirty-one with Sharpe and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, as it came to be called.

It came out and I figured OK, this is it. I’m waiting. I sat by the phone. The phone didn’t ring. Weeks passed and months passed, and I thought, rats, this is almost certainly the best paper I’m ever going to write, and nobody cares. It was kind of disappointing.

- ideas. A very academic contest—in slow motion—took place. Sharpe was first to publish. But today most economists credit Sharpe, Lintner, and Mossin jointly for the development of the CAPM model. Today, nearly every business school in the world teaches the model, and not just for valuing stocks. As mentioned earlier, the model turns out to be a handy tool for valuing a company’s projects, too. Suppose you are an electronics CFO needing to decide whether to build a new semiconductor factory. You use CAPM to look at it from the point of view of an investor considering whether to include your shares in his portfolio—that is, to give you the cash to build the plant. Your company overall may have a moderately high β of 1.1; but the semiconductor industry may have an even higher β of 1.7. Thus, building the plant will expose your company to some extra risk. To justify that, the project’s planners must show you that it can also produce extra profit. In short, CAPM helps set a “hurdle rate” for the plant’s expected return. If the forecasts suggest the return will clear the hurdle, fine; build it. If not, scrap it.

- The next big step in the development of modern financial theory began in a small, windowless smoking lounge in the Chicago Board of Trade. For more than a century, the exchange had been the center of U.S. trading in commodities—wheat, pork bellies, corn and soy, cattle and barley. But on April 26, 1973, some of its members inaugurated a new kind of market, in stock options. Options of one kind or another had been around for generations; Bachelier’s thesis had, after all, been on options. They gave the holder the right to buy or sell something at a fixed price. Stock options—contracts to buy or sell a company’s stock—are a form of compensation for many executives,… ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1209))

- in 1973: contracts to buy 100 Xerox shares at $160 apiece over the following three months. Thirty-nine such contracts were traded. Each contract cost the buyer $5.50 a share. In New York that day, the actual Xerox stock price was only $149—meaning that the buyer of these $160 “call” options was betting Xerox would rise fairly quickly. If it hit, say, $170 within the next three months, he had the right to buy the stock cheaply at $160 and resell it at $170. Profit: $10 a share, less commission, taxes, and the original $5.50 option premium. On the other hand, if Xerox did not rise—or even fell—then the option would expire unused and the $5.50 premium would be lost. As fate would have it, that is exactly what happened with those first Xerox contracts in April 1973: They expired worthless because the stock did not rise high enough. Before the new Chicago market, trading options was a small, expensive business conducted “over-the-counter,” broker to broker, by phone or telex. The new market was an open bazaar, with published prices and low commissions. So for a speculator, those Xerox options were a new, cheaper way to bet on Xerox stock. The entrance fee was… ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1215))

- buyer and a seller came together. But was there a way to estimate a “reasonable” price? The answer came, not in the noisy Chicago trading pit, but from a mindset far away in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Fischer Black had started with a conventional academic career, graduating from Harvard in physics and then getting a doctorate in applied mathematics. He was a tall, thin man of few words. He complained of a poor memory, and so got into the habit of jotting down his ideas immediately, whenever or wherever they struck. As a lecturer, he was known for sometimes stopping in mid-sentence, falling silent, and taking notes. In 1965 he left Harvard and moved across town to a big Cambridge consulting firm, Arthur D. Little Inc.; he wanted, he later said, to work on practical problems with “more immediate payoff.” There, he met another ADL man, Jack Treynor—the same who had devised, but not published, an asset-pricing model around the same time as Sharpe. Black began to study it, and became hooked. “The notion of equilibrium in the market for risky assets had great beauty for me,” he recalled. He tried applying the model… ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1225))

- what an option or warrant was worth today, they thought they had to know what the underlying stock would be worth at expiration—that is, how far “in the money” or “out of the money” the option would end up being. But that was a hopeless approach. If you could predict that, you would not be a struggling young economist much longer. As Black thought about it, he realized that maybe he could work around not knowing the stock’s final value. He devised a complicated differential equation to describe his ideas—and then could not solve it; that type of math had not been one of his strong points. “So I put the problem aside and worked on other things,” Black later recalled. About this time, a young Canadian economist, Myron S. Scholes, arrived at MIT to start teaching finance at its Sloan School of Management. Scholes had been born in a gold-mining region of the far north, Timmons, Ontario, where his father had moved in the Depression to set up a dental practice. His mother died of cancer when he was sixteen, and then he developed scar tissue on his corneas that, until corrected surgically ten years… ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1235))

- teaching job at MIT. There, several smart young economists had gathered around economists Paul Samuelson, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Cootner (the first two eventually won Nobels). And on Tuesday evenings, a workshop on finance met to discuss new issues. There, Scholes and Black got to know each other. Together, they took up Black’s work again. They made an odd couple—the austere, reserved Harvard man and the temperamental, disputatious Canadian. They focused on Black’s earlier, counterintuitive insight: When valuing an option, you do not need to know how the game will end—that is, what the stock price will finally be when the option expires. Instead, all you need to know is what the traders themselves know, the terms of the option (the strike price and time to expiration) and how volatile the stock is. If a stock is very stable, its out-of-the-money options will not be worth much to anybody. The odds are very low that the stock price will rise far enough to make the options useful. By contrast, if a stock is risky, if its price swings widely up or down, then the options will be very valuable: Odds are high that, on one of those swings, the options will come into the money and pay off handsomely. Moreover, as the option matures and the stock price moves, the value of the option in the marketplace will keep changing. The Black-Scholes formula permitted the same, frequent recalculations of value that the market itself did. It also, to be manageable, had “to assume away all kinds of complications,” Black later recalled. For instance, they followed Markowitz, Sharpe, and Bachelier in assuming that a stock’s risk, or volatility, can be gauged by the bell-curve standard. Black and Scholes started talking their ideas out with another MIT colleague, Robert C. Merton. He was a Columbia engineering undergraduate, a Caltech masters student in applied mathematics, and then an MIT economist—and he was bit badly by the markets bug. As a grad student, he would rise early to get down to a local brokerage house for the opening of trading; only after a few hours of watching the tape and placing his bets would he go to class. Now at MIT, as an assistant to Samuelson, Merton was also working on the options problem, and made some useful mathematical suggestions to Black… ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1245))

(That) had the effect of sharply reducing the value of the warrants. “How we came up with the option formula,” Black 1989 In other words, they lost their shirts. But they did not care. The fact that their formula had correctly spotted the anomalous warrants suggested that their math was sound, even if their market intelligence was not. So in October 1970, Black and Scholes submitted a paper to the Journal of Political Economy. Rejection: Too specialized, the journal said. They tried another journal. Rejection: Too many papers competing for too little space in its pages. Black, himself, suspected the ivory-tower class system at work. He later grumbled, “One reason these journals didn’t take the paper seriously was my non-academic return address.” In the end, the paper was rewritten and published in the Journal of Political Economy—but only after two friends from… ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1265))

- options dealers had incorporated its esoteric terminology, of “deltas” and “implied volatilities,” into their daily language. Texas Instruments began advertising its latest calculator as just the thing for a quick Black-Scholes calculation on the fly. An entire industry grew. With the help of the Black-Scholes formula and its many subsequent amendments, corporate financiers now routinely buy insurance, or hedge, against unwanted market problems, and not just in stocks. For instance, when General Electric signs a contract to deliver turbines to a British electricity company, it will buy pound “put” options whose value will rise if the pound falls. Similarly, fund managers can try to take out portfolio insurance—buying stock options that will zig when their portfolios zag. Certainly, these are costly; but they are cheaper than watching a portfolio shrivel when the market turns against it. And such hedging, or insurance, is the least of Black-Scholes’s uses. Thousands of business executives find it in their pay: the formula is routinely used to calculate the value of the stock options a company grants its leaders.

There he structured a popular course around a simple theme, fifty questions on finance. Alas, by then, many an experienced financier or economist would have skipped the class; the answers were starting to become clear, they thought. Black’s ideas and those of other theorists had already become dogma in the financial industry. They filled a need. The 1950s and 1960s had been a time of easy living on Wall Street. Most stocks rose with the postwar boom, and a broker’s job was to deliver good “picks.” Usually, that meant touting “growth” stocks like Xerox, IBM, or Avon, all members of a group of fifty well-reputed, fast growing companies called the “Nifty Fifty.… ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1286))

The financial industry needed new tools, new answers. Sure, the academics and their theories were grumpy and difficult, and their message that you cannot beat the market was particularly galling. But Wall Street’s customers were even more grumpy and difficult. So the financial industry became a convert to the new, “modern” finance. Merrill Lynch turned CAPM into an industry in its own right, producing a periodical “Beta Book” for its brokers and customers eager to do the math themselves. Across the world, financial firms started constructing efficient portfolios for their clients. After a few false starts, the index fund, the ultimate in passive investing, was born. It now constitutes more than a fourth of U.S. fund investments. Options took off. The industry was transformed. It discovered economies of scale: If there is just one market portfolio and one size fits all, then the same funds and same analysts can serve all customers. Merge and save. Bigger is better. And the academics themselves turned from disparaged outsiders to valued insiders. Many joined or became consultants to big financial houses.

- Markowitz, Scholes, and Merton—received Nobels. The whole edifice hung together—provided you assume Bachelier and his latter-day disciples are correct. Variance and standard deviation are good proxies for risk, as Markowitz posited—provided the bell curve correctly describes how prices move. Sharpe’s beta and cost-of-capital estimates make sense—provided Markowitz is right and, in turn, Bachelier is right. And Black-Scholes is right—again, provided you assume the bell curve is relevant and that prices move continuously. Taken together, this intellectual edifice is an extraordinary testament to human ingenuity. But the whole is no stronger than its weakest member. The crash of October 19, 1987, took many by surprise. On one day, the Dow plunged 29.2 percent. Something was wrong: The academics said that the fall should not have happened, that it was a once-in-an-eon event. The carefully designed investment portfolios blew up. The options-based portfolio insurance failed—indeed, it made the market rout worse, as fund managers rushed to get more insurance and thereby drove down prices even further. Later, the financial turmoil of the 1990s reinforced the point: Something is not quite right in the theory. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1303))

- This is where financial theory, from Bachelier to Black, meets financial reality. All the academic models are here, in the computers and workbooks of the pros—but almost invariably updated, altered, or mixed with other models. Indeed, the result is something like a traditional medicine or over-the-counter nostrum: many different chemicals and no clear “active ingredient.” But in the world of finance, the purity or elegance of the theory does not matter. Only one question counts, what makes money? And there are no easy answers. Indeed, in the eyes of the academic purists, you would find lots of things that look plain wrong on a typical, real-world trading floor—so many that, when visiting one, you can play the old childhood game of “spot the mistakes” in an intricate picture. Citigroup runs one of the biggest foreign-exchange operations at Canary Wharf. On a typical day in 2003, it is crowded, busy and self absorbed.

It wiggles across the screen, a seeming random walk reflecting the world’s mercurial views on the relative merits of the American and Japanese economies: up, down, or sideways in what the eye sees as an irregular pattern, but which standard financial theory calls random fluctuation. Then she performs an elementary task, of the sort chartists have been doing for a century. She calculates a moving average—for each day, the average of the exchange rate over the prior sixty-nine days. This calculation traces a smoother, gentler line than the raw price data, averaging out all the peaks and troughs. Now, she suggests, here is a simple way to make some money in the currency market: Every time the actual exchange rate climbs above the average line, you buy. Every time it falls below the average line, you sell. Simple. The result? If you had followed this strategy over the past decade, she calculates, you could have pocketed an average annual return of 7.97 percent. Heresy. Impossible.

Assumption: People are rational and aim only to get rich. Theory: When presented with all the relevant information about a stock or a bond, individual investors can and will make the obvious rational choice that leads to the greatest possible wealth and happiness. They will not ignore important information, or pay a lot for a stock they expect to fall. They will not become philanthropists.

The refutation of this one assumption of modern financial theory has in the past twenty-five years created a fertile new field of inquiry, called behavioral economics. It studies how people misinterpret information, how their emotions distort their decisions, and how they miscalculate probabilities. For instance, suppose you offer somebody a choice: They can flip a coin to win $200 for heads and nothing for tails, or they can skip the toss and collect $100 immediately. Most people, researchers have found, will take the sure thing. Now alter the game: They can flip a coin to lose $200 for heads and nothing for tails, or they can skip the toss and pay $100 immediately. Most people will take the gamble.

In computer simulations by economists Paul De Grauwe and Marianna Grimaldi at the Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium, the two groups start interacting in unexpected ways, and price bubbles and crashes arise, spontaneously. The market switches from a well-behaved “linear” system in which one factor adds predictably to the next, to a chaotic “non-linear” system in which factors interact and yield the unanticipated.

- jumped long ago into economics theory: Natura non facit saltum or, Nature does not make leaps, was the motto of one of the discipline’s first reference texts, the 1890 Principles of Economics by Alfred Marshall. If you assume continuity, you can open the well-stocked mathematical toolkit of continuous functions and differential equations, the saws and hammers of engineering and physics for the past two centuries (and the foreseeable future). You can also draw important, useful inferences. For instance, as discussed in the preceding chapter, Markowitz’s central idea was to reduce all investment decisions to two simple numbers, the mean and variance of expected prices, mathematical proxies for return and risk. In 1970 MIT’s Samuelson offered a proof for Markowitz’s simplification predicated on the assumption that prices change continuously. Reality: Clearly, prices do jump, both trivially and significantly. The trivial: Brokers often quote prices in round numbers, skipping intermediate values. Thus in the currency market, professional traders observe, about 80 percent of quotes end in a 0 or a 5, skipping the intermediate digits. The usual odds would suggest those values, being just two of the ten possible final digits in a number, should occur only about 20 percent of the time. Then there is the significant: Almost every day on the New York Stock Exchange, “order imbalances” occur in one stock or another. On one typical day, January 8, 2004, Reuters News Service reported imbalances happening eight times. Here, major news—approval of a medicine by the Food and Drug Administration, an unexpected takeover offer, or a windfall legal victory—caused market indigestion; sell and buy orders did not match, and market-makers had to raise or lower their price quotes until they did. To cope, some exchanges license “specialist” broker-dealers to step into the breach and trade when others will not.

- First, independence: Each change in price—whether a five-cent uptick or a $26 collapse—appears independently from the last, and price changes last week or last year do not influence those today. That means any information that could be used to predict tomorrow’s price is contained in today’s price, so there is no need to study the historical charts. A second assumption: statistical stationarity of the price changes. That means the process generating price changes, whatever it may be, stays the same over time. If you assume coin tosses decide prices, the coin does not get switched or weighted in the middle of the game. All that changes are the number of heads or tails as the coin is tossed; not the coin itself. And a third assumption: the normal distribution.

If you are going to use probability to model a financial market, then you had better use the right kind of probability. Real markets are wild. Their price fluctuations can be hair-raising—far greater and more damaging than the mild variations of orthodox finance. That means that individual stocks and currencies are riskier than normally assumed. It means that stock portfolios are being put together incorrectly; far from managing risk, they may be magnifying it. It means that some trading strategies are misguided, and options mispriced.

The same techniques of calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz two centuries ago to study the orbits of Mars and Mercury can be used today by a civil engineer to calculate the maximum stress on a new bridge, or the volume of water to pass beneath it. Now, none of this means that the bridge, river, and planets work the same way; or that an archaeologist at the Acropolis should help price an Accenture bond. Likewise, the wind and the markets are quite distinct; one is a phenomenon of nature, the other a creature of man. But the variety of natural phenomena is boundless while, despite all appearances to the contrary, the number of really distinct mathematical concepts and tools at our disposal is surprisingly small. When a man goes to clear a jungle he has relatively few types of tools: To cut, perhaps a machete; to knock down, a bulldozer; to burn, fire. Science is like that. When we explore the vast realm of natural and human behavior, we find our most useful tools of measurement and calculation are based on surprisingly few basic ideas. When a man has a hammer, all he sees around him are nails to hit. So it should be no great surprise that, with our small number of effective mathematical tools, we can find analogies between a wind tunnel and a Reuters screen.

- fractal and multifractal geometry. It is the study of roughness, of the irregular and jagged. I coined its name in 1975. Fractal is from fractus, past participle of frangere, to break, as I was reminded by one of my sons’ Latin dictionaries. The same root survives in many common words, including fraction and fragment. I developed these ideas over many decades of intellectual wanderings—pulling together many stray, forgotten, under-explored, and seemingly unrelated artifacts and issues of the mathematical past, extending them in every direction, and creating a new, coherent body of mathematics. Fractal geometry has come to be viewed as “natural.” It is used today for an improbably diverse set of tasks: compressing digital images over the Internet, measuring metal fractures, analyzing brain waves in an EEG machine, designing ultra-small radio antennae, making better optical cables, and studying the anatomy of lung bronchia. The methods of fractal geometry have become part of the toolkit of fluid dynamics, hydrology, and meteorology. Its power comes from its unique ability to express a great deal of complicated, irregular data in a few simple… ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=1756))

- Fractal geometry is about spotting repeating patterns of this kind, analyzing them, quantifying them and manipulating them; it is a tool of both analysis and synthesis. The pattern can take many forms. It can be a concrete shape that repeats on successively smaller scales, as with the fern or cauliflower. It can be an abstract, statistical pattern—for instance, the probability that a particular square in a grid will be black or white, or that a point in space will be occupied by a star or by vacuum. The pattern can scale up, scale down, and get squeezed, twisted—or both. The way the pattern gets used can be strictly defined by a precise, deterministic rule; or it can be left entirely to chance.

Since I discovered it over two decades ago, it has become the topic of innumerable mathematical investigations. It has also been reproduced on millions of T-shirts, prints, book jackets, and PC screen savers. Readers seeking more precise explanations of it may consult my recent book, Mandelbrot 2004a. The Mandelbrot Set illustrates the profound connections between fractal geometry and chaos theory. ([Location 2059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2059))

As you zoom in on any portion of it, as if with a microscope, the pattern does not get simpler as you would normally expect. “Proper fractals” remain equally complicated at every level of magnification. But the Mandelbrot set’s complication increases without any bound.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It was a review of a book by an academic “character,” George Kingsley Zipf. Zipf, independently wealthy, was a university lecturer at Harvard in a self-invented field he called statistical human ecology. His book, Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort, saw power laws as an omnipresent pattern in the social sciences. Such power laws are common in physics, and are a form of what I now call fractal scaling. Seismologists have a mathematical formula that shows the number of earthquakes varying by a power law with their intensity, on the famous Richter scale. Put another way: Small quakes are common while big ones are rare, with a precise formula relating intensity to frequency. But at that time only a few examples were known—to very few persons. Zipf, an encyclopedist obsessed by an idée fixe, claimed that power laws do not occur only in physical sciences but are the rule in all manner of human behavior, organization, and anatomy—even in the size of sexual organs. Most fortunately, the book review my uncle gave me limited itself to one unusually elaborate example: word frequencies. In text or speech, some words such as “the” or “this” occur often; others, “milreis” or “momus,” appear rarely if ever (for the curious: the first is an old Portuguese coin, the second a synonym for critic). Here was Zipf’s game: Pick a text and count how many times each word appears in it. Then give each word a rank: 1 for the most common word, 2 for the second-most common word, and so on. Finally, graph the number of times each word appears against its rank. A surprising pattern emerges. The curve does not fall smoothly from most common to least common word. It plunges vertiginously at first, then declines more slowly—like the profile of a ski jumper leaping into space, to land and coast down the gentler slope below. That is a classic scaling pattern. Zipf, eyeballing his charts and fitting a curve to the data, devised a formula for it. I was spellbound. By the end of that long Metro ride, I had the topic for half of my doctoral thesis: I knew exactly how to expand on the math behind word frequencies in a way Zipf, no mathematician, could not. In subsequent months, what I found was surprising. By playing with the equation, you could build a powerful tool of social measurement. An improvement on Zipf’s formula could quantify the richness of someone’s vocabulary and give it a numerical grade: high grade, rich vocabulary; low grade, poor vocabulary. It could measure differences from text to text, from speaker to speaker. It could capture erudition in a number. Still, friends and advisers were aghast at my determination to pursue this strange avenue. Zipf was a crank, they told me. They showed me his book: dreadful. Counting words was not real math. I would never get a proper job, no easy professorship. But I was seeking no advisers. In fact, I wrote the thesis without one, and persuaded one of the university’s bureaucrats to rubberstamp it when it was completed.… ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2125))

- of social philosophy as practiced by Adam Smith into a data intensive field of scientific research and mathematical equations. His books look more like modern economics than most any other texts of that day: tables of statistics from across the world and ages, rows of integral signs and equations, intricate charts and graphs. One of Pareto’s equations achieved special prominence, and controversy. He was fascinated by the problems of power and wealth. How do people get it? How is it distributed around society? How do those who have it use it? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition, but Pareto resolved to measure it. He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries, through different countries: the tax records of Basel, Switzerland, from 1454 and from Augsburg, Germany, in 1471, 1498, and 1512; contemporary rental income from Paris; personal income from Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Ireland, Italy, Peru. What he found—or thought he found—was striking. When he plotted the data on graph paper, with income level on one axis and number of people with that income on the other, he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era. Society was not a “social pyramid” with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next. Instead, it was more of a “social arrow”—very fat at the bottom where the mass of men live, and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite.

- was this effect by chance; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve, as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly. It is a social law, he wrote: something “in the nature of man.” The income curve. This is Pareto’s 1909 diagram of how wealth is distributed through any human society, in any age or country. Rising income is on the vertical scale, population on the horizontal (latter-day economists have switched the coordinates). The number of people with income between levels m and p is represented by the shaded area. The mass of men fall to the broad bottom of the curve. The privileged few sit at the narrow top. While the bell curve is symmetric, the income curve is not. That something, though expressed in a neat equation, is harsh and Darwinian, in Pareto’s view. At the very bottom of the wealth curve, he wrote, men and women starve and children die young. In the broad middle of the curve all is turmoil and motion: people rising and falling, climbing by talent or luck and falling by alcoholism, tuberculosis, or other forms of unfitness. At the very narrow top sit the elite of the elite, who control wealth and power for a time—until they are unseated through revolution or upheaval by a new aristocratic class. There is no progress in human history. Democracy is a fraud. Human nature is primitive, emotional, unyielding. The smarter, abler, stronger, and shrewder take the lion’s share. The weak starve, lest society become degenerate: One can, Pareto wrote, “compare the social body to the human body, which will promptly perish if prevented from eliminating toxins.” Inflammatory stuff—and it burned Pareto’s reputation. At his death in 1923, Italian fascists were beatifying him, republicans demonizing him. British philosopher Karl Popper called him the “theoretician of totalitarianism.” By the time I heard of him, much of the fire had gone out of the debate. Most economists willingly adopted his seminal theories on other topics such as economic equilibrium. But they passed over in silence the distasteful matter of his income curve. To me—I did not even study economics until I was in my thirties—Pareto’s formula was a marvel. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2167))

- He grouped people by their incomes, counted how many were in each category, and then plotted the results. Now, it is a handy fact about data that scale according to a power law: On suitably chosen paper, they form an unmistakable pattern. Start with some engineering graph paper, of the kind that has logarithmic measures on each side; that is, instead of numbering the axis scales 1, 2, 3, or 4, call them 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 units, in powers of ten. On paper like this, scaling data will form a straight, sloping line; other data will not. You can try it yourself. Get a sheet (available on the Web, if you do not keep it handy), and plot the area of an assortment of square bathroom tiles. Call the horizontal axis the length of each tile, and the vertical axis the area. Then plot: a tile of length two inches has an area of four square inches, a tile of length three inches has an area of nine square inches, and so on. A straight line will emerge, climbing from left to right. How fast does it climb? Measure the slope. It rises two units for every one unit sideways. Slope: 2. Funny coincidence: Two is also the value of the exponent by which you raise the length to get the area. In… ([Location 2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2184))

- Of course, bathroom tiles, boxcars, and strings make for particularly silly power laws; other, more complex data may show steeper or shallower slopes on the paper. Regardless: If a power law is in play, some kind of straight line will appear. It is a simple test, childishly simple. Just draw, see, and measure. The diagram below shows some examples. The picture of an increasing power law. This is what a power law, such as Pareto investigated, looks like when plotted on log-log paper (with the axes measured off in powers of 10).

- rises as the cube (power = 3) of the side. And the length of a line rises in direct proportion (power = 1) with the length of the shorter lines laid end to end to form it. With fractal geometry, one can get an endless range of powers—that is, diagrams that slope more steeply or gently, or go down rather than up. A straight line is exactly what Pareto found, when he plotted income against the number of people. A power law was clearly present. In fact, his line sloped down instead of up, because the power was negative rather than positive. And alpha, Pareto’s name for the absolute slope of that line, was 3/2, he thought. What does that mean? Well, the gentler the slope, the more even the distribution of income. In the case of human vocabulary, Zipf thought it was governed by a power-law slope of 1: With so gentle a slope, the average person would use a few words very often but still have a fairly rich vocabulary overall. (Zipf happened to be paying undue attention to James Joyce’s Ulysses. Most books show a slope greater than 1—that is, they have a less rich vocabulary.) With a Pareto slope, or alpha of 3/2, much wealth is concentrated in very few hands. Look… ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2200))

And once more: What proportion earns more than $10.7 million, a thousand times the minimum? Answer: 0.003 percent—a very small number, indeed. Look at it another way, through the lens of what mathematicians call conditional probability. That is a fancy term for a straightforward concept: Given a starting condition, what is the probability that some event will happen? The absolute odds of being a billionaire are very low; but according to Pareto’s formula, the conditional probability of making a billion dollars once you have made half a billion is the same as that of making a million once you have made half a million. Money begets money, power makes power. Unfair, but true—both socially and mathematically. As it turned out, Pareto’s calculations were hobbled by the limitations of his data. His formula works only when looking at the very rich. He was also handicapped by his excessive hope of finding a universal law, for all countries and ages. Just as Zipf thought that for word frequencies alpha… ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2210))

- law relationship between income and population was insightful. At its core is the observation that, in a society, a very few people are outrageously rich, a small number are very rich, and the vast bulk of people are middling or poor. The alpha in Pareto’s formula is just a way of quantifying exactly how inequitable the society is. And it permits some interesting predictions. For instance, some economists have found Pareto’s formula a good way to describe incomes within individual professions—say, the pay scale in the electrical industry from executive suite to turbine room. From that, I developed a mathematical model of why people often specialize in one profession, rather than hop from trade to trade. The reason is common sense, but the mathematics support it. If they invest in their own profession—for instance, get a graduate degree—they will probably rise higher and faster up their own industry’s income curve. If they change fields or dabble in many, they will probably make less. That helps explain why, when a new multidisciplinary industry like e-business appears, salaries can shoot up: The new companies have to offer absurdly high compensation to induce people to take the risk and leave their own, specialized Pareto curve. In different guises, power laws like Pareto’s occur throughout economics. For example, data suggest that the size of firms in an industry scales. The bigger the company, the rarer it is, in a proportion that follows a Pareto-like formula. City sizes in a country scale, as well, from metropolis to village. Insurance claims make a particularly good and well-accepted example. In Sweden the damage claims for house fires are collected by an actuarial agency of the government. It was found that the odds of any particular size of claim vary much like income—except that in insurance, alpha for most houses is about ½. In a sense, that means fat insurance claims are relatively more common than fat millionaires. In Pareto’s case, just 0.003 percent of people had… ([Location 2220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2220))

- What distinguishes one family member from another is the relative importance of the largest individual measurements. Recall: If you add the heights of 1,000 people and calculate the average, adding a 1,001st person’s height will not change the average very much. With the blindfolded archer, by contrast, the 1,001st shot, if very wide of the mark, could totally change the average. The bell curve is egalitarian; every data point adds its value to the whole, but no one can dictate the statistical outcome to the rest. The Cauchy curve is inequitable and dictatorial; the big data points can and do dominate the crowd. These are two extremes, and Lévy linked them by a whole spectrum of other family members. All can be expressed by the same basic formula. Only the details—the parameters, in mathspeak—differ. If you fiddle with the parameters, you get curves that are squatter or taller, have more outliers or fewer, are shifted left or right as the median changes, and are symmetrical or skewed. The key parameter is alpha, the same variable as in Pareto’s and Zipf’s formulas. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2262))

- So, many seemingly unrelated ideas come together in one unifying concept. This sort of serendipity, to a mathematician, is better than winning the lottery on your birthday. Of course, Lévy’s interest in this topic was strictly theoretical; and his early discussions of stable distributions called them “exceptional.” He was merely picking up a thread of math that had begun with the practically minded Gauss, Poisson, and Cauchy and had been revived in “purified” form with George Pólya, Kolmogorov, and Lévy, himself. Lévy eschewed applications of any kind. When I began studying income it occurred to me that these math games might actually be useful: Alpha and all the other details of stable distribution theory might make handy tools for analyzing the real world. That proved to be the case, as I showed in several papers on the distribution of personal income. But it was initially difficult to get my work accepted—by either applied or theoretically minded scientists. The applied researchers found the math of L-stable distributions formidable, especially the way they do not behave “properly” with an easily defined variance. They recall the difficulty calculating the score of our blindfolded archer. Theoretical scientists were simply not interested. When I later told Lévy how I had developed his ideas and applied them to economics, he was flabbergasted and, perhaps, annoyed. In his view, “real” mathematicians simply did not do such prosaic things as study income ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2269))

One is a general way of looking at the world; the next a practical example of it in economics; and the last a set of mathematical considerations no one viewed as useful. How did they come together in the cotton mystery? The IBM computing center chewed through the thousands of cotton prices, as I had asked. It quickly confirmed Houthakker’s view: The price changes from one day to the next, one week or month or year to the next, did not behave as the Bachelier model assumed. The variance misbehaved. Each time I added an extra price-change to the data set, my estimate of the variance changed. It never settled down to one simple number—say, 1 percent volatility. Instead, it roamed erratically from about 0.4 percent to 3 percent, nearly a… ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2280))

- power law was at work—just as in Zipf’s word frequencies and Pareto’s income curve. The size of price changes varied in the same way. A great many small price movements are found in the same cotton market with a few enormous jumps; a great many rare words are in the dictionary with a small number of common words; vast legions of poor people coexist in the world with a privileged few plutocrats. Uneven. Unfair, perhaps. But still indisputable. That was part of my hypothesis. How to test it? Well, if I was right, then I should be able to find a particular value of alpha that governs the cotton price curve—just as Pareto thought he had found an alpha of 3/2 for income. So I followed Pareto’s lead and drew a diagram for cotton prices on log-log paper. Seeing the plots, at last, was satisfying. Every kind of cotton data that I considered formed a straight line. Together they form the “rows of cotton” diagram that follows. The fits to the line are not precise; in statistics, nothing is. But if you hold a ruler against the lines, you can measure the slope: It is -1.7. It is negative because the line falls, rather than climbs; by convention, the alpha would be… ([Location 2289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2289))

If the data form a straight line, then some kind of scaling is at work. That is what this somewhat complicated chart, from my 1963 paper analyzing a century of U.S. cotton prices, shows. For each of three sets of cotton data, I analyzed the positive and negative changes separately. The results are shown in these six rows of dotted lines. The horizontal scales show the size of the price changes; big ones are to the right.

- But the cotton diagram has a deeper story to tell. Time is the crucial dimension to consider. If you say the price per bale fell one dollar, what time-scale do you mean? With the income curve, time was irrelevant; Pareto had taken a snapshot of yearly incomes of a collection of individuals not ordered in any way. The cotton market is a movie, varying over time. Normally, we think about it from one celluloid frame to the next, from one trading day to another. But we could as easily edit it to view it only once every twenty frames (a month of trading days) or once every 250 frames (a year of trading days). Now, you would typically expect the movie to look different for each edit. But what if it looked the same? That was my idea: What the heck? I decided to check whether by any chance the movie looks roughly the same in all three cases. If it did, at each time-scale you should see the same proportion of big changes to small, the same fat tails, the same odds of another big change coming. To test this invariance, look back at the cotton chart. The different data sets shown are actually different ways of playing the movie. The ones labeled b+ and b– show the way… ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2306))

Having acquired an interest in financial markets after my move to New York, I started chatting with the Wall Street pros. There is something funny, one told me: In the newspaper, all price charts look alike. Sure, some go up; some down. But daily, monthly, annually—there is no big difference in the overall look of it. Strip off the dates and price markers, and you could not tell which was which. They were all equally wiggly. “Wiggly” is hardly a scientific term—and until I developed fractal geometry years later, there was no good way to quantify so vague a notion as wiggly. But that is exactly what we can now see in the cotton data: a fractal pattern. Here, the fractal scaling up and down is not being done to a shape—the florets of a broccoli or the triangles of a Sierpinski gasket. Rather, it is being applied to a different sort of pattern, the way prices vary. The very heart of finance is fractal. So it all comes full circle. It was no coincidence that Houthakker’s cotton chart looked like my income chart. The math was the same. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2317))

My initial paper on the subject started life early in 1962 as a messy draft that I dashed off, pecking with two fingers on a portable typewriter. But Houthakker, it happened, needed a last-minute replacement for a Harvard colleague who was going on sabbatical; he asked me to teach in his place. My draft, warts and all, was hastily published as an internal research report by IBM. The noise from academia was loud. Who was this Mandelbrot fellow, a grimy industrial scientist with a degree in applied mathematics, to challenge the elaborate models of the economics elite? But curiosity was strong and spreading. On a stopover at Chicago, I met economist Zvi Griliches (who later moved to Harvard). He was setting the program for a winter meeting in Pittsburgh of the Econometric Society. I was invited to speak, and a panel of three was assigned to lead a discussion on the cotton results. Then, while elsewhere at Harvard late in 1963, I got a call from across town at MIT’s Sloan School.

My luck turned with the Journal of Business at the University of Chicago—which, ironically, was to become home to the most ardent proponents of the standard financial model. An editor there, Merton Miller, later a Nobel laureate, took a few hours to check around, and then called back with a deal. My IBM paper, he said, was already well-known around his economics department. In fact, my ex-student Fama was on the faculty. Therefore they could skip the usual, time-consuming process of having a paper read, critiqued, and dissected by academic “referees.” I jumped at the offer.

Following a reprint of Fama’s introduction to my paper, Cootner included a five-page critique in his book. He felt my graph-paper test too simplistic, the math intractable, the evidence insufficient, and cotton too peculiar a commodity from which to draw sweeping conclusions. The implications were great, he wrote. But “surely, before consigning centuries of work to the ash pile, we should like to have some assurance that all our work is truly useless.” Assurance was not long in coming. My own research found scaling patterns in the shares of such nineteenth-century railroad Goliaths as the B&O, the Boston & Maine, and the Illinois Central. Fama and his students at Chicago found more evidence. In 1970, for instance, Richard Roll found U.S. Treasury bill yields scaled with a pattern more erratic than that of cotton prices. There were more. As Fama put it at one point, there “would seem to be conclusive evidence in… ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2346))

Through the late 1960s, many economists were infatuated with it. They spent months poring over the data, manipulating them on the new computers that were starting to appear across academia, and eagerly submitting research papers to the academic journals. But 1972 proved to be a key year. By then, a new wave was sweeping through finance. Markowitz portfolio theory, Sharpe asset-pricing, and the Bachelier market model were spreading; and the next year Black and Scholes published their influential options-pricing formulae. “Modern finance” was the official religion. My hypothesis contradicted it; and I was about as welcome in the established church of economics as a heretical Arian at the Council of Nicene. In 1972, a University of Chicago grad student, Robert R. Officer, crystallized many of the qualms of the economics establishment. His Ph.D. thesis found evidence both for—and against—strict scaling in the same set of data. Other seemingly contradictory reports appeared.

- risk, and shun it. Perhaps no great statistical analysis was needed at all: This fact of mass psychology, alone, might have been sufficient evidence to suggest there is something amiss with the standard financial models. Second, as will be seen in the next chapter, data that scale can produce surprising patterns—patterns that, if you glance at them, you would swear are periodic, predictable, and bankable. Anyone studying the cotton price records could easily imagine he was seeing “corrections,” “resistance levels,” and the other signals that a technical analyst seeks to buy, sell, or hold. It is fool’s gold. Lastly, the cotton story shows the strange liaison among different branches of the economy, and between economics and nature. That cotton prices should vary the way income does; that income variations should look like Swedish fire-insurance claims; that these, in turn, are in the same mathematical family as formulae describing the way we speak, or how earthquakes happen—this is, truly, the greatest mystery of all. Let us mull the promises that science makes to society to win its support. The grand promise is to endeavor solving the great mysteries—to the list of which I have added one. But there is also a more practical promise. It consists in helping society to improve, to prevent it from acting on the basis of theories that sound nice but are not true to the facts, and to help it act on the basis of facts—even if those facts have yet to find a theory that fully explains them.

- IN 1906, a young Englishman named Harold Edwin Hurst arrived in Cairo. It was to have been a short stay. But it lasted sixty-two years and ended with his solving one of the great mysteries of the pharaohs—and, inadvertently, providing a clue to the way financial markets work. Hurst’s problem concerned the Nile floods. The great river’s waters, wrote Greek traveler-historian Herodotus about 450 B.C., start rising at the summer solstice, mount to a crest over the next one hundred days, and carry such rich soil downriver that “the people get their harvests with less labor than anyone else in the world.” What caused the floods? The oldest legends had the Nile flowing from the full breasts of the goddess Hapi. The priests said it fell from the heavenly cataracts of the Celestial Nile. Some said northerly winds blowing in from the Mediterranean backed the river up. Others said the floods came from melting snows far to the south—a yarn Herodotus dismissed; surely no snow could fall in a southern heat so intense it even burned the people black, he reasoned. “About why the Nile ([Location 2436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2436))

- behaves precisely as it does I could get no information from the priests or anyone else.” More directly important than why the Nile flooded, however, was how much it flooded from one year to the next. Sometimes the floods ran high, sometimes low. Prosperity or poverty hung upon the outcome. Recall the Bible story of the seven fat years and seven lean years, foretold from Pharaoh’s dream by Joseph, son of Jacob. By Hurst’s day, when the land of Egypt had passed to British rule, the problem was no less pressing. The population in the Nile Valley was swelling; Manchester mills wanted Egypt’s cotton; and the river’s dams were unequal to the task of managing so vast and precious a resource. Hurst, who rose to become chief scientist of the public-works ministry, was charged with devising what was called “century storage” to stockpile water against the worst possible droughts. It was a daunting task. He observed: “There has been a great deal of investigation as to trying to forecast the flood; nothing of any practical use has come out of it, so you don’t even know one year what the next year’s flood will be like.” But he did find a formula for the floods—and his work earned him the respectful nickname,… ([Location 2443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2443))

- 1960s, I discovered the same “Nile pattern” in many other contexts—oddest of all, in how a stock price fluctuates. The Nile pattern is a crucial part of fractal geometry. Other researchers, broadening my work in recent years, have found it in international crude oil prices, London gold fixings, and the deregulated U.S. electricity market. Indeed, the Nile pattern provides the second major link in my theory of how financial markets work—a necessary complement to the first one about scaling laws and “fat tails” of the last chapter. Adding a third link in a later chapter, a comprehensive market model results. Good scientists are often circumspect in their formal, academic journal utterances. The most famous understatement in science may be Watson and Crick’s one-sentence observation, in their original 1953 Nature report on the structure of DNA, that “it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” Hurst was similarly cautious in… ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2454))

- But also wrong. In fact, the dam should be higher than that, Hurst concluded. He found the range from highest Nile flood to lowest widened faster than the coin-tossing rule predicted. The highs were higher; the lows, lower. But the problem was not the individual floods; looked at singly, the bell curve fit the data on each year’s flooding reasonably well. Apparently, it was the runs of weather—the back-to-back floods or droughts—that were changing the game. It seems obvious, now: Not just the size of the floods, but also their precise sequence, matters. Hurst, studying the flood records, devised his own formula to capture this effect. To do so, he began with the Nile, then looked far beyond, without any preconceptions. He gathered records of discharges from Lake Huron and the Truckee River near Lake Tahoe. He looked at the annual ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2502))

- water levels in Sweden’s Dalalven Lake; rainfall measurements from Adelaide, Australia, to Washington, D.C.; the thickness of lakebed sediments in Russia, Norway, and Canada; temperature readings from St. Louis to Helsinki; the pattern of tree rings in Flagstaff pines and Sequoia—even sunspot numbers. He looked through any reliable, long-running records he could find that were in any way related to climate, for a total of fifty-one different phenomena, 5,915 yearly measurements. In almost all cases, when he plotted the number of years measured against the high-to-low range of each record, he found the range widened too quickly—just like the Nile. In fact, he found as he looked around the world, it all fit the same neat formula: The range widened, not by a square-root law as in coin-tossing, but as a three-fourths-power (0.73, to be precise.) A strange number; but it was, Hurst asserted, a fundamental fact of nature. Hydrologists were skeptical. From 1951 to 1956—Hurst was then in his seventies—he published three lengthy essays reporting his findings. Each one was accompanied by a flurry of printed comments from supporters and detractors. Some praised him, finding more records to support his case. Others accused him of statistical voodoo. One, a Mr. F. A. Sharman, senior civil engineer at Sir William Halcrow & Partners, sarcastically observed that anyone who claimed to find a common thread from tree rings to sun spots to mud layers must have taken “a sensational step ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2508))

- A wide range. How high should you make a dam? That was the problem that the hydrologist H.E. Hurst was grappling with in his studies of the Nile, when he stumbled upon a powerful new method of measuring the strength of long-range dependence in a series of measurements. Hurst was trying to characterize the total flow of water past the Rhoda Gauge, minus the historical average over many centuries.

- Hurst found a better way, which he published in 1951 and 1955: For time intervals of varying length and starting point, he began by adjusting the data to remove the trend during that interval. Only then did he compute the range. Statisticians would have expected the “detrended” range to increase as the square root of the length of the time interval, as it does in Brownian motion. In fact, Hurst found the range grew faster than that. This striking anomaly made no sense to statisticians. But Hurst defended it doggedly. It might have been buried forever, but sheer luck made me interpret it as a symptom of scaling—that is, of fractality. For this homeless truth I created a proper home in the concept of long dependence, and extended it to the study of financial prices. In financial terms, the diagram above can be read as a price chart. The interval under study runs from time t to t + δ, or t + delta. The removed trend is marked by a dashed line. And the gap between the highest and lowest deviations from the trend defines what I called the “bridge” range in Mandelbrot 2002. Maybe, but the formula works. For instance, suppose you want to keep New York in steady water supply for a century: How big should you make the… ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2524))

- you would need reservoirs deep enough to store up to 16.7 times the standard deviation: 105 inches, or two and a half years’ supply. Other hydrologists on other rivers have since confirmed his basic findings. His own calculations showed the Nile could be tamed by a series of moderate-sized, interdependent reservoirs far upriver from Egypt. But by the time construction was commissioned in the 1950s, the newly independent government of Gamal Abdel Nasser preferred a… ([Location 2534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2534))

- It is a long way from the Nile to the Charles River; but I first heard of Hurst’s work in 1963 when I was teaching economics at Harvard. My newly published cotton studies were just starting to stir attention. One day, after a lecture on the subject, a man approached me; I wish, today, that I could remember who he was, to thank him. “You know,” he said, referring to my price-scaling theory, “you have a power law here. But I’ve heard that a power law was also found by a hydrologist. He… ([Location 2540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2540))

- Rushing to conclusions, I first thought it had to be the same thing. Scaling and power laws were appearing in so many other phenomena, why not in hydrological cycles, too? Following this particular lead should be easy. A few hundred yards from my lecture hall were the offices of the Harvard Water Resources Center, and a leading hydrologist, Professor Harold A. Thomas Jr. An improbable site, ivy-clad Harvard, for a gritty school of dam-building. But Thomas quickly told me about Hurst’s observations. I thought I had it figured out in a flash. Hurst’s law, that the range from high to low flood levels widened by the three-quarters-power of the standard deviation, sounded like a mere variant of my cotton formula. The big floods, I reckoned, were like big price jumps; the disastrous droughts were market crashes. But great theories are often humbled by mere facts. It was not that simple. Looking up Hurst’s papers revealed that his point had not been the size of the variations, but the precise sequence of them. If jumbled up and taken out of their original sequence, his data yielded nothing special at all: a boring bell curve. Now I was hooked. When studying cotton, there had been obvious correlations… ([Location 2544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDBEO&location=2544))
