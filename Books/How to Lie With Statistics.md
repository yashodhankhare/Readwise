## Highlights
- As Henry G. Felsen, a humorist and no medical authority, pointed out quite a while ago, proper treatment will cure a cold in seven days, but left to itself a cold will hang on for a week. ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=66))

- The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=69))

- Like the “little dash of powder, little pot of paint,” statistics are making many an important fact “look like what she ain’t.” A well-wrapped statistic is better than Hitler’s “big lie” it misleads, yet it cannot be pinned on you.

- This is the sampling procedure, which is the heart of the greater part of the statistics you meet on all sorts of subjects. Its basis is simple enough, although its refinements in practice have led into all sorts of by-ways, some less than respectable. If you have a barrel of beans, some red and some white, there is only one way to find out exactly how many of each color you have: Count ’em. However, you can find out approximately how many are red in much easier fashion by pulling out a handful of beans and counting just those, figuring that the proportion will be the same all through the barrel. If your sample is large enough and selected properly, it will represent the whole well enough for most purposes. If it is not, it may be far less accurate than an intelligent guess and have nothing to recommend it but a spurious air of scientific precision. It is sad truth that conclusions from such samples, biased or too small or both, lie behind much of what we read or think we know.

- It becomes pretty clear that the sample has omitted two groups most likely to depress the average. The $25,111 figure is beginning to explain itself. If it is a true figure for anything it is one merely for that special group of the class of ’24 whose addresses are known and who are willing to stand up and tell how much they earn. Even that requires an assumption that the gentlemen are telling the truth. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=122))

- A river cannot, we are told, rise above its source. Well, it can seem to if there is a pumping station concealed somewhere about. It is equally true that the result of a sampling study is no better than the sample it is based on. By the time the data have been filtered through layers of statistical manipulation and reduced to a decimal-pointed average, the result begins to take on an aura of conviction that a closer look at the sampling would deny. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=141))

- To be worth much, a report based on sampling must use a representative sample, which is one from which every source of bias has been removed. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=149))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Give that kind of second look to the things you read, and you can avoid learning a whole lot of things that are not so. It is worth keeping in mind also that the dependability of a sample can be destroyed just as easily by invisible sources of bias as by these visible ones. That is, even if you can’t find a source of demonstrable bias, allow yourself some degree of skepticism about the results as long as there is a possibility of bias somewhere. There always is. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=155))

- The basic sample is the kind called “random.” It is selected by pure chance from the “universe,” a word by which the statistician means the whole of which the sample is a part. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=165))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The test of the random sample is this: Does every name or thing in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample? The purely random sample is the only kind that can be examined with entire confidence by means of statistical theory, but there is one thing wrong with it. It is so difficult and expensive to obtain for many uses that sheer cost eliminates it. A more economical substitute, which is almost universally used in such fields as opinion polling and market research, is called stratified random sampling.

- The operation of a poll comes down in the end to a running battle against sources of bias, and this battle is conducted all the time by all the reputable polling organizations. What the reader of the reports must remember is that the battle is never won. No conclusion that “sixty-seven percent of the American people are against” something or other should be read without the lingering question, Sixty-seven percent of which American people? ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=185))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Actually, as we have seen, it is not necessary that a poll be rigged—that is, that the results be deliberately twisted in order to create a false impression. The tendency of the sample to be biased in this consistent direction can rig it automatically. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=218))

- When you are told that something is an average you still don’t know very much about it unless you can find out which of the common kinds of average it is—mean, median, or mode. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=235))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In this case, as usually is true with income figures, an unqualified “average” is virtually meaningless. One factor that adds to the confusion is that with some kinds of information all the averages fall so close together that, for casual purposes, it may not be vital to distinguish among them. If you read that the average height of the men of some group of people is only five feet, you get a fairly good idea of the stature of these people. You don’t have to ask whether that average is a mean, median, or mode; it would come out about the same. (Of course, if you are in the business of manufacturing overalls for these men you would want more information than can be found in any average. This has to do with ranges and deviations, and we’ll tackle that one in the next chapter.) ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=240))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Consequently one kind of average is as good as another for describing the heights of men, but for describing their pocketbooks it is not. If you should list the annual incomes of all the families in a given city you might find that they ranged from not much to perhaps $50,000 or so, and you might find a few very large ones. More than ninety-five percent of the incomes would be under $10,000, putting them way over toward the left-hand side of the curve. Instead of being symmetrical, like a bell, it would be skewed. Its shape would be a little like that of a child’s slide, the ladder rising sharply to a peak, the working part sloping gradually down. The mean would be quite a distance from the median. You can see what this ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=249))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- would do to the validity of any comparison made between the “average” (mean) of one year and the “average” (median) of another. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=254))

- So when you see an average-pay figure, first ask: Average of what? Who’s included? ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=289))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You may have read in the paper that the income of the average American family was $3,100 in 1949. You should not try to make too much out of that figure unless you also know what “family” has been used to mean, as well as what kind of average this is. (And who says so and how he knows and how accurate the figure is.) ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=293))

- The principal joker in this one is the inadequate sample—statistically inadequate, that is; for Doakes’ purpose it is just right. That test group of users, you discover by reading the small type, consisted of just a dozen persons. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=317))

- The importance of using a small group is this: With a large group any difference produced by chance is likely to be a small one and unworthy of big type. A two-peracent-improvement claim is not going to sell much tooth-paste. How results that are not indicative of anything can be produced by pure chance—given a small enough number of cases—is something you can test for yourself at small cost. Just start tossing a penny. How often will it come up heads? Half the time, of course. Everyone knows that. Well, let’s check that and see…. I have just tried ten tosses and got heads eight times, which proves that pennies come up heads eighty percent of the time. Well, by tooth paste statistics they do. Now try it yourself. You may get a fifty-fifty result, but probably you won’t; your result, like mine, stands a good chance of being quite a ways away from fifty-fifty. But if your patience holds out for a thousand tosses you are almost (though not quite) certain to come out with a result very close to half heads—a result, that is, which represents the real probability. Only when there is a ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=329))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There’s another kind of little figure that is not there, one whose absence can be just as damaging. It is the one that tells the range of things or their deviation from the average that is given. Often an average—whether mean or median, specified or unspecified—is such an oversimplification that it is worse than useless. Knowing nothing about a subject is frequently healthier than knowing what is not so, and a little learning may be a dangerous thing.

- Just to clear the air, let’s note first of all that whatever an intelligence test measures it is not quite the same thing as we usually mean by intelligence. It neglects such important things as leadership and creative imagination. It takes no account of social judgment or musical or artistic or other aptitudes, to say nothing of such personality matters as diligence and emotional balance. On top of that, the tests most often given in schools are the quick-and-cheap group kind that depend a good deal upon reading facility; bright or not, the poor reader hasn’t a chance.

- Peter and Linda have been given what is generally regarded as the best of the tests, the Revised Stanford-Binet, which is administered individually and doesn’t call for any particular reading ability. Now what an IQ test purports to be is a sampling of the intellect. Like any other product of the sampling method, the IQ is a figure with a statistical error, which expresses the precision or reliability of that figure. Asking these test questions is something like what you might do in estimating the quality of the corn in a field by going about and pulling off an ear here and an ear there at random. By the time you had stripped down and looked at a hundred ears, say, you would have gained a pretty good idea of what the whole field was like. Your information would be exact enough for use in comparing this field with another field—provided the two fields were not very similar. If they were, you might have to look at many more ears, rating them all the while by some precise standard of quality. How… ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=457))

- The first thing you might do is check the accuracy of your measuring system by pacing off what you took to be a hundred yards, doing this a number of times. You might find that on the average you were off by three yards. That is, you came within three yards of hitting the exact one hundred in half… ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=466))

- Your probable error then would be three yards in one hundred, or three percent. From then on, each fence line that measured one hundred yards by your pacing might be recorded as 100 ± 3 yards. (Most statisticians now prefer to use another, but comparable, measurement called the standard error. It takes in about two-thirds of the cases instead of exactly half and is considerably handier in a mathematical way. For our purposes we can stick to the probable error, which is the one still used in connection with the Stanford-Binet.) As with our… ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=469))

- test is basically, only with how consistently it measures whatever it measures. So Peter’s indicated IQ might be more fully expressed as 98 ± 3 and Linda’s as 101 ± 3. This says that there is no more than an even chance that Peter’s IQ falls anywhere between 95 and 101; it is just as likely that it is above or below that figure. Similarly Linda’s has no better than a fifty-fifty probability of being within the range of 98 to 104. From this you can quickly see that there is one chance in four that Peter’s IQ is really above 101 and a similar chance that Linda’s is below 98. Then Peter is not inferior but superior, and by a margin of anywhere from three points up. What this comes down to is that the only way to think about IQs and many other sampling results is in ranges. “Normal” is not 100, but the range of 90 to 110, say, and there would be some point in comparing a child in this range with a child in a lower or higher range. But comparisons between figures with small differences are meaningless. You must always keep that… ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=474))

Now that you have practiced to deceive, why stop with truncating? You have a further trick available that’s worth a dozen of that. It will make your modest rise of ten percent look livelier than one hundred percent is entitled to look. Simply change the proportion between the ordinate and the abscissa. There’s no rule against it, and it does give your graph a prettier shape. All you have to do is let each mark up the side stand for only one-tenth as many dollars as before.

- A chart on which a little man represents a million men, a moneybag or stack of coins a thousand or a billion dollars, or an outline of a steer your beef supply for next year is a pictorial graph. It is a useful device. It has what I am afraid is known as eye-appeal. And it is capable of becoming a fluent, devious, and successful liar. The daddy of the pictorial chart, or pictograph, is the ordinary bar chart, a simple and popular method ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=555))

Look with suspicion on any version in which the bars change their widths as well as their lengths while representing a single factor or in which they picture three-dimensional objects the volumes of which are not easy to compare. A truncated bar chart has, and deserves, exactly the same reputation as the truncated line graph we have been talking about. The habitat of the bar chart is the geography book, the corporation statement, and the news magazine. This is true also of its eye-appealing offspring.

In the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind, hardly anybody will notice the difference. The semiattached figure is a device guaranteed to stand you in good stead. It always has. You can’t prove that your nostrum cures colds, but you can publish (in large type) a sworn laboratory report that half an ounce of the stuff killed 31,108 germs in a test tube in eleven seconds. While you are about it, make sure that the laboratory is reputable or has an impressive name. Reproduce the report in full.

It is not up to you—is it?—to point out that an antiseptic that works well in a test tube may not perform in the human throat, especially after it has been diluted according to instructions to keep it from burning throat tissue. Don’t confuse the issue by telling what kind of germ you killed. Who knows what germ causes colds, particularly since it probably isn’t a germ at all? In fact, there is no known connection between assorted germs in a test tube and the whatever-it-is that produces colds, but people aren’t going to reason that sharply, especially while sniffling. Maybe that one is too obvious, and people are beginning to catch on, although it would not appear so from the advertising pages. Anyway, here is a trickier version. Let us say that during a period in which race prejudice is growing you are employed to “prove” otherwise. It is not a difficult assignment.

- a trend to report. Princeton’s Office of Public Opinion Research tested this question once. What turned up is interesting evidence that things, especially in opinion polls, are not always what they seem. Each person who was asked the question about jobs was also asked some questions designed to discover if he was strongly prejudiced against blacks. It turned out that people most strongly prejudiced were most likely to answer Yes to the question about job opportunities. (It worked out that about two-thirds of those who were sympathetic toward blacks did not think the black had as good a chance at a job as a white person did, and about two-thirds of those showing prejudice said that blacks were getting as good breaks as whites.) It was pretty evident that from this poll you would learn very little about employment conditions for blacks, although you might learn some interesting things about a man’s racial attitudes. You can see, then, that if prejudice is mounting during your polling period you will get an increasing number of answers to the effect that blacks have as good a chance at jobs as whites. So you announce your results: Your poll shows that blacks are getting a fairer shake all the time. You have achieved something remarkable by careful use of a semiattached figure. The worse things get, the better your poll makes them look. Or take this one: “27 percent of a large sample of eminent physicians smoke Throaties—more than any other brand.” The figure itself may be phony, of course, in any of several ways, but that really doesn’t make any difference.

Twenty-six percent more than what? When it was finally pinned down it was found to mean only that this juicer got out that much more juice than an old-fashioned hand reamer could. It had absolutely nothing to do with the data you would want before purchasing; this juicer might be the poorest on the market. Besides being suspiciously precise, that twenty-six percent figure is totally irrelevant. Advertisers aren’t the only people who will fool you with numbers if you let them.

That sounds like a good argument for staying off trains, perhaps for sticking to your automobile instead. But when you investigate to find what the figure is all about, you learn it means something quite different. Nearly half those victims were people whose automobiles collided with trains at crossings. The greater part of the rest were riding the rods. Only 132 out of the 4,712 were passengers on trains. And even that figure is worth little for purposes of comparison unless it is attached to information on total passenger miles. If you are worried about your chances of being killed on a coast-to-coast trip, you won’t get much relevant information by asking whether trains, planes, or cars killed the greatest number of people last year. Get the rate, by inquiring into the number of fatalities for each million passenger miles.

Unless the union is a band of angels with an archangel at their head you can ask and record with perfect honesty and come out with proof that the greater part of the men do have some complaint or other. You issue your information as a report that “a vast majority—78 percent—are opposed to the union.” What you have done is to add up a bunch of undifferentiated complaints and tiny gripes and then call them something else that sounds like the same thing. You haven’t proved a thing, but it rather sounds as if you have, doesn’t it? It is fair enough, though, in a way.

- The catch is that annual return on investment is not the same kettle of fish as earnings on total sales. As another reader replied in a later issue of Harper’s, “If I purchase an article every morning for 99 cents and sell it each afternoon for one dollar, I will make only 1 percent on total sales, but 365 percent on invested money during the year.” There are often many ways of expressing any figure. You can, for instance, express exactly the same fact by calling it a one percent return on sales, a fifteen percent return on investment, a ten-million-dollar profit, an increase in profits of forty percent (compared with 1935–39 average), or a decrease of sixty percent from last year. The method is to choose the one that sounds best for the purpose at hand and trust that few who read it will recognize how imperfectly it reflects the situation.

- SOMEBODY once went to a good deal of trouble to find out if cigarette smokers make lower college grades than nonsmokers. It turned out that they did. This pleased a good many people and they have been making much of it ever since. The road to good grades, it would appear, lies in giving up smoking; and, to carry the conclusion one reasonable step further, smoking makes dull minds. This particular study was, I believe, properly done: sample big enough and honestly and carefully chosen, correlation having a high significance, and so on. The fallacy is an ancient one that, however, has a powerful tendency to crop up in statistical material, where it is disguised by a welter of impressive figures. It is the one that says that if B follows A, then A has caused B. An unwarranted assumption is being made that since smoking and low grades go together, smoking causes low grades. Couldn’t it just as well be the other way around? Perhaps low marks drive students not to drink but to tobacco. When it comes right down to it, this conclusion is about as likely as the other and just as well supported by the evidence. But it is not nearly so satisfactory to propagandists.

- It seems a good deal more probable, however, that neither of these things has produced the other, but both are a product of some third factor. Can it be that the sociable sort of fellow who takes his books less than seriously is also likely to smoke more? Or is there a clue in the fact that somebody once established a correlation between extroversion and low grades—a closer relationship apparently than the one between grades and intelligence? Maybe extroverts smoke more than introverts. The point is that when there are many reasonable explanations you are hardly entitled to pick one that suits your taste and insist on it. But many people do. To avoid falling for the post hoc fallacy and thus wind up believing many things that are not so, you need to put any statement of relationship through a sharp inspection. The correlation, that convincingly precise figure that seems to prove that something is because of something, can actually be any of several types. One is the correlation produced by chance. You may be able to get together a set of figures to prove some unlikely thing in this way, but if you try again, your next set may not prove it at all. As with the manufacturer of the tooth-paste that appeared to reduce decay, you simply throw away the results you don’t want and publish widely those you do.… ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=751))

- from time to time or indeed both may be cause and effect at the same time. A correlation between income and ownership of stocks might be of that kind. The more money you make, the more stock you buy, and the more stock you buy, the more income you get; it is not accurate to say simply that one has produced the other. Perhaps the trickiest of them all is the very common instance in which neither of the variables has any effect at all on the other, yet there is a real correlation. A good deal of dirty work has been done with this one. The poor grades among cigarette smokers is in this category, as are all too many medical statistics that are quoted without the qualification that although the relationship has been shown to be real, the cause-and-effect nature of it is only a matter of speculation. As an instance of the nonsense or spurious correlation that is a real statistical fact, someone has gleefully pointed to this: There is a close relationship between the salaries of Presbyterian ministers in… ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=763))

These physical relationships often have the kindness to produce perfect correlations, but figures from business or sociology or medicine seldom work out so neatly. Even if education generally increases incomes it may easily turn out to be the financial ruination of Joe over there. Keep in mind that a correlation may be real and based on real cause and effect—and still be almost worthless in determining action in any single case.

- Permitting statistical treatment and the hypnotic presence of numbers and decimal points to befog causal relationships is little better than superstition. And it is often more seriously misleading. It is rather like the conviction among the people of the New Hebrides that body lice produce good health. Observation over the centuries had taught them that people in good health usually had lice and sick people very often did not. The observation itself was accurate and sound, as observations made informally over the years surprisingly often are. Not so much can be said for the conclusion to which these primitive people came from their evidence: Lice make a man healthy. Everybody should have them.

- As we have already noted, scantier evidence than this—treated in the statistical mill until common sense could no longer penetrate to it—has made many a medical fortune and many a medical article in magazines, including professional ones. More sophisticated observers finally got things straightened out in the New Hebrides. As it turned out, almost everybody in those circles had lice most of the time. It was, you might say, the normal condition of man. When, however, anyone took a fever (quite possibly carried to him by those same lice) and his body became too hot for comfortable habitation, the lice left. There you have cause and effect altogether confusingly distorted, reversed, and intermingled. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=846))

- might seem to imply that all such operations are the product of intent to deceive. The president of a chapter of the American Statistical Association once called me down for that. Not chicanery much of the time, said he, but incompetence. There may be something in what he says,* but I am not certain that one assumption will be less offensive to statisticians than the other. Possibly more important to keep in mind is that the distortion of statistical data and its manipulation to an end are not always the work of professional statisticians. What comes full of virtue from the statistician’s desk may find itself twisted, exaggerated, oversimplified, and distorted-through-selection by salesman, public-relations expert, journalist, or advertising copywriter. But whoever the guilty party may be in any instance, it is hard to grant him the status of blundering innocent. False charts in magazines and newspapers frequently sensationalize by exaggeration, rarely minimize anything. Those who present statistical arguments on behalf of industry are seldom found, in my experience, giving labor or the customer a better break than the facts call for, and often they give him a worse one. When has a union employed a statistical worker so incompetent that he made labor’s case out weaker than it was?

- The Columbus Dispatch declared that a manufactured product was selling at a profit of 3,800 percent, basing this on a cost of $1.75 and a selling price of $40. In calculating percentage of profits you have a choice of methods (and you are obligated to indicate which you are using). If figured on cost, this one comes to a profit of 2,185 percent; on selling price, 95.6 percent. The Dispatch apparently used a method of its own and, as so often seems to happen, got an exaggerated figure to report.

- The wide, blue yonder lie also turns up during every strike. Every time there is a strike, the Chamber of Commerce advertises that the strike is costing so many millions of dollars a day. They get the figure by adding up all the cars that would have been made if the strikers had worked full time. They add in losses to suppliers in the same way. Everything possible is added in, including street car fares and the loss to merchants in sales. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=953))

- The similar and equally odd notion that percentages can be added together as freely as apples has been used against authors. See how convincing this one, from The New York Times Book Review, sounds.   The gap between advancing book prices and authors’ earnings, it appears, is due to substantially higher production and material costs. Item: plant and manufacturing expenses alone have risen as much as 10 to 12 percent over the last decade, materials are up 6 to 9 percent, selling and advertising expenses have climbed upwards of 10 percent. Combined boosts add up to a minimum of 33 percent (for one company) and to nearly 40 percent for some of the smaller houses.   Actually, if each item making up the cost of publishing this book has risen around ten percent, the total cost must have climbed by about that proportion also. The logic that permits adding those percentage rises together could lead to all sorts of flights of fancy. Buy twenty things today and find that each has gone up five percent over last year. That “adds up” to one hundred percent, and the cost of living has doubled. Nonsense. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00351DSX2&location=957))

- To take the simplest possible example, let’s say that milk cost twenty cents a quart last year and bread was a nickel a loaf. This year milk is down to a dime and bread has gone up to a dime.

- Consider last year as the base period, making the prices of that time 100 percent. Since the price of milk has since dropped to half (50 percent) and the price of bread has doubled (200 percent) and the average of 50 and 200 is 125, prices have gone up 25 percent.

- Try it again, taking this year as base period. Milk used to cost 200 percent as much as it does now and bread was selling for 50 percent as much. Average: 125 percent. Prices used to be 25 percent higher than they are now. To prove that the cost level hasn’t changed at all we simply switch to the geometric average and use either period as the base. This is a little different from the arithmetic average, or mean, that we have been using but it is a perfectly legitimate kind of figure and in some cases the most useful and revealing. To get the geometric average of three numbers you multiply them together and derive the cube root. For four items, the fourth root; for two, the square root. Like that.
