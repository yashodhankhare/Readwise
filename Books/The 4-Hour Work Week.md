## Highlights
- Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.” ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=691))

- What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do.

Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.” ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006X0M2TS&location=1211))
