## Highlights
- Category kings are not a recent phenomenon. Before the 1920s, there existed no such category as “frozen foods.” Clarence Birdseye—yep, that was actually his name—created it. Like many category creators through the ages, Birdseye was an outsider. Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1886, he spent a lot of time on his family’s farm on Long Island and developed a passion for taxidermy (not a hobby many kids have these days). That led him to a job as a naturalist for the U.S. government, which eventually took him to Labrador, in Canada’s northeastern corner. Birdseye watched the Inuit people catch fish and toss them on the ice, where the fish flash-froze, retaining their flavor and texture.

- When Birdseye returned to the United States, he experimented by flash-freezing fish between cakes of dry ice, and then realized the process also worked for vegetables. He started a company—at first called General Seafoods—to make and sell this new category of product. As he built his company, Birdseye realized he had to design and build the category itself, because before Birdseye, there was no ecosystem that would get frozen food from a factory to consumers, and no demand for frozen food because consumers didn’t even know they might want it. He developed freezer cars for railroads and sold rail operators on the idea. He developed freezer cases for grocers and convinced them that frozen food would increase sales. He even convinced DuPont to invent cellophane. And he ran ads that positioned frozen vegetables as something different from canned vegetables. One early Life magazine ad—by then under the Birds Eye brand—showed a woman in pearls lounging on a pillow eating Birds Eye spinach, implying that only commoners put up with canned spinach. Frozen food was not just better than canned food—it was different from canned food. Birdseye’s work took a couple of decades to pay off, but it takes time to build and dominate categories—and it took a lot more time then than it does now. Of course, ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=331))

- almost a century later, Birds Eye is still a huge brand in frozen foods.1 Clarence Birdseye has more in common than you might think with the founders of Uber. Uber is a category king of recent vintage. Not very long ago, we all lived with an age-old problem: in most cities, taxi service sucked. If you walked out to a given street corner, you had no idea if a taxi might happen by in a few minutes or, well, never. Yet there didn’t seem to be an alternative way to get an instant car ride, so people didn’t seek one out. We had an old, ongoing problem, but we didn’t really know it was a problem that could be solved in a new way. On a snowy night in Paris in 2008, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, in the city for a European tech conference, stood roadside getting wetter and colder as they tried in vain to hail a cab. Kalanick and Camp were, separately, already reasonably successful tech entrepreneurs. Kalanick had started an online content-delivery company, Red Swoosh, which got bought by Akamai Technologies for 20 million. Camp had done better, founding StumbleUpon—a… ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=341))

- than a year earlier, changing the way we think about mobile technology and services. Why, Kalanick and Camp wondered, couldn’t you pull out your smartphone, push a button, and get picked up by a car? Back home in San Francisco, the pair experienced the problem anew. Hailing a cab in that town was like trying to get a bartender’s attention in a jam-packed nightclub. So Kalanick and Camp went to work on their idea, and launched their service in the summer of 2010 in San Francisco. As millions of users now know, a customer’s iPhone app would, at the push of a button, send a dispatch to drivers, showing the customer’s location. Drivers—not taxis, but moonlighters driving their own cars—would have their own version of the app on a phone, allowing them to see dispatches and respond. The system would store customers’ credit card information, so paying for the ride could be easy and safe for everyone involved. Kalanick and Camp originally called this service Uber-Cab, and later dropped the second part. Half a year later, investors were lining up to give Uber money. Benchmark Capital put… ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=353))

- this through the way it designed the company and its service. It did this through its messaging to the public. And it did this through confrontation. Every time the taxi industry tried to stop Uber, the scuffle made people more aware of Uber. In London, taxi drivers protested Uber by going on strike. When riders couldn’t get cabs, they signed up for Uber at a rate eight times higher than before the strike. As Uber was developing its service and its company, it was defining this new category of problem and inserting it into our brains. Within a couple of years, Kalanick, by then Uber’s CEO and public face, understood that he could frame an even larger problem that Uber could solve. All of personal transportation was too expensive and too messy, particularly in cities. Plus, too many cars lead to traffic jams and pollution. Those were big problems that never had a good solution. But what if, Kalanick asked all of us, fewer cars could serve more people? What if his service could get so big, reliable, and cheap that in many places using Uber could become more desirable than owning a car? He… ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=364))

- The most exciting companies create. They give us new ways of living, thinking, or doing business, many times solving a problem we didn’t know we had—or a problem we didn’t pay attention to because we never thought there was another way. Before Uber, we hailed a cab by standing perilously close to traffic with an arm in the air. After Uber, that just seemed dumb. These companies don’t only invent something to sell us. They are not making products or services that just incrementally improve on whatever came before. They don’t sell us better. The most exciting companies sell us different. They introduce the world to a new category of product or service—like Clarence Birdseye’s frozen food, or Uber’s on-demand transportation. They replace our current point of view on the world with a new point of view. They make what came before seem outdated, clunky, inefficient, costly, or painful. We hear a lot about “disruption.” It’s a holy word in the tech industry, like maybe you should genuflect when someone says it. But disruption is a by-product, not a goal. Legendary companies create new categories that generate a gravitational pull on the market. Customers rush to a new category because it makes sense to them. In some cases, people leave an old category behind, and their departure sucks the life out of it. In that way, sure, new categories disrupt old categories. But for the smartest pirates, dreamers, and innovators on the planet, disruption is never the goal. Creation is the goal.

- anything at all. Airbnb created a new category of on-demand places to stay, but as of this writing no one—including and especially cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky—is predicting the new category will lead to the collapse of the hotel industry. Our term for the companies that create, develop, and dominate new categories is category kings. Importantly, category kings are not necessarily the companies that first hatch an idea or patent an invention. A single cool product launched into the universe doesn’t make a category king. Category kings take it upon themselves to design a great product, a great company, and a great category at the same time. A category king willfully defines and develops its category, ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=421))

- This book is about the strategy that builds category kings. Following this strategy doesn’t make it certain you’ll become a category king, but it will improve your odds. And we believe it will at least help you play bigger than you otherwise might. As we’ll show, a category king strategy is important and effective when the economy is roaring, and perhaps even more powerful when downturns cripple runner-up competitors. Some of the great category kings have been built during some of the “worst” times—Google in the early 2000s right after the dot-com crash; Airbnb in 2008 as financial markets melted; Birds Eye amid the Great Depression.6 ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=440))

- Most category kings are once-in-a-founder’s-lifetime achievements. A rare few individuals have proven to be master category king creators. One of the best of all time, as you might imagine, was Steve Jobs, especially during his second go-round at Apple. He led the creation of three important new categories: digital music (with the iPod and iTunes), smartphones (iPhone), and tablets (iPad). Elon Musk made Tesla Motors into the category king of electric cars and SpaceX into the category king of private spaceflight, incredibly doing that for both companies at the same time. Jeff Bezos started out making Amazon.com the category king of online retail, and repeated that success with e-book readers (Kindle) and cloud-based computing services (Amazon Web Services). A lesser-known but no less prolific creator of category kings is Seattle entrepreneur Rich Barton. He had a hand in founding Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor.

- Sometimes category kings aren’t even a business, yet they define and develop something new in our way of life. Peter Drucker was the category king of management thinking. And of course as we’ve mentioned, there was Elvis Presley, the category king of rock and roll. Those individuals were not just better than what came before; they were very different from what came before. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=461))

- it clear that those are the companies he wants to invest in. “Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.” As you’ll see, he’s describing category kings—the companies that take all the economics out of a category. Thiel goes on to say, “All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.” By Thiel’s definition, category kings are the happy companies.7 ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=479))

- Bryan Roberts at Venrock, another top-tier VC, tries to spot potential category kings early. “A category king tends to have broken open a new space, and that often means a big risk element early on—something most people think you can’t surmount, or that if you do surmount, no one will care,” he told us. A company like Snapchat might fall into that latter category. Early on, a lot of people wondered why anyone except teenagers would care about a service that disappears their selfies. But once a category king proves its category works, as Snapchat did, “things go from non-consensus to consensus very quickly, but by then you [the company] have some competitive advantage that’s hard to surmount.” In Roberts’s view, category kings win big—and these days, they win fast.10 Meanwhile, Jim Goetz of Sequoia Capital directly advertises his category creation philosophy: “We seek mission-driven founders who can build a great company and category at the same time.” Various studies point to the power of category kings.

- In late 2014, one tech industry analyst, Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity, looked at the state of profits of smartphone companies and found that Apple took in 93 percent of the industry’s total profits.12 Imagine that! Of all the world’s smartphone makers, one company—the category king—claimed almost all of the economics. Like it or not, there is increasingly no middle class in business. The wealth goes to the kings. A second-place prince—such as Lyft or Samsung—can get a tidy share of the economics. The rest of the players get relegated to the life of serfs in the category king’s empire. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=532))

- of Minnesota, graduated from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1992, then worked as a patent attorney for Pfizer. He’d played lots of poker in college—“we were all pretty pathetic,” he recalls. And then, while working in Chicago, he decided it was time to learn to play well. He read poker books and started entering tournaments, perfecting his game as he played. In 2004, he won the World Series of Poker—a 5 million prize. At the World Series of Poker the following year, he did something unprecedented in a game that seems to involve so much luck: he followed up his first-place victory by finishing in the top tier again, taking home more than 300,000. By 2013 he’d made more than 7.4 million playing poker. Uh, and he quit his day job. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=560))

- We talked to Raymer about how someone can increase his or her odds in a game that has so many factors that can’t be controlled. (Seriously, we don’t want to talk to technology people all the time.) “A lot of people don’t think about luck and skill properly,” he told us. Most people, he explained, think of luck and skill in any particular endeavor as a zero-sum continuum—a straight line that puts luck at one end and skill at the other. That would mean that if you’d say that an outcome is determined by 40 percent luck, it must be 60 percent skill; or if it’s 90 percent luck, then the outcome must rely on only 10 percent skill. But ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=567))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- luck and skill, Raymer insisted, “are not on the same axis.” And that makes all the difference.14 Of course, Raymer used poker to illustrate. There is a great amount of luck involved in which cards you get. But there’s also a great amount of skill in deciding what to do with those cards, the bets you place, the way you conduct yourself at the table. On the luck side, the odds for everyone around the table are the same. On any given hand, you might be terribly unlucky, and there would be nothing much you could do to win. But the most skillful players essentially better their odds over time. If the odds are the same for everyone, more skill results in better decisions with the cards you’re dealt, and ultimately gives you a better chance of winning. “You have to be realistic about how much luck is involved in whatever you’re doing and after that kind of ignore it,” Raymer said. “Then you have to say, what’s the smartest decision I can make and ignore results in the short run because they are irrelevant.” Raymer’s consistent success shows that good outcomes don’t happen by accident even in chaotic multidimensional games like poker.

- We see the emergence of a new discipline in business. We call the discipline category design. It is emerging today in much the way engineers embraced product design in the 1980s to make sure individual products had the best chance of succeeding—of beating the odds. In the early 2000s, companies adopted experience design—a discipline a step up from product design, developed as a way to make sure the mix of hardware, software, and usability together gave the user the best experience possible. Experience design is yet another way to improve the odds of winning in a nutty marketplace. Category design involves creating a great product (along with its experience), a great company, and a great category at the same time. It is a broad, deep discipline that impacts every part of a company and its leadership team. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=591))

- The first inventor is an innovator to be thanked. The first to define and develop a category is a category king to be followed. Category design is not just engineering. Too many people in Silicon Valley believe that building a great product is enough, and that the market will find it and flock to it. That’s a disease that has infected even the best and brightest minds. In fact, the best product doesn’t always win the category. Different wins. Great category thinking wins. Best product gets you an award at a TechCrunch conference. Category design is also not just marketing. Category design is a company-wide strategy. It involves the CEO and top management, product designers, engineers, sales, marketing, PR, partners—and often customers and users, too. We’ve heard CEOs sing the refrain: “We make shit and sell shit and everything else is bullshit.” Well, good luck with that. While you’re making shit and selling shit, someone else will define your category and steal it from you. Category design isn’t just positioning or branding. We have great respect for the seminal 1970s book Positioning, by Al Ries and Jack Trout.16 Their sense of ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=638))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- positioning as a necessary discipline was on the mark for the late twentieth century. But in this century of mobile/social/cloud, dynamics have changed, and positioning is only one part of category design. And as for branding—we call branding agencies “tattoo parlors.” You don’t want to wake up with Mike Tyson’s tattoo on your face, so don’t let someone else tattoo you. Brands don’t make a category king. Category design does. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=648))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In that sense, a problem is a category. A company that best frames a problem is the company that often comes to define and take the category. Put another way: winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution. For potential customers, categories become an organizing principle. The public comes to understand the problem that’s been defined, and then demands a product or service that solves it. Uber initially built its new category around a simple, clear problem: taxi service usually sucks. As Uber expanded, it opened up more category potential by framing a broader problem: how can you reliably get around town without a car? Uber had to get people to understand that this was a problem that could be solved in a new, technology-based way. As often happens, it was a problem many people didn’t know could be solved. Once the public understands the problem, people latch on to the most popular solution. Given all of the product and service choices people must make, it can get too burdensome to research every offering. So we pick the leader. Global networks, search engines, and social media allow everyone to quickly identify the top solution. Almost as soon as the problem—the category—is well understood, customers find the most popular solution and flock to it. Especially for digital products and services, there is no reason for anyone to settle for what they see as second or third best. Everyone who wants the best can get the best, instantly. The perceived best takes almost all of the market share; second best manages to hold on to enough to keep going; and the rest get pretty much nothing.

- And even back then, as Ries and Trout explained, marketers knew that winning a category meant everything. “History shows that the first brand into the brain gets twice the long-term market share of the No. 2 brand and twice again as much as the No. 3 brand,” they wrote. “And the relationships are not easily changed.” ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=730))

- The category as an organizing principle is supported by research on the brain and cognitive biases, as described by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, and by a host of brain scientists.8 Our brains are governed by more than fifty different cognitive biases that push us toward decisions based not on facts and logic, but on instincts that can be at odds with facts and logic. It’s a shortcut system in our brain—a way to make decisions faster and easier, especially when overwhelmed by too much information. One of the cognitive biases is called the Anchoring Effect. It’s a tendency for an early bit of information to affect our view of all the information that comes after. For instance, the first offer put on the table in a negotiation has a powerful impact on any other offer that comes after. So in category dynamics, an early company that solves the problem will win a powerful place in customers’ minds. It becomes an anchor. Other companies coming afterward get judged against that early ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=742))

- company. Another bias that kicks in is the Choice Supportive Bias—the tendency to give positive qualities to an option we’ve chosen just because we’ve chosen it. This means that once you’ve committed to a product or service in a new category, you’re likely to feel certain that it is the best even if something slightly better comes along. This helps explain why category kings can’t be dethroned by a competing product or service that’s simply better. Once people have chosen a king, they will always tend to believe the king is better, even if it’s not. This reality explains why companies with superior technology can still lose category wars. Once a king emerges customers believe it’s the best, regardless of any evidence to the contrary. The category king concept also plays out in humans’ pack mentality. Groupthink Bias describes a tendency to believe things because other people do. Brain studies have shown that when we hold an opinion that differs from others’ in a group, our brains produce an error signal, warning us that we are probably wrong. In a category, the Groupthink Bias brings momentum to an emerging category king—customers embrace the king because so many other customers have embraced the king. For some people the pressure to make important buying decisions is not unlike ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=750))

- the feeling of being under threat. Research from Vladas Griskevicius at the University of Minnesota shows that when people are threatened they seek safety in numbers. “In the pack we feel less vulnerable, less likely to get eaten when the critter cannot see us because we blend in with the crowd. The group is our haven, our shield.”9 As a result, the people who already own iPads make the people thinking about buying iPads feel safer about the decision. The need to fit in is a uniquely human behavior and begins as early as two years old. “Conformity is a very basic feature of human sociality,” said Daniel Haun, a psychological scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.10 Studies show that people will and do change their minds to fit in. MRI scans of people changing their minds to conform to a group show that two critical reward-related regions in our brain are stimulated when we change our minds to be like others. It turns out we want to buy from category kings because our brains feel safe and happy when… ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=760))

Your product, your company culture, your marketing—everything has to be aligned with transforming the way potential customers think. If you change the way they think, they will change their buying behavior. More important, if you are the company that changes the way people think, people will see your company as the category king, and you will win the majority of the customers.

- A lot of venture capitalists like to say, “We invest in great teams.” But a great team is nothing without a great category. A great team in a lousy category or a me-too position in an existing category is a losing cause. But if a middling team stumbles on a great category, the category will make heroes of the team. The product doesn’t have to be an engineering marvel, either—it just has to be good enough to satisfy the category. When the right product and right company connect to a strong category, the category literally pulls the product or service out of the company. We see that all the time with these rocketing start-ups, from Facebook in the early 2000s to Slack in the mid-2010s. Once the category’s problem gets defined, the market demands the solution, and potential customers will turn to the consensus solution with ferocity. In a well-honed category-driven strategy, the company designs the category, evangelizes the problem, offers its solution to the problem, and then the category makes the company its king. The greatest power comes from the people proclaiming their own king. A self-determined king that isn’t made by the category is a hollow despot destined to be overthrown at the first sign of weakness. This is why a category-based strategy requires the design of a great product, a great company, and a great category at roughly the same time. They are of a piece—designed to work together to change the way people think. We depict the strategy as a triangle, with each side of equal importance. (Actually, we prefer to think of it as a bar stool with three legs required to keep us firmly seated in front of our beers, but a triangle is easier to draw.)

- Product design is the purposeful building of a product and experience that solves the problem the market needs solved. The goal is what is traditionally called a great product/market fit—in other words, a great product/category fit. In the tech start-up world, most companies actually begin with a product—a couple of folks messing around in a garage to make something. Company design is the purposeful creation of a business model and an organization with a culture and point of view that fits with the category. The goal is a great company/category fit.

- computing. Corning has pulled off this kind of strategy over and over for 165 years, and is still doing it today with new categories of glass that never before existed. One of the greatest category creation events in computing history was orchestrated by IBM when it brought out its System/360 computer in 1964, more than fifty years after the company was founded. The triangle can work in more circumscribed ways, too. Every department inside a larger business is essentially creating a product or service of some kind, and would benefit from thinking about the category it serves and how the department and its offering plug into that category. Individuals can think this way about their careers. The most successful people identify a category, an offering (what they can uniquely do that the category needs), and a personal culture and point of view (who they are and how they think) at the same time. Muhammad Ali created a category of showman-boxer, perfectly suited to the emerging age of television, that hadn’t existed before. The category reflected what he could do and how he thought, and he completely dominated it for the rest of his career. No one else emerged who could compete with him.

- Google, Through a Category Lens Few companies start on day one with all three points of the triangle firmly planned out. Some companies begin with a team that just wants to work together, essentially beginning with company design. Some companies get their start because an entrepreneur thinks up a new product, starting at product design. And some companies begin with a vision for a category—like Bhargava of 5-hour Energy, who then had to design a product and company to tackle the category. Still, legendary companies quickly move past their initial impetus and grasp category thinking, embracing all three points of the triangle. However they start, these companies quickly move to designing the product, company, and category in parallel. With that in mind, we want to tell you the story of Google in a way you probably hadn’t considered. A lot of people think Google was just a better search engine when it appeared in 2000. Even Google had bought into the classic… ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=911))

- bunch of reasonably popular search engines already existed. If it was just a better product in an existing category, how did it become a category king? But there’s another, revealing way to look at Google’s success. Before Google, all sorts of search engines proliferated: Alta Vista, Lycos, Infoseek, Ask Jeeves, AllTheWeb, and more. They seemed awesome at the time because nothing like a search engine had ever existed. But none of those search engines made real money—the only way they could monetize search was through banner ads, which never worked well for anybody. None of them broke out from the pack and led the market. They all worked off a similar idea: their software crawled through the words on Web pages to find matches with the words users typed in. That process, though, meant that you got a lot of shitty results just because a word you typed appeared a few times in some document. Searching by keyword also meant that the bigger the Web got, the slower the search engines got, since the search engine computers had to crawl through an exploding volume of pages. In their dorm rooms at… ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=920))

- count votes. More links to a page were like more votes that the page was worthwhile. This method tended to push higher-quality results to the top, plus the system also got better as the Web grew, learning from the links and from the search activity of users. More Web pages meant more votes, and more votes produced results that weren’t just better—Google’s results often seemed prescient, seeming to understand what you were actually looking for.18 Google was the kind of innovation only someone outside of traditional search and computer science could’ve come up with. “The whole field had suffered blinders,” Bell Labs computer scientist Amit Singhal said at the time. “Search really did need two people who were never tainted by people like me to come up with that shake-up.”19 So Google wasn’t just another search engine—Google created a new category of search that drew power from the very structure of the burgeoning Web. Google from the start was something different, not just better. It solved a clear problem for its users who wanted spot-on results from an ever more chaotic Web. It redefined the very meaning of “search” on the Web and of course… ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=931))

- though Google did almost no marketing or messaging to develop the category at first. It didn’t even know it had created a category. However, imagine if Google had never done anything else—imagine it only understood itself as a better search engine. Google would not be the powerhouse it is today. It would’ve just been a great product, and maybe Microsoft would’ve bought it to get Google’s technology, saving itself from its eventual Bing doltishness. But instead, Page and Brin pretty quickly found a way to monetize this new search paradigm with a new search advertising paradigm, creating AdWords. For the first time, ads could be matched to search terms, and advertisers could pay for an ad’s performance instead of paying for random “eyeballs” seeing an ad. As part of this revolution in advertising, Google reimagined how advertisers would purchase ads—by bidding, auction-style, on search terms. Google brilliantly changed the advertising business model, coupling it with a particularly powerful characteristic of search: when you search for something, you tell Google a little about… ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=943))

- It was so powerful and new, the money started flooding in to Google, and the company used this cash flow to extend and extend and extend its category by creating more information services that would tell advertisers something about the target consumer at that moment. Google Maps reveals where you are, Gmail sees what you’re writing about, Calendar has your schedule, Google Docs can glimpse what you’re working on. The company bought YouTube so it could know what you’re watching. It built Android so it could take that whole search-advertising stew into mobile phones. Google started with a search product that was different, and then redefined “search” into something much, much bigger and different than it had meant before, funded by an entirely new category of advertising. Though we are not sure Google ever understood it this way, it had embarked on a brilliant category strategy—the kind we’ll unpack as we go through this book.20 As a result, Google has transformed the way we get and consume information, reinvented advertising, created more than fifty thousand high-value jobs, and built… ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=953))

Whether Google knew what it was doing or not, it put together the three parts of the triangle. Conventional wisdom says Google won simply because it built a better search engine. But it won because it also designed a new category and designed its company to fit that category. So no matter where you start on the triangle of category thinking, ultimately category design can’t be left to chance. A great product and great company are nothing without a great category.

- A Category Crowns a King We love Diane Greene, founding CEO of VMware, and think she’s brilliant. We talked to her about VMware’s beginnings, and came to realize that at the start, VMware had no idea it was about to create a powerful category. The VMware product started as a research project by Greene’s husband, Mendel Rosenblum, a computer ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=971))

- science professor at Stanford. At the time, computers could run a single operating system, like Microsoft’s Windows. Rosenblum developed software that would essentially partition a computer, allowing it to run another operating system at the same time. The second operating system would be kind of a virtual computer running inside another computer, so Greene and Rosenblum started calling their product “virtualization software.” At first, the product was aimed at researchers who might want to run an experimental piece of software in a safe container inside a computer, avoiding the risk of the experimental software fucking up everything else on the machine. “Our early customers were all physics and chemistry professors,” Greene told us. “It was our internal joke: ‘VMware—it’s not for everybody. You have to be really smart.’”21 Still, Greene and Rosenblum weren’t naive. They realized they’d created a new kind of product, and that it could be useful in a lot of situations—like for corporations wanting to safely test software on their systems. So in 1998 they started a company, made Greene CEO, and shortened “virtual machine software” to VMware—a name pretty much everybody involved hated. They found that the technology was difficult to explain. A lot of venture capitalists didn’t invest because they didn’t understand the market—in part because Greene didn’t even understand the market. “We didn’t think it was going to become a multibillion-dollar industry,” she told us. “We just said, ‘This is, like, really needed.’” VMware’s founders started at the product design corner of the triangle. They knew that technologists had at least a vague sense they needed virtualization software. Greene was still struggling to comprehend and articulate the category when VMware was ready to release the first version of its product. Instead of trying to sell the software through typical channels, Greene decided to put it up on VMware’s website and allow people to use it for free for thirty days. VMware posted the software on a Sunday afternoon. “We only had a limited amount of bandwidth that we had paid for,” Greene recalled. “And so we came in at like six in the morning [on Monday], and there’s all these emails from this kid at Cornell, and he goes, ‘VMware—your site went away. It ran out of bandwidth. I’m hosting it at Cornell and I’ll record everybody that comes and share all that information with you.’” When Greene and her team looked, 75,000 people had downloaded the product. It dawned on Greene that VMware had created an entirely new category—virtual machine software—that had fantastic potential. She dove into a version of category design, talking to the media about how this new product worked and how it could save corporations fantastic amounts of money on operating their computer systems. She realized there was a ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=974))

- huge problem VMware could solve—vastly underutilized corporate computers—and started to publicize it. Another smart move: “Right away, we devised a huge training program, where you could become VMware certified,” she said. It was a tactic for shaping the category and building an ecosystem of users and believers. Over the next few years, Greene did a lot of things right to design and develop this category and ensure that VMware was its undisputed king. But the important part of this story is the way the category instantly embraced VMware and made it the king. The category, once born, was so grateful to VMware for designing a product and company that could serve it, the category pulled VMware out of obscurity and practically carried it to a throne. By giving the category definition, the category arose out of nothing, and a new king was born. VMware, by the way, went public nine years after it was founded and created the category, fitting with our 6–10 Law. A lesson here is that a category needs a king. New categories benefit from a near monopoly. When we don’t yet know where a category is going or what it can become, we really want a… ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=996))

The category no longer needs a visionary leader to bring it to life. All that’s left to accomplish are incremental improvements in price and quality, and competition is good at driving that.

- Let’s point the lens at ourselves: what problem is category design solving? The problem, at its core, is that very few people are walking around with the equivalent of Steve Jobs’s intuition. Too many good companies with good products fail to make a dent in the universe1—because they can’t find their place in the universe. Too many companies essentially stick a pole in the air during a thunderstorm and hope they get struck by lightning. Entrepreneurs have an “aha” that compels them to solve a problem. Category designers take the next step to condition the market to see their aha the way they do and demand the new thing. The odds of success in this fast-moving, highly networked era are too overwhelming unless you possess the extremely rare talent of Jobs or one of the other preternaturally brilliant category designers such as Marc Benioff or Jeff Bezos. For every other smart, ambitious person, category design can provide a systematic approach to improving the odds of becoming a category king—of finding a way to play bigger. And category design combined with company design and product design is the way to change how people think, and so change their buying behavior.

- As the three of us worked through Macromedia’s situation with our category-thinking caps on, we zeroed in on the importance of “experience” in the emerging digital economy. The Internet made it so easy to click from one website to another, it had created a new problem: sites found it difficult to keep people engaged. So we saw a new problem that Macromedia could solve. Macromedia could help sites become more “sticky” by improving the quality of the experience on the site. Seems so obvious now, but at the time this counted as a revelation. Macromedia, we urged, had to become known for products that help Web developers and designers deliver great experiences for users. This was not just about the engineering that would go into products—it meant understanding the context around users when they touched experiences that were created using Macromedia products. It meant understanding how the products and the branding and the customer service and everything else made people feel, and designing the experience so it made them feel good. A term surfaced out of all this thinking: experience design. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1074))

Category design means bringing together many activities across your company and executing on the tactics described in this book. It is a discipline and a future career. Just as someone can be a product designer or experience designer, there will be a role at many companies for a category designer.

- work matters. Too many CEOs believe that customers will buy when they learn about the features of their breakthrough innovation. But a product and a company don’t float in space. A product and a company exist inside a category. If you don’t take charge of the category, someone else will, and then you’re royally screwed. Position yourself or be positioned. Another mistake would be assuming that the space around the company is outside of your control. Some executives talk about the market like it’s the weather—something that happens to them, versus something that they can affect and in some cases even control. But here’s the key: if you’re creating a new category, you can make the kind of weather you want to live in. If you move into someone else’s category, you certainly can’t do much about the conditions around your company. If you open up a new category or define the rules for an emerging one, you get to design the whole space the way you want it. But remember: you have to design it! If you leave design to chance, someone else will design it—maybe a competitor, maybe customers, maybe a Gartner Group analyst, maybe the press. But if it’s not you, that means you blew a golden opportunity to increase your odds of success. Engineering schools teach that good technology will always win. Tech companies can now get product out so quickly and cheaply, it’s tempting to rush right by category design. Getting a product out can trump even considering the larger space, so many won’t think about the category because it’s hard and because category design can’t be measured instantly. And then when a great product fails, the team believes they ran into bad luck. But to again invoke poker champion Greg Raymer, the odds are the same for everyone in the game. The key is to play bigger by doing everything in your power to increase your odds. It won’t guarantee winning, but it gives you a better chance than others around you—and certainly a better chance than hoping to get struck by lightning. Category design is the twenty-first-century way to increase your odds. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1145))

You have to first define and market the problem—and only then can you help people understand that you can solve the problem better than anyone else. VMware had to make technologists feel that an inability to run two or more operating systems on a computer was a problem. Before VMware, that problem didn’t exist in the heads of most computer operators. As it happened, as soon as VMware revealed the problem, technologists immediately got it and felt a critical need to solve the problem. At that point, VMware was the perceived leader, and customers pulled the product right out of VMware. Likewise, Google had to make us realize that Alta Vista’s search results were a problem.

But while still at Oracle, even as Siebel soared in the CRM space, Benioff recognized a new problem with CRM that he thought he could solve: Siebel software was so expensive and complex it often frustrated customers who tried to implement it or scared companies away from buying it in the first place. In the emerging Internet, Benioff envisioned a solution to the problem. He could put CRM-style software in one central data center, and let customers use the application through the Internet. Instead of charging millions of dollars up front for the software, he could charge a more affordable subscription fee. Instead of requiring the corporate customer to employ IT people to maintain the complex software on the company’s own machines, Benioff could take care of the software in its data center, so customers would never have to touch it. Benioff left Oracle to start Salesforce.com and market a product that would be cheaper and easier to use than Siebel’s—but most important, it would be different. It was also, at that moment in time, tremendously nonconsensus. Most corporate IT people ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1187))

- looked at Salesforce in its early days and said: it’ll never work. Benioff didn’t leave the category to chance. He didn’t just believe the cool new product would sell itself. He understood that to get funding, hire employees, and win customers, he had to take the world on a journey. He had to condition the market. In 1999, he started doing that while Salesforce was still only a few coders working in a San Francisco apartment. Benioff invited Don Clark, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, to visit, but Benioff didn’t spend time selling his solution. He evangelized the problem. On July 21, 1999, the Journal ran Clark’s story on the front page. Headlined “Canceled Programs: Software Is Becoming an Online Service, Shaking Up an Industry,” the story marked a first step in conditioning the market to desire what Salesforce would eventually give it. Benioff followed up that publicity by talking to other journalists and throwing launch parties under the theme “The End of Software.” The phrase would become Salesforce’s mantra. The company even designed a clever “No Software!” logo that mirrored the old Ghostbusters movie logo. Notice that there is nothing about Salesforce itself in those slogans and logos. Benioff’s first priority was creating a category. He focused on defining the problem only he could solve. “We needed to introduce an ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1196))

- entirely new market and promote a new way of doing business,” Benioff recounted in his book, Behind the Cloud.7 From there Benioff got creative, and he used Siebel as his foil. Siebel was a tangible example of the problem Benioff needed to define. So he positioned Salesforce as the anti-Siebel. He wanted his company to be seen as the pirates storming Siebel’s fortress. “We applied for a permit from the city [of San Francisco] to march against software,” he told the New York Times a few years later. “We claimed it was hurting the American economy. It was creating landfills full of CD-ROMs. And the city granted it to us!”8 Benioff led a tongue-in-cheek antisoftware protest. Unlike so many excruciatingly diplomatic CEOs, Benioff publicly taunted his much bigger competitors, especially Siebel Systems and SAP, which also sold a CRM system.9 He sounded at times like he was blowing more smoke than Foghorn Leghorn in a Looney Toons short.

- As journalists, analysts, and potential customers woke up to this new problem, Siebel felt like it had to react, even though Salesforce at that time posed little threat to Siebel’s economics. “As [Siebel] began defending itself and acknowledging Salesforce.com,” Benioff wrote, “the press began to see this fight as an increasingly interesting story, and that further legitimized us. At this point, we had already won.”11 Salesforce won because once people can see the problem, they can’t unsee it. In a flash, Siebel had been labeled as a problem. Salesforce positioned itself as the solution. Benioff created the perception that Salesforce’s category kingship was inevitable. From nothing, his vision became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course, Salesforce then had to deliver. It had to actually build the technology to adequately solve the problem. But when the category demands a product, the product doesn’t have to be perfect right from the get-go. Once the cloud-based sales-force automation category revealed the problem, the market demanded any viable solution.

The company infected customers and developers with its point of view. Work with us, Salesforce said, and show those establishment pigs how to do things. Benioff linked himself to the Dalai Lama, invoking a spiritual leader who rejects materialism—as if Benioff were a rebel among Porsche-driving CEO narcissists. That led to a moment of international notoriety in the early 2000s when Salesforce put out a promotional poster of the Dalai Lama appearing to endorse the company. An uproar followed. Benioff apologized. The incident blew over. Salesforce was left better known than if the incident had never happened at all. (Now that is one classic hijack—a tactic we’ll get into later.) In perhaps his most inspired insult to the established CRM industry, Benioff chose as his company’s New York Stock Exchange symbol “CRM.” By the time Salesforce went public in 2004, it had signed up 10,000 customers and nearly 140,000 users, each paying 65 to 125 a… ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1229))

- in that category, Siebel found it was the me-too wannabe. Even worse for Siebel, as Benioff recalled, “By getting behind this [cloud software], they’ve validated the market for us.” Salesforce.com had effectively designed its category so the category crowned Salesforce as its king. Siebel entered the category and had to play by Salesforce’s rules, and so its defeat was certain. The company that defines the space is best positioned to dominate it. It’s important to note that Salesforce did not disrupt Siebel. It created a new category that Siebel couldn’t play in. The new category made people see a problem with the old category, so some of Siebel’s customers migrated to the new one—yet a huge number of Salesforce’s customers were newcomers to sales-force automation, unable to afford or implement the older CRM software. Siebel may have still dominated its old category, but Salesforce’s new category sucked the vitality out of Siebel’s old one. This may seem like semantics, but it’s a matter of cause and effect: you don’t first disrupt and then create the new—you create the new, and if that… ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1240))

- We’d like to highlight one seminal act by Musk that demonstrates what kind of courage it can take to design and build a new category. That’s when, in 2014, Musk gave away Tesla’s patents—a lesson both in courage and in how to think about intellectual property while building a category. Patents are considered sacred in business, particularly in the technology and pharmaceutical industries. They are sought after as a form of protection—both a wall that can keep enemies at bay, and a weapon that can be wielded to attack competitors. Patents can also be a profit center, generating licensing fees from other companies. For all those reasons, patents expressly benefit the company that owns them and hobble potential competitors and other entities entering the same category. That may be fine in a situation like VMware’s. Its category caught fire quickly, carrying VMware along with it, and VMware’s patents held back powerful players such as Microsoft from building competing products—at least for long enough so that VMware could get established as the clear, undisputed king. But Tesla faced a different kind of problem in the 2010s. It created a new category and won its crown, but the category was growing slowly. Electric cars are not like a piece of software that can be instantly distributed to the world through the cloud. Cars are expensive and time-consuming to build and distribute. One small company just didn’t have the firepower to make the category explode. In 2014 electric cars were still about 1 percent of the total car market. Tesla needed help. It needed to be the king of a thriving category that included competitors, which would help drive up the number of electric cars on the roads, which in turn would help encourage an ecosystem of charging stations, repair shops, and all the ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1269))

- other pieces necessary to develop a burgeoning electric car market. Musk understood that he needed the category to grow so it would demand more of Tesla’s cars, even if this meant aiding competitors. As long as Tesla was the category king, the bulk of the benefits of a growing category would accrue to Tesla. So Musk decided to give away Tesla’s patents. He wrote a blog post explaining his decision. The patents, Musk wrote, only served “to stifle progress.” By opening up its patents for others to use, Tesla hoped to make it easier for other companies to make great electric cars. “We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform,” Musk wrote. To put an exclamation point on his decision, Musk ordered that the framed patents hanging on the wall at Tesla headquarters be taken down.14 Musk flew directly in the face of conventional wisdom in order to build his category, knowing that a strong category would be the key to his company’s long-term success. This is what we mean by courage. It is the CEO’s job to have that courage, and to infuse the rest of the organization with courage. In technology businesses in particular, categories are being created faster than ever. The king gets crowned faster than ever.

- majority of the economics. If you’re not the king, or at least No. 2, you will be lucky to have much of a business at all. This is about a whole organization leaning forward on its skis when it’s already going 80 miles per hour down a double-black-diamond slope. A company has to fully embrace its drive to be a category king, because every part of the organization has to be involved, and every part has to move in synch at maximum speed. For that reason, the CEO or equivalent leader has to be the driver of category design. It’s not a job for the chief marketing officer or the head of product design or any other department head. The leader has to feel the conviction of belief in the category, and bring everyone else along, or else the effort will fail. Companies, we believe, will come to employ category designers, just as they now employ experience and product designers. A category designer can architect a plan for the category and the company, but even then, the CEO will have to drive it because the plan will stretch across so many in-house boundaries.

- category where none exists can seem very risky, since by definition there is no market there yet. You have to see something no one can yet see, and if you can’t make potential investors, employees, or customers see it, too, they won’t want anything to do with your company. The temptation instead is to pick out a well-trodden category and go after a crumb of it. By doing that you have a shot at a minor success. You might carve out a little corner of a category with a me-too product that has a new feature or a slight twist, and in the end sell your company to Google or Facebook for what to most of the working universe would seem like a winning lottery ticket. You walk away with a million dollars, your company disappears into the maw of some giant, and no one really remembers what you’d done.

- 1.   Can you explain to me like a five-year-old what problem you’re trying to solve?   2.   If your company solves this problem perfectly, what category are you in?   3.   If you win 85 percent of that category, what’s the size of your category potential? A lot of the entrepreneurs come into a Fullpen session with an initial insight or idea that by itself seems pretty interesting. Maybe it’s a service that doesn’t yet exist, or a technology advance that does something that couldn’t be done before. But rare is the entrepreneur who can answer Dave’s Three Questions. That’s when the trapdoor in the Fullpen room floor opens and the entrepreneur disappears into a crocodile pit.4 The questions get at what the Fullpen participants need to know—in fact, what the world needs to know—about the entrepreneurs’ insights. Is what you’re creating just a cool thing and little more? Is it a feature of someone else’s category? Or can it blossom into its own vital, dynamic category? An insight by itself isn’t worth much. An insight has to lead to discovering a category that ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1341))

Most of the best insights come from what we call a “missing.” Basically, someone sees something that they feel is missing from the world, and the person is driven to fill that void. Google’s Larry Page felt he had to harness hyperlinks to fix search. Mark Zuckerberg had to create an online version of the Harvard freshman “facebook” so he could more easily meet girls. Clarence Birdseye had to bring frozen food to the masses, inspired by what he saw in the arctic.

- Flipkart is an example of a market insight that grew out of an intersection of culture, geography, and technology. In 2007, Amazon was well established around the globe but ran into headwinds in India. Regulations there prevented Amazon from selling directly to consumers from its own inventory, so shipping from afar might cost 9 on a 10 book. The postal service was unreliable and a vast swath of potential customers either didn’t have a credit card or shied from using credit cards online. Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal had both graduated from the prestigious technology university IIT-Delhi and actually went to work for Amazon in India, so they understood Amazon’s problems there firsthand—yet also saw a yawning opportunity. Their market insight: India needed a uniquely Indian online retailer. So the two set up Flipkart, and built their own warehouses and a delivery system suited to the culture. Thousands of Flipkart’s couriers would put products into their backpacks and ride off on motorbikes to pick their way through the perpetually jammed streets of India’s cities. At a customer’s door, they’d take cash for the purchase, bypassing credit cards entirely. The service caught on among Indian consumers, and in mid-2015 Flipkart raised funding at a 15 billion valuation. “A simple desire to create a tailor made product for the Indian consumer has grown into something beyond what we imagined,” Sachin Bansal told the Hindu.8 Marc Benioff and Jeff Bezos more methodically pursued their market insights. Benioff, as we showed earlier, already worked deep inside the software industry, at Oracle. He knew all about CRM software, and to him CRM’s shortcomings were the “missing” in that industry. He saw the nascent Internet as the technology he could apply to fix it. Bezos also realized the Internet would be a game changer, though at first he wasn’t sure what game it would change. While working on Wall Street in 1994, “I came across a fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent a year,” he told us. “I had never seen anything growing 2,300 percent a year, so the question for me was: what kind of business plan might make sense in the context of this growth?” He made a list of twenty products that could effectively be sold through mail order, and studied each. Books were on that list, and Bezos concluded books had an interesting trait: no bookstore could carry more than 100,000 or so titles, but millions ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1377))

- of books were in print. He could use the Internet to launch the world’s largest bookstore. When Amazon.com went live in 1995, it offered a million titles in its catalog. Bezos had worked his way through logic to arrive at a market insight.9 Of course, all these market insights look obvious in retrospect. But at the time, they were not. It was not obvious there was a market for an electric guitar, DVDs by mail, surf wetsuits, or books over the Internet. It was also not obvious that these entrepreneurs could build the technology, companies, and categories that would make the insights come alive. And that’s the other trick about market insights. When you have a good one, it seems a little crazy. It is nonconsensus. It becomes your job to make it consensus, and to believe in it when no one else does.

- In the end, a market or technology insight only matters if it leads to good answers to Dave’s Three Questions. Can you explain what problem you’re trying to solve? To create a category, that problem needs to be one that people didn’t realize they had or didn’t realize they could solve. If your company solves this problem perfectly, what category are you in? It needs to be a category that doesn’t exist and that you have the ability to create. It must be nonconsensus or you are by default a follower. If you win 85 percent of that category, what’s the size of your category potential? The answer tells the world how big your company can become and how much your company will matter. Are you Pixar in its first phase, with a category potential of three hundred machines? Or are you Pixar in its second phase, with category potential of dominating a global computer-animated movie category that never before existed but is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of decades?

- Insight to Category Entrepreneurs can be great at coming up with a market or technology insight, but too few take the next step and discover the category that fits that insight. They seem to have an unquestioned belief that once the world sees their new product, the world will “get it,” and so these innovators leave the category to chance.

We’ll share with you how we do our work to help a company arrive at a category, though we’re not saying it’s the only way to do this work.

- The process of category design starts with discovery—looking for those critical insights with the team through a series of conversations, interviews, whiteboarding sessions, or drinks. That insight is always there, but sometimes it is buried under heaps of day-to-day minutiae and can take weeks to unearth. Sometimes it is sitting on the surface. The trick is to spot it, listen for it, and push it around to make sure you really know it when you see it. This becomes the first phase of real category design, converting insight into a plan for a worthy category, a compelling story, and a course of action for conditioning the market to see the world the way you do. Let’s start with the category discovery work with Origami. Our job was to help the company’s brilliant technologists and entrepreneurs understand what they already knew. At Origami, we started by interviewing a select set of executives, board members, leaders, and ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1476))

Those facets: Vision mission: What was the original market or technology insight that led you to create this company? Customers: Who do you envision buying this product or service? Who will use it? Problem statement: What’s the problem you think you can solve for your potential customers? Use cases: What are the specific ways people will use this product or service to solve their problem? Product/solution: Give a detailed explanation of the technology behind the solution—what does it do now, and what else is it capable of doing?

Or does it allow them to do something that couldn’t have been done with prior technology, creating huge value?

- Most of all, the category needed to clearly be tied to the problem it was solving, which had to be a problem that potential customers didn’t yet know they had, or didn’t know could be solved. The way to discover that problem and category was to force the company to think about itself and its space in a deep, detailed way. It’s sort of like putting the company on a psychologist’s couch and making the patient confront the details of his or her life. This, we find, is fundamentally different from the usual practice of rushing to build and release the product, believing a great product will speak for itself. As Origami went through this process, it started to see how its technology insight connected to a unique problem. The company had to understand the from/to it would need to create. The first step involved identifying the customer—who inside companies actually cares about this marketing-tech shit? Usually it’s the head of analytics, the person who runs digital marketing, and the chief marketing officer. Where were each of those types of customers coming from, and where did Origami want to move them to? Put another way, what’s the problem ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1510))

- they don’t know they have or don’t know they can solve, and what would their world look like if they had a solution? Most of the time, the from/to—or froto—discussion gets lively, and in the end it generates an understanding of the customer and a collective vision for the future. The froto discussion at Origami led to a first sketch of the category. Origami saw that its technology was a way to move marketing measurement from an art to a science; from interpretation to fact; from lagging spreadsheet reports to real-time reporting. It could solve the problem of taking something blurred and mushy and making it sharp and tangible. The conversation then turned to how to use such attributes to define a category. Naming a category is part art, part science. Lots of companies have hired a branding agency to help pick a three-letter acronym that describes their product or service, but naming a category has to involve more rigorous thinking. It’s not like naming your cat: “Do I like this name or not?” The right thinking leads to a name that will help design and dominate a new large space. The name will inform the strategy of the company, not the other way around. A category name should describe the nature of the problem being solved. For companies aimed at the enterprise, the name should speak to the business function where the problem lives. Ideally, the category name will become a line item in every company’s budget. Consumer-facing companies need a category name that’s direct and descriptive, like “social network” or “on-demand transportation.” The art of naming a category comes into play when choosing the right words to convey all the right attributes. At Origami, the team wrestled with conflicting directions for the name. On one hand, they felt a desire to make the category very functional. Another urge was to make the category familiar sounding, setting it close to existing analytics and intelligence technology, so customers would feel a sense of comfort that Origami wasn’t some overreaching solution that was more science fiction than science. Yet one way or another, the category had to break free of the mar-tech noise and establish high ground with a new discipline in marketing.

Things got heated, emotional—which is all good. A passionate dialogue is how good things ultimately happen. The Origami team tabled the discussion for a couple of days to let the ideas sink in. It turned into a week of discussion before a much better name surfaced: Origami named the new category Marketing Signal Measurement.

Oxytocin is an empathy chemical, and it motivates cooperation and understanding—quite important when trying to convince someone to, as Apple used to say, think different. “My experiments show that character-driven stories with emotional content result in a better understanding of the key points a speaker wishes to make and enable better recall of these points weeks later,” Zack wrote. He added a swipe at the way too much business has been conducted for far too long: “In terms of making an impact, [storytelling] blows the standard PowerPoint presentation to bits.”2 That’s why category designers tell a story. We call that story a point of view, or POV. After you come up with an aha of an initial market or technology insight, and after you discover and define the right category, ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=1719))

- you have to craft the story about the category that you’ll tell. You need a powerful POV. A POV tells the world you’re a company on a mission, not a missionary company looking to make money any way it can. It frames the new problem that your category identifies, and sets you up as the answer. When someone can articulate your problem, you believe that person must have the solution. It’s why Bill Clinton won two presidential elections by claiming, “I feel your pain,” and why Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter by simply asking, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Politicians are masters at this. A great POV separates the companies, products, and categories that people love from the ones they, at best, tolerate. When you start to think about it, you can easily see the difference between a company that has a strong POV and one that has a POV black hole. In grocery stores, you can sense that Whole Foods has a clear POV, built around healthy gourmet products, while Safeway seems to have no POV at all other than selling groceries. Southwest Airlines has a palpable POV; United Airlines does not. Apple has a POV; Microsoft does not.3 A POV conditions the market to accept and embrace the company’s vision and have the same aha the founders experienced.

- both what is missing and why your company can fix that problem. A POV has to shift people’s minds so they reject an old way of thinking and come to believe in something new. It has to reach people on an emotional level. No one remembers what you say—but they remember how you made them feel. That feeling can be excitement about something that’s coming, or fear of missing out. Some of the best POVs make people think: “Oh fuck, I don’t have one of those! I have to get one of those!” To reach people’s emotions, a POV has to sound the way people talk. It has to be simple, direct, visceral. Language matters! Nobody in the history of the human race has ever been moved to joy or tears by a train wreck of lazy business babble. The story about your business is more important than the facts about your business. Sound outrageous? Maybe, but the brain research proves it’s true. People relate to and remember stories—even people who make a living analyzing facts. A POV tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It tells the world why this category and the company creating it are different. Different sticks.

- just choose the category king—or the lowest price if there’s no clear king. A great POV takes you outside the better wars and sets you in a different space all your own. A well-executed POV gives the company an identity and culture. It becomes the invisible hand that guides your priorities. It results in the right kinds of employees joining the company, the right kinds of investors funding it, and the right ecosystem building out around it—and, by the way, repels those you don’t want hanging around. Ultimately, the POV steers the company’s strategy. A powerful POV guides every decision the leadership team makes and every initiative it pursues. The POV helps employees intuitively feel how they should perform their jobs so they align with the company’s strategy. Most great, enduring companies have a POV imprinted on their DNA. Marc Benioff, as described earlier, built Salesforce.com on one of the great technology POVs of all time. In an era of big software and the first fuzzy glimmers of cloud computing, Benioff articulated that Salesforce meant “the end of software.” It was different.

- Salesforce was different. It would devote 1 percent of equity to charity and was intent on pushing for a new kind of corporate responsibility. It would speak out on social issues. It would be the industry pirate and defy convention. “A company can’t own its facts,” Benioff recalled about those decisions. “What a company can own, however, is a personality.” And that personality drives action. “We act the way people expect us to, which has made them feel connected to us,” Benioff wrote. “It’s an emotional attachment, and that’s an asset that cannot be stolen by any competitor.”4 To put an exclamation point on that, years later—in 2015—when the state of Indiana passed legislation seen as discriminating against the gay population, Benioff took a highly publicized stand and pulled Salesforce out of the state. The move seemed authentic and not a stunt because it was authentic. It fit with Salesforce’s long-held POV on the world, and in the end boosted Salesforce’s reputation in the tech industry.

- In our careers, we’ve felt the power of a great POV. As described earlier, Al, Christopher, and Dave together helped develop a new category and POV for Macromedia in the early 2000s, building the POV around “Experience Matters,” experience design, and a new set of Rich Internet Applications products. The POV told the Experience Matters story, and guided Macromedia’s strategic decisions. When Dave and Christopher were at Mercury Interactive, they helped reposition the company into a new category with the “Business Technology Optimization” (BTO) POV. When Hewlett-Packard purchased Mercury for 4.5 billion in 2006, the head of HP’s enterprise division, Ann Livermore, said that BTO was half the reason HP bought the company.

- To hit his targets for cost, size, and simplicity, Palm needed a new way for people to input information. At the time, the computing power needed to recognize a person’s handwriting couldn’t be built into a cheap, keyboardless, pocket-size device. So Hawkins came up with the unique solution of teaching human users a kind of shorthand script that the device could more easily comprehend. He called the script Graffiti. In other words, Hawkins concluded it would be easier to teach humans to alter their method of writing than to teach a computer to recognize every handwriting style.11 As Hawkins and his team developed the device, the team refined the POV and made it explicit. They wrote it down. “Most competition believes the reason these devices are not selling is the lack of appropriate features,” the POV said. “Palm believes the reason they aren’t selling is the devices aren’t simple enough.”12 Palm even redefined the PDA category, instead calling it “connected organizers.” When Palm’s engineers pressed Hawkins to add features to the device that would increase its cost or size, Hawkins referred back to the POV and held fast.

- Palm launched the Palm Pilot at a demo conference in 1996. The press immediately picked up the story. Word of mouth spread like crazy. Palm also recognized that it had to aggressively spread its antithetical story, so it educated the market with infomercials and public relations efforts. By sticking to the POV, Palm got the product right, and convinced the market the product was right. People accepted Hawkins’s aha and saw the problems of cost and uselessness inherent in other handhelds, effectively moving the market from a previous belief to Hawkins’s belief. For the first time, a handheld digital device caught on with the mass market, and Palm paved the way for the smartphones we hold dear today.

- Quokka didn’t muster enough momentum to survive the dot-com crash of 2000, and neither did Scient, showing that even if you get the POV and everything else pretty much right, timing can kill you.14 Reed Hastings of Netflix is truly one of the masters of timing. He cofounded the company in 1997, and always said he chose the name Netflix for a reason. He understood that someday the company would offer movies that could be watched directly through the Internet. But he also knew that the technology would not be ready for years. He didn’t even bother to dangle a streaming-movie POV in front of the public back in those days. Instead, he crafted a POV for the times. The concept of choosing your movies on a website and getting DVDs through the mail jumped just enough into the future, past Blockbuster and its stores and VHS tapes, but avoided asking consumers to do something they wouldn’t understand. Hastings waited, in fact, until a number of inconvenient and ill-timed services attempted delivering online movies—each failing to make an impact. At a conference called Web 2.0 in 2005, Hastings was interviewed onstage and asked why Netflix hadn’t started streaming movies. He had to explain why the market wasn’t ready, saying the software and antipiracy mechanisms still presented too much of a hassle for mass-market users.15 Netflix in 2007 finally introduced a new POV that set up a new category of simple, low-cost streaming movies. The company already had 4.2 million subscribers for its DVD service that he could address, and broadband Internet was rapidly spreading to U.S. homes. Hastings brilliantly played timing to make Netflix the category king of two successive categories: first, DVDs by mail; then streaming movies.

- Crafting a POV is a much more serious endeavor than thinking up the classic “elevator pitch,” which tries to simplify a company’s proposition down to a thirty-second burst. The POV is an articulation of strategy, and has to be solid enough to drive everything else the company does. Far down the line, a company might give some junior communications person the task of crafting a shorter, punchier version of the POV for that rare and coveted occasion when one of the company’s leaders happens to ride in an elevator with a potential buyer. Finding the story can be fun, creative, and at the same time grueling work. We usually grind through a dozen revisions of these documents before they’re ready to be shared. And then we think it is best to reveal the trailer at a dinner event that includes the executives, leaders, and key board members involved in the interviews.

- By that point, you have the story. It’s not about the technology or the product features, even though Origami began with a technology insight. It’s not about which company is the best or cheapest. It’s also not a steaming pile of business jargon diarrhea, which frankly is the way many corporations express themselves. The story simply and clearly defines the problem and creates a “thing” that modern marketers will feel they must have. That thing is not Origami per se—it’s Marketing Signal Measurement. MSM! Origami first needs its potential market to say, “We gotta get that thing!” Once people decide they need MSM, Origami stands a good chance of winning those customers as long as it builds a product that solves the problem well enough. If analysts, journalists, and bloggers understand the category story, they too will describe this new thing, and describe it in the way Origami describes it—which is tied back to the way Origami can solve the problem. If the world accepts the story and the problem the way Origami laid it out, Origami will always be at an advantage—because the story and problem are tailored to Origami. When all of this works the way it’s supposed to work, a category is born, and a probable category king is already on its way to claiming its crown.

- A strong POV tells the engineers, product managers, writers, architects, designers, and other creators what to build—and, more important, what not to build.

Jobs’s other company, Pixar, similarly uses a powerful POV to guide all its creative decisions. “Our mandate was to foster a culture that would seek to keep our sight-lines clear,” CEO Ed Catmull wrote. “The first principle was ‘Story Is King,’ by which we meant that we would let nothing—not the technology, not the merchandising possibilities—get in the way of our story.”21 By adhering to “Story Is King” and similar principles, Pixar produced one highly praised feature after another. When filmmakers were in doubt about what to do, they knew to default to the Pixar POV. The POV is not a way to describe your products; it’s a way to make sure your products are great.

- Some cranky business butt-head might hear about POV and grumble that it’s the same thing as stuff like branding and positioning. But POV is an articulation of strategy, and so POV informs branding and positioning. POV first is the company’s identity, looking inward.

The typical slogan is more forgettable than a deep cut on a Nickelback album and could be used by almost any other company. Witness SAP’s “Run simple,” or Microsoft’s “Where do you want to go today?” Both are POV-free and mean nothing.

That’s what Coverity was about, and the company told the story to potential business customers that the integrity of your software is the integrity of your business. Coverity would explain: Look, a jet airliner has more than 100 million lines of software code, and it’s probably a good idea to test it to make sure it all works the way it’s supposed to. The company made a case that software integrity testing was a responsibility, not a feature. The Coverity team launched software integrity POV as an advocacy campaign to free the world of software bugs, and the POV helped the company grow more than 20 percent a year and win a position as the clear leader. Analysts ranked Coverity higher than huge incumbents such as IBM and HP. The POV paid off a couple of years later, in 2010, when Toyota Prius cars were being investigated for a potential software glitch that could cause some of them to spontaneously accelerate when the brakes were applied. This software integrity problem resulted in a 4 billion loss in market cap for Toyota. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2021))

All that attention grew out of the POV work and Coverity quickly moved from the development basement to getting heard in boardrooms. In the end, point of view is an articulation of strategy. If you know and internalize a POV, you have your strategy—that grand overarching plan for creating a category, a company, and a product that matter. But getting to that POV takes a deep mining of the company’s soul. The work can take time, and it’s hard. But we promise you, it’s worth it. Technologists tend to want to build products and figure the rest out later. That’s backward.

Whoever does that work should do this work. Step Two: Fact Finding This is another reason to have the same person or team do the category work and the POV work: all of the research needed for category discovery also feeds into the POV work. Please refer back to the end of chapter 4 for the fact-finding questions that need to be addressed. However, for the POV, the team needs to dive into strategic and cultural questions.

Those are squishier questions than those necessary for category discovery, but the POV is as much emotional as it is factual. The research needs to gather as much emotional detail as possible along with the facts. Step Three: Agree on the Problem You have to know how to clearly state the problem you’re solving before you can describe your solution. Macromedia stated that a bad Internet experience equaled bad business, so bad experiences need to be addressed (by Macromedia’s products, of course).

- As we said earlier, when we craft a POV, we keep in mind the pacing and emotional tautness of a movie trailer. In a limited number of powerful words, the POV should lay out the problem and its ramifications, describe a vision for the category, sketch a blueprint for how to build the category, and paint a picture of potential outcomes. The basic structure is much like a classic late-night infomercial. Set up the problem with a dramatic flourish, then describe the solution. We’re constantly amazed how many companies market a so-called solution in the absence of a problem. The initial purpose of the POV is to condition the market to understand the problem and demand a solution. The bigger, more urgent, and more strategic the perceived problem is, the more time, attention, and money people will spend to solve it. At the end of the POV, simply describe your company’s particular solution in a broad, visionary way. At no point should a POV get into product features. Keep it simple. Use human words, not business or technology words. Keep sentences and phrases short. Be provocative. Think movie trailer!

Should it sound serious and reasoned? Provocative? Aggressive? Playful? Sensity in its POV wanted to make fun of standard streetlights. Part of the POV said, “Don’t blame them for being dumb . . . they’re just built that way.” The approach makes Sensity seem forward-thinking and willing to challenge convention. Origami’s language is more sober, reflecting a thoughtful solution to an intractable business problem. In each case, the language signals something about the company culture. Write the POV as a short document or series of slides. It must be able to be quickly read or presented—perhaps taking no more than ten minutes to absorb. Keep in mind that the Declaration of Independence, one of the most enduring and successful POV documents in history, contains 1,337 words. So there is no excuse for ever writing anything longer than that. Once a draft is written, present it to the leadership team.

Bruce Springsteen doesn’t go around changing the lyrics to “Born to Run.” So don’t change the words of your POV. Step Five: Distribute, Evangelize, Mobilize A POV does no good sitting static on a Web page or orphaned on someone’s hard drive. Salesforce made laminated cards to give to every employee. Some companies present a POV at an all-hands event, or smaller team meetings. Don’t just send it out in a cc:all email. A POV has to be actively evangelized by the CEO and her leadership team. Train your people in orientation meetings. Certify them. Make it religion. Make it conditional for employment. One very effective training technique is having every new employee stand in front of the entire company and recite the POV. Make it a contest and reward the best presenters. Make it fun and part of your culture. Invite your people to craft videos and presentations on why the POV matters.

- everything it can sell, promising potential customers that the company will build whatever the customer wants. The things the customers ask for rarely line up with the true north originally set by the CEO. Instead of working on true north, engineers increasingly find themselves working on customer requests, and customers generally ask for something better, not different. This is all acutely true in companies building business products, but it happens with consumer products. Often, it happens much more quickly in consumer companies, since consumers can adopt new technologies, products, and services in an instant. And it can happen very publicly for consumer companies, as the gravity-inducing requests and criticisms pour out into social media. These forces are the beginning of gravity dragging the product and company away from true north. Pull the product a little off course now and it will continue to veer wildly away from true north over time.

One is to be a maniacal totalitarian visionary product-design asshole.2 This is how Steve Jobs quite famously and effectively did it.3 It’s why Microsoft was so successful under Bill Gates, and so lost under super sales guy Steve Ballmer, who listened too much to customers, salespeople, and competitors and reacted to what the market was telling him instead of telling the market how to react to him. Few CEOs have it in them to run a company and adhere to true north at the same time. Given that difficulty, the other way to fight gravity is to set up the POV as true north, and deploy category design as the process that keeps the product, company, and category on track. We’ve said before that category design involves conditioning the market to see your aha. Well, before you can condition the market, you have to condition your company. It takes courage to become a category king, and in the witching hour the CEO has to stand behind the POV and category design strategy, and believe in the creation of a new category that doesn’t yet exist and can’t yet be measured. Gravity doesn’t want you to chase a zero-billion-dollar market. Gravity pulls hard toward an existing market that’s already defined and that customers already understand. Every business function feels it. An enterprise sales team wants to sell into a line item that exists on their customers’ annual budgets, instead of having to convince customers they need a new budget for something they never heard of. Consumer marketers veer toward persuading people to shift their spending to Pepsi instead of Coke, rather than educating them about adding a new kind of item, like a 5-hour Energy shot. Engineers lean toward building a product that’s better than others on the market, not different from anything they’ve seen before. Marketing, finance, PR, HR—they all feel the tug of gravity. Everybody tends to skate to ([Location 2148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2148))

- where the puck is instead of to where it’s going. And in that moment, it takes courage for the leader to turn away from some giant amount of revenue now because she just knows that true north is the right path and that creating, developing, and dominating an entirely new category is the better strategy. Category kings don’t ignore everything gravity pulls them toward, but they have to find a magical line between giving the market just enough of what it’s asking for and leading on to a new place—to a new category of the future.4 This battle against gravity is the manifestation of the desperate, palpable, jaw-clenching tension between today’s revenue and the future of the company. And while we know it sounds crazy to many, in the category king game you are playing for future economics, not today’s revenue. You will have to continually grow the category potential and push the perception that you are the king, following the equation that says a company’s value is determined by its category’s potential, the company’s position in the category, and its ability to prove it can deliver on its promises.

When we work alongside an executive team, right after the POV gets marked “done,” Dave chairs a meeting with the leadership team to identify and schedule a lightning strike within three to six months. A lightning strike is an event meant to explode onto the market, grab the attention of customers, investors, analysts, and media, and make any potential competitors crap their drawers. It is the full concentration of the company’s resources on one high-intensity strike. This is in complete opposition to traditional peanut butter marketing, which involves spreading marketing and PR across a wide swath of the market over a long period of time and hoping somewhere it sticks.

- The most important thing to understand about a lightning strike is that it’s not a marketing event. It’s a company event. And this is why the strike becomes a forcing function for every part of the company. Once the work is done to define the category and set up the vision, the lightning strike is meant to show the world that the category and vision are real, imminent, and inevitable. And to do that, the lightning strike has to introduce the product and company strategy that will make that POV real, imminent, and inevitable. The products have to work, make sense, and add up to a vision and not a bag of doorknobs.

Company strategy and financial strategy must be in synch with the POV at the lightning strike.

- Let’s say you’ve finished your POV and set a date for the lightning strike. As every department starts planning its drive to the strike, the leadership team should sit down and thoroughly imagine the category the company is trying to create. But just imagining the category is not enough. You need to make the implicit become explicit. We recommend creating four seminal documents: a category blueprint, product taxonomy, customer use cases, and category ecosystem. If you’re inside a well-funded start-up, the output of this work should look well honed and professional. But a two-person start-up in a backyard shed or an individual designing a career might do this on the back of a napkin. The most important part is that you think these things through and write them down. ([Location 2245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2245))

- Every category’s blueprint will be different, and there are many ways to depict them, but the larger point is that the document needs to show an outside audience that you’ve thought out the category, and that you have a plan to execute. That’s an important step toward establishing your company as the leader and most important player in the new category.

- The document you create as you do this is called a product taxonomy. Having a common way of describing everything is critical. The taxonomy becomes “truth” and it describes all the elements of the solution and how they fit into the category. Words matter. Category kings lead with language. The name of products and features can change the way people value them. That’s why automobile dealers no longer sell used cars. They sell pre-owned vehicles. It was hard for Congress to vote against something called “the PATRIOT Act.” If you want the world to value your product innovations, give them innovator names that tie back to your category design.

- There’s another possible response to realizing the suit is too big. You might decide the suit is too big now, but you can grow into it. You might adjust the POV while keeping the grander vision in your back pocket. Jeff Bezos didn’t start Amazon with a POV of becoming the most powerful force in retailing since the rise of Wal-Mart. He started with a POV of becoming the world’s biggest bookstore. That was, as he often said, the formulation behind the company’s name: the Amazon is the world’s biggest river, and Amazon.com would be the world’s biggest bookstore. Once Bezos conquered his original POV, he kept instituting more ambitious ones. Early on in the life of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg would talk about a grand ambition of connecting everyone in the world on his platform, but that suit would’ve been way too large for the young company. The early POV was built around connecting college students, while Zuckerberg kept the grand vision in his pocket until ([Location 2362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2362))

You will know the POV is ambitious enough if you feel the stress on the company as it tries to get to the lightning strike. Your chief operating officer might feel like Scotty on Star Trek, and run into your office yelling, “She canna take any more, captain! She’s gonna blow!” But if you have confidence that the strain is just the result of driving hard, and that your vessel can handle it, then slam the throttle forward and make lightning happen.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One is the CEO. No one else can make the entire organization get behind the mobilization effort and march it to the finish line. The CEO must completely believe in the category design plan, evangelize it throughout the company and ecosystem, and stick by it when the shit gets real. The other is the lightning strike master controller. One person needs to track the entire process and all the dependencies, and sound the alarm when something goes awry. The master controller should not be the CEO (who wouldn’t have the time), but needs to have direct access to the CEO. Otherwise, it can be anyone from the leadership team—a CMO, CTO, CFO, etc. Step Two: Set the Lightning Strike in Motion Right after adopting the POV, plot a date three to six months out for a lightning strike. Look for an event to hijack, or some other reason to have the strike that day. Next, decide what the strike will deliver. Who will be targeted? What are the from/tos for each target?

- Ries and Trout cited it in Positioning. The authors noted that the leader is “the one who moves the ladder [that is, a category] into the mind with his or her brand nailed to the one and only rung.”7 Another justification came up over happy hour drinks in Palo Alto with Richard Melmon, who cofounded Electronic Arts and is now a partner with Bullpen Capital. When Melmon looks at start-ups in the 2010s, he thinks back to the beginning of his career, when the technology industry embraced a study from Boston Consulting Group called the Experience Curve.8 The study, based on data, showed that a market leader—essentially, a category king—gains knowledge and experience faster than runner-ups, ([Location 2594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2594))

- ups, so it quickly learns how to make better products at lower cost than competitors, and learns more about customers and the market than competitors, all of which can be used to solidify and expand a lead. BCG proved the power of category strategy fifty years ago. But, as Melmon said, the advantages of the Experience Curve begin with planting that leadership position into the brains of potential customers. “This is not just an idea—it’s physics,” Melmon told us. “Your brain has neurons and connections, and it’s about physically implanting that thought in your brain, altering the actual physical structure.”9 If a company can do something to implant that thought in potential customers’ brains, it lowers the amount of work that company has to do to acquire new customers. In other words, the cost and difficulty of acquiring customers goes down for the leader, while at the same time making it harder for competitors to alter that thought, which increases those competitors’ cost and difficulty of acquiring new customers. The customer-acquisition advantage rolls up to other Experience Curve advantages, creating a flywheel that keeps empowering the category king while leaving competitors at a disadvantage.

- One of our favorite pirate stories goes back to the earliest days of Salesforce.com. In December 2000, when the company was twenty months old and barely a blip on the tech industry radar, gigantic Microsoft, then the industry’s superpower, announced it was buying Great Plains Software. If you looked at Great Plains through a prism in just the right way, the company could be seen as a Salesforce competitor. Salesforce CEO Benioff sent a memo to his staff poking fun at the deal and suggesting that the merger was only going to hasten the demise of software-based CRM in favor of cloud-based CRM. Benioff said in the memo that “Microsoft Great Plains will cause ‘Great Pains’ to the software CRM players who built their products in Microsoft’s path.’” And then Benioff leaked the memo to business journalists, who couldn’t resist using the “Great Pains” pun in their stories.13 The tactic gave Salesforce a free ride on Microsoft’s news—and associated the Salesforce brand with Microsoft. That’s what we call a hijack. To increase the odds of becoming a category king, smart companies don’t waste time and money on pointless vanilla, overly polite public relations. They go for PR that is opportunistic and edgy. And one good way for an upstart to leverage PR is to hijack some bigger company’s PR or news. A lightning strike is, really, a beginning—the opening salvo in defining, developing, and dominating a new category. Once the strike is over, a company has to relentlessly execute on its category strategy, over and over again, for years. While the initial strike can knock back potential competitors, you have to finish them off with blow after blow. And while a lightning strike is intended to lodge a new category into the brains of potential customers, you have to reinforce that idea with a constant drumbeat of messages. Hijacks are a good way to do that. Earlier in the book, we told Dave’s story of Coverity hijacking news about software problems in the ([Location 2684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015MOJ80G&location=2684))

- Toyota Prius, landing him on TV to talk about the value of testing software—which reinforced the category Coverity was creating. That was a classic hijack of a major ongoing news story. Sometimes it works to hijack your own news. Amazon.com hijacked its own 2002 IPO. Brad Stone wrote that “Bezos believed a public offering could be a global branding event that solidified Amazon in customers’ minds”—not to mention that it could be used to beat down Barnes & Noble, which was then trying to wrestle the online book market away from Amazon.14 A cruel thing about lightning strikes is that you can’t relax after pulling off that first one. You need to get busy with hijacks. And you need to start planning the next strike. In fact, we recommend three to six strikes to firmly establish a category, each within six months of the previous one. If you’re a real pirate, you’ll establish a rhythm of strikes and hijacks that constantly barrage customers and competitors with reminders about the category, the problem you’ve defined, and the solution you’re offering. Once you burrow into people’s brains, you want to deepen those grooves and make them permanent. This relentless pummeling is a job for the entire company, not just a few individuals in marketing. The follow-up strikes and hijacks can’t just be marketing events; they have to be company events. The messages need substance behind them, so the company must mobilize continuously, building the muscles that back up the words. All in all, this becomes an ongoing exercise in total execution.

- in category design, has to be conceived and supported by the leadership team. We recommended that the whole mobilization process be led by a strike master controller, who coordinates all the mobilization that has to come together on the day of the strike. You also need someone who can pull off the strike itself—the actual event. The job is a combination of event planner and internal company wrangler. This person must have strong cross-functional skills, be detail oriented, love spreadsheets, and have the respect of the CEO. This is not a traditional role—you won’t find a strike leader position on LinkedIn. It’s just someone who can get shit done and is not afraid to be a pirate. Since events and news can be different around the world, a strike leader in a global organization might want to assemble a tight, coordinated team of people in different regions. Together this team must present a single source of truth for the entire organization for all deadlines, actions, and owners. Another position to fill is the chief hijacker. This is probably your head of communications. It should be someone who is creative and opportunistic, understands the context around your company, can build good relationships with the media, and ideally is a pirate—someone who is willing to mix it up and take chances.

- This happens in parallel with the mobilization. As the whole company starts moving, the strike needs to be planned and executed. We recommend a kickoff meeting to set deadlines, set expectations for what will happen at the strike, and agree on the outcomes that are the goals of the strike. Ideally, the strike leader has a one-page master status report that lists all the dependencies and where they stand. This can be tricky because, as described earlier, a lot has to get done and it has to get done in the right order. The master status report is the truth. Set up a weekly meeting to go over the master status sheet with department heads. It will become obvious who’s not delivering, and that will create natural pressure from teammates on those individuals.

- The foundation of a flywheel is made up of the three elements we described early in the book: company design, product design, and category design. If all three are strong and working in synch, they reinforce one another and create a compounding effect on both the company and market. Since a good category king designs all three at the same time, it designs a category that’s a perfect fit for the products it offers and the kind of company it operates—giving the king a natural and unshakable advantage. A company’s value is rooted in its category. First comes category potential.
