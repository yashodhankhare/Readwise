- Bastiat was having none of this. Interest wasn’t theft, he maintained, but a fair reward for a mutual exchange of services. The lender provides the use of capital for a period of time, and time has value. Bastiat cites the famous lines from Benjamin Franklin’s Advice to a Young Tradesman (1748): ‘Time is precious. Time is money – Time is the stuff of which life is made.’ ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=408))

- The abolition of interest would only benefit the wealthy. ‘In your system,’ Bastiat wrote to Proudhon, the rich will indeed borrow gratis, while the poor will not be able to borrow at any price. When a rich man presents himself at the bank, he will be told: You are solvent, here is the capital, we lend it to you for nothing. But let a worker dare to show his face. He will be asked: ‘Where are your guarantees, your lands, your houses, your goods?’ ‘I have only my arms and my probity.’ [The worker replies.] ‘That does not reassure us, we must act with prudence and severity, we cannot lend to you gratis.’12 ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=418))

- In the year of Bastiat’s death, a final pamphlet appeared. In ‘What is Seen and What is Not Seen’ Bastiat tells the parable of a merchant, Jacques Bonhomme, whose shop window is broken by his careless son. Neighbours thought that it wasn’t all bad news. At least repairing the window provided employment for the glazier, who could spend the money ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=440))

- on food and other sundries. But Jacques Bonhomme now had less money to spend, says Bastiat. Here, Bastiat is urging readers to consider the broad consequences of any economic action, not just its effect on a particular beneficiary: In the sphere of economics, a habit, an institution, or a law engenders not just one effect but a series of effects. Of these effects only the first is immediate; it is revealed simultaneously with its cause; it is seen. The others merely occur successively; they are not seen; we are lucky if we foresee them.

- The entire difference between a bad and a good Economist is apparent here. A bad one relies on the visible effect, while the good one takes account of both the effect one can see and of those one must foresee.16 The bad economist, says Bastiat, pursues a small current benefit that is followed by a large disadvantage in the future, while the good economist pursues a large benefit in the future at the risk of suffering a small disadvantage in the near term. The American journalist Henry Hazlitt elaborated on Bastiat’s Parable of the Broken Window in his bestselling book Economics in One Lesson (1946). Like Bastiat, Hazlitt lamented the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of any given policy, or its effects on only a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on the special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.17 ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=448))

- The supply and demand for capital are equalized by interest rates, Hazlitt maintained. Yet a ‘psychopathic fear of “excessive” interest rates’ induced governments to pursue cheap money policies. Easy money, wrote Hazlitt, creates economic distortions … it tends to encourage highly speculative ventures that cannot continue except under the artificial conditions that have given birth to them. On the supply side, the artificial reduction of interest rates discourages normal thrift, saving, and investment. It reduces the accumulation of capital. It slows down that increase in productivity, that ‘economic growth’ that ‘progressives’ profess to be so eager to promote.21 ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=465))

- After the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008, neoliberal economists implemented the anarchist Proudhon’s revolutionary scheme. Central bankers pushed interest rates to their lowest level in five millennia. In Europe and Japan, rates turned negative – an unprecedented development. The results were not as Proudhon anticipated, however. Rather, Bastiat’s grim forebodings about free credit appear closer to the truth. Central bankers congratulated themselves for restoring calm on Wall Street. The bogey of deflation was dismissed. Unemployment came down sharply. These were the ‘seen’ effects of zero interest rates. The secondary consequences ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=476))

- The authorities believed that low rates would boost corporate investment. But White suggested firms were actually investing less. Furthermore, ultra-easy money was responsible for the misallocation of capital. Creative destruction was thwarted. ‘It is possible,’ White concluded, ‘that easy money conditions actually impede, rather than encourage, the reallocation of capital from less to more productive resources.’ ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=486))

- ‘Aggressive monetary easing in economic downturns is not a “free lunch”,’ concluded White, ‘at best, it buys time to rebalance economies.

- This book is about the role of interest in a modern economy. It was inspired by a Bastiat-like conviction that ultra-low interest rates were contributing to many of our current woes, whether the collapse of productivity growth, unaffordable housing, rising inequality, the loss of market competition or financial fragility. Ultra-low rates also seemed to play some role in the resurgence of populism as Sumner’s Forgotten Man started to lose patience.

- By the nineteenth century, it was clear to some financial observers that speculative manias tended to coincide with periods of low interest rates. As Walter Bagehot, the Victorian era’s most famous financial journalist, liked to say, ‘John Bull can stand many things but he can’t stand two per cent.’ It was Bagehot who elaborated the rule that during financial panics the central bank must lend freely (Chapter 5), although his stipulation that relief lending should only be provided against high-quality collateral at penal rates is ignored by modern lenders of last resort. Modern central bankers fret about the twin evils of inflation and deflation. Their goal is to achieve a stable price level. Yet over the past hundred years, several great credit booms – including the credit boom of the 1920s (Chapter 6), Japan’s bubble economy of the 1980s and the global credit bubble preceding the 2008 Lehman crisis (Chapter 7) – have occurred at times when inflation was quiescent. On each of these occasions, the lack of inflation encouraged central banks to maintain interest rates below the economy’s growth rate. Each of these credit booms ended in disaster.

- long-term rates, policy rates and market rates, risk-free rates and rates on private debt. Large companies issue a vast number of different securities, each of which sports a different yield. Individual countries have their own interest rates, related largely to their inflation and default history. Differences between rates are mostly related to risk, and the relationship between them varies over time. Yet if it’s acceptable to talk about the ‘price level’, composed of the prices of countless goods and services, then the rate of interest is also an acceptable shorthand for discussing the entire spectrum of interest rates.

- The most important question addressed in this book is whether a capitalist economy can function properly without market-determined interest. Those, like Proudhon, who argue that interest is fundamentally unjust don’t believe in its necessity. To modern monetary policymakers, interest is viewed primarily as a lever to control the level of consumer prices. From this perspective, there’s no problem in taking interest rates below zero to ward off the evil of deflation. But influencing the level of inflation is just one of several functions of interest, and possibly the least important.

- As Bastiat understood, a very low rate of interest may benefit the rich, who have access to credit, more than the poor. In his debate with Proudhon, Bastiat pointed out that time had value. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=575))

- Our word capital comes from caput, a head of cattle. These derivations, claim Sydney Homer and Richard Sylla, imply that interest originated with loans of seeds and of animals. These were loans for productive purposes. The seeds yielded an increase. At harvest time the seed could conveniently be returned with interest. Some part or all of the animal’s progeny could be returned with the animal. We shall never know but we can surmise that the concept of interest in its modern sense arose from just such productive loans.4 ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=611))

- In similar vein, Irving Fisher writes that Nature is, to a great extent, reproductive. Growing crops and animals often make it possible to endow the future more richly than the present. Man can obtain from the forest or the farm more by waiting than by premature cutting of trees or by exhausting the soil. In other words, Nature’s productivity has a strong tendency to keep up the rate of interest.6 ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=623))

- Over the ages the linguistic connection between a loan and its natural fecundity became more abstract. The word usury derives from the Latin usuarius, meaning ‘one who has the use but not ownership of a thing’.7 In the seventeenth century, a loan was still commonly referred to as the ‘use’ of money.

- The calculation of interest requires standardized measurements of time and value. The Sumerian calendar contained thirty days in the month and twelve months in the year.fn3 Time, distance and weight, and also money and interest were measured in fractions of sixty – a number that lent itself to simple calculation being the lowest number divisible by the first six integers.14 Working out how much interest was due could still be a complex business. Pupils were taught how to calculate the rate of interest on a loan in which both principal and interest were combined.15 One test required the student in Old-Babylonian times to answer the following question: ‘Give 1 gur at interest; in how many years are capital and interest equal?’fn4 ‘Awkward calculation,’ we are told, ‘is one of the characteristics of Babylonian mathematics.’16 ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=662))

- The Enmetena document points to an early and enduring problem with interest, namely that when a debt compounds with interest it is liable to become unpayable. The Sumerians had a phrase for compound interest, mash mash, which implies livestock replicating itself, so the debt multiplies ad infinitum.30 The problem of debt compounding at a geometrical rate has never lost its fascination. As the English philosopher Richard Price calculated in the late eighteenth century: ‘A penny … put out to 5 per cent. compound interest at our Saviour’s birth, would, by this time, (that is, in 1773 years) have increased to more money than would be contained in 150 millions of globes, each equal to the earth in magnitude, and all solid gold.’ Karl Marx cited Price’s calculations approvingly (as did Proudhon in his debate with Bastiat).31 Debt crises, exacerbated no doubt by the horrors of compound interest, were a regular feature of Mesopotamian history. It is perhaps no coincidence that Enmetena of Lagash was also the first ruler in the ancient world to proclaim a debt cancellation.

- Keynes, who studied Babylonian monetary history while researching his Treatise on Money, believed that interest rates were determined by custom rather than market forces. As his disciple Joan Robinson put it, interest has a ‘Cheshire cat grin [which] … remains after the circumstances which gave rise to it in the past have completely vanished’.41 Marx held a similar view, writing that ‘customs, juristic tradition, etc., have as much to do with determining the average rate of interest as competition itself.’42 ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=773))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Yet it’s also clear that ancient interest rates were not solely determined by custom and law. Morris Silver maintains that the ancient loan market responded to changes in the supply and demand for credit.fn8 As we have seen, there were many private lenders in Mesopotamia – presumably they needed to be enticed into lending with the offer of a reasonably attractive reward. Loans made in the name of a temple deity were often at a lower rate to those provided by private individuals. This may be an early example of subsidized public lending, or perhaps the temples attracted a better class of debtor – after all, no one wants to default to a god. Higher rates on barley loans possibly reflected the fact that such loans were made at times when corn was scarce and that the loans were to be repaid after the harvest when barley was cheap and abundant.45 Despite the long-term stability of what one might call the ‘benchmark’ rate of interest in the ancient world there is also evidence that market rates varied across time and place. In the Neo-Babylonian period, rates as low as 5 per cent and as high as 240 per cent have been recorded. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=788))

- Higher interest rates contained a risk premium, with loans to trading partnerships, known as harranu loans, yielding as much as 40 per cent (but if the ship was lost at sea the principal did not have to be repaid).47 Interest rates in the Assyrian commercial stations of Cappadocia were higher than in Mesopotamia. Great merchants paid lower rates than less creditworthy borrowers,48 while the interest premium on barley loans may have provided insurance against the risk of a royal decree of debt cancellation.49 It is clear that interest rates were not correlated with economic growth, either in the ancient world or afterwards. In the first millennium of the current era, global economic growth has been estimated at a mere 0.01 per cent per annum. Yet, during this thousand-year period, real interest rates in Europe ranged between 6 and 12 per cent.50 Nor do we observe any connection between the interest rate and demographic change. In fact, population growth and interest rates have often moved in opposite directions.51 The view that the rate of interest is determined by ‘real’ economic, as opposed to monetary, factors was advanced by the Scottish philosopher David Hume in his influential essay ‘Of Interest’ (1752).52 Yet Hume’s claim that interest rates are unaffected by changes in the money supply is not supported by the ancient history. After Alexander the Great seized and distributed large stocks of Persian gold and silver, prices are said to have risen and interest rates declined.53 Suetonius, in The Twelve Caesars, describes how, ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=799))

- when the Emperor Augustus brought the treasure belonging to the kings of Egypt back to Rome, money became plentiful and interest rates fell from 6 to 4 per cent.54 After Augustus’ death, the Emperor Tiberius hoarded money, with the result that interest rates rose above the legal limit and a banking crisis erupted in AD 33. Tiberius then decided to lend out the imperial treasure free of interest to patrician families, which brought about an immediate decline in interest rates and an end to the crisis.55 His actions constituted the world’s first experience of quantitative easing.fn9 In short, the ancient history of interest provides no strong support for any particular view as to how the rate of interest is formed. Law and custom obviously played an important role. Yet occasional changes in the quantity of money in circulation also appear to have influenced interest rates. Market forces were at play, to some extent at least. We see them in the variety of rates on offer and in the risk premiums charged on certain loans.56 As major lenders, temples and palaces had an influence on the supply of credit and its price (interest), just as the modern central bank does today.… ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=816))

- A Wall Street banker sent back to Larsa in the seventeenth century BC would find much that was familiar. Interest arose from some combination of need and greed. Interest existed at such an early stage of civilization because capital was in short supply. The palaces and temples had important outlays and needed to receive their dues and taxes on time. So they charged interest for late payment, just as the tax authorities do today. By demanding interest on loans, these public institutions were in effect rationing their resources. Barley loans were made to the hungry and to farmers who required seed corn. Lenders, private and public, were able to charge interest because wealth was unevenly distributed, and they possessed a command over resources which others – say, an ambitious alewife – wanted ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=851))

- to borrow and were prepared to pay for the privilege. ‘The emergence of interest to incentivize lending is the most significant of all innovations in the history of finance,’ writes the financial historian William Goetzmann.60 This point is well made. Finance allows people to transact across time. The farmer borrows barley to sow his fields but must wait until harvest before repaying the debt. Industrial processes – even the light crafts-based industries of the Ancient Near East – require time in production from raw materials to the sale of finished goods. A text from third-millennium Mesopotamia shows that the preparation of cloth took over a year.61 Foreign trade consumes a lot of time. When capital is tied up in industry or trade, the interest charge bears some connection to the time used in production. In any society with private property, whether in Mesopotamia or later civilizations, the payment of interest is required to induce people to lend their resources. Without interest, they would inevitably have hoarded their capital. In ancient Babylon, a person with spare funds had a choice between buying and cultivating some land or lending the money to a third party who could use the loan to acquire a farm. It seems obvious that the rate of interest and the productivity of capital, in this case the farm surplus, should bear some relation to each other.

- Two millennia later, property markets remain sensitive to changes in the money supply and interest rates. As the Englishman Nicholas Barbon wrote in the late seventeenth century: ‘Interest is the Rent of Stock [i.e. capital], and is the same as the Rent of Land: The first, is the Rent of the Wrought or Artificial Stock; the Latter, of the Unwrought, or Natural Stock.’62 The Scottish notation for interest in Barbon’s day was ‘@rents’.63 In the following century, the French economist and statesman Anne-Robert Jacques Turgot elaborated on Barbon’s insight: ‘Every capital in the form of money … is the equivalent of a piece of land producing a revenue equal to a particular fraction of this sum.’64 For Turgot, the world of finance was a mirror held up to the world, with real and… ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=872))

- To twenty-first-century policymakers, the interest rate is simply a lever used to control inflation and tweak economic output. Yet an acquaintance with the Babylonian origins of interest should give pause for thought. Interest has always been with us because resources have always been scarce and must be rationed somehow, because wealth is unequally distributed between creditors and borrowers, and because, as Böhm-Bawerk says, ‘interest is the soul of credit.’ Interest exists because loans are productive, and even when not productive still have value. It exists because those in possession of capital need to be induced to lend, and because lending is a risky business. It exists because production takes place over time and human beings are… ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=882))

- When money is lent on a contract to receive … [there is] an increase by way of compensation for the use; which is generally called interest by those who think it lawful, and usury by those who do not.

- Yet the Aristotelian critique of usury contains a serious flaw. Both the Greek philosopher and his medieval follower Aquinas claimed that money existed solely for exchange. According to their view, the lender surrenders all ownership of his money at the moment a loan is made. But as economics textbooks invariably point out, money is also a store of value. While the lender surrenders the exchange value of money, he retains its stored value, held in the form of a debt. That’s why creditors from Babylonian times onwards have always taken collateral for the period of a loan. Aristotle overlooks the fact that lending takes place across time – that it is an intertemporal transaction, a curious omission given his writings on the nature of time. Interest is a charge for the use of money over a certain period of time. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=955))

- Seneca’s notion that time is man’s most precious possession resurfaces in the Italian Renaissance in the writings of the architect and humanist Leon Battista Alberti (1404–72). In his Libri della Famiglia, composed in the 1430s, one of Alberti’s characters instructs on the proper management of time: ‘for I would sooner lose sleep than lose time, that is, than let the right moment for doing something slip by.’17 Fernand Braudel writes that Alberti signals a shift from the earlier Scholastic view, when ‘time had been considered as belonging to God alone; to sell it (in the shape of interest) was to sell non suum, what did not belong to one. But now time was once more becoming a dimension of human life, one of man’s possessions which he would do well not to waste.’18 ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=989))

- Once the idea took hold that time not only had value but was an individual’s possession, clerical injunctions against usury lost much of their force. If a merchant gained from a loan, why shouldn’t the lender share in those profits? In fact, the idea that the lender should be protected against lost profits is embedded in the very concept of interest. The word derives from the Latin interesse, a legal term under Roman law (‘id quod interest’) for compensation paid by a defaulting debtor. The Code of Justinian, issued in sixth-century Byzantium, allowed lenders to claim a penalty for late repayment. From a legal perspective, interest was viewed as the opportunity cost suffered by a creditor who, being deprived of his capital, could not make profitable use of his money elsewhere.

Interest is the difference in monetary values across time, the rate at which present consumption is exchanged for future consumption. Interest represents the time value of money.

- The Marshmallow Test shows that humans, or at least pre-schoolers, are impatient. They exhibit positive ‘time preference’. The bonus marshmallow can be seen as a kind of interest. Various arguments have been advanced as to why people prefer present over future satisfactions. Child development psychologists, including Mischel, ascribe impatience to stress early in life, which activates the brain’s limbic system.56 Economists have more prosaic explanations. Given that life is nasty, brutish and often short, some reward for delaying immediate pleasures makes sense. It may also be the case that humans are congenitally short-sighted and underestimate their future wants. And, even if none of the above held true, when an economy is steadily expanding most people can expect to become richer over time; since their future income exceeds their current income, people will value it less.

- Time preference explains interest on consumption loans, and why supposedly ‘usurious’ rates are not necessarily unfair. A payday loan of $20 to repay $25 at the end of the week makes for a very high annualized rate, but the borrower may put an even higher premium on a glass of beer and a square meal enjoyed that night. Time preference also determines how long investors are prepared to wait for a return on their capital. It was John Rae, a little-known early nineteenth-century Scottish economist, who first mooted a connection between investment and time preference (for which he was later credited by Böhm-Bawerk and Fisher). The formation of capital, said Rae, ‘implies the sacrifice of some smaller present good, for the production of some greater future good’.66 ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1213))

- be paid now is of more value than £1,000 to be paid £10 a year for 100 years.’67 By discounting the future cash flow generated by a stock, bond, building or any other income-producing asset, interest allows us to arrive at its present value. Capital value and interest are inversely related: a high discount or ‘capitalization’ rate produces a low capital value and vice versa. An anonymous pamphlet, published in 1621, claimed that ‘land and money are ever in balance one against the other; and when money is dear, land is cheap, and where land is cheap money is dear.’68 Without interest, it would not be possible to put a price on an acre of land, Sir William Petty observed half a century later. Rents in future years must be worth less than this year’s rent, Petty said, otherwise ‘an acre of land would be equal in value to a thousand acres of the same land; which is absurd, an infinity of units being equal to an infinity of thousands.’fn7 In the following century, Adam Smith described how the price of land depended on the market rate of interest. In The Wealth of Nations (published in 1776) Smith noted that land prices had risen in recent decades as interest rates declined.

- Later generations of economists built upon Rae’s insights. The Victorian W. S. Jevons claimed that businesses would borrow to invest – which he described as adding time to the period of production – up to the point at which the marginal return on investment was equal to the rate of interest.70 Böhm-Bawerk had a similar idea, maintaining that a decline in the rate of interest would lead to the adoption of more ‘roundabout’ (time-consuming) methods of production. Modern monetary economists incorporate time preference into their models. But these models blithely assume that the prevailing rate of interest automatically reflects society’s time preference. But what if that is not the case? This problem exercised the minds of Böhm-Bawerk’s distinguished pupils, among them Friedrich Hayek, Mises and Schumpeter. For Hayek, it was axiomatic,… ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1239))

- terminology, the ‘structure of production’ lengthens. If interest rates are kept below their natural level, misguided investments occur: too much time is used in production, or, put another way, the investment returns don’t justify the initial outlay. ‘Malinvestment’, to use a term popularized by Austrian economists, comes in many shapes and sizes. It might involve some expensive white-elephant project, such as constructing a tunnel under the sea, or a pie-in-the-sky technology scheme with no serious prospect of ever turning a profit. Consumer behaviour is also affected when interest rates are pushed below society’s time preference. Cheap credit encourages households to take on too much debt; they borrow and spend, bringing consumption forward, but when the future arrives the cupboard is bare. Hayek thought that periods of widespread malinvestment must end in economic crisis. As events leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 showed, the build-up of excess amounts of consumer debt can be equally disastrous.

An upcoming merchant (and future governor of the East India Company), Josiah Child, had a surefire proposal to cure England’s woes. Child proposed a reduction in the cost of borrowing; an ‘abatement of interest’, he suggested, ‘would tend to the increase of trade and advance the value of the lands of England’. The businessman outlined his ideas in a book, Brief Observations Concerning Trade and the Interest of Money (1668), which became one of the most popular works on economics to appear in the seventeenth century.

- iniquities of usury per se to the perceived mischief caused by excessively high rates of interest. One of the earliest and most distinguished critics of high interest was the philosopher and statesman Sir Francis Bacon. In 1612, Bacon published an essay, ‘On Usury’, in which he conceded that some charge for borrowing money was inevitable, ‘for since there must be borrowing and lending, and men are so hard of heart, as they will not lend freely, usury must be permitted.’ Nevertheless, he identified several ‘discommodities of usury’: First, that it makes fewer merchants … second, that it makes poor merchants … third … is the decay of customs [tax receipts] … fourth, that it bringeth the treasure of a realm, or state, into a few hands … and ever a state flourisheth, when wealth is more equally spread … The fifth, that it beats down the price of land … The sixth, that it doth dull and damp all industries, improvements, and new inventions … The last, that it is the canker and ruin of many men’s estates; which, in process of time, breeds a public poverty. Having been personally in debt since his youth, and once arrested for nonpayment, Bacon knew from experience how interest ‘ate up old estates with ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1280))

- Like many English ‘moneyed men’ of his day, Child looked enviously at Holland, whose merchants were able to borrow at 3 per cent in Amsterdam to lend onwards in London at 6 per cent.9 He believed Holland’s easy money was ‘the Causa Causans of all the other Causes of the Riches of that People’.10 A legal reduction in interest, Child argued, would help England compete with the Lowlanders. He envisaged a virtuous circle of ever-lower rates, whereby ‘the abatement of Interest causeth an encrease of Wealth, and the encrease of Wealth may cause a further abatement ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1328))

- of Interest.’fn1 Like countless commentators over the ages, Child drew attention to the iniquities of compound interest, which serves to ‘make the Lenders monstrous rich’. An abatement would bring a ‘diffusive principle’, spreading riches more widely.11 Yet Child was a most unlikely champion of the poor. Few men in England had grown more ‘monstrous rich’ than this, in the words of diarist John Evelyn, ‘most sordidly avaricious’ merchant.12 In truth, Child’s advocacy for lower interest was intensely self-interested. Like a modern buyout baron’s, his control of the East India Company, where he was shortly to become governor, was maintained through the extensive use of debt: the greater the gap between the company’s profits and the cost of borrowing, the greater his personal gains.fn2 Child was also an advocate of the company’s trading monopoly who distributed bribes to Members of Parliament to protect the ‘Honourable Company’, as the East India Company was then known, from competition. Contemporaries were well aware that he was talking his own book. As a cynical pamphleteer observed, demands for lowering interest were really designed for the ‘ingrossing all trade, into the hands of a few rich Merchants, who have Money enough of their own to Trade with, to the excluding all young men, that wants it’.13 ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1334))

- Besides, Locke believed that bankers wouldn’t pass on the benefits of lower interest but pocket the gains themselves. Indebted businessmen, like Child (whom he didn’t mention by name), would also profit. ‘It will be a gain to the borrowing merchant,’ wrote Locke. ‘For if he borrow at four per cent. and his returns be twelve per cent. he will have eight per cent. and the lender four.’20 ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1379))

- Locke feared that a reduction of interest would increase the demand for loans, for ‘every man would be forward to borrow, and desire that he might have other men’s money to employ to his advantage.’ Again this wasn’t desirable since it would ‘multiply the number of borrowers among us, of which it is certain we have too many already’.21 He didn’t see why feckless borrowers should be bailed out by cutting interest rates. Nor did he think that trade would benefit. On the contrary, a lower rate would ‘discourage lending at such a disproportion of profit, to risque’. Money would circulate more slowly and be hoarded, ‘for the Bankers … at that low Rate would be content to have more Money lye dead by them, than now when it is higher.’ And if money were withdrawn from circulation and hoarded, then its value would increase relative to other commodities (i.e., deflation would ensue).fn3 It was widely believed by contemporaries that a reduction of interest would raise the value of land. Locke was unpersuaded. He thought other factors played upon land prices, and, even if land prices were to rise, there would be no advantage to the nation as a whole, since the lowering of interest merely ‘a little alters the distribution of the Money’: sellers of land would receive more money but buyers would have to pay more.22 Locke was concerned that cheaper borrowing would push money into the hands of City bankers, raising London house prices relative to the rest of the country.23 ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1383))

- high interest because they were poor.24 The Dutch enjoyed greater prosperity and cheaper borrowing, said Locke, not because low interest brought forth riches but because ‘the industry and frugality of that people, makes them content to work cheaper, and sell at less profit than their neighbours, and so get the trade from them.’ Locke also pointed out that England’s trade had thrived during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when interest was at 10 per cent: I will not say high Interest was the Cause of it; for I rather think that our thriving Trade was the Cause of high Interest, every one craving Money to employ in a profitable Commerce. But this I think I may reasonably infer from it, That lowering of Interest is not a sure way to improve either our Trade or Wealth.25 In short, Child’s claim that England’s prosperity would return simply by lowering interest rates was absurd: ‘If ill Husbandry has wasted our Riches,’ Locke wrote, we cannot hope, simply by reducing the rate of interest, to ‘… ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1400))

- The notion that interest must be free to find its own level underpins Locke’s argument. Any attempt to regulate interest, he believed, would only ‘increase the arts of lending’ as borrowers and lenders would seek to evade the law. For Locke, money was composed of precious metals, with a certain intrinsic value and of limited supply. This being the case, he thought the level of interest was fixed by the supply and demand for money, just like any other commodity. But what was the appropriate level of interest? This question has plagued economists ever since. Locke acknowledged it was a thorny issue: ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1432))

- what the stated Rate of Interest should be in the constant change of Affairs, and flux of Money, is hard to determine. Possibly it may be allowed as a reasonable Proposal, that it should be within such Bounds, as should not on the one side quite Eat up the Merchant’s and the Tradesman’s profit, and discourage their Industry; nor on the other hand so low, as should hinder Men from Risquing their Money in other Men’s Hands, and so rather chuse to keep it out of Trade, than venture it upon so small profit.31 At the time of writing this, Locke assumed that in England the natural rate of interest – or what he called ‘the natural value of Money’ – was above 4 per cent and probably closer to 6 per cent. Child’s writings, on the other hand, implied that the natural rate must be below 4 per cent. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1437))

- A century after Thornton, the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell discussed the potential for market rates of interest to diverge from the natural rate (i.e. the return on real capital) in his influential book Prices and Interest. Wicksell concluded that any discrepancy between market rates and the natural rate would be revealed by changes in the general price level: if interest rates were set too low there would be inflation, and if too high then deflation. For better or worse, this remains conventional wisdom among monetary policymakers in the twenty-first century. (Central bankers’ Wicksellian obsession with price stability in the 1920s and the early years of this century is discussed later in this book.) In truth, the natural rate of interest is unobservable, a pure abstraction – in Wicksell’s description it is the rate at which capital would be lent in a world of barter, lacking any type of money.34 In Locke’s day, at least, money was backed by rare metals. In the modern world, however, money is created whenever a bank makes a loan and the link between acts of saving and lending has become more tenuous. In the early 1930s, Keynes and his Cambridge colleague Piero Sraffa went so far as to deny that a natural rate of interest could exist for an entire economy. Nevertheless, the concept ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1461))

- of a natural rate – also referred to as the ‘neutral rate’, the ‘equilibrium rate’ and ‘r-star’ – remains indispensable for economists. Even though it cannot be known with certainty, it is useful to hold in mind how the world would look if the natural rate held sway; a rate that was set, as Locke imagined, by individuals freely lending and borrowing money in the market, like any other commodity; a rate that accurately reflects society’s time preference; which ensures that we neither borrow too much nor save too little; which ensures capital is used efficiently, and puts an accurate value on land and other assets; a rate which provides savers with a fair return and is not so low as to subsidize bankers and their financial friends, nor so high as to bite borrowers. Like Locke, we may be fuzzy about where the natural rate of interest lies exactly, but we can tell its absence. When the cost of borrowing is set at too high a level, then businesses won’t borrow to invest, creditors gain unduly at the expense of debtors, capital values are depressed, workers remain idle and the economy stagnates. When bond yields far exceed the growth in national income, then existing debt becomes burdensome and bankruptcy beckons. (Economists refer to this state of affairs as a ‘debt trap’.) High interest is associated with deflation and what Bacon called ‘public poverty’. As we shall see, Britain suffered many of these ills after its ill-fated return to the Gold Standard ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1471))

But it’s not just a question of changes in the level of consumer prices. When asset price bubbles proliferate, credit booms, finance crowds out honest endeavour, savings collapse and capital is misallocated on a grand scale, the chances are that market rates of interest are not aligned with the natural rate. Locke was the first writer to consider at length the potential damage produced by taking interest rates below their natural level. It’s worth summarizing his position in modern language. In his Considerations Locke suggested the following undesirable outcomes might occur: financiers would benefit at the expense of ‘widows and orphans’ wealth would be redistributed from savers to borrowers… ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1482))

- money would flow abroad in search of higher returns asset price inflation would make the rich richer the reduction of interest rates wouldn’t revive a moribund economy In short, Locke argued that a forced reduction in interest rates imparts no benefit to a society lacking in ‘industry and frugality’.35 Such views on interest hold little sway in the modern world. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, central bankers slashed interest rates, hoping to revive economies by easing the burden of debt and boosting asset values. Their aims were remarkably similar to those espoused by the seventeenth-century advocates of easy money. Some policymakers even shared Josiah Child’s extraordinary belief that raising asset values by lowering the rate of interest was akin to creating real wealth. After a decade and more of unconventional monetary policies, it appears that Locke was prescient. As we describe in later chapters, the central bankers’ policy of ultra-low interest rates hurt savers (‘widows and orphans’) while benefiting financiers and senior executives, who reaped windfall gains after the cost of borrowing fell below corporate profitability. Paper wealth has multiplied while genuine wealth has stagnated. Locke’s suggestion that the lowering of interest would induce banks to hoard, thereby slowing the circulation of money and promoting deflation (‘raising the value of money’) also came to pass. Nor did the collapse of interest rates bring about a reduction in debt levels, as the younger Culpeper promised, but induced excess borrowing, as Locke had foreseen. Finally, the dramatic collapse of interest rates failed to deliver a robust economy: ‘if ill husbandry has wasted our riches, [we cannot] hope by such kind of laws [i.e., lowering interest rates] to raise them to their former value.’ Once again, Locke was spot on. In the light of recent experience, Child’s claims that a drop in interest rates would reduce inequality, discourage luxury and boost the population appear cruelly misguided.fn4 Still, the seventeenth-century exponents of easy… ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1490))

He was also the founder and head of the French central bank, and ran a vast corporate enterprise, known as the Mississippi Company, whose activities encompassed a large share of the French economy. Law’s shareholding in the company was worth a vast fortune, and he was ennobled as the Duke of Arkansas. That a foreigner and fugitive from English justice should rise to such heights in his adopted country seems scarcely believable. Daniel Defoe, the keenest financial observer of the age, disparaged Law’s success. In order to rise in this world, wrote Defoe, The case is plain, you must put on a sword, kill a beau or two, get into Newgate [gaol], be condemned to be hanged, break prison if you can, – remember that by the way, – get over to some strange country, turn stock-jobber, set up a Mississippi stock, bubble a nation, and you may soon be a great man.3 Equally remarkable is the fact that this convicted murderer should later earn a place in the pantheon of great economists. ‘He worked out the economics of his projects,’ enthuses Schumpeter, ‘with a brilliance and, yes, profundity, which places him in the front rank of ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1537))

- monetary theorists of all times.’4 Law has been called the original monetarist – an eighteenth-century forerunner of Milton Friedman. His monetary policy prescriptions form the basis for modern central banking. Yet Law’s ‘System’, as he called it, was a spectacular failure. No sooner had the Scotsman achieved his eminence than the bubble burst, his project and monetary ideas utterly discredited. Most accounts of the Mississippi Bubble are concerned with the ‘madness of crowds’, as evidenced by the frenzied speculation that took place in the rue Quincampoix, the Parisian open-air stock market. But this outbreak of speculative fever wasn’t a random event. In this chapter, we trace the source of the Mississippi bubble and its subsequent collapse to Law’s ambitious monetary experiment and, in particular, his policy of expanding France’s money supply and cutting interest rates. While Locke considered the inconveniences that might take the rate of interest below its natural level, Law conducted the world’s first experiment with easy money. His story of boom and bust is a cautionary tale for our times. ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1548))

Following the example of the General Bank’s earlier flotation, three-quarters of the subscription could be paid for in depreciated government debt. For the first couple of years the stock flat-lined. But then Law opened the monetary spigots. In December 1718, the General Bank was nationalized and renamed the Royal Bank. This was the type of institution that Law had envisioned in his earlier writings. Unlike the General Bank, the Royal Bank’s notes were denominated in the unit of account, the livre tournois, rather than gold. This removed any restriction on the amount of money that could be issued. As soon as the Royal Bank started printing its paper money, Mississippi shares perked up.

- Law’s earlier claim that an increase in the circulation of money would reduce the rate of interest was vindicated. As banknotes gushed forth, French interest rates collapsed. In August 1719, the Mississippi Company agreed to take over some 1.2 billion (later raised to 1.7 billion) livres of France’s national debt, for which it was to receive a payment of 3 per cent. Government creditors could exchange their bonds for shares, but those who refused this offer would find the interest payment reduced to 2 per cent (from 5 per cent).27 As a later commentator wrote, by the stroke of a pen, the holders of the greater part of the government indebtedness found their investments destroyed at a period when the decline in interest and the rise in the value of real and personal property seemed to cut them off from all avenues for investment except those which led up to the system itself.28 ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1690))

Mississippi shares fell sharply in February 1720 after the Company’s office for the purchase and sale of shares was closed. Law then changed tack, reopened the office and promised to fix the share price at 9,000 livres, at which point, wrote the treasurer Dutot, the shares ‘became proper to fulfil the uses of money’.48 This meant that a potentially limitless number of banknotes might be issued to maintain the market price of the shares. On the foreign exchanges, the French currency continued to fall against gold-backed sterling. On 21 May, Law changed his position once again, announcing that the share price would be pegged at 5,000 livres – roughly half its peak level. The banknotes were also scheduled to lose half their value relative to coin, and the number of notes in circulation was to be reduced.

- Law had finally embarked on a deflationary course. It was not a popular decision. Riots broke out, the Royal Bank was stormed, and Law’s personal carriage was smashed to pieces by the mob. The Regent quickly annulled the decree and sacked his finance minister. Law was subsequently reinstated, but all confidence in the System was shattered. In early December, Law tendered his resignation. The following month, a little more than a year since his appointment as finance minister, Law slipped out of France, leaving his dreams, fortune and wife and daughter behind. His great monetary experiment had failed. ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1794))

- After the bubble burst, Mississippi Company shares lost around 90 per cent of their value, falling back to the level they had traded at in 1718. François Velde, an economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve, estimates that a fair value for Mississippi stock during the bubble year was around 1,875 livres, roughly a fifth of the peak share price.54 This was not the first time, nor the last, that speculators would place too high a price on some exciting new development. As James Buchan writes, their delusion lies in the conception of time. The great stock-market bull seeks to condense the future into a few days, to discount the long march of history, and capture the present value of all future riches. It is his strident demand for everything right now – to own the future in money right now – that cannot tolerate even the notion of futurity – that dissolves the speculator into the psychopath.55 It seems no coincidence that the speculator’s mistaken conception of time has often appeared at moments when the price of time was abnormally low, as ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1832))

- The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 produced economic and financial conditions – a toxic mixture of deflation, high unemployment and soaring government debt – somewhat similar to France’s after the death of Louis XIV. Monetary policymakers responded to these conditions by taking a leaf from Law’s copybook, pushing down interest rates and acquiring large chunks of their national debt (although not going quite so far as Law) with newly printed money. There’s another similarity. After 2008, the Federal Reserve embarked on a deliberate policy of boosting asset prices by reducing the discount rate. While Law created Mississippi millionaires, his twenty-first-century imitators minted billionaires by the score. In the decade after the global financial crisis, central bankers justified their unconventional monetary ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1861))

- policies on the grounds that consumer price inflation was quiescent. But, as Cantillon pointed out, when a national bank turns on the printing press and buys up government debt, the newly created money is initially trapped within the financial system, where it inflates financial assets rather than consumer prices, and only slowly seeps out into the wider economy.fn11 As we describe in later chapters, Defoe’s description of Law’s System as ‘an inconceivable species of mere air and shadow’ might equally well apply to the central-bank engineered economic recovery after 2008. The irrepressible Law never admitted to the flaws inherent in his System. The French ambassador Count de Gergy, who visited Law in Venice shortly before his death in 1729, reported that he had ‘never seen a man more stubborn than him about his cursed System, and in such a way that it is probable that from the start of its operations he really believed his projects to be infallible’.61 Central bankers, who resort to printing money, manipulating interest rates and fuelling asset price bubbles, exude a similar air of infallibility. They fail to heed Cantillon’s warning that it’s all very well to embark on a grand monetary experiment, but there is no painless exit. ‘What central bankers are doing now is exactly what Law recommended,’ Law’s biographer Antoin Murphy wrote in the wake of the global financial crisis. ‘From this perspective, it may be argued that, notwithstanding the failure of the Mississippi ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1867))

- While Overstone elaborated the phases of the credit cycle, Bagehot looked into its causes. The cycle arose, he said, from ‘the different amounts of loanable capital which are available at different times for the supply of trade’.5 Any number of reasons might cause the amount of loanable capital to vary – a gold discovery, the excessive issue of banknotes or the expansion of trade. But there was also a psychological element. ‘Credit, the disposition of one man to trust another, ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1919))

- is singularly varying,’ Bagehot wrote.6 Interest is the barometer of trust, rising and falling over the course of the cycle. Too much trust is a dangerous thing. Bagehot described the lax financial behaviour that typified the peak of the credit cycle: The good times, too, of high price almost always engender much fraud. All people are most credulous when they are most happy; and when much money has just been made, when some people are really making it, when most people think they are making it, there is a happy opportunity for ingenious mendacity.7 As the cycle entered its final stages, the Bank of England would be forced to raise rates. The important thing, said Bagehot, was that it should act promptly. Bad lending had to be nipped in the bud.fn1 ‘The best method – the sole method – to contract the entire credit currency in this or in any other country is to raise the rate of interest.’ If the Bank failed to act in a timely fashion, a crisis became inevitable. During a panic trust evaporates and interest rates soar. After a prolonged period of high rates, however, ‘business is checked, prices fall [deflation], the exchanges are righted, and the balance of trade redressed.’8 Once the panic has passed, capital lies idle and savings accumulate, and the supply of loanable capital exceeding ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1924))

- As a banker and financial journalist, Bagehot observed that outbreaks of financial recklessness did not occur at random. Rather, they tended to appear at times when money was easy and interest rates low. He expressed this insight in his own inimitable fashion: ‘John Bull can stand many things, but he cannot stand two per cent.’14 When interest rates fell to such a low level, investors reacted to the loss of income by taking greater risks. In modern language, they engage in ‘yield-chasing’. John Bull – that personification of English common sense – made his first appearance in Bagehot’s writings in an article for the Inquirer published on 31 July 1852: ‘John Bull’, says someone, ‘can stand a great deal, but he cannot stand two per cent …’ Here the moral obligation arises.

Later in the century, Joseph de la Vega in his book Confusion de Confusiones, the earliest account of stock market activity, reported that every day … the revenue from investments at fixed interest becomes less, inasmuch as it is difficult to find ways of investing money. The rate of interest on ordinary loans amounts … to only 2½ per cent. Therefore, even the wealthiest men are forced to buy stocks, and there are people who do not sell them when the prices have fallen, in order to avoid a loss.

Like John Law, the company’s directors sought to lower the cost of government debt, then largely consisting of expensive annuities, by converting the debt into shares. As with Law’s ill-fated project, the bubble occurred at a time of easy money.25 The yield on the country’s long-term government debt fell from 8 per cent in 1710 to around 4 per cent in the early 1720s. As in France, the decline in interest rates encouraged government creditors to exchange their annuities for South Sea shares, whose price soared nearly tenfold during the first half ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2042))

- The finance mania took off at a time when interest rates were at a nadir. In the summer of 1862, the Bank of England’s lending rate was at John Bull’s dreaded 2 per cent. The Economist’s editor wasn’t unduly concerned, however. Bagehot believed that low rates reflected a glut of savings. Within a couple of years interest rates had soared off their lows. In 1864, Bank rate hit a record 9 per cent. Bagehot was much heartened, going so far as to hail a new era: ‘the management of the Bank of England has so much improved,’ Bagehot gushed, ‘that we need no longer fear those periodic crises and panics which used to mark every long period of very unfavourable foreign exchange.’52 At the end of 1865, The Economist asserted ‘there are no bad debts and no collapse.

- bankers will not be impaired by any large losses or bad bills.’53 Bagehot was gravely mistaken. Another massive expansion of Britain’s railway system was under way – the proposed new lines amounted to half the country’s existing rail network. As with every investment mania, much of the capital was wasted. Railway finance was shaky. Contractors accepted payment in money bills, bonds and shares, which they sold on to the finance companies. It was this flood of domestic ill-investment, and the associated financing, that had forced up interest rates. In Das Kapital, Marx made an insightful comment on the failure of Overend Gurney. High interest might indicate prosperity, wrote Marx, but it could also indicate ‘that the country is undermined by the roving cavaliers of credit who can afford to pay a high interest because they pay it out of other people’s pockets … and meanwhile they live in grand style on anticipated profits.’54 ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2153))

- THE BAGEHOT RULE The collapse of Overend Gurney inspired Bagehot to set down his thoughts on the operations of the London money market. First published in 1873, Lombard Street owes its lasting fame to its author’s ideas on how a central bank should behave during a financial crisis. As the holder of the nation’s gold reserve, the Bank of England had a duty to lend during banking panics. ‘A panic, in a word, is a species of neuralgia, and according to the rules of science you must not starve it,’ Bagehot wrote. To that end, he recommended that during a panic the Bank of England should lend copiously against good securities and at a high rate of interest.

- It is no coincidence that the chief proselytizers for central bank accommodation came from banking families. The family fortunes of both Baring and Bagehot were endangered by uncontrolled panics. To be fair, it should be noted that the Bagehot rule, in its original form, sought to mitigate moral hazard. The scion of Stuckey’s recommended that during panics the Bank of England should only lend for a short period, against high-quality collateral and should charge a high rate of interest for its money.fn7 The Bagehot rule is much cited by monetary policymakers in the twenty-first century. After the 2008 global financial crisis, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, a former President of the New York Federal Reserve, referred to Lombard Street as the ‘bible of central banking’. In his memoirs, The Courage to Act, Geithner’s former boss, Ben Bernanke, mentions Bagehot more frequently than any other economist.64 When Bernanke’s Federal Reserve and other central banks stepped up as lenders of last resort during the crisis, Bagehot provided the cover for their trillions of dollars’ worth of central bank loans. Yet Bagehot’s stringent conditions were not followed. Modern lenders of last resort have only a tenuous connection with their Victorian antecedents. They do not lend at high interest but at the lowest rates. Their emergency loans are not provided for a short period, but for years on end. They do not lend against high-quality collateral but reach to the outer edges of the credit spectrum. Modern central bankers show far less concern for moral hazard than Bagehot – and their actions would give Thomson Hankey an acute case of neuralgia. They often cite deflation as a justification for extreme measures. Yet nowhere does Bagehot consider deflation to be a financial risk. It would be surprising had he done so, since the Victorian era was marked by long periods of mild deflation, punctuated by the occasional severe deflation witnessed during banking panics. Deflation that appears at such moments would have been seen as a symptom of credit sickness, the fever so to speak, rather than ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2209))

- In the Orient, he surmised, a man might put his money in gold or diamonds or even bury it, rather than lend at interest. Bagehot penned an editorial (The Economist, 23 November 1867) ‘On the Dangers of Lending to Semi-Civilised Countries’. The borrower under scrutiny was Egypt. It was not a question of that country’s great resources or agricultural fertility. Rather, what is required for the repayment of foreign debts, wrote Bagehot, is ‘a continuous polity; a fixed political morality; and a constant possession of money’. Egypt did not possess these qualities. The editorial concluded starkly: ‘We lend to countries whose condition we do not know, and whose want of civilisation we do not consider, and, therefore, we lose our money.’66 Bagehot’s words were wasted. Egypt was promising to pay 10 per cent, a sum large enough to blind investors to the fact that its ruler, the Khedive, was a spendthrift whose debts were at least fifteen times greater than his annual revenues. Over the following ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2239))

- years, a full-blown mania in foreign bonds appeared. The Latin American republics were back in favour. Japan issued its first foreign loan in 1870, paying 9 per cent. A Parliamentary Committee in July 1875 pronounced on the foreign lending mania: ‘Its revelations concerning market-rigging, concerning loan-issues made solely for the purpose of earning fat commissions, concerning interest kept up solely out of the interest on the loans threw serious distrust upon several firms of cosmopolitan bankers.’67 By this date many foreign loans had already defaulted. Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Paraguay stopped paying in 1872. Spain hung on until June 1873. Bolivia, Guatemala, Liberia and Uruguay suspended interest payments. Egypt nearly stopped doing so in 1873 but managed to roll over its maturing debt at extortionate rates. Eventually, the Khedive found a reprieve by selling a stake in the Suez Canal to the Disraeli government for the payment of £4 million. In February 1876, Bagehot reflected on the foreign lending craze. It was a familiar story. Periods of low domestic interest rates, it seemed, made the specious promise of high yields on foreign debt particularly attractive: the human mind likes 15 per cent; it likes things which promise much, which seem to bring large gains very close, which somehow excite sentiment and interest the imagination. The manufacturers of ‘financial schemes’ know this, and live by it. A long and painful experience is necessary to teach men that ‘15 per cent’ is dangerous; that new and showy schemes are to be distrusted; that the popular instinct on them is essentially fallible, and tends to prefer the brilliant policy above the sound – that which promises much and pays nothing, above that which, promising but little, pays that little.68 ([Location 2248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2248))

- For the first time it became possible for central bankers to conduct an ‘active’ monetary policy in pursuit of certain economic objectives.fn4 But the central bankers’ newfound discretion meant that the setting of interest rates inevitably became politicized, especially in Britain, whose attempt to return sterling to the Gold Standard was accompanied by high interest rates, unemployment and lingering deflation. By the summer of 1920, the Bank of England’s lending rate had climbed to 7 per cent. When Norman attempted to tighten further, he was opposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Austen Chamberlain. ‘Interest rates,’ Norman told an official at the New York Fed, ‘are now a political as well as a financial question.’9 Years later, the Bank of England Governor remarked to his counterpart at the Bank of France that he could not raise interest rates ‘without provoking a riot’.10 The social tensions produced by Britain’s high interest rates and an uncompetitive exchange rate eventually erupted in the General Strike of 1926. Britain’s ill-fated return to gold turned Keynes into a vehement critic of the Gold Standard and of high interest rates in general. ‘So long as unemployment is a matter of general political importance,’ he wrote in 1923, ‘it is impossible that Bank rate should be regarded, as it used to be, as the secret peculium of the Pope and Cardinals of the City.’11 For the rest of his life, the world’s most prominent economist never missed an opportunity to advocate lower interest rates.

America’s central bank, Anderson lamented, had been created to provide assistance during a financial crisis, ‘but from early 1924 down to the spring of 1928, it was used … to finance a stock market boom’.19 During those years, bank credit in the United States more than doubled. Much of the new lending was not employed by industry – commercial loans actually decreased – but went to finance stock loans, real estate mortgages and the purchase of foreign securities.

The Federal Reserve System is the antidote for money contraction and credit shortage,’ Mellon declared a year after the Long Island meeting.23 By taming the business cycle, however, the Fed inadvertently encouraged speculative behaviour.

- Loans on securities accounted for almost a third of lending by Federal Reserve member banks. By early 1929, total outstanding broker loans had reached almost $7 billion.28 The more money that poured into the stock market, the higher stock prices climbed. Towards the end of the decade, shares on the New York Stock Exchange were changing hands at bubble valuations.fn8 Companies with exciting new technologies, such as Radio Corporation of America and General Motors, whose profits lay in the distant future, attracted the most fervid attention. Benjamin Anderson thought the 1920s market similar to the late 1890s boom: ‘“Cheap money” characterized both “new eras,” and cheap money is the most dangerous intoxicant known to economic life, especially if it be prolonged through many years.’29 By placing too low a discount on the future earnings of companies, investors ended up paying too much. The discounting error was widely acknowledged at the time. In early 1928, Moody’s Investors Services declared that stock prices had ‘over-discounted anticipated progress’.30 After the crash, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote in their book Security Analysis that the late 1920s witnessed ‘a transfer of emphasis [in the valuation of stocks] from current income to future income and hence inevitably to future enhancement of principal value’.31 Or, as the market analyst Max Winkler memorably described: ‘The imagination of our investing public was greatly heightened by the discovery of a new phrase: discounting the future. However, a careful examination of quotations of many issues revealed that not only the future, but even the hereafter, was being discounted.’32 ([Location 2483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2483))

- In April 1928, Keynes met the Swiss banker Felix Somary at the Berlin home of Carl Melchior, a mutual friend.52 Somary’s disposition was so inherently bleak that he called his memoirs The Raven of Zürich. In the same month that Keynes expressed the view that the Fed would arrest any incipient depression, Somary was warning his clients of an impending crash. The danger, Somary said, came from the ‘wide gap between yields on the highest-priced shares on the stock exchange and ordinary interest rates. The lower the yields speculators expect from high-flyers on the markets, the greater the danger of a crash – and this development is going on in New York.’53 The Swiss banker left a record of his conversation with Keynes: Keynes asked me what I was advising clients. ‘To insulate themselves as much as possible from the coming crisis, and to avoid the markets,’ I replied. Keynes took the opposite view. ‘We will not have any more crashes in our time,’ he insisted, and asked me in detail for my opinions about individual companies.

Between 1927 and the end of 1929, Keynes’s personal fortune declined by more than three-quarters, from £44,000 to £7,815, as a result of heavy losses on commodity speculations, his use of portfolio leverage and his failure as an economist to anticipate Somary’s gathering storm clouds.54 ([Location 2598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2598))

- In a capitalist economy, Hayek said, continuous advances in productivity mean that consumer prices have a natural tendency to decline. During periods of rapid technological development and commodity gluts, such as the 1920s, the price level might be expected to decline quite rapidly. The pursuit of stable prices by central bankers, however, worked against this natural tendency.58 Monetary policy directed at stabilizing prices, said Hayek, ‘administers an excessive stimulus to the expansion of output as costs of production fall, and thus regularly makes a later fall in prices with a simultaneous contraction of output unavoidable.’ The future Nobel laureate wrote these words in 1928. In effect, Hayek was predicting that the Roaring Twenties would end in a deflationary bust.59 ([Location 2621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2621))

Between August 1929 and March 1933, as the US money supply collapsed by more than a third, the country experienced three successive banking crises and around a quarter of workers lost their jobs. These events, wrote Friedman and Schwartz, were ‘a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces … The drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequence of other economic changes.’69 No one took this message more to heart than Ben Bernanke, the head of Princeton’s economics department and a governor of the Federal Reserve from 2002 onwards.

Yet the Austrian’s interpretation of the 1920s and its aftermath has been more or less air-brushed from the history books, while Fisher’s monetarist view has become received wisdom. In his book on the Great Depression, Ben Bernanke suggested that to gain a proper understanding of this period was the ‘Holy Grail of macroeconomics’. According to Bernanke’s reading of events, the Fed’s key error was that it allowed consumer prices to fall after 1929. At Milton Friedman’s ninetieth birthday in November 2002, Governor Bernanke apologized on behalf of his employer for the 1930s catastrophe and vowed it would not happen again. At the time this seemed like a facetious gesture. Yet only six years later the United States was facing the most severe financial crisis in decades. As the newly installed Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bernanke found himself in the position to make good on this promise. He wasn’t going to make the same mistakes again.

- Japan’s great bubble economy now emerged. The nation’s money supply and credit expanded rapidly while interest rates were held well below the economy’s GDP growth rate.5 Business investment soared. Japanese corporations, which issued foreign currency warrant bonds, enjoyed a negative cost of borrowing after swapping the proceeds back into yen. Financial engineering, known as zaitech, became commonplace: companies borrowed to speculate in stocks through their brokerage trust or tokkin accounts. Easy money fuelled a bubble in equities and property. The real estate value of the imperial palace in Tokyo was famously estimated to have surpassed that of the entire state of California. Towards the end of the decade, inflation started to tick upwards. In 1989, the new Governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasushi Mieno, decided to prick the stock market bubble. The discount rate was raised on three occasions that year, in May, October and on Christmas Day, four days before the Nikkei index reached its all-time high.6 As property prices continued to rise in early 1990, the BOJ continued to raise the discount ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2777))

- Had the BOJ not attempted to burst the bubble, or had the central bank loosened policy more quickly after the bubble started to deflate, then the monetarists’ hypothesis, first elaborated by Fisher and disputed by Hayek – that price stability is a necessary prerequisite for economic and financial stability – might have been properly tested. Still, consumer prices in Japan remained stable for nearly a decade: it was only from the mid-1990s that deflation set in. By that date the real estate collapse had severely weakened Japan’s banking system. Nor should it be overlooked that deflation in Japan was mild compared to what the United States experienced in the Depression years, and the Japanese money supply continued growing throughout this period. Because of these differences, monetarists tend to emphasize the severe US deflation of the early 1930s when they assert that stable consumer prices create stable financial conditions.14 ([Location 2820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2820))

Greenspan was neither a career public servant, like Volcker, nor an academic economist (he dropped out of his PhD programme and later received an unconventional doctorate from New York University). He had once been a member of Ayn Rand’s ‘Collective’, the group of fervent admirers who gathered around the author of Atlas Shrugged, and even wrote a Randian article that upheld the Gold Standard and blamed the Federal Reserve for the 1929 crash.20 Despite this radical libertarian background, Greenspan was to prove an interventionist central banker. During his tenure as Fed Chairman, monetary policy was frequently tweaked to give the financial markets what they wanted. For which Greenspan earned lavish praise, becoming in time a totemic figure to Wall Street, a monetary shaman whose indecipherable incantations had the power to keep markets aloft. Senator John McCain once jested that if Greenspan were to die in office, he’d prop him up and put dark glasses on him.

Early in his tenure, he remarked that, ‘if I turn out to be particularly clear, you’ve probably misunderstood what I said.’ H. G. Wells’s description of that other long-serving central banker Montagu Norman – whom the novelist described as one of those ‘strange Mystery Men … dimly visible through a fog of battling evasions and misstatements, manipulating prices and exchanges’ – applies as well to Greenspan. A couple of months into his new role, in October 1987 Greenspan was confronted with the worst stock market collapse since 1929. He responded by cutting the Fed funds rate and flooding Wall Street with liquidity. The stock market bounced back. Shortly afterwards, the Fed switched its attention from attempting to influence the growth of bank borrowing to directly targeting interest rates.fn3 Henceforth, monetary policy would remain focused on near-term inflation, while other financial imbalances – as reflected by current account deficits, credit growth and underwriting standards, private sector leverage, and asset price bubbles – elicited no response beyond the occasional attempt to pressurize the market into a correction.

- The closed community of central bankers and monetary economists remained obdurate to monetary explanations for the crisis. They had invested too much time and effort in their economic models and were reluctant to jettison them. Their canonical model assumes that an economy is only knocked off course by random or ‘exogenous’ shocks, such as the 1973 oil crisis. It has no place for money and credit. Interest rates are given and errors in monetary policy are revealed by instability in consumer prices but not asset prices. Speculative bubbles and irrational exuberance are not countenanced. Instead, the model posits a world filled with rational actors possessed with perfect foresight. But it doesn’t remotely describe what actually happens on Wall Street or any other stock market.

- Institutional factors contributed to this state of cognitive dissonance. The Federal Reserve is the world’s largest employer of finance PhDs and has deep connections with economic journals that specialize in monetary matters. It is telling that, in a 2010 survey, a large majority of academic economists believed that low rates caused, or at least greatly contributed to, the housing bubble, but most economists specializing in monetary policy continued to side with the Fed’s view.38 If Bernanke, as head of the Federal Reserve, held that the crisis wasn’t a failure of ‘economic science’ but one of economic management (regulation), it was only to be expected that the Fed’s own research team should follow their chief’s lead.39 They occupied an echo chamber in which existing beliefs were reinforced and uncomfortable questions ignored. ‘Bernanke’s Fed,’ concludes historian Philip Mirowski, ‘has evaded suffering any consequences for its intellectual incompetence’ in the lead up to the crisis. Instead of being hounded from office, Bernanke was credited with saving the world from another Great Depression and anointed Time magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ in 2009. His exercise in denial meant that the Fed learned little from the crisis. Besides the odd tweak, monetary policymakers saw no need to change their flawed models. If low interest rates hadn’t caused the crisis, there would be no problem in taking them even lower in future.

- Not only did the major central banks in the developed world now have a target, but they all coalesced around the same number: 2 per cent acquired talismanic significance – what Governor Kuroda called a ‘global standard’.42 The number was written into the ECB’s constitution. It was constantly invoked by central bankers, as if repetition would help them to attain their aim. Here is how Janet Yellen, Bernanke’s successor at the Federal Reserve, addressed a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in September 2016: So let me be clear – 2 percent is our objective. We want to see inflation go back to 2 percent; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation. So we’re not trying to push the inflation rate above 2. It’s always our objective to get back to 2, but 2 percent is not a ceiling. And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that, on average, would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent. That is not our policy. We want to see the inflation rate get back to 2 percent as rapidly as we can. ([Location 3057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3057))

- We have seen how the Fed’s pursuit of price stabilization in the 1920s contributed to that era’s credit boom and speculative excesses. Fixing a specific target to the same policy only exacerbates matters. It has long been recognized that managing institutions by reference to a fixed quantitative indicator has its limitations.fn11 Quantitative targets tend to get chosen because they are easy to quantify. But factors that aren’t easily measured tend to get overlooked. As a result, the use of targets is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes, including short-termism, the diversion of resources into bureaucracy, risk aversion, unjustified rewards, and the undermining of institutional culture. Metrics serve to stifle innovation and creativity; they imitate science but resemble faith. When an institution is guided by some specific target, critical judgement is suspended. In the 1970s, the American social scientist Donald Campbell pointed out that ‘the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.’ Historian Jerry Muller adds a corollary to Campbell’s Law, namely: ‘anything that can be measured and rewarded will be gamed.’ The most famous target law of all emerged several decades ago in the field of monetary economics.

- the early 1980s, central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic sought to control inflation by targeting the growth of the money supply. The money supply is a fuzzy concept and can be measured in a number of different ways (economists refer to M0, M1, M2, M3, etc.). Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics observed that whenever the Bank of England targeted a particular measure of money supply, that measure’s earlier relationship to inflation broke down. Goodhart’s Law states that any measure used for control is unreliable. The mistake in setting targets lies in assuming that relationships between variables – in this case a certain measure of the money supply and inflation – are stationary. In the real world, human behaviour responds to attempts at control. ‘The essence of Goodhart’s Law,’ write John Kay and Mervyn King in their book Radical Uncertainty, is that ‘any business or government policy which assumed stationarity of social and economic relationships was likely to fail because its implementation would alter the behaviour of those affected and therefore destroy that stationarity.’43 As a former Governor of… ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3078))

- which we ought not to have targeted, and there is no health in the economy.’44 Another retired central banker, Paul Volcker, was even more critical of the inflation target. ‘I puzzle at the rationale,’ wrote the former Fed chief. ‘A 2 percent target, or limit, was not in my textbooks years ago. I know of no theoretical justification. It’s difficult to be a target and a limit at the same time.’ No price index could accurately capture the real change in consumer prices, Volcker added. Besides, in a growing economy there is a tendency for prices to move up and down a little, not sideways. As to the idea that monetary policy should be eased at a time when the economy was robust and unemployment low merely because inflation trailed the target, well, Volcker thought, ‘certainly, that would be nonsense.’45 One problem with the inflation target, according to UCLA economist Axel Leijonhufvud, is that ‘a constant inflation rate gives you absolutely no information about whether your monetary policy is right.’ On the contrary, Leijonhufvud maintained, the target encourages central banks to pursue policies that undermine financial… ([Location 3089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3089))

- ‘Most economists did not understand the economy’s peculiar path prior to the crisis, and persisted in befuddlement in the aftermath,’ writes Philip Mirowski.4 After the crisis, no intellectual paradigm shift took place. A fixed belief in the veil of money remained firmly in place, a blindfold that obscured the true operations of the economy from those who wore it. This belief explains why central bankers denied responsibility for the collapse in long-term rates after 2008, even as they pushed short-term rates to zero or below and attempted in various ways to manipulate bond yields.fn1 Nor could they admit that their actions might have any lasting impact on the economy’s growth rate: ‘It’s important to recognize … that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long-run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part,’ said Fed Chairman Bernanke in 2013.5 The lowest interest rates in history and lacklustre economic growth were routinely ascribed by central bankers to secular stagnation. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel were an exception to this rule. As we have seen, the BIS’s chief economist William White was one of a handful of prominent economists who anticipated the financial crisis.

Five years later, White and Borio were vindicated. As head of the BIS’s Monetary and Economics Department from 2013, Borio provided a radically different account of secular stagnation to that of Summers. He took the unorthodox view of the BIS in a new direction and provided (by guiding the efforts of his research team) empirical evidence to counter the conventional central bankers’ narrative. Borio cast aside the money veil to reveal a world of asset price bubbles, financial cycles, and credit booms and busts: ‘Think monetary! Modelling the financial cycle correctly … requires recognising fully the fundamental monetary nature of our economies,’ was Borio’s clarion call.7 The financial system, he asserted, doesn’t… ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3315))

The financial crisis, he maintained, was caused not by a savings glut but by too much credit – a ‘banking glut’. When a bank makes a loan, he said, it conjures up deposits, spending power and even savings. Inflation, in Borio’s view, was not simply a monetary matter but originates in the real world. After China flooded the West with cheap exports, the rate of inflation declined in the United States and elsewhere. Falling consumer prices weren’t in themselves an unmitigated disaster, and episodes of deflation didn’t reliably forecast economic calamity. Instead, Borio found that strong credit growth and real estate bubbles were more reliable red flags. Borio’s team scoured the historical data for evidence of Hume’s contention that the rate of interest was determined by real factors. But they found little relationship between interest rates and savings, investment or profits. There wasn’t even a stable link between demographics and interest rates.fn3 Instead, the BIS suggested that interest… ([Location 3328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3328))

It is generally agreed that central banks have a preponderant influence over short-term rates, but long-term rates are said to be determined by savings, productivity and other ‘real’ factors.

The fact that the financial crises of 1929 and 2008 both occurred at times of low and stable inflation suggests that conventional wisdom is mistaken. If a stable price level doesn’t reliably indicate the natural rate, then it’s difficult to see how central bankers could discover it.

- participants.’ Once the central bank exerts a semi-permanent influence on bond yields, Gehringer and Mayer added ominously, there is a ‘high chance of misalignments of market rates … [which] can cause severe economic distortions’.10 The idea that errors in monetary policy might produce economic distortions, other than disturbances to the price level, was not countenanced by the central banking establishment. But Borio’s research led inexorably to this conclusion. Financial imbalances – a polite term for credit booms and speculative manias – tend to form during periods of low interest rates and low inflation, he noted.fn5 Before the financial crisis, global interest rates were low both in real terms and relative to the growth rate of the global economy. Credit booms and real estate bubbles often produce nasty economic shocks and are followed by weak recoveries. The post-Lehman economy conformed to earlier precedents, notably Japan’s after 1990. Central bankers responded to economic stagnation after 2008 by pushing rates even lower. Thus, low rates begat low rates. Debt was the missing link in the secular… ([Location 3365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3365))

- left behind by the crisis produced what Borio called a ‘financial drag’. As overburdened households turned to repairing their balance sheets, they borrowed and spent less. Borio and his colleagues found that the share of society’s income used for servicing debt (the debt–service ratio) tends to remain constant over time. Thus, ever lower interest rates are needed to sustain a rising stock of debt. A vicious cycle begins, with more debt requiring lower rates, and lower rates resulting in yet more debt. Some commentators referred to this decades-long process as the ‘debt supercycle’. Ultra-low rates, being the hair of the dog, are no cure for a debt hangover. ‘After all,’ Borio asked, ‘if the origin of the problem was too much debt, how can a policy that encourages the private and public sectors to accumulate more debt be part of the solution?’11 Once the economy enters a ‘debt trap’ it becomes harder to raise interest rates without causing huge damage. ‘Too low rates in the past,’ Borio concluded, ‘are one reason for lower rates today.’12 It wasn’t just that the stock of debt was too high. Much of the debt failed to generate decent returns. ‘The issue,’ Borio observed, ‘is not so… ([Location 3378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3378))

- why property bubbles reduce economic growth. After the crisis, banks needed to repair their balance sheets. The resolution of Scandinavia’s banking crisis in the early 1990s showed that dealing promptly with bad debts speeded up the economic recovery. But ultra-low interest rates after 2008 enabled banks to delay this painful process, encouraging them to keep bad debts on their books. Japan’s interminable ‘balance sheet recession’ revealed the pitfalls of failing to grasp the nettle. Most Western countries now took the Japanese path. Non-performing loans proliferated on the balance sheets of banks, like cancerous cells. The problem of ‘evergreening’, or renewing, bad debts was acute in Europe. Zombie companies became commonplace. The cumulative effect of bad debts and capital misallocation was to reduce potential output growth. ‘When economic conditions become more hostile, misallocations beget misallocations,’ Borio claimed.14 The decline in potential output growth gave central bankers yet another reason to lower interest rates. Bad debts weren’t the only challenge facing banks in the post-crisis years. Banks make money by lending out deposits for a… ([Location 3392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3392))

- the opposite effect on investors. Faced with a loss of deposit income, the BIS found that savers fled conventional banks to invest in financial markets, where they took greater risks in pursuit of higher returns.16 A similar search for yield had occurred prior to the financial crisis, and was in large measure responsible for its severity. Borio observed ‘a disappointing element of déjà vu in all this’.17 The Federal Reserve’s reflexive tendency to ease monetary conditions whenever markets became turbulent encouraged yet more risk-taking. Borio observed that central bankers were slow to hike rates during booms but rushed to ease them after every bust. Their asymmetrical approach imparted a downward bias to interest rates and an upward bias to debt, he noted. The danger arising from the Fed’s inconsistency was a longstanding concern: ‘lowering rates or providing ample liquidity when problems materialise but not raising rates as imbalances build up, can be rather insidious in the longer run. They promote a form of moral hazard that can sow the seeds of instability and of costly fluctuations in the real economy.’18 Borio and… ([Location 3404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3404))

- flows. It was conventional for economists to focus on the current account balances between countries, as these reflect differences in national savings. Borio, on the other hand, argued that the link between savings and credit was tenuous. While the current account measures the surplus or deficit in a country’s savings, cross-border lending is recorded by gross capital flows. Gross capital flows, Borio claimed, provide a better indicator of financial fragility at the international level.19 Since much foreign lending is denominated in dollars, low interest rates in the United States after 2002 spurred a massive increase in international capital flows. Investors borrowed cheaply in dollars and invested the proceeds abroad at higher yields. The embers of Lehman Brothers were still warm when this global carry trade rekindled, its flames fanned by the Fed’s zero interest rates and massive securities purchases. Over the following years, emerging markets went on a borrowing binge, accumulating trillions of dollars’ worth of foreign debts. Their financial systems thus became acutely sensitive to any tightening move by the Federal Reserve. In the summer of 2013, the global financial markets threw a ‘tantrum’ when Fed Chairman Bernanke signalled his intention to reduce the pace of the Fed’s securities purchases. On the international front, as on the domestic one, it was proving easier to reduce interest rates than to normalize them. Borio fretted about the ‘excess elasticity’ of the international monetary system, which set no limits on cross-border lending but threatened to snap back violently when matters got out of hand. The longer US interest rates remained stuck close to zero, he feared, the greater would be the build-up of global financial imbalances. The Federal Reserve was not solely to blame. Foreign central banks contributed by printing money to acquire foreign exchange reserves and by keeping domestic interest rates low (which they did in order to prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar). Borio envisaged a grand denouement, on a par with the collapse of the world’s financial system in the Great Depression. The easy money regime threatened to end in what he called an ‘… ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3417))

- after the October 2014 bond market ‘flash crash’. As one year followed another, unconventional monetary policies became more unconventional. Abnormality became the new normal. Monetary policy is path dependent, said Borio. Once the central bankers have taken a wrong turning, the financial system and economy are driven off course: economic growth falters, financial imbalances accumulate, and capital is misallocated. Bubbles form. Too much debt accumulates. After the crisis, central bankers tried out new monetary measures – quantitative easing, paying banks interest on their reserves, zero and negative interest rates, and various other innovations. They stamped on the gas pedal whenever the economy lost momentum, or when the financial engine threatened to stall. The interest rate was floored but still the economic juggernaut continued to slow. All the signs pointed in the direction of ever lower rates. How to get back on track, Borio was asked. ‘If I were you,’ he replied, ‘I would not start from here.’22 It’s an old joke. He feared that monetary policy was losing efficacy. Central bankers were… ([Location 3439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3439))

- of pressure that has gradually accumulated over the years along major faultlines.’23 References to ‘seismic rupture’ were repeated over the years. Central bankers had bought time, but time was wasted. The day of reckoning was postponed. The bill accumulated. Establishment economists considered with disdain the flood of papers churned out by Borio’s BIS team. The BIS ‘is listened to but ignored’, the chief economist at a rival international monetary authority is said to have sniped. Borio can’t be modelled, sneered critics in the academy. Similar comments were once directed at the maverick economist Hyman Minsky, whose brilliant insights into financial instability were belatedly recognized after the subprime crisis. Minsky and Borio have much in common; both are unorthodox and eclectic thinkers, who laid aside formal models to observe how things appear in the world – the real world, as opposed to the unreal reality constructed by academic modellers. Both asserted the primacy of finance in modern capitalism. Money matters, said Minsky. Interest rates matter too, added Borio. Printing money and manipulating interest rates changed the world after 2008, and not necessarily for the better. The financial panic was doused, but the world ended up with more debt, more bubbles, more zombies and more financial risk. Viewed from Borio’s perspective, secular stagnation was a monetary disease. For all his genius, Hume was mistaken – not completely mistaken, but he went too far in dismissing finance. Money is not a veil. Monetary policy is not neutral.

- Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate … It will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down … enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people. Andrew Mellon, 1932 In his book Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, Joseph Schumpeter describes capitalism as a ‘process of industrial mutation … that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.’1 That phrase stuck. If Schumpeter is widely remembered today, it’s because he owns the intellectual copyright on creative destruction – the evolutionary process by which new technologies and business methods displace older, less efficient ways of doing things. Schumpeter’s borrowing from Darwin’s theory of natural selection is as important to our understanding of the nature of capitalism as Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’. Most discussion of creative destruction revolves around the adoption of new technologies, the roles played by entrepreneurs as harbingers of change and by competition in selecting the most efficient businesses. Less recognized is the important part played by interest in this dynamic process. Arthur Hadley, a late nineteenth-century American economist and President of Yale University, pointed this out decades before Schumpeter came out with his brilliant insight. Hadley argued that interest ‘helps the natural selection of the most competent employers and the best processes, and the elimination of… ([Location 3470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3470))

- When doubts about the survival of the single currency surfaced in 2010, the financial markets started to view countries on Europe’s periphery, from Ireland to Greece, as over-indebted and uncompetitive. Bound by euro-fetters, members of the Eurozone could not regain competitiveness by devaluing their currencies. Instead, interest rates across the region diverged, with highly indebted countries, including Italy and Greece, suddenly forced to pay hefty risk premiums. Meanwhile German bond yields headed into negative territory. Deflation beckoned. Deleveraging was in order. To bring down labour costs, the PIIGS were going to have to embrace deep structural reforms. Unemployment in Spain climbed to Great Depression levels. Schumpeter’s forces of creative destruction were about to be unleashed, big time. Then along came Mario Draghi (a former economics professor, Goldman Sachs managing director and, lately, Governor of the Bank of Italy), the incoming President of the European Central Bank, with his July 2012 promise to ‘do whatever it takes’ to hold the Eurozone together. Never mind the clause in the ECB’s constitution which forbade bailouts of member countries – that could be fudged. This wasn’t a solvency crisis, said Draghi, it was a liquidity crisis. (In truth, so long as an entity is supported by a central bank, there can be no insolvency.) Never mind that monetary policy was no substitute for the political and economic reforms necessary for the long-term survival of the single currency – that could be ignored for the moment. What mattered was that the markets believed in the ECB’s firepower. Backed by Draghi’s hard commitment, banks in Spain, Portugal and Italy used cheap loans from the ECB to buy their own sovereign debt, pushing down credit spreads and making a lot of money in the process.16 Draghi successfully extinguished Europe’s debt crisis and saved the Single Currency, but soon enough a different problem became evident.

- The term ‘zombie’ was first applied in the corporate sense to the floundering US Savings & Loan associations of the late 1980s. These local savings banks (‘thrifts’) had been skewered by the high interest rates of the Volcker Federal Reserve, which pushed their cost of funding far above the returns on their outstanding loans. ‘Zombie’ thrifts survived by offering higher deposit rates and taking more risk on to their loan books. Gresham’s Law states that bad money drives out good money. Under certain conditions, it applies to business conditions too. ‘In a kind of Gresham’s Law scenario, bad zombie thrifts tend to drive out healthy competition,’ wrote economist Edward Kane in 1989.17 This was a keen insight. After the collapse of Japan’s Bubble Economy, a graveyard full of corporate zombies arose in the East. In the first half of the 1990s Japanese banks decided to roll over (‘evergreen’) their non-performing loans rather than recognize losses. ‘Unnatural selection’ started to determine the allocation of capital.18 Later studies showed that loss-making Japanese firms enjoyed better access to bank credit than profitable ones. Gresham’s Law was at work, once again. The zombification of Japan’s economy was associated with excess capacity across many industries – ranging from fridge makers to car manufacturing – that lingered for years. Corporate profits and returns on capital declined. Productivity growth suffered. Deflation lingered. With the forces of creative destruction stilled, Japan Inc. appeared increasingly sclerotic.

- Europe post-2012 proved an ideal breeding ground for a new generation of corporate zombies. Much of the bank credit unleashed by Draghi’s ‘outright monetary transactions’ did little to boost employment or capital spending. Aside from buying their governments’ debt, Eurozone banks boosted lending to their most heavily indebted and least profitable corporate clients.20 Zero interest rates kept loss-making companies on life support. By 2016, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that 10 per cent of firms were unable to cover their interest payments from profits – the OECD’s definition of a zombie. Europe, it seemed, was turning Japanese. The zombie phenomenon was not confined to continental Europe. In both the United States and United Kingdom, ultra-low rates forestalled corporate bankruptcies. The default rate on US junk bonds after the Great Recession was just half the average of the two previous downturns. ‘The Fed’s extraordinary intervention,’ credit analyst Martin Fridson suggested, ‘enabled companies [to survive] that should have failed.’21 In Britain, the insolvency rate was also lower in the 2008–9 recession than during the milder economic downturn of the early 1990s.

- around one in ten small businesses were kept alive on the drip of easy money.22 ‘Avoiding insolvency is the new norm,’ protested an unhappy member of the British Association of Recovery Professionals.23 The lowest insolvency rates were reported by Greece, Spain and Italy – the countries hit hardest by the sovereign debt crisis and where one might have expected to see the greatest concentration of bankruptcies. Italy had the worst zombie infestation. Industrial overcapacity was rife. The country was home to some two dozen cement producers, many of them limping along thanks to ‘financial doping’.24 Italian clothing company Stefanel was a typical zombie. Out-performed by strong competitors, the Veneto-based fashion firm produced a string of losses and went through several debt restructurings. Its share price collapsed. Stefanel clung on thanks to loan forbearance from its banks and the ECB’s negative interest-rate policy. Eventually, in June 2019, its shares were suspended after the company announced it was applying for special administration under bankruptcy law. As in Japan, Europe’s zombie companies undermined the region’s economic dynamism. As in Japan, zombies gnawed at the vitals of Europe’s banking system. By 2015 it was estimated that European banks had more than €1 trillion of bad debts, a twofold increase since 2009 and roughly equivalent to a tenth of their private sector loans.25 Italian banks were worst affected. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Europe’s oldest bank – and Stefanel’s main lender – required a state bailout.26 Weighed down with old non-performing loans, European banks became reluctant to advance new loans. (The flattening of banks’ net interest margins by monetary policy exacerbated this problem.) A curious case of adverse selection appeared: more efficient firms in industries dominated by zombies were forced to pay more for their bank loans than those in other sectors.27 Another feature in common with Japan was how the ECB’s monetary balm removed the impetus for structural reforms in the Eurozone. Prior to Draghi’s arrival at the ECB around half of the OECD’s recommended growth initiatives were adopted across Europe.28 After the sovereign debt crisis was alleviated, politicians sat back. Four years after Draghi’s ‘do whatever it takes’ intervention, just one in five reform measures were still being implemented.fn5 The IMF abhorred the slow pace of structural reform in France, Italy and Spain, warning that ‘without drastic changes, they are likely to follow Japan’s path to long economic stagnation.’29 At least Japan had sufficient domestic savings to fund its escalating national debt and printed its own ([Location 3614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3614))

Lee called these firms ‘unicorns’, she said, because ‘it means something extremely rare, and magical.’32 Their valuations may have been magical, but unicorns soon became much less rare. By 2015, nearly 150 of them existed, with a combined market valuation of around half a trillion dollars.33 ‘A little-known fact about unicorns,’ mused James Grant, ‘is that they feed on interest rates.

- all this easy money with a fervour. ‘It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,’ an excitable unicorn boss with a keen interest in financial history told The Economist in 2015. He wasn’t exaggerating. Easy money was dumb money. Rather than carefully scrutinize the pitches and books of start-ups, venture capitalists invested on a ‘spray and pray’ basis. As venture capitalists raised ever larger funds, they invested in ever more dubious concepts. ‘Basically the Federal Reserve is printing money,’ wrote a tech industry insider, ‘and a lot of that money is making its way to venture funds and from there into the pockets of a bunch of kids who are building start-ups in San Francisco. As long as the Fed keeps printing money and the stock market keeps going up, the party will continue.’35 Good times engender much fraud, Bagehot said. Some unicorns proved as fantastical as the name suggested. Elizabeth Holmes, the twenty-something founder of Theranos, claimed to have developed technology for conducting a wide range of medical tests from a small drop of blood extracted from the finger. Holmes modelled herself on Apple’s Steve Jobs, right down to the black turtleneck sweaters. Like her hero, she created a ‘reality distortion field’. Impossible things could be achieved if only people acted as if they were possible. Hyperbole was the order of the day. Holmes claimed her ‘mini lab’ to be the ‘most important thing humanity has ever built’. In fact, Theranos’s black-box technology didn’t function as described. Long before this was discovered, the company achieved a $9 billion valuation on Silicon Valley. But this fortune, like Holmes’s invention, was fake. Theranos bled investors of more than $1 billion before going bankrupt – a unicorn-sized loss.36 Other unicorns engaged in ‘narrative construction’. Uber didn’t see itself for what it was – an online cab-hailing business – but as an integral part of the new ‘gig economy’, whose software platform could be leveraged to enter myriad other business lines. Uber planned flying taxis and self-driving cars, which, by removing pesky driver costs,… ([Location 3664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3664))

- Economic vitality is also indicated by turnover in the jobs market. Recessions normally induce a shake-out of less efficient firms, accelerating the relocation of workers between businesses. Job destruction was particularly severe in the United States when interest rates spiked during the recessions of 1980 and 1982. The subsequent economic recovery was marked by strong job creation. Schumpeter would have approved. After 2008, a different picture emerged. Fewer bankruptcies and fewer start-ups meant less job creation and destruction. The decline in employment turnover (known as the ‘churn rate’) roughly tracked the falling interest rate.fn7 While the media ran horror stories about a ‘Second Machine Age’, in which robots were replacing humans ([Location 3725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3725))

- in the workplace, the reality was that fewer jobs were created or destroyed by technology than at any time since the Industrial Revolution.42 More Americans suffered from prolonged spells of unemployment. Even as the US economy recovered, the labour force participation rate declined, hitting a three-decade low in 2014. ‘Stifling [job] reallocation stifles growth as well,’ concluded labour economists Steven Davis and John Haltiwanger. A flaccid labour market was also associated with weak income growth.43 Nearly a decade after Lehman’s demise, American workers were having to put in longer hours simply to maintain their standard of living.44 One of the most pressing concerns of the post-Lehman decade wasn’t so much a savings glut as an investment famine. Ultra-low rates were supposed to induce companies to borrow and invest. But despite the central banks’ best efforts, investment collapsed throughout the developed world and remained low for years. Economies on both sides of the Atlantic were saddled with excess capacity.45 Naturally, firms that weren’t operating at full throttle had little reason to invest. Weak capital spending went hand in hand with weak corporate sales and household spending. Heightened uncertainty about the future led firms to defer investment, although the extent to which this uncertainty (as measured by the dispersion of economic forecasts) was due to the persistence of crisis-era ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3731))

A decline in the growth of a country’s capital stock implies lower future output growth.48 Even the Federal Reserve agreed that falling investment in the United States contributed to the slowdown in productivity growth.49 What the Fed didn’t acknowledge – couldn’t acknowledge – was that monetary policy played any role in this matter.

Retired from the Fed, Ben Bernanke described the interest-rate implications of sinking US productivity as ‘dovish’.52 A Bank of England study estimated that each point decline in productivity resulted in twice as large a fall in the ‘equilibrium’ (or natural) interest rate.53 Claudio Borio at the BIS turned such conventional thinking upside down.

- Market economies are complex systems. Their order is spontaneous – that’s to say, they operate without any central guiding hand. The same is true of ecological systems, which also suffer at times from misguided, if well-intentioned, interference by public bodies. The part played by economic downturns in promoting creative destruction has a parallel in nature. Fires have an important role in regenerating forests. Trees are stressed when woodlands become overgrown, which renders them vulnerable to disease and insect infestation. Below the canopy, an understory builds up, a thicket of dying trees, rotten timber and shrubs. Young trees have difficulty competing for light, nutrients and water. By clearing the understory, forest fires serve an ecological purpose. Weaker trees are destroyed by fire, and those that survive have more space in which to grow. Certain native tree species are specially adapted to fire. The thick bark of the Douglas fir enables it to withstand high temperatures. The giant sequoia and jack pine require fire to propagate their seeds. Created in 1905, the US Forest Service has been fighting fires for most of its history. It took on the firefighting role after the great conflagration of 1910, known as the Big Burn, which killed many people and consumed 5 million acres of woodland in the Northwestern states. In later years, the Forest Service transformed into the ‘Fire Service’. Before 1934, only manmade fires were put out. After that date all fires were suppressed. The service adopted a ‘10 a.m. policy’ – any fire reported was to be contained before mid-morning on the following day. Research unfavourable to the fire-fighting policy was ignored or suppressed. By the 1970s, however, the government foresters had come to recognize the costs of suppressing fires. The more fires the Forest Service put out, the more extensive fires became. While small fires in the forest destroy with precision, great conflagrations wreak indiscriminate damage, killing even the healthiest trees.55 As the financial costs of fire-fighting were also running out of control, the policy was put on hold. However, this decision was reversed after a large fire broke out at Yellowstone National Park in 1998. In recent decades, the incidence of large-scale wildfires has increased, and the number of acres consumed by fire has trended upwards. Naturally, the Forest Service… ([Location 3782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3782))

In his memoirs, Ben Bernanke dismisses off-hand the notion that ‘firefighters cause fires.’57 The former Fed chief justifies his position by referencing Bagehot’s argument that central banks must intervene during financial crises. That may be true. But Bernanke’s unconventional monetary policies remained long after the financial fires had been snuffed out. If one accepts that the financial inferno of 2008 would not have occurred but for the earlier period of easy money, then one is drawn to James Grant’s conclusion that the Fed’s ‘functional dual mandate has become that of arsonist and fireman’.58 After the financial crisis, the Fed worked tirelessly to douse fires and protect the economy’s understory. Zombie companies proliferated in the forest, stronger firms struggled with weaker competitors for capital and sales.

- outset, the company was a creature of Wall Street.1 Shortly after its establishment, General Electric under Coffin’s management bid for its main competitor, Westinghouse Electric. As Thomas Lawson, the Boston banker who defended Westinghouse, wrote, General Electric’s ‘high-priest was J. Pierpont Morgan; its home, Wall Street; its owners, the principal votaries of the “System”’.2 The System that Lawson referred to was the means by which the savings of ordinary people were ‘always at the absolute service and mercy of the votaries of frenzied finance’. Here’s how the System worked. Workers deposited their savings at a bank or invested with an insurance company; those savings were then funnelled via the Morgan network to provide the capital for the amalgamation of American businesses, such as General Electric. Morgan’s immense power came from his control of the public’s savings. ‘The goose that lays golden eggs,’ wrote Justice Louis Brandeis, ‘has been considered a most valuable possession. But even more profitable is the privilege of taking the golden eggs laid by somebody else’s goose. The investment bankers and their associates now enjoy that privilege. They control the people through the people’s own money.’3 ([Location 3826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3826))

- Trusts gave birth to the so-called ‘robber barons’, business tycoons named after medieval feudal lords who, from their castles on mountain passes, extracted tolls from passing merchants. The latter-day robber barons, said Brandeis, set tolls at the highest level that the traffic could bear. Most prominent among them was John D. Rockefeller, who forced competitors to sell out to his Standard Oil, known as the ‘Anaconda’ for its strangulating grip on the oil industry. Another was Edward H. Harriman, who started his career as a ‘pad-shover’ or quotation boy on Wall Street and became America’s most powerful railway magnate after Morgan arranged the merger of his Union Pacific company with the Great Northern and several other railroads in 1901.

- Most of the profits made from forming trusts, however, fell to the denizens of Wall Street.8 The trick was to acquire a company on leverage, ‘water’ the stock (increase its capitalization), merge operations with other concerns and float the amalgamated business at a higher price on the stock market.9 Investors were provided with cheap stock loans to boost demand for the shares at the IPO. In his Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), Thorstein Veblen claimed that the managers of public companies had become versed in the arts of stock manipulation: the certainty of gain … seems rather more assured in the large-scale manipulation of vendible [i.e., traded] capital than in business management … Indeed, so secure and lucrative is this class of business, that it is chiefly out of gains accruing, directly and indirectly, from such traffic in vendible capital that the great modern fortunes are being accumulated.10 ([Location 3866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3866))

The Austrian-born Marxist, who twice became Germany’s finance minister in the 1920s, observed that share prices rose and fell in inverse relationship to the rate of interest. (Brandeis likewise observed that ‘easy money tends to make securities rise in the market. Tight money nearly always makes them fall.’) Hilferding made a more original observation: when the returns on industry were above the cost of borrowing, financiers were poised to reap windfall gains.11 The lower the interest rate, the higher the promoter’s profit.

- More important than Washington’s passivity towards nascent trusts was the collapse in corporate borrowing costs. Mergers were facilitated by a ‘strong appetite from debt investors (particularly for quality credits) and low interest rates [which] enabled acquirers to obtain financing on attractive terms’.23 Large companies could borrow at a lower rate than they earned on their capital, creating an opportunity for bankers to extract a ‘promoter’s profit’. Debt figured prominently in the March 2015 acquisition of food giant Kraft by ketchup-maker H. J. Heinz, itself a leveraged buyout controlled by Brazilian financiers 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.

- This bloated food giant was not created to slather the world with more ketchup and mayonnaise. Rather, the aim was to boost returns by adding debt and cutting costs. Over the following couple of years net debt increased by more than half and per-share earnings nearly doubled.24 Kraft Heinz was one of a number of so-called ‘platform companies’, similar to the trusts of the robber baron era, which used debt to finance anti-competitive mergers. Other notable platform companies included the beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (also controlled by the Brazilian 3G), cereal-maker Post Holdings, together with a number of healthcare companies. No platform company soared higher than Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The brainchild of Michael Pearson, a former McKinsey consultant, Valeant acquired more than twenty medical and drug businesses, including contact lens-maker Bausch & Lomb. The Canadian-listed company boosted its profits by slashing costs and pushing through large price hikes on its portfolio of patented drugs.25 Acquisitions were funded with debt. By 2015 Valeant’s long-term liabilities approached $30 billion, up three times in as many years, and yet despite this debt load the company’s borrowing costs remained below 6 per cent.26 By October 2015, Valeant’s stock was up more than fifteenfold since the start of the decade, and Michael Pearson’s equity-linked compensation package was ([Location 3938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3938))

The number of listed US companies halved in the two decades prior to 2016.27 An academic study found that three-quarters of American industries had become significantly more concentrated.fn1 As in the late nineteenth century, low interest rates once again played the key role in the consolidation of US industry. Economists at the University of Michigan found that price-fixing cartels are more influenced by the level of interest rates than by any other factor. Cartels tend to form at times of low interest rates and break up when rates are high.28 ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3950))

- debt, low default levels and rising asset prices, private equity had delivered double-digit returns for investors over the previous decade. Starved of opportunities to earn decent returns elsewhere, investors beat at the doors of the top buyout firms. One private equity fund that sought to raise $2 billion ended up with three times as much. Another fund closed with record cash commitments of nearly $25 billion. Megadeals were back in favour, such as Bain Capital’s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba’s microchip business, completed in May 2018. Buyout deals took place at higher earnings multiples and with more leverage. By 2018, private equity worldwide was sitting on an estimated trillion dollars of dry powder to finance future deals.30 Private equity claimed to have a more long-term approach to managing businesses than was found in the public markets. But the industry’s penchant for enhancing returns with leveraged ‘dividend deals’ and flipping companies for a quick profit belied such claims. The buyout business model normally involved acquiring healthy firms and putting them through the financial wringer: juicy returns derived from applying leverage. Research suggested that most buyouts saw little improvement in operations or business strategy. A 2018 study found that most private equity firms actually cut long-term investment. ‘This [buyout] harvest is all about wealth extraction, not wealth creation,’ concludes one commentator.31 No set of individuals benefited more from the Fed’s easy money than the buyout barons.

- The great management consultant Peter Drucker once wrote that profits were not the rationale of business decisions, but rather the test of their efficacy.32 What Drucker meant was that if a company does its job well, delivering goods or services to customers at competitive prices, then profits should be forthcoming. From the early 1980s onwards, however, the corporation’s purpose was redefined. It was no longer about serving customers or even making profits. Instead, companies were told to pursue ‘shareholder value’, a management philosophy aimed at maximizing the market value of the company’s equity. In the name of ‘shareholder value’ senior executives were handed free stock options and other equity-linked incentives. Now they had skin in the game, management interests were said to be aligned with those of shareholders.

- encouraged to replace ‘expensive’ equity with ‘cheap’ debt. As long as the cost of borrowing was low enough, executives could boost their company’s earnings by repurchasing their shares with debt (see box, p. 165). Since companies with robust earnings growth performed well in the stock market, senior executives earned windfall gains from this simple feat of financial engineering. The promoter’s profit was back. From the turn of the century, the cost of debt in the United States was held below the cost of equity. This ‘funding gap’ provided the impetus for share buybacks. After the global financial crisis, the funding gap grew even larger. ‘As the cost of equity still remains high relative to the cost of debt,’ commented one Wall Street strategist, ‘it makes sense for companies to de-equitize – use cheap financing to buy back their own shares.’33 The monetary authorities had hoped that companies would use their access to cheap debt to boost investment. But a very low interest rate, combined with a tax structure that favoured debt over equity, noted the OECD, ‘works directly against long-term investment’.34 Managements of… ([Location 3997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3997))

- The impulse for buybacks also came from outside the firm. Companies that underperformed in the stock market became takeover targets for competitors or private equity firms. Hedge funds, with their outsize performance fees, had a strong incentive to promote buybacks. ‘Activist’ investors launched publicity campaigns and proxy battles to push managements into buying back still more shares.

- corporate interest cover (the ratio of profits to interest payments) had fallen to levels last seen prior to the financial crisis, despite the fact that the prime lending rate – the short-term rate paid by large corporations – had collapsed.56 More than half the corporate cash flow was used for ‘financial risk-taking’ (mergers and acquisitions, buybacks and dividends) leaving less for ‘economic risk-taking’ (investment and R&D).57 Such activity, warned the IMF, ‘is associated with intermittent large destabilizing swings in the financial system’. In plain English, the risks of another financial crisis were rising. By this date, Valeant’s game was up. A common problem with corporate roll-ups, such as Valeant, is that they must complete ever larger acquisitions to continue growing their earnings. In the second half of 2015, Valeant’s stock price collapsed after its policy of hiking drug prices attracted the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The decline in its share price and a rising cost of borrowing brought Valeant’s acquisition spree to an end. Questions were raised about its solvency. After the Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating the drug-maker’s accounting practices, CEO Michael Pearson was sent on medical leave. By this date, Valeant’s shares were down 95 per cent from their peak. Having gorged in the credit markets, the Kraft Heinz Company was also sick. Within two years of the merger, the food giant’s net debt had swollen to $33 billion, up by more than half. Leverage initially helped boost its earnings per share. Investors received large payouts, but less profit was retained to support the ongoing operations. As with Valeant, Kraft Heinz’s presentations to shareholders came under scrutiny. Sales of its processed foods flagged. The company’s Brazilian managers had proved more adept at borrowing and cutting costs than managing brands. In early 2019 the value of Kraft Heinz’s brands was written down by $15 billion and its share price plunged.58 ([Location 4105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4105))

As Oxford’s first Professor of Political Economy, Nassau Senior, put it in 1836: ‘To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, or to seek distant rather than immediate results, are among the most painful exertions of the human will.’1 Interest is the wage of abstinence, said Senior.

- Was the abstinence of Baron Rothschild so painful? Was the labourer who spent every penny of his meagre wages to support a large family so profligate? It was left to John Stuart Mill to point out that while the rich had enormous resources, ordinary people also saved a part of their incomes. Interest, said Mill, reflected the marginal pain of their abstinence. Perhaps abstinence is the wrong word. Saving takes place over time. ‘To save,’ wrote Frédéric Bastiat, ‘is deliberately to put an interval between the moment when the services are made for the society, and that when the equivalent is received from it.’3 The reward for this ajournement is interest. Various commentators from Bentham onwards have treated interest as the difference in value between present and future consumption.

- Marshmallow Test shows that at least a proportion of children, when faced with a choice between an immediate marshmallow or two marshmallows in future, are prepared to wait. The second marshmallow is waiting’s reward. Irving Fisher put it nicely when he wrote that ‘Interest is, as it were, human impatience crystallized into a market rate.’4 Economists talk about time preference rather than impatience to describe how people value present and future goods differently. An individual’s time preference can be seen as a kind of personal rate of interest. Imagine that the present and future are two countries, separated by a river. Finance is the intertemporal bridge that joins them together, connecting the present with the future. By acts of borrowing and lending, and saving and investing, we shift expenditures across time. Interest is the toll levied on borrowers for bringing forward consumption and the fee paid to savers for moving consumption into the future.fn1 The level of interest regulates the traffic on the bridge and its general direction. When the interest toll is raised spending is pushed into the future, and consumption is brought forward when the toll is lowered. In an ideal world, people should save enough to meet their future needs, but not so much that current spending is depressed. Under such circumstances, the traffic across the bridge is orderly in both directions. ([Location 4526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4526))

- This delicate balance is upset when the market rate of interest falls below society’s ‘crystallized impatience’. When the interest rate is higher than an individual’s time preference, he or she will save more for the future. Conversely, when the market rate is below the public’s time preference people borrow to consume. An abnormally low rate of interest boosts current spending, but the benefits don’t last. You cannot have your cake and eat it, at least not indefinitely. Cake is not the only item on the menu. People have a choice: jam today or more jam tomorrow. The rate of interest influences their decision. Here’s how development economist William Easterly puts it: Becoming rich is a choice between today’s consumption and tomorrow’s. If I cut my consumption sharply and save a large proportion of my wage income, then in a few years I will be richer because I will have both wage income and the interest earnings on my savings. If I consume all of my wage earnings, then I will have just my wage earnings forever onward.5 A nice feature of the interest bonus, at least for the saver, is that it compounds over time. Thus, a small amount of savings grows larger with every passing year. Thanks to interest, money bears fruit.

- When interest is at 6 per cent, savings double every twelve years. At 1 per cent, however, it takes seventy years for savings to double. Cassel believed that if the rate of interest fell below 1 per cent, saving would no longer be viable. Faced with such low returns, retirees could only maintain spending at the required level by consuming their capital.6 ‘If such a practice became general, it would have quite a disastrous effect,’ Cassel concluded, comforting himself that such an outcome was impossible. In this chapter we show how the policy of ultra-low interest rates, which started with the Dotcom bust and was revived after the subprime crisis, reduced the level of saving in the United States and elsewhere.

- While borrowers benefited from the decline in interest rates, savers were pinched. After 2008, American depositors lost an estimated $400 billion a year in interest income.13 Before Lehman’s bankruptcy, interest payments accounted for a tenth of total household income. Three years later, the share of interest income was down by a third. Over the course of the post-crisis decade, American depositors fared worse than during the Great Inflation of the 1970s when real interest rates were on average higher. The economist’s term for holding short-term rates below the rate of inflation is ‘financial repression’. As James Grant commented, ‘what’s being repressed today is the standard of living.’14 ([Location 4602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4602))

Thanks to the Federal Reserve, the S&P 500 soared, the US housing market recovered, and household wealth climbed to an all-time peak.

Over the long run, equity returns are inversely correlated with the market’s valuation. As with bonds, elevated stock prices imply lower future returns. In the United States, a balanced portfolio comprising of stocks and bonds has historically returned around 5 per cent after inflation.30 Ten years after the financial crisis, with the valuation of the US stock market at close to a record high and the yield on Treasuries near an all-time low, the expected return on a balanced investment portfolio was around half its historic average.31 ([Location 4658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4658))

- ‘Over the last few decades, we have been conducting a large-scale social experiment with ultralow savings rates, without a strong safety net beneath the high-wire act,’ wrote economist Tyler Cowen.56 Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager featured in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short, put it more bluntly. ‘The zero interest-rate policy,’ said Burry, ‘broke the social contract for generations of hardworking Americans who saved for retirement, only to find their savings are not nearly enough.’57 An increasing number of Americans were forced to work beyond the traditional retirement age.58 For younger workers, the dream of enjoying a comfortable old age would remain a dream – another illusion of wealth. Pensioners faced the prospect of their nest eggs running out. The World Economic Forum in 2019 observed that retirees on several continents were in danger of outliving their savings. The average American male retiree had enough savings for not quite ten years, leaving him eight years short. The ‘retirement gap’ for American women was close to eleven years. At least, Americans could be thankful not to be retiring in Japan, where the retirement gap was fifteen years for men and twenty years for women.59 Alongside longevity risk, pension providers faced the prospect that further declines in interest rates would swell their deficits. In fact, their actions exacerbated this risk. Egged on by regulators, pension managers hedged interest-rate exposure by purchasing long-dated bonds. Given that the top three hundred pension funds held some $15 trillion-worth of assets, their massive bond purchases contributed to the decline in long-term interest rates.60 In the United Kingdom, liability hedging by corporate pension funds drove the yield on fifty-year inflation-linked gilts into negative territory.61 Thus, low rates begot a pensions crisis and the pensions crisis begot lower rates. The pension world was caught between a rock and a hard place. In theory, higher interest rates would reduce pension liabilities. In practice, they would also hit the value of pension assets, making a bad problem even worse.62 Relief came from an unexpected quarter. A few years after the financial crisis, life expectancy in the United States and the United Kingdom ceased improving and briefly went into decline. If only this trend continued, a consultant gleefully pointed out, half of British corporate pension deficits would disappear.63 Savers in the era of zero interest rates resembled Sumner’s Forgotten Man, suffering at the hands of policymakers who failed to consider the full consequences of their actions. One of the crueller consequences was ever-escalating life insurance contributions. In August 2016, the New York Times reported that life companies were hiking premiums for elderly American savers.

- Interest arises out of inequality, and also affects the distribution of income and wealth. Righteous denunciations of usury, however, conceal a more complicated picture. In ancient times usury served to worsen inequality, as Marx suggested. But the extent to which interest aggravates inequality depends on the nature of the economic system and on the identity of borrowers and lenders. In traditional societies, usury is often practised on those in desperate need, such as peasant farmers. But taking interest in a modern capitalist economy isn’t always unfair. The historian R. H. Tawney described the changing attitudes to usury in sixteenth-century England: The theory of usury had been designed for an age in which the lender was rich and the borrower poor. Now the borrower was often a merchant who raised a loan in order to speculate on the exchanges or to corner the wool crop, and the lender an economic innocent, who sought a secure investment for his savings.5 ([Location 4817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4817))

The financial world is divided between mighty borrowers and powerless lenders, great whales feed off the savings plankton. As Justice Brandeis observed, Wall Street uses other people’s money, and the less it pays for this use the greater its profits. The question of interest has always been about justice, defined by St Augustine as a ‘virtue which renders to everyone his due’.10 Distributive justice requires that borrowers and lenders receive an equivalence of value. Usury is defined as the charging of excessive interest. But no word exists to describe too little interest. Nevertheless, justice is violated when lenders receive little or nothing while borrowers make fat profits from their loans. An equitable rate of interest is one that is neither too high nor too low. When the scales are tipped too far in the direction of low interest rates it’s plain unfair. ([Location 4841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4841))

Most inequality experts inclined to the traditional view, which holds that interest is fundamentally unjust. One economist attributed rising inequality in the United States to the ‘aggressively high interest-rate policies’ of the early 1980s.110 Another suggested, more plausibly, that the Federal Reserve had contributed to inequality by hiking interest rates whenever labour incomes were rising quickly.111 Central bankers absolved themselves and shifted the responsibility to politicians.fn8 Nowhere in the academic literature was the impact of ultra-low interest rates given due consideration.

Less creditworthy means more needy. The wealthiest homeowners pay the lowest mortgage rates … There are two ways to interpret this relationship. The first is to consider that the neediest borrowers are also the riskiest … The second is to consider that the neediest borrowers can be squeezed the hardest.118 Just as Bastiat predicted, the poor didn’t benefit from easy money.

He was also a first-rate economist – ‘one of the ablest minds that ever became active in our field,’ according to Schumpeter – who explained why useful things like water have a lower market value than diamonds, more than a century before other economists developed the theory of marginal utility.3 In his book On Money (1751), Galiani turned his attention to the ancient problem of usury. Although a man of the cloth, he had little time for the contributions of other clerics on this topic. Galiani rejected the traditional view that charging for loans was inherently unjust. On the contrary, he correctly described interest as representing the difference ‘between present money and money that is distant in time’. But Galiani wasn’t referring to his contemporary Turgot’s notion that humans prefer current over future consumption. Instead, Galiani justified the existence of interest on the grounds that each loan carries some risk of loss, which induces anxiety in the lender. ‘Keeping someone in anxiety is pain, hence it must be paid for,’… ([Location 5257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5257))

- The spread between what the bank charges for its loans and pays on deposits is akin to an insurance premium.fn2 In fact, bonds can be replicated with insurance contracts, known as credit default swaps (CDS). The yields on CDS vary with the probability of default, as Galiani thought should be the case. Insurers employ actuaries to calculate loss probabilities. The types of risk they insure – homes, cars, business, lives, and so forth – are normally independent of each other. But badly underwritten insurance policies change people’s behaviour. For instance, if car insurance is priced too cheaply, more bad drivers take to the roads leading to a rise in the number of car accidents. Subsidized home insurance encourages people to build on flood plains or move into hurricane-prone areas. In extremis, moral hazard might induce a policyholder to burn down his house so he can claim on the insurance. Moral hazard also occurs when the interest rate – Galiani’s price of insurance – is set too low. Credit booms occur at times of easy money, when financial risks are mispriced and market… ([Location 5281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5281))

- which both rewards and punishes people for taking risks. Homo capitalisticus is a risk-taker, and a stable economy requires that risks are correctly priced. When the price of risk is set too low, too much risk is assumed, new risks multiply and the financial system becomes unstable. Walter Bagehot understood that investors are prone to behave rashly when interest rates fall below a certain level. A desire to maintain the income of their investments induces them to speculate. A recent study finds that when government bond yields fall below average investors take on more risk. ‘Interest rates play an important role in affecting risk-taking behavior,’ conclude researchers Yueran Ma and Wilte Zijlstra. Modern finance theory states that this shouldn’t be the case. But investors ‘have a deeply ingrained notion that saving is the preservation of wealth and wealth should grow at a “decent” rate’. They won’t accept a loss of income. What’s more, their propensity to assume risk moves… ([Location 5292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5292))

- When short-term rates are low, investors have an incentive to take out loans to buy assets that yield more income. The difference between the cost of borrowing and the return on risky loans is known as the ‘carry’. There are numerous types of carry trades, from hedge funds using leverage to buy mortgage-backed securities to landlords taking out mortgages on their rental properties. The returns from carry trades are asymmetric: investors generally enjoy a steady stream of small gains but are exposed to sudden large losses. In market parlance, carry traders are said to pick up nickels in front of steamrollers. (More crudely, they are said to ‘eat like a bird, shit like an elephant’.) Losses on carry trades can’t be accurately predicted since their returns are skewed or ‘fat-tailed’. But financial black swans don’t appear out of a clear blue sky. Carry trades tend to blow up after periods of easy money, when leverage and other risks have accumulated in the financial system.

- In the era of zero rates, cash was trash. PIMCO’s Bill Gross noted that by late 2012 the rate paid on his brokerage money market fund was just 0.01 per cent, which meant that $10,000 of savings would not yield enough to buy a cup of coffee. It was only natural that the search for yield should resume. Yield-chasing after 2008 took on myriad forms, from online peer-to-peer lending to investments in listed ‘yieldcos’, which, as their name suggests, were designed to attract yield-hungry investors. Other income-enhancing vehicles included business development corporations (lenders to small businesses), master-limited partnerships, preference share funds, high-yield municipal bond funds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and real estate investment trusts. Having ‘broken the buck’ (i.e., traded below par) after the Lehman bust, money market funds were also forced to take more credit risk to survive in the era of zero rates.8 High-yielding reinsurance funds, known as ‘catastrophe bonds’, proved so popular that they brought down the cost of… ([Location 5322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5322))

- The Fed didn’t merely encourage the search for yield by slashing interest rates. One of the explicit purposes of quantitative easing was to encourage Wall Street to take more risk. Investors who sold Treasury bonds and mortgage securities to the central bank were supposed to replenish their portfolios with higher-yielding securities (in Fedspeak, this was the ‘portfolio balance channel’). At the same time, ‘The Fed became possibly the biggest carry trader of all: its balance sheet is a huge carry trade with large holdings of yielding securities, such as Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, financed by very low-cost liabilities.’10 Central banking in the age of… ([Location 5334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5334))

- When the yield curve slopes upwards, bonds with longer maturities provide more income than short-dated bonds or cash. When interest rates decline, owning bonds with longer maturities – what’s known as taking ‘duration’ – also generates capital gains. During a bond bull market, owning long-dated securities with even the tiniest of yields can deliver mouthwatering profits. In late 2015, for instance, the government of Japan issued a forty-year bond with a coupon of just 1.4 per cent. Soon afterwards, the Bank of Japan announced the inception of negative interest rates and the price of this bond climbed by more than a third.20 After 2008, yield-starved investors embraced duration as never before. American banks, desperate to earn at least some interest on their assets, extended duration in their securities portfolios.21 Even central bankers reached for yield.

- bank asset managers revealed that several of them had lengthened the duration of their securities portfolios and bought asset-backed securities for extra income.22 Duration even paid for owners of bonds with negative yields. Some $12 trillion-worth of bonds belonged to this category by the summer of 2016.23 ‘Yields don’t matter,’ declared a Tokyo insurance executive as the redemption yield on a thirty-year Japanese government bond turned negative.24 This comment was not as crazy as it may appear, since any loss of income experienced by bondholders was more than offset by the prospect of capital gains as interest rates declined. As Japan embraced negative rates, its government bonds were delivering their best returns in decades. The prospect of further rate cuts, as interest rates moved deeper into negative territory, only whetted appetites. Thus, it could be said (with a more or less straight face) that investors should buy negative-yielding bonds for capital gains and equities for income. Meanwhile, governments capitalized on this duration frenzy to lengthen the maturities on their loan books. ‘We are happy to feed the market with the product they want,’ declared the manager of France’s national debt.25 In 2015, both Ireland and Belgium issued bonds with 100-year maturities.26 A number of private companies, including German chemical firm Bayer and French utility EDF, also issued century bonds.27 Brazil’s scandal-ridden energy giant Petrobras found strong investor demand for bonds that promised to redeem into the twenty-second century. Italy, perennially on the verge of a sovereign debt crisis, launched a fifty-year bond yielding less than 3 per cent that was heavily oversubscribed. At the time, the yield on Italian short-term bonds was printed with a minus sign. Duration may be profitable during a bond bull market, but it is also a risk factor. When interest rates rise, bondholders who own long-dated securities suffer most. As duration lengthened and the size of the global bond market expanded after 2008, the total loss exposure for fixed-income investors climbed inexorably. With trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds trading at negative yields, bondholders faced huge losses if interest rates were to rise unexpectedly. According to Goldman Sachs, the aggregate duration of corporate bonds around the world doubled between 2006 and 2016. By the latter date, Bloomberg estimated that a mere half a percentage point rate increase would generate $1.6 trillion of losses in the fixed-income markets.28 A dislocation in the bond markets posed a potential threat to the market for financial derivatives, those financial weapons of mass destruction, as ([Location 5394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5394))

In the second decade of the new millennium, the bond market showed several bubble characteristics: abnormal valuations; a ‘this-time-is-different’ mindset among investors; moral hazard induced by continuous central bank interventions; massive bond issuance; and a widespread myopia that blinded investors to the prospect of losses. The bond vigilante, ever alert to the risks of fixed-income investing and demanding protection in the form of adequate interest compensation, was laid to rest. No capitalist was ever more supine than the millennial fixed-income investor.

- of risk, while market practitioners describe it as the price of uncertainty. Volatility has also been called the price of market liquidity. The most frequently cited measure of volatility is provided by the VIX index, which calculates the implied volatility of the US stock market from the options prices on the individual companies which constitute the S&P 500 index. In the aftermath of Lehman’s bankruptcy, this ‘fear gauge’ climbed to a record high (just short of 90, roughly six times its average level). In the post-crisis years, market volatility collapsed, and the VIX remained lower for longer than ever before. Each of the Fed’s three rounds of quantitative easing took place at successively lower levels of stock market volatility.43 This was no coincidence. Quantitative easing, observed Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, ‘works because we take volatility out of financial markets’.44 Dan Galai, the Israeli finance professor who created the VIX, suggested a link between ultra-low interest rates and ultra-low market volatility: ‘With so much liquidity in the market, it suppresses volatility,’ Galai mused as the VIX approached an all-time low in September 2017, ‘and that comes with interest rates [being] so low. Volatility being low for a long time is relatively new, but maybe it’s correlated, with the same causes.’45 ([Location 5480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5480))

- Once volatility declined, traders returned to the profitable strategy of buying into stock market dips, confident that the Fed had their backs. Volatility itself became a hot new asset class. Traders sold VIX futures, ‘shorting vol’, which earned them profits for as long as markets stayed becalmed.fn6 In effect, volatility sellers were insuring other carry traders against loss. This carry trade of carry trades proved the most profitable of all. A Credit Suisse-sponsored fund that sold volatility futures, known by its ticker XIV (VIX inverted), climbed elevenfold in price between its launch in late 2010 and early 2018. The IMF estimated (in 2017) that some $500 billion were managed in volatility-targeting strategies, and warned that the regime of low volatility was encouraging investors to take on more leverage.46 Hedge funds, including Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, gathered hundreds of billions of dollars to implement a strategy known as ‘risk parity’, which allocated investments in bonds, equities and other asset classes based on their historic volatility, leveraging the less volatile assets.

The search for yield brought about a collapse in underwriting standards and the return of less-regulated ‘shadow banks’. Regulatory arbitrage abounded.

- Bank of England’s monetary policy provided a strong incentive to evade the rules.58 Andrew Haldane identified another problem. Perhaps financial regulation didn’t reduce systemic risk, he suggested, but merely influenced where risk appeared. Haldane pointed to the fact that savings had left an increasingly regulated banking system for credit markets. ‘Risk, like energy, tends to be conserved not dissipated, to change its composition but not its quantum,’ said Haldane. ‘So it is possible the financial system may exhibit a new strain of systemic risk … now originating on the balance sheets of mutual funds.’59 The Bank of England’s top economist was on the right track but understated the problem. The quantum of risk doesn’t remain the same under all conditions. Ultra-low interest rates, as Bagehot understood and modern research confirms, encourage investors to take more risk. Ultra-low rates and central banks’ money-printing may have dampened market volatility, but, as Hyman Minsky pointed out – and the recent experience of the subprime crisis confirmed – financial stability is destabilizing.

- Could it be that the monetary policy experiments after the Lehman crisis did more harm than good? That was the view of PIMCO’s ‘Bond King’ Bill Gross, who, displaying his own science credentials, suggested that just as Newtonian physics breaks down at the speed of light, so a market economy ceases to function normally when interest rates approach the zero lower bound.4 Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff stuck with this theme: Just as the normal laws of physics seem to be upended when an object approaches a black hole (or, to be more precise, the normal laws imply weird consequences), the laws of economics ([Location 5612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5612))

- seem to be upended when a recession-stricken economy hits (or at least approaches) the zero bound.5 In his letters to investors, PIMCO’s bond manager described how the financial system needs a positive spread or carry between borrowing and lending rates. At zero rates, money market funds are forced to contract, and banks find it unprofitable to lend. Gross compared carry to the oxygen that feeds the blood. ‘Safe carry’, he maintained, was essential to capitalism. At zero rates, the blood becomes anaemic, oxygen-starved, even leukaemic.6 Gross pointed to UK bank-branch closures and staff lay-offs, zombie companies and blockages in the financial plumbing induced by the Fed’s massive Treasury bond purchases.fn1 ‘Low yields, low carry, [and] future low expected returns have increasingly negative effects on the real economy … Perhaps zero-bound interest rates and quantitative easing programs are becoming as much of the problem as the solution,’ Gross wrote in the summer of 2013. Five years later, two American economists published a paper modelling the losses suffered by banks when policy rates fall below a certain level. Markus Brunnermeier and Yann Koby named this tipping point the ‘reversal interest rate’.

Quantitative easing boosted asset prices and shrank credit spreads, but most of this newly created money wasn’t lent to consumers or businesses but was deposited by the banks at the Federal Reserve. The fact that the Fed in 2008 started paying interest on excess reserves (i.e. bank deposits at the central bank) gave banks even less reason to lend. The circulation of money through the economy slowed.8 In short, the Fed’s policy of keeping rates close to zero didn’t create inflation, but rather produced a lingering deflation.

A frantic search for yield encouraged investors to take greater risks and underwriters to lower lending standards. The international carry trade picked up, as investors piled into higher-yielding debt issued by emerging markets. Ten years after the crisis, the developing world was once again on the brink.fn5 When one considers the various ‘transmission mechanisms’ by which ultra-low interest rates affected the economy and financial system it’s easy to understand why Western economies never achieved escape velocity. On the contrary, the unintended consequence of unconventional monetary policies was to reduce the economy’s trend growth rate, thereby lowering the natural rate of interest. Although the Federal Reserve didn’t take responsibility for this outcome, central bankers slowly came to understand that the natural rate was on a downward trend. A few years after the crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee – the body which sets the Fed funds rate – started to publish charts of each member’s prediction for the future course of interest rates. These ‘dot plots’, as they were called, showed that America’s monetary policymakers consistently overestimated the future level of interest rates. The FOMC’s median forecast for the ‘long term’ rate (the expected normal level of interest rates) trended downwards over time.9 ([Location 5656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5656))

While Greenspan’s easy money (a 1 per cent rate) lasted for just twelve months, for seven years after the financial crisis the Fed funds rate remained at or close to zero. Nor did the Fed’s balance sheet ever contract on Bernanke’s watch. In fact, between the date of Bernanke’s Wall Street Journal commentary and his departure from the post, the Fed’s balance sheet grew by around $4 trillion. In the era of the ‘new normal’ any number of excuses could be found to delay the return to normality.

Central banking in the twenty-first century more closely resembled a game of peekaboo.

The next month the Fed started buying securities to help out a frozen ‘repo’ market – the place where Wall Street raises cash by posting securities as collateral. The Fed funds rate peaked at 2.5 per cent, less than half its highest level in the previous cycle. Around the world, policy rates converged towards the level set by the keeper of the world’s reserve currency. Attempts by individual central banks to normalize rates were invariably thwarted. For instance, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its rate to 4.75 per cent in October 2010 and kept it at this lofty level for just over a year, after which it progressively cut the rate. Norway followed Australia’s lead, timidly hiking before having second thoughts. The European Central Bank under Jean-Claude Trichet raised rates in the midst of the Eurozone crisis, and twice again in 2011, but reversed course towards the end of that year. Low rates had well and truly begot lower rates. One way to keep monetary accommodation perpetually in place was to move the goalposts. Quantitative easing was originally instituted to restore order to financial markets during a period of panic – a modern extension of Bagehot’s lender of last resort rule (although without the Victorian’s restrictive conditions). But when the Fed launched its third round of QE in September 2012, its aim was to help the jobs market.fn7 The level of unemployment itself proved another moving target. The Fed’s forward guidance originally set an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent as the threshold for normalizing monetary policy. But when the jobless rate reached this level in 2015, the FOMC concluded that further delay was justified because the ‘natural rate’ of unemployment had fallen. Fed Chairman Janet Yellen, who replaced Bernanke in early 2014, mused that the risks associated with interest rates at the zero lower bound justified keeping the policy rate at zero for longer than otherwise.12 In effect, Yellen was saying that the existence of ultra-low rates was in itself sufficient grounds for maintaining them.

- Negative interest rates were intended, as Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff put it, to ‘turbocharge the economy out of a deflationary recession’.23 But they failed to live up to this promise. In fact, they exacerbated the problems already produced by ultra-low rates. From the outset, negative rates created a tremendous challenge for conventional banks. When they were introduced into Europe, the head of Portugal’s central bank viewed them as a threat to the financial system.24 European banks felt unable to pass on the cost to depositors. German banks suffered huge losses, which they compensated for by taking more risk.25 The solvency problems at European life insurers and pension funds deteriorated.26 Liquidity in the bond markets dried up. The repo market likewise suffered.27 Real estate bubbles inflated in Switzerland and Sweden.28 Negative rates failed to turbocharge investment.29 Danish investment actually declined in the years after they were introduced.30 One explanation was that monetary policy was sustaining overcapacity in the global shipping industry, in which the Danes were important players.31 It was also suggested, not implausibly, that negative rates undermined business confidence by creating the impression of a never-ending crisis.fn11 The negative-interest-rate policy even failed in its primary purpose, namely bringing inflation back up to target.

- around 1 per cent. Not only did negative interest rates hinder banks from creating money, but the policy itself was said to induce a deflationary mindset.32 Rather than discouraging hoarding – the original purpose of Gesell’s ‘rusting money’ proposal – negative rates had the opposite effect. One of Germany’s largest banks, Commerzbank, announced that it would consider stashing cash in its vaults to avoid the ECB’s tax on deposits. In Japan, sales of safes took off after negative rates were introduced.33 These responses should have been anticipated. Keynes was vindicated: interest really was necessary to stop people from hoarding capital. The perverse effects of negative rates were observed by leading investors.34 ‘For economies to function normally,’ noted David Hoag of Capital Group, a large US investment firm, ‘they need positive interest rates and they need capital to be allocated efficiently.’35 BlackRock’s Larry Fink thought that the impact of this radical policy on savers had not been properly considered.36 Hedge fund manager Paul Singer claimed that negative rates removed the signals that direct investors how to allocate capital and manage risk.37 Bill Gross suggested that the trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds at negative yields formed ‘a supernova that will explode one day.’38 Another investor compared the policy to colliding black holes.39 The verdict of Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital was more blunt: ([Location 5821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5821))

- NOTHING STRANGE Up to this moment, the notion that interest could be charged at a negative rate had only been proposed by monetary cranks, such as Gesell, or contemplated as a thought experiment by a handful of economists. The economists’ verdict was not positive. Even Gesell’s hero, the nineteenth-century radical Henry George, thought that capital could not be maintained if interest rates fell below zero.44 George’s contemporary Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk believed that negative interest rates were against human nature. The great Swedish economist Gustav Cassel, author of The Nature and Necessity of Interest, dismissed the ‘absolute absurdity of thinking’ that the rate of interest could ever fall to zero or less.45 The invitation to waste capital, Cassel said, would be overwhelming. Although Irving Fisher supported Gesell’s proposal in the Great Depression, he believed that zero or negative interest was ‘practically almost impossible’. Negative interest, said Fisher, could only work if money was turned into a ‘perishable commodity, like fruit’.46 The Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson likewise believed that the concept of a negative interest rate was absurd. The MIT economist suggested that if negative rates were maintained for long enough it might become profitable to level the Rockies to save on the fuel used by vehicles climbing steep gradients.47 UCLA economist Axel Leijonhufvud thought that if long-term rates turned more negative than short-term rates it could only be a sign of a decaying world.48 The world would be turned on its head.

Up to this date, bond yields had only dipped below zero on a couple of occasions, and that was due only to regulatory and fiscal quirks.fn12 Now Danish homeowners were receiving rebates on their mortgages and companies were getting paid to issue bonds with negative yields.

- If the Gold Standard was characterized by its ‘golden fetters’, the chief vice of the Dollar Standard is its extreme elasticity. Central bank reserves are mostly composed of dollar-denominated securities (US Treasury bonds and agency debt), which, unlike gold, can be issued without limit. As the keeper of the world’s reserve currency, the United States doesn’t need to maintain its own foreign-exchange reserves, nor worry about its balance of payments. There is no limit on how many dollars flow abroad nor how much the United States borrows from foreigners. America can run what Jacques Rueff called ‘deficits without tears’, and over the years it has taken advantage of this exorbitant privilege to become the world’s largest international debtor. US interest rates aren’t influenced by international capital flows. Absent the prospect of inflation, there is no limit on how low interest rates can sink. (The question of whether the Fed could set negative rates is murky from a legal perspective.) Not everything has changed, however. Differentials in interest rates between countries still influence the amount and direction of cross-border lending. The most important interest-rate spread is that between the cost of borrowing in the United States and elsewhere. Countries that peg their currencies to the dollar are obliged to shadow American monetary policy: they must loosen when the Fed loosens and tighten when the Fed tightens. When the US central bank eases, dollar-peggers often intervene in the foreign exchanges: to prevent their currencies from appreciating, their central banks buy dollars with freshly printed local currency, thereby further loosening domestic monetary conditions. In short, when the United States adopts easy money it unleashes a ‘global monetary plague’.1 The plague is not contained to countries which peg to the dollar: even those with floating currencies are infected. When US interest rates fall below foreign rates, international carry trades take off. Investors borrow dollars and invest the proceeds abroad at higher yields. Foreigners are also encouraged to take out cheap dollar-denominated loans. (The yen and euro are also commonly used to finance cross-border carry trades.) For instance, when Iceland’s economy overheated in the early 2000s its central bank raised rates. But high Icelandic rates attracted hordes of carry traders who borrowed in foreign currencies (dollars, euros and yen) to acquire krona-denominated securities, known as ‘glacier bonds’, and lent directly to Icelandic banks, thereby easing, rather than tightening, monetary conditions.2 ([Location 5889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5889))

- earned his pittance selling vegetables, which might explain why corrupt officials were keen to appropriate his wares. North Africa, once the grain basket of the Roman Empire, was now the world’s largest food importer. Half of Egypt’s wheat – the main staple for the country’s 80 million-odd population – came from abroad. A much-photographed protester in Cairo’s Tahrir Square wore a ‘bread helmet’ made from a croissant and two bread sticks held together with cling film. Commentators blamed crop failures among the world’s leading food exporters on climate change. But some other factor must have contributed to the sharp rise in food prices, since the price of industrial commodities, whose supply was unaffected by the weather, also soared in the months prior to the Arab Spring. Most industrial commodities, and precious metals from copper to silver, were trading at bubble levels.fn3 That additional factor was the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies. Stanford economist Ronald McKinnon argued that the Arab Spring originated with ultra-low interest rates in the United States, which, as we have seen, drove capital flows into the emerging world and caused ‘overheating’ of the non-climate variety. China’s voracious demand for raw materials, in particular, stoked the ‘commodity super-cycle’.19 Easy money also stoked speculation in commodities, touted on Wall Street as a hot ‘alternative asset class’. McKinnon posed a tantalizing counterfactual: ‘If the Arab Spring had been recognized as mainly a food riot, the response of Western governments would have been more measured in taking sides, while focusing more actively on monetary measures to dampen cycles in primary commodity prices.’20 ([Location 5976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5976))

- Yet the decline in interest rates also propelled globalization. Since international trade credit is mostly denominated in dollars, when the cost of borrowing in dollars falls multinational companies are inclined to construct longer supply chains. In the era of easy money, global manufacturing took place across several continents and multiple countries (six on average). For instance, car engines built in Japan were shipped to Canada for further work, fitted into vehicle chassis in Mexico, with the finished cars sold in the United States. Lengthier supply chains tied up vast amounts of working capital and required ample financing.37 Manufacturers in emerging markets benefited most from the lengthening of supply chains.

Yet by 2010 the People’s Republic had transformed into a financial superpower. Its central bank sat on the world’s largest pile of foreign exchange reserves. The China Development Bank, one of several policy banks, was the world’s largest bank by assets. Two publicly listed Chinese banks were ranked among the top ten most valuable companies.9 Outstanding bank loans exceeded China’s GDP.10 The period of rapid economic growth commenced with Deng’s economic reforms, launched in the late 1970s. Financial deepening – defined as the accumulation of financial assets faster than non-financial wealth – played an important role in what has been called the China miracle.11 World Bank economists Robert King and Ross Levine find a strong relationship between the expansion of the financial sector and subsequent income growth. Their research suggests that finance leads growth, rather than the other way around. As King and Levine write, ‘When countries have relatively high levels of financial development, economic growth tends to be relatively fast over the next 10 to 30 years.’12 China’s blistering economic growth in the decades after 1980 appeared to support this finding.

- Having survived numerous setbacks, China’s property market gained a reputation for invincibility – a key condition, according to hedge fund tycoon George Soros, for a ‘super bubble’ to emerge. After the 2015 stock market crash, monetary policy was further eased. In October, the central bank’s benchmark rate reached an all-time low of 2 per cent. Over the following year, bank lending accelerated, with mortgages taking a greater share of new loans.44 In parts of Shanghai and neighbouring Suzhou, empty development plots sold for more than neighbouring land with completed buildings – a case of ‘flour more expensive than bread’. By late 2016, house prices were valued nationwide at eight times average Chinese incomes, roughly double the peak valuation of US housing a decade earlier. Property valuations in China weren’t completely irrational. Sir James Steuart’s claim that the value of the Mississippi Company was justified by the low cost of borrowing applied to China’s real estate market. John Law’s Royal Bank set interest rates at 2 per cent in 1719. Nearly three centuries later, the People’s Bank set interest rates at the same level. A study released in 2015 by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that rental yields in Beijing and Shanghai had fallen below 2 per cent – in line with the discount rate.45 However, rental yields of less than 2 per cent implied a payback of nearly seven decades – roughly the same length of time as residential land leases, after which title reverted to the state. China’s property market was hailed as the ‘bubble that never pops’.46 But, as the NBER researchers commented, ‘only modest declines in expected appreciation seem needed to generate large drops in house values.’ ([Location 6357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6357))

China avoided the immediate consequences of the debt trap by concealing bad debts. What’s been called ‘Red Capitalism’ resembled a shell game in which non-performing loans were passed from one state-connected player to another. The shell game commenced at the turn of this century when state banks were weighed down with non-performing loans. The bad loans weren’t written off, however, but sold at face value to state-owned asset management companies (AMCs), which paid for them by issuing ten-year bonds that were, in turn, acquired by the state-owned banks.

Concealing or ‘evergreening’ bad debts required low interest rates. China’s rate cuts in 2001 and 2002 were partly intended to help banks handle their debt problems. Over the following years, bank loan rates were kept well below the country’s nominal GDP growth, while deposit rates remained stuck beneath 3 per cent. Thus, Chinese depositors indirectly bailed out the banking system.88 ([Location 6530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6530))

As John Law had discovered in 1720, it is not possible for a country to fix the price of its currency on the foreign exchanges while rapidly expanding the domestic money supply. Since 2008 China’s money supply had grown relentlessly relative to the size of its economy and the world’s total money supply. Those trillions of dollars’ worth of foreign exchange reserves provided an illusion of safety since a large chunk was tied up in illiquid investments. Besides, cash deposits in China’s banks far exceeded foreign exchange reserves. If only a fraction of those deposits left the country, however, the People’s Republic would face a debilitating currency crisis.

A quarter of China’s dollar billionaires were real estate moguls.136 At the top of the rich list was Xu Jiayin, boss of property developer China Evergrande, whose fortune (in 2018) was estimated at $40 billion. Many successful property developers turned out to be the offspring of top Party members.137 Local government officials who drove villagers off their land to hand it over to developers acted as ‘engines of inequality’.138 Financial repression turned back the clock on China’s economic liberalization. Throughout its history, the Middle Kingdom’s progress ‘has an intermittent character and is full of leaps and bounds, regressions and relapses’.139 In general, when the state has been relatively weak and money plentiful, the Middle Kingdom has advanced. Incomes were probably higher in the twelfth century under the relatively laissez-faire Song than in the mid-twentieth century when the Communists came to power. But when the state has shown a more authoritarian character, economic output has stagnated or declined. The mandarins’ desire for total monetary control contributed to Imperial China’s ‘great divergence’ from Western economic development. In recent years, China has experienced an authoritarian relapse. Paramount leader Xi Jinping exercises imperial powers. An Orwellian system of electronic surveillance tracks the citizenry. Millions of Uighurs are reported to have been locked up in camps. Private companies are required to place the interests of the state before their own. The ‘China 2025’ economic development plans aim to establish Chinese predominance in a number of new technologies, from artificial intelligence to robotics. A system of social credits, which rewards and punishes citizens’ behaviour, will supplement conventional credit. A digital yuan, issued by the People’s Bank, will supplement – or even replace – conventional money. These developments are best summed up by a phrase that became commonplace in the 2010s: ‘the state advances, while the private [sector] retreats.’140 Financial repression has played a role in this regressive movement. The credit binge launched by the 2008/9 stimulus enhanced Beijing’s sway over the economy. As the state has advanced, productivity growth has declined. Because interest rates neither reflect the return on capital nor credit risk, China’s economy has suffered from the twin evils of capital misallocation and excessive debt. Real estate development, fuelled by low-cost credit, delivered what President Xi called ‘fictional growth’. By 2019 Chinese GDP growth (per capita) had fallen to half its 2007 level. The Third Plenum of the Eighteenth Chinese Communist Party Congress, held in Beijing in 2013, heralded profound reforms to banking practices. The ceiling on bank deposit rates was lifted, and banks could set their own lending rates.

Bad loans would become harder to conceal. Without access to subsidized credit, state-owned enterprises would become even less profitable. Corporate zombies would keel over. Economic planners would lose the ability to direct cheap capital to favoured sectors. The cost of controlling the currency on the foreign exchanges would become prohibitively expensive. Beijing would no longer be able to manipulate real estate or fine-tune other markets.142 The Party’s monopoly of power has survived the liberalization of most commercial prices and many business activities, but the cadres never removed their grip on the most important price of all.

- debt.10 With the prospect of short-term interest rates being held below inflation for years without end, the hedge fund tycoon Ray Dalio anticipated what he called a ‘beautiful deleveraging’.11 Contrary to Dalio’s expectation, public and private debt kept on rising. The lure of financial engineering prompted companies to take on more debt, while the decline in government bond yields removed any incentive to fiscal prudence. Hence the Trump administration’s near $1 trillion federal deficit in 2019 at a time when the US economy was in its tenth year of expansion. Among the advanced economies, only Germany resisted the urge to borrow and spend.12 By the end of 2020, the US national debt was higher relative to GDP than in 1945. Quantitative easing made it easier for governments to run large deficits. But, from a financial perspective, this operation involved swapping long-dated government bonds for short-term liabilities (cash deposits at the central banks). As a result, government finances became yet more vulnerable to even a small rise in interest rates. In the United Kingdom, for instance, it was estimated that a 1 per cent rise in interest rates would cost the British government around 0.8 per cent of GDP in extra interest payments.13 The political imperative to maintain financial repression was overwhelming. As in the post-war period, the return of financial repression was accompanied by greater government involvement in the economy. As France’s President Nicolas Sarkozy observed in 2009, ‘The main feature of this crisis is the return of the state.’ State capitalism – described as a ‘bureaucratically engineered capitalism’ marked by a ‘long-term commitment to progressively greater state control’ – became more entrenched.14 China led the way with its massive economic stimulus, financed by state-controlled banks, planned by local governments and implemented by state-owned enterprises.

Some commentators suggested that the Japanese stocks no longer reflected fundamentals.23 The shift to negative interest rates comprised the central bankers’ most audacious move. After all, what is a negative interest rate but a tax on capital – taxation without representation, no less? There appeared to be no limit on how far central bankers might go to enforce their policies. If hoarding thwarted their negative interest-rate policy, then it was time to abolish cash.24 The ‘paper currency’, wrote Kenneth Rogoff in his 2016 book The Curse of Cash, ‘has become a major impediment to the smooth functioning of the global financial system.’25 What the former IMF chief economist meant was that the existence of banknotes impeded the central bankers’ ability to engage in radical monetary experiments. A cashless world, Rogoff admitted, would look different to the one we were used to. Beggars would have to be provided with debit card readers (as was already the case in progressive Sweden). Cheques would lie around uncashed – an alternative form of hoarding. People would file their taxes early (as reportedly occurred in Wörgl in the 1930s). There were some drawbacks, for sure.

In a cashless world, the state would be able to record every transaction over the course of a person’s life, from a child’s first purchase of tooth-destroying sweets onwards. Rogoff envisaged a day when all cash would be digitized and every citizen had a bank account with the central bank. A few years later, central banks started to examine the issue of digital currencies – money issued by central banks without any physical manifestation. Needless to say, this idea originated in authoritarian China. ‘Money,’ wrote Friedrich Hayek, ‘is one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented by man.’26 As Dostoyevsky put it, ‘money is coined liberty.’27 Cash allows people to make transactions discreetly, even if that discretion is sometimes abused.

- THE ROAD TO SERFDOM REVISITED Hayek’s comment on money appears in his best-selling book The Road to Serfdom, a lengthy critique of central planning published in 1944. Hayek feared that the enhanced role of the state during wartime would permanently erode traditional economic and political freedoms. Although the Austrian economist wrote extensively elsewhere about monetary policy and interest rates – and, in particular, how easy money interfered with the economy’s ‘steering mechanism’ – these topics are not directly addressed in The Road to Serfdom. Nevertheless, since the setting of interest rates is just one aspect of central planning, Hayek’s concerns are relevant to our understanding of the post-Lehman world. The Road to Serfdom was directed at the unintended consequences of centralized economic policymaking. ‘[W]e may choose the wrong way,’ Hayek wrote in the Introduction, ‘not by deliberation and concerted decision, but because we seem to be blundering into it.’29 Hayek was sceptical about the mindset of central planners, scientists and engineering types whose ‘habits of thought … tended to discredit the results… ([Location 6881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6881))

- their own devices, they would impose their preferences on the community. Central planning doesn’t work, in Hayek’s view, because public officials can never gather all the information needed to make it work. On the other hand, capitalism works because it is a system in which decision-making is decentralized: prices set under competitive conditions contain all the information about people’s infinitely varied preferences. Hayek refers to ‘regulation by the price mechanism’. If resources aren’t allocated by the market then the authorities must step in. He was concerned that ‘once the free working of the market is impeded beyond a certain degree, the planner will be forced to extend his controls until they become all-comprehensive.’32 In The Road to Serfdom, Hayek warns against official attempts to achieve full employment through monetary policy, which he believed would damage growth prospects.

- Under a central-planning regime, he predicted, people would seek security instead of independence, while ‘insecurity becomes the dreaded state of the pariah.’ Regulation, he feared, would serve the interests of the powerful at the expense of everyone else.34 The economist-philosopher fretted about how inequality would be perceived under central planning: ‘Inequality is undoubtedly more readily borne, and affects the dignity of the person much less, if it is determined by impersonal forces than when it is due to design.’35 Political stability, in Hayek’s view, depends on the existence of a strong middle class: ‘the one decisive factor in the rise of totalitarianism on the Continent,’ he wrote, ‘is the existence of a large recently dispossessed middle class.’36 Hayek hadn’t completely abandoned hope. The future of capitalism and democracy depended on economic growth, he stated.

The management of industry and trade would become a matter of current administration, and the personnel would unavoidably acquire the characteristics of a bureaucracy. Socialism of a very sober type would almost automatically come into being.38 Schumpeter shared Hayek’s fears for the future. The bulk of the population, he thought, took improvements in the standard of living for granted while resenting the insecurity produced by capitalism. While Hayek cited Julien Benda’s 1927 book, La Trahison des Clercs (‘The Treason of the Intellectuals’), which criticized the cult of scientific expertise, Schumpeter believed that capitalism was under attack from intellectuals – a group distinguished by their ‘absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs’, whose ranks were swollen by rising numbers of university graduates filled with a ‘righteous indignation about… ([Location 6921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6921))

- decades. Capitalism triumphed. No victory is permanent, however. Concerns for the future of capitalism, liberalism and even democracy itself have resurfaced. Once again, we are faced with the unintended consequences of central planning. This may appear less obvious now than in Hayek’s day because our central planning hasn’t so far involved the nationalization of industries, large-scale public investment, the regulation of prices and incomes, high levels of taxation, rationing, or other wartime measures. Instead, central planning in the twenty-first century has involved manipulating the most important price in a market-based economy, the universal price, namely the rate of interest. Interest lies at the heart of capitalism. Interest rates are the traffic signals that guide the market economy, writes James Grant.40 Turn off those signals and pile-ups occur. If money is provided too cheaply, the market’s steering mechanism breaks down, as Hayek explained elsewhere.fn4 Without interest, future income streams are impossible to value. Capital can’t be properly allocated and too little is saved. If this situation continues for long, then state investment would have to replace private investment and central banks would have to replace commercial banks as the major providers of credit. Without interest to regulate financial behaviour, an inherently unstable financial system would require endless new regulations. Like Bastiat, Hayek understood that the immediate stimulative effects of cheap money were seen but the economic damage it wrought was not so obvious. As we have described over the course of this book, each time the monetary authorities stepped forward to deal with some real and pressing problem – whether the collapsing banking system, the unravelling of international credit and rising unemployment in 2008, or Europe’s sovereign debt crisis a couple of years later – there followed secondary consequences that were never properly considered or resolved. So far, each step we have taken on this new road to serfdom has been incremental and justified on the grounds of expediency. Little thought has been given to the general direction in which we have been travelling. There is no grand master plan, unlike in Marxism, to concentrate minds. Rather, we have blundered – to use Hayek’s term – into greater government control of the economy. And the more we… ([Location 6934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6934))

- Iceland is a small country that benefited from a massive currency devaluation. That option wasn’t open to every crisis-stricken country. Still, Iceland’s experience shows that there was an alternative to slashing interest rates and protecting the financial system at any cost. Iceland’s answer was to let the banks fail, prosecute miscreant bankers (two dozen of whom were sent to jail) and shelter domestic depositors and homeowners at the expense of other creditors. The US approach to the subprime crisis was the opposite in almost every respect. It would be a mistake to go into the next crisis equipped with the same tools and mindset that failed to restore our economies to health after 2008. In the early 1930s, Hayek argued that the cure for a credit boom wouldn’t come from lowering interest rates or by running large fiscal deficits. If interest rates had been too low before the crisis, then reducing them further was not the answer. Instead, he believed that interest rates should be allowed to ([Location 7024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7024))

- rise, along with savings (which had been too low beforehand). Bad investments should be liquidated, he added. The Austrian economist failed to convince people at the time. Yet Iceland adopted many of Hayek’s prescriptions, out of necessity rather than ideological fervour, and emerged from the crisis in better shape than most. Hayek didn’t believe that economics lent itself to real-life experiments.49 Still, he might have felt vindicated by this outcome. Towards the end of his life, the veteran economist visited Iceland. It was suggested to him that economic principles didn’t apply to a small country like Iceland. Hayek disagreed. Economic principles were valid everywhere, he said.50 ([Location 7031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7031))

- The Road to Serfdom was published at a time of war, when most of the world’s economies were under the control of the state. Hayek anticipated, wrongly as it turned out, that having advanced so far the state’s dominion must inevitably extend. Instead, Western societies settled into peacetime with what used to be called a ‘mixed economy’, one that was neither capitalist nor socialist. Nor was the post-war experience of financial repression an unmitigated economic disaster. In fact, after 1945 France experienced a prolonged period of strong economic growth, known as Les ([Location 7039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7039))

- Trente Glorieuses. Germany enjoyed its Wirtschaftswunder. America’s economy returned to its pre-Depression growth trend. Britain limped along as the ‘sick man of Europe’, but its economy performed better than in recent years. The Bretton Woods period (1945–71) was largely free from speculative bubbles and financial crises. Decades of financial repression, combined with high taxes, realized Keynes’s long-held ambition for the euthanasia of the rentier.fn5 It seems that Hayek got his timing wrong. In the post-war years, conventional wisdom held that inflation could be held in check without recourse to interest rates. When inflation returned in the 1960s, the initial policy response involved the introduction of prices-and-incomes controls, which took the state into every nook and cranny of economic life. The era of stagflation beckoned. Hayek took up his pen again to resist the state’s encroachments, pointing out the futility of price controls in the battle against inflation. Governments, he wrote, were holding ‘a tiger by the tail’.46 The wheel has turned full circle. Once again, we are faced with the suppression of interest rates accompanied by the advance of the state in many areas of economic life. Prominent economists, such as Larry Summers, call for greater public investment. US Democrats propose a Green New Deal. A new generation of central planners has arisen who propose technocratic solutions for our economic and social ills. If we are to avoid progressing too far along the new road to serfdom, their assumptions and policies require greater scrutiny from politicians and from the public at large. Thirty years after the publication of The Road to Serfdom, Hayek was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In his prize lecture, entitled ‘The Pretence of Knowledge’, the veteran economist chastised his fellow economists for their failure to consider the complexity of human life.… ([Location 7043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7043))

- Over the following months, the Fed’s balance sheet doubled (from $4 trillion to $8 trillion). Other central banks followed suit. Together they created more money than in all the years since Lehman’s bankruptcy. Directly and indirectly, the central banks financed the Great Lockdown with its unemployment payments, furlough schemes, support for stricken businesses and countless other emergency expenditures. Never outside wartime had governments run up so much debt, borrowed so cheaply or spent so quickly. Never had governments closed down large parts of their economies while maintaining, and even in some cases boosting, people’s incomes. The world had indeed turned upside down.

Wall Street’s meltdown was followed by an even more dramatic melt-up. Asset price bubbles proliferated: bubbles in stocks and bonds, in real estate and household wealth, in cryptocurrencies and digital art, in luxury goods (supercars and Swiss watches) and household pets (Cockapoos selling for $5,000 a pup), and in collectibles (baseball and Pokémon trading cards).

- Bernstein, a New York-based fund manager and former Wall Street strategist, produced a ‘Bubble checklist’ (composed of increased liquidity, rising leverage, elevated market turnover, a boom in new issues, and the ‘democratization of the market’).7 All these bubble conditions were met. US stocks traded at unprecedented valuations. US house prices rose more quickly than during the real estate bubble. US household wealth climbed faster than ever before to reach a new high. After the initial dislocation, Treasury yields fell to an all-time low. US junk yields also declined to their lowest ever level. Around the world, some $18 trillion-worth of bonds yielded less than zero. In Europe, designated high-yield bonds sported negative yields. Warren Buffett’s long-time partner, Charlie Munger, described the market frenzy as ‘the most dramatic thing that almost ever happened in the entire world history of finance’.8 He wasn’t exaggerating. Cash flowed from American stimulus cheques into the millions of new accounts opened at Robinhood Markets. The app-based broker offered zero-commission trading, margin loans at 2 per cent and options trading for the masses, and blended techniques developed in Silicon Valley to attract users to its app with those developed in Las Vegas to keep gamers hooked.

- the next ‘meme’ stock, or ‘stonk’ in their parlance. Their trading mantra was YOLO – You Only Live Once. They were driven by fear as much as greed – Fear of Missing Out. A bet that went stratospheric was called a ‘mooner’. More money was raised by US public offerings in 2020 than in any previous year, including at the height of the Dotcom frenzy. Among the bubble companies that accompanied the South Sea Bubble three centuries earlier was the ‘company for carrying an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is’. Now dozens of blank-cheque vehicles came to the market. Known as Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), they were used to purchase speculative ventures, in electric-vehicle technology, space travel, flying taxis, cannabis farming and a company to ‘augment humans to enhance productivity and safety’. Like the original bubble companies, some SPACs were obvious frauds. Others didn’t take themselves seriously, adopting emoticons (LMFAO, viz: ‘laughing my fucking arse off’) for stock tickers. Meme stocks weren’t confined to new technologies.

- that had sold short GameStop shares lost billions of dollars. This wasn’t so much the democratization of finance, touted by Robinhood, as mob rule. Cryptocurrencies joined the carnival. The price of Bitcoin climbed nearly tenfold (between January 2020 and April 2021), its market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. This performance was nothing compared to lesser-known cryptos. Originally conceived as a spoof on Bitcoin, Dogecoin’s price rose nearly 150-fold. Not to be outdone, a spoof on Dogecoin, called Shiba Inu, did even better. A digital collage, transferred in electronic form as a ‘nonfungible token’ or NFT, sold at Christie’s for $69 million. An NFT containing a Dogecoin image was split into fractional shares and valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.

- truncating downside volatility, forestalling business failures, and postponing the day of reckoning, such policies have persuaded investors that risk has gone into hibernation or simply vanished.10 Warren Buffett agreed that ultra-high valuations were supported by ultra-low interest rates. ‘Interest rates,’ said the Sage of Omaha, ‘basically are to the value of assets what gravity is to matter.’fn1 Once this gravitational force was removed, Dogecoins, NFTs, meme stocks and other speculative assets were free to float into the stratosphere.

- lush monetary pastures and companies are worth more bankrupt than as going concerns; in which money that can’t be used in exchange soars in value; in which central bankers create wealth by printing money and government deficits create private savings. As it turns out, Carroll did conceive much of this. In his less well-known novel Sylvie and Bruno, the Outland Emperor wishes to make his subjects twice as rich. A ‘new Money-act’ is proposed that involves doubling the value of every coin and banknote. ‘I wonder why nobody ever thought of it before!’ says the Emperor’s adviser, the Outland Professor. ‘And you never saw such universal joy. The shops are full from morning to night. Everybody’s buying everything!’ On the other side of the Looking-Glass, Carroll turned conventional values upside down: two eggs cost less than one and a ‘puff [a pun on a speculative promotion] is worth a thousand pounds’. The author even invented his own cryptographic money order. In his books Carroll played with time. Time stands still at the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party. The Hatter himself is accused of ‘murdering the time’ (by singing out of tune). Alice is accused of wasting time.

- events to happen in reverse order. Carroll would have understood that when the price of time is set at nothing or turns negative, and central banks print money without limit, finance becomes absurd. The autists on WallStreetBets found the situation intensely amusing. Serious investors, such as Klarman, found it deeply worrying. THE COVID TRANSITION The novelist Michel Houellebecq claimed that the ‘banal virus’ would change nothing. ‘We will not wake up after the lockdown in a new world. It will be the same, just a bit worse,’ a pessimistic Houellebecq announced on French radio. It was true that Covid aggravated existing ills. In the financial world shutdowns were accompanied by more money-printing, more debt and even lower interest rates. Big Business thrived while small businesses were shuttered. Big Tech’s monopoly profits were fattened by enforced screentime.

- Yet the acceleration of these tendencies brought them closer to an endpoint. In China, the pandemic sent the housing market into overdrive. By this date, nearly a third of economic activity in the People’s Republic was exposed to property development. China’s housing stock was valued at nearly four times GDP. President Xi decided to grasp the nettle. Towards the end of 2020, Beijing introduced its ‘three red lines’, measures intended to reduce property developers’ use of leverage. By the following summer, Evergrande, the country’s largest developer, with debts of around $300 billion, was on the verge of failure. Housing sales collapsed. The ‘bubble that never pops’ had popped. Bursting property bubbles are usually accompanied by deflation. In the West, on the other hand, the pandemic brought a gust of inflation. Global supply chains snapped as countries locked down. And once lockdowns were lifted, the United States and other Western countries faced labour shortages. Wage growth picked up. The price of a barrel of oil, which had briefly turned negative in April 2020, now surged past $75 and continues rising.

- ‘We’re not thinking about raising rates, we’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,’ Fed chief Jerome Powell declared in the summer of 2020. The Fed’s Vice Chairman, Richard Clarida, later added more prosaically that ‘the decline in neutral policy rates since the Global Financial Crisis is a global phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist for years to come.’ Yet few things in finance are harder to predict than the direction of interest rates. Turns in the bond market occur infrequently, only once every several decades, and when this moment arrives most experts are taken by surprise. In 1899, the President of Equitable Life solicited opinions from respected American financiers on the future course of long-term interest rates. At this date bond yields had been falling for decades. The sages of Wall Street assumed this trend would continue. Of the sixty-nine responses received by Equitable Life not one anticipated any change. Treasury Secretary Lyman Gage held the view that interest rates were headed ‘permanently downwards’.11 Gage was wrong. The bond bull market had already ended, and over the following decades Treasury yields rose. The bear market in bonds that commenced at the end of the nineteenth century coincided with the reversal of globalization. The bond bear market that started in 1945 followed a period when US interest rates had been kept at artificially low levels and Federal Reserve banks lent directly to the American government to finance the war effort. Inflation returned with a vengeance after the war and Treasury yields rose for the next three and a half decades. It’s not hard to draw parallels between these periods and the Covid conjuncture. Stepping down from his role as the Bank of England’s chief economist in mid-2021, Andrew Haldane warned that the balance of risks was tilted towards inflation. The central bank’s role, said Haldane, was to remove… ([Location 7200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7200))

- Keynes’s Cambridge contemporary, the economist Dennis Robertson, was enthralled by Lewis Carroll. Every chapter in his popular book Money contains an epigraph from Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Robertson thought that Keynes’s interest theory was as insubstantial as the grin of the Cheshire Cat.fn2 Unlike Keynes, he believed in the necessity of interest: Something is needed to ensure the equality between the amount of tea which sellers are willing to put on to the market and the amount which buyers are willing to take off it; and that something is a certain price of tea. Similarly, something is needed to ensure equality between the amount of money which lenders are willing to put on the market for loans and the amount of money which borrowers are willing to take off it; and that something is a certain rate of interest.14 What Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht called a ‘true rate’ of interest reflects the supply and demand for actual savings. As we have seen, this true or natural rate is not necessarily revealed by the active presence of inflation or deflation. Central bankers who fix interest rates by reference to changes in an index of consumer prices are setting themselves up to fail. The source of the problem is that, whereas capital is limited, the medium by which savings are transferred – namely, money – can… ([Location 7221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7221))

- out the bad, he predicted. Any bank that offered too little interest would lose clients.15 The advent of cryptocurrencies has the potential to realize Hayek’s vision. Cryptocurrencies are already lent on various platforms (one of which calls itself ‘Compound’). Interest on crypto loans is charged at suspiciously high rates, suggesting the existence of Ponzi schemes, and the early history of cryptocurrencies has been marked by seamy behaviour and uncertainty regarding their true scarcity. Still, it’s possible that one day a cryptocurrency may emerge which is safe to store, efficient for transactions and limited in supply. The trouble is that governments won’t willingly give up their money monopoly. There is an alternative. Central banks are developing digital currencies to compete with free-wheeling cryptos. The central bank digital currencies might be used to acquire government bonds that would provide them with asset-backing. If their issuance was limited to no more than the economy’s trend growth rate, this money would be as good as gold.16 A digital Gold Standard would have some of the advantages, and fewer of the disadvantages, of the classical Gold… ([Location 7236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7236))
