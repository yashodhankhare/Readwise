## Highlights
- For the longest time, the editor of this book, Alice Mayhew, had planned to call it The Sunny Side of the Street. It’s easy enough to see why. A Piece of the Action—a title she tossed at me at the very last minute, and which I immediately embraced—is about the historical process by which millions of middle-class Americans went from being savers—people who kept their money in the bank and spent it frugally—to being unrepentant borrowers and investors. It traces the invention of products like credit cards, mutual funds, and individual retirement accounts, as well as events like the Age of Inflation in the late 1970s, which helped change the way people thought about and dealt with their money. It also tells the stories of a handful of men who were there at the creation, men like Charles Merrill, the flamboyant founder of Merrill Lynch; Peter Lynch, the investing guru who managed the Fidelity Magellan Fund; and Charles Schwab, who transformed his eponymous company into the nation’s biggest discount broker. During the six years it took me to complete A Piece of the Action, I came to think of the subject of this book as “the democratization of money.” ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=43))

- But there were also millions of middle- and upper-middle-class Americans who got caught up in the subprime bubble in one of two ways. Many decided to replace a prime mortgage with a subprime mortgage—which usually entailed pulling out tens or perhaps ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=192))

- hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, money that was then rolled into the mortgage. Secondly, they took out subprime home equity loans—often called second mortgages—with lower “teaser” interest rates that increased sharply after a few years. Sometimes, these second mortgages were independent of the first mortgages; they were again a way for the homeowners to pocket the appreciation of their homes without having to actually sell the house. But sometimes, the second mortgage served as the down payment for the first mortgage. So long as the value of one’s home kept rising, this game could go on. When the interest rate on your adjustable subprime mortgage jumped after a year or two, you simply refinanced and got a new starter rate. If the value of the home had risen high enough, you could pull out yet more cash. But of course, home prices couldn’t keep rising at a double-digit rate forever. By 2008, they had not only stopped rising but had collapsed. The game was over. Millions of Americans, poor and middle-class alike, were suddenly faced with the grim prospect of having to repay the mortgages that they’d assumed they could perpetually roll over. I don’t really need to recount what happened then, do I? ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=194))

- Ghilarducci’s book got enough attention that that October, shortly after the fall of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis, she was invited to testify before Congress. “The 401k is a failed experiment,” she said bluntly. Afterward, she told me, several people who had been at the congressional hearing told her that her line would be the only thing anybody remembered from the hearing. Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh, attacked her. A blogger for U.S. News & World Report called her “the most dangerous woman in America.” But all she had really done was state the obvious.

- Ghilarducci believes that during the financial crisis, the federal government should have helped people whose 401ks had been eviscerated over the previous decade. Just as the government bought so-called toxic assets from the banks and handed them to BlackRock, a big bond fund manager, it should have done something similar with 401k assets. The government has made a profit on the assets it bought from the banks; she thought the same could have been possible with the mutual funds and other assets invested in 401ks.

- This book is a history of one such enormous change in American life: the astonishing transformation of the financial habits of the middle class. By this I’m referring not only to the process that led us to become investors, though that’s certainly a large part of it. Rather, I’m speaking about a broader set of habits that have resulted from Americans having to take charge of their own financial lives, habits that include changes in the way we borrow, the way we save, even the way we think about our money.

- The financial markets were once the province of the wealthy, and they’re not anymore; they belong to all of us. We’ve finally gotten a piece of the action. If we have to pay attention now, if we have to come to grips with our own tolerance for risk, if we’re forced to spend a little time learning about which financial instruments make sense for us and which ones don’t, that seems to me an acceptable price to pay. Democracy always comes at some price. Even financial democracy. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=299))

- Sometimes change comes about in an obvious and dramatic way, but more often it takes place gradually and even imperceptibly. It’s only afterward, when the dust has settled, that we suddenly have the presence of mind to look up and see that everything is different. The money revolution has been a work in progress for some thirty years now, but it’s only been quite recently that we’ve finally been able to look up and see how much has changed. When did we start putting our savings in money market funds instead of bank passbook accounts? When did we start using credit cards for items that used to require a trip to see the loan officer at the bank? When did mutual funds capture our fancy? When did we become so aware of yield that we began moving our money around to capture an extra half a percentage point? When did we start keeping track of the Japanese stock market? When did this all happen? How did this all happen? Here is how it happened. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=303))

- Thus did Americans begin to spend money they didn’t yet have; thus did the unaffordable become affordable. And thus, it must be said, did the economy grow. Between 1945 and 1960, consumer credit simply exploded, going from $2.6 billion to $45 billion. A decade later, it stood at $105 billion. It was as if the entire middle class ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=449))

- In hindsight, that is what made BankAmericard so different from any financial product that had come before it. It put the onus entirely on the customer. It was he or she alone who got to make the key decisions about how and when to spend large sums of money—and how and when to pay it back. It could be used impulsively or carefully, frequently or sparingly, for emergencies or for shopping sprees. And then, when the bill arrived, it was he or she alone who decided whether to pay back the money all at once (with no interest), or in installments (with interest). The crucial point is ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=538))

- that the customer was in control of financial decisions that had always before required the explicit approval of a banker or loan officer. One major reason previous credit card programs had flopped was that most banks feared giving their customers that much control. Bank of America had no such qualms.

- A store owner who accepted the credit card was, in effect, handing his back office headaches over to the Bank of America. The bank would guarantee him payment—within days instead of months—and would take over the role of collecting from the customers. As for the bank, in addition to taking its 6 percent cut, the card was a way to get its hooks into businessmen who were not yet Bank of America customers.

- Williams himself had an almost prudish view of his new device. “The biggest thing a credit card can do is enable families to take advantage of sales—to buy your skis in the summer and your barbecue grill in the winter,” he says. “I wanted people to understand that their goal should be to make credit pay them, instead of having them pay for credit. If they overspent,” he adds with a paternalistic smile, “then you might have to rap their knuckles once in a while.” ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=601))

- THE GREATEST POPULARIZER of the stock market—the man who spent his career trying to convince the middle class that stocks and bonds should be a part of their lives—died in his bed, at his Long Island retreat, on October 6, 1956. He was seventy years old, and though the moment of death had arrived suddenly, the real surprise is that he lived as long as he did.

- On October 5, he lapsed into a coma, and the next day, Charles Edward Merrill was dead. Of the hundreds who attended his funeral—the industrialists whose stock he had underwritten, the partners he had made wealthy, the family he had tried, however imperfectly, to love, even some of the women he had seduced—most had known him as Charlie. Good Time Charlie Merrill. He was a piece of work. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=718))

- Most importantly, they both bet correctly that success in their particular spheres of personal finance lay with attracting the middle class, instead of catering to the rich. “Bringing Wall Street to Main Street” was the way Merrill liked to describe his life’s work, and although his life ended well before his work was done, those words would echo through the decades, as events gradually conspired to push Americans in the direction Merrill had always tried to lead them. In time, his central idea, that the middle class should be investors as well as savers, would be at the heart of the money revolution.

- Always, he carried around a palpable pride, and a need to place himself at the center of any orbit he was in. “Whatever he decided to serve,” his son James Merrill once wrote, “the victim was meant to choke it down and be grateful.” James Merrill, of course, would go on to become one of America’s finest poets; he was also one of the rare homosexual men in the 1950s who lived his life, in large measure, in general disregard of the closet. At first, Charlie Merrill had a difficult time comprehending both these aspects of his son’s life. Once, after Merrill learned his son was having an affair with a professor at Amherst College, he was filled with such instant rage that he fleetingly contemplated having ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=810))

- the professor killed. And though Merrill realized early on that his son was unlikely ever to join the firm, he was still not disposed to look kindly on a vocation so profitless (in the literal sense) as poetry—at least not until the president of Amherst assured Merrill that his son had “professional” talent.

- Three days after assuming control, Merrill called a conference of his new partners, where he laid out his plans. In effect, Merrill was planning to apply to the brokerage industry the same principles that had made chain stores so successful: the mass marketing techniques, the emphasis on high volume and low cost, the saturation advertising, the nationwide distribution network. To the snickers of his competitors and the skepticism of many of his new partners, he would run his new firm as if it were a supermarket. It was his last great business insight. On the face of it, there was scarcely an industry in America less amenable to mass marketing techniques than the brokerage business. It had always been a high-cost, low-volume industry that made its money by catering to the wealthy. Indeed, Merrill’s own cost structure was instructive: At the end of the 1930s, his firm was spending $14.29 on each transaction but taking in only $10.17. “When you figure that one of our clients, the Carnation Milk Company, can content the cow, milk it, pasteurize the milk, put the milk in the can, put a label on it, put it in a box, advertise it, ship it all over the world, and sell the can of milk for five cents, then you realize how perfectly frantic these figures make me feel,” Merrill said. His first order of business was to slash costs, which he did ruthlessly, employing Smith as his designated hatchet man. He and Smith even closed the large, plushly appointed ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=836))

- And finally, a Merrill Lynch man would be paid a salary. To Merrill, this was the most important change of all—and the one his brokers most resented. Historically, brokers made their money on commissions that were added to the price of a stock or a bond that a broker bought or sold for a client. This system had a glaring built-in conflict (as it does to this day), pitting the need of the broker for commission revenue against the desire of the customer for sound ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=863))

- and stable investments. From time immemorial, unscrupulous brokers “churned” accounts to reap commissions, but even honest brokers faced temptation. A broker with a clientele full of contented customers was—and still is—a broker who will soon be looking for a new job. Brokers needed trades to make money. Putting his brokers on salary was Merrill’s way of eliminating the temptation. A salaried broker, he believed, would be better able to guide clients to long-term investments without having to worry about the need to generate periodic trades. And the customer, listening to his broker’s advice, would know that it wasn’t motivated by the prospect of commissions. For the rest of his life, Merrill never changed his view about this, and despite periodic grumbling from the brokers, he refused to reintroduce a system of pay based on commissions.

- There was almost nothing Merrill Lynch wouldn’t do to spread the good word. It was said that $1 out of every $4 spent on advertising by Wall Street was spent by Merrill Lynch, a figure Merrill liked to toss off with both pride (he was doing his part) and disdain (nobody else was doing theirs). The firm published an endless stream of reports, investment magazines, pamphlets—11 million pieces in 1955 alone—with titles like How to Invest and How to Read a Financial Report. In 1948, it ran perhaps the most famous financial ad in history in… ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=881))

- And yet one ends up wondering whether Merrill felt disappointed by what he achieved in his lifetime. As grand as his accomplishments were, they simply did not lead to the kind of sweeping change in America’s financial habits that he had hoped for. Those 440,000 customers may have been a large number by Wall Street’s standards, but they were a pittance in the grand scheme of things, especially considering the growing prosperity of the middle class. And despite the firm’s success, Wall Street remained unmoved by his example. When Merrill died, his voice was nearly as lonely as when he’d first landed on Wall Street, enthusiastically soliciting “the modest sums of the thrifty.” ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=897))

- For the next ten minutes, as he gripped the podium to steady himself, he bemoaned Wall Street’s various failings—its failure to change its pay system, as he had done. It had failed to advertise and promote its business—the way Merrill Lynch had. American business had failed to persuade the middle class to come into the market—as he had urged. Brokers had failed to understand the greatness of their products—despite his many attempts to explain it to them. “If the average man had invested a set sum of money every year since 1937 . . . and reinvested his dividends every year, he would have done considerably better than if he put the same amount of money out at ordinary . . . compound interest. [But] you could tell that story to nine out of ten men in our line of business, and they wouldn’t even listen to you, much less believe it,” he growled. No wonder so few people had come to the stock market! Everyone had failed him. Including, perhaps, the American public itself. Despite everything he had done, there were only 6.5 million individual investors at the time Merrill made his speech. That amounted to 4 percent of the country. Had the other 96 percent listened to Merrill, they would have participated as the Dow Jones average made its steady climb during the 1950s. They would have made a great deal of money. But they were not yet ready, and nothing Merrill could say or do could make them ready. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=907))

- In the early 1960s, the market got much rockier, the classic example being its wild swing in the wake of the Kennedy assassination: In twenty-seven minutes of trading, the market lost $13 billion in value, only to gain it all back when the stock exchange reopened a few days later. In general, though, the upward momentum continued. In 1960, the Dow Jones average reached 685; by the end of 1962, it was over 900. And still the market remained not much more than a curiosity to most people.5 But by 1965 that had changed; the market had become interesting to many Americans again. It was not, however, the result of anything Merrill Lynch did, even though the firm continued to promote the virtues of the market as if it half-expected its founder to phone in his daily critiques from the grave. Instead, what caught the public’s attention was the spectacular performance of a young immigrant from Shanghai named Gerald Tsai, Jr. Tsai was a money manager at ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=931))

- an investment company based in Boston, called Fidelity Management and Research, and what he managed was a mutual fund. A mutual fund was an investment vehicle that allowed people to purchase shares not in a single stock, but in a group of stocks, which were bought and sold by a professional fund manager like Tsai. The money manager served as a proxy for the fund’s shareholders, making the investment decisions that most individual investors had neither the time nor the knowledge to make themselves. In effect, a fund manager was a buffer between market and investor. For most of their history, mutual funds had had an insignificant role in the market; at the end of World War II, all the funds put together held only $1 billion. But in the mid-1960s, they suddenly became hot: In 1965, $2.4 billion streamed into the market via mutual funds. Among the reasons for their popularity was that they held out the prospect, as The New Yorker’s John Brooks would later put it, “[of] making ‘people’s capitalism’ a reality instead of a catch phrase.” In other words, they appealed to the middle class. And thus the irony: Charlie Merrill, the champion of the middle-class investor, hated mutual funds. The reason for Merrill’s dislike of mutual funds is lost to history,6 but his view on the subject was well-known among the Merrill Lynch hierarchy.

- Lynch in 1946, and ran the firm in the 1970s, remembers writing a memo as a young staff assistant, suggesting that the firm start its own mutual fund. “I’m not going to touch this one,” his boss said. “Merrill will have a fit.” In his brash innocence, Regan insisted on having the memo shown to Merrill—and the great man did, indeed, have a fit. Merrill’s prejudice made such a deep impression that even after he had died, the firm still refused to have anything to do with mutual funds. Here, plainly, was Charlie Merrill’s blind spot. How could someone who believed so fervently in the importance of bringing the middle class to the market miss the deep appeal of mutual funds? How could he fail to see that people would embrace the idea of having a fund manager serve as their market proxy?

- And few could match his results. That’s the other reason he was famous. The growth funds run by Tsai and the other gunslingers were often called performance funds, for their explicit aim was to outperform the market. (Their implicit aim was to outperform each other.) Every year Tsai ran Fidelity Capital, it was near the top in terms of its annual gain. Once, in 1962, Tsai got caught in a market downdraft, but he recovered with such astonishing speed that his fund gained 68 percent in the next three months. In 1965, his last year at Fidelity, his fund gained close to 50 percent while the Dow itself rose only 15 percent. Thanks largely to Tsai’s growing legend, Fidelity’s small handful of funds grew from $239 million in 1955 to $1.5 billion a decade later.

- the right man for his time, but he also worked for the right company—the fund company that, more than any other, exalted performance, and championed the radical idea that a fund should be managed not by a committee of stodgy, anonymous men, but by one person, who would be free to follow his own market instincts. It is not too much to say, in fact, that Fidelity invented both concepts and that without these two radical notions—of measurable performance and solo fund managers—mutual funds would never have caught the public’s fancy the way they did. Portfolio managers, with their brash manners and controversial ways, competing against each other and the market: that was compelling in a way that a hundred of Charlie Merrill’s pamphlets were not. That was irresistible. Fidelity was owned by Edward Crosby Johnson 2d; it would be difficult to conjure up a more unlikely radical. In person, he seemed almost a caricature of the proper Bostonian: a discreet, reserved, formal man who favored bow ties and was known to everyone, at all times, as “Mr. Johnson.” A corporate lawyer, Johnson had a lifelong love affair with the market: He once famously told the writer Adam Smith that “the market is like a beautiful woman—endlessly fascinating, endlessly complex, always changing, always mystifying.” When offered the chance, in 1943, to take over an inconsequential fund called Fidelity Fund, which ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=989))

- “Two men can’t play a violin,” he liked to say. Thus did he create a new species, the portfolio manager, and a new kind of mutual fund investing. Very quickly, firms cropped up to monitor the performance of these newly aggressive funds, and published the results. By 1958, when Tsai began managing Fidelity Capital, the essential framework was in place. Did Johnson understand the way his radical changes would excite both the press and the public? It seems unlikely. For one thing, he was never the missionary that Charlie Merrill was; he wasn’t really thinking about trying to bring the middle class into the market, though that turned out to be one of the primary consequences of his innovations. He also didn’t understand that he had created a system that lent itself naturally to press coverage. The press loves anything that smells of a horse race, and that is what the mutual fund industry was now poised to become: an exciting annual race between portfolio managers and the market averages.

After his famous protégé had left, Johnson made it known within the firm that press inquiries were not to be answered.

- But as much as Tsai may have represented the end of that era, he also represented the beginning of something. He was a glimpse into the future. The system that Johnson established, and that Tsai epitomized—“the cult of performance,” in Smith’s words—that was here to stay. And in focusing so gleefully on Tsai’s post-Fidelity performance, the writers missed something else. Eventually, Johnson did retire, handing over the reins of power to his son Ned, just as he had said he would. Barely noticed at the time, this would turn out to be an event of far more significance than the rise and fall of Gerry Tsai.

Why should he be given credit until he can prove he knows how to use it?” So pervasive was this sentiment that when Proxmire’s bill banning the mailing of unsolicited cards made it to the Senate floor, it passed 79-1.

- What was most needed at this critical juncture was for someone to emerge who could lead the way—someone who was not paralyzed by the chaos, but galvanized by it. And 10 and behold, there he was. HIS NAME WAS DEE WARD HOCK, and if you found his surname almost comically apt for someone in the credit card business, you were best advised to keep it to yourself. Dee Hock took himself much too seriously to see the humor. He took his mission much too seriously too, which he came to define as making BankAmericard, which he ran from 1970 to 1984 (and whose name he changed to Visa along the way), the premier payment system in the world. This was the sort of grandiose phrase that came naturally to Dee Hock and a fair indication of the depths of his ambition. What he meant was that he expected Visa someday to replace the current “premier payment system,” which was, well, cash. To anyone expressing skepticism about this goal, Hock would refer the skeptic to the dictionary, where money was defined as “something generally accepted as a medium of exchange.” That’s what a credit card was, in his view: a device that was accepted as a medium of exchange between a buyer and a seller. Just like cash. “He used to say that money had evolved from shells to green paper to the artful arrangement of binary digits,” a former employee recalls. That’s the other thing a credit card did: in an electronic banking system, it set into motion a computer, which triggered the rearrangement of a person’s binary digits. Thus completing the exchange of value. Dee Hock wanted Visa to control the binary digits. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1256))

It wasn’t the finance business that bothered him so much as it was corporate life in general. Practices that other people accepted as the way of the world caused Hock to boil with rage. One reason he always wrote his own speeches at Visa was because he remembered how much it rankled him whenever he had had to ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1323))

- The interest banks paid to consumers was stuck for a very good reason: that’s where the Federal Reserve Bank wanted it to be. Under another one of those Depression-era bank regulations, the Federal Reserve had control over how much interest banks could pay their customers. Its power over bank interest rates was embodied in a rule called Regulation Q, which owed its existence to the Depression-era belief that banks had gotten into trouble in the 1930s because they paid too much interest in competing for deposits. This was quite true in 1933, when Regulation Q took effect; more than 4,000 banks closed that year, and the practice of overpaying for deposits had a lot to do with those closings. Forty years later, however, Reg Q had the perverse effect of forcing banks to pay too little interest on their customers’ deposits. It had gone from being a rule that protected banks from themselves to being a rule that protected banks from the vagaries of the real world. Banks were actually able to take advantage of inflation and high interest rates—for while Reg Q allowed banks to collect deposits at artificially low ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1552))

- rates, they could then turn around and lend out that money at the prevailing rate of 10 or 11 percent. Not surprisingly, Q was one regulation bankers did not complain about. So long as inflation was negligible, nobody else complained either; Regulation Q had no meaning in American life. But once inflation began to bubble up, Reg Q had a great deal of meaning. It meant that the middle class was losing money in its own bank accounts—and the government was not only allowing this to happen, it was causing it to happen. This was obvious to anyone who took the time to think it through. If you had money in the bank earning 41/2 percent annual interest, in a year when inflation rose by 6 percent, you lost, in effect, 11/2 percent of that money’s earning power. If you had money in the bank earning 41/2 percent in a year when T-bill rates hit, say, 81/2 percent, you were losing the chance to make an additional 4 percent of real world interest. This was not only obvious, it was untenable. Something had to give; somebody was bound to figure out a way around Regulation Q. The people who did so were Bruce Bent and Henry Brown on the East Coast and James Benham on the West Coast. For that’s what their money market fund was, ultimately: it was the way around Q. It was the most logical response to the disparity between market interest rates and the lower rates forced on the country’s savers by the Fed.

- Though they did not instantly grasp the ultimate significance of the money market fund, Brown and Bent understood completely that they were making the first real assault on Regulation Q. Here is Henry Brown describing the moment of epiphany: “It was a frustrating time,” he wrote in an unpublished chronicle, of their disastrous first two years in business. (“Bent calculated that the proprietor of the hot dog stand at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 53rd Street was making twice as much money as either of them.”) In a moment of desperation, Bent one day asked Brown: “ ‘How do you get money?’ “ ‘By paying more [interest] than anyone else,’ Brown replied.” Thus did the light bulb go on. “So now we had to figure out some way we could pay higher interest,” continued Bent. “Where could we find an aberration in the marketplace?” Regulation Q created the aberration. The two men first planned to exploit their discovery by starting a state-chartered bank someplace where Reg Q was not part of the state… ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1571))

- we were sitting around trying to sort out this situation,” Bruce Bent recalls, “[and] I said, ‘What about a mutual fund?’ ”  . . . They sat down and boned up on the Investment Company Act of 1940, and found, to their surprise, that nothing in the law seemed to stand in their way. Although making it a reality would turn out to be full of complications, the idea itself was fairly straightforward. They would create a mutual fund that would invest, as Brown puts it, “in short-term instruments of indebtedness.” In their first prospectus, Brown and Bent laid out plans for a fund that would rely primarily on two such instruments, T-bills and jumbo certificates of deposit (that is, CDs containing $100,000 or more), which had been deregulated in the mid-1960s, and therefore offered market interest rates. Just as investors in an equity fund reap the returns gained by the fund manager, investors in a money market fund would be able to reap the interest rates these instruments yielded.8 By sticking only to short-term debt—and mostly government debt, at that—Brown and Bent were ensuring that their fund’s yield would always reflect the current market interest… ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1581))

- As word of his fund’s prospectus spread, the mutual fund industry was stunned at what Ned Johnson was trying to do. It wasn’t so much the technical hurdles that stunned them, but the philosophy that underlay his willingness to allow customers to write checks against their money market fund. In doing so, Johnson was turning his back on one of the industry’s most firmly held beliefs. “Make it easy to put money into a fund,” went the old mutual fund saw, “but hard to take money out.” It often took weeks to redeem mutual fund shares—weeks of paperwork going back and forth in the mail, with silly requirements for notaries and signature guarantees and the like. Though no one ever said it in so many words, the idea was that if you made it hard for people to withdraw from a fund, they wouldn’t bother. Check writing turned this idea on its head. With Johnson’s fund, it would actually be easier to take money out of a money market fund than to put it in. “Our philosophy was that if you made it easy to withdraw your money, you’d wind up getting more of it,” says Johnson now. It sounds like a very basic observation, but it was a powerful new notion at the time. It meant that Johnson had begun to think of Fidelity not as a company that managed funds but as one that sold products, the same as any other consumer goods company. Consumer companies succeeded not by resisting the wishes of customers but by embracing those wishes. Customers returned to McDonald’s because it made their life easier, not harder. Ned Johnson was going to do that now too. He was going to treat investors like consumers, people whose money he had to fight for, since they had other places to put it—and would soon have many more such places. That’s what check writing implied. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1747))

- Unlike Bent and Brown, or Benham, Ned Johnson did not rely on word of mouth to promote his new fund. Here came the next new wrinkle: he relied on advertising, just like any other consumer-product company. This was another one of those decisions that made everyone at Fidelity nervous. But what choice did he have? The broker network was dead. Even if that hadn’t been the case, what broker would be willing to sell a money market fund, which had no commission attached? So Fidelity had to learn how to sell the fund itself. Johnson hired an ad man named Alan Holliday, who happened to be a long-time Fidelity investor. Holliday began writing a series of ads for the fund. “Fidelity’s Money Market Fund,” read the headline of one early ad, “the one with the check redemption feature.” If this effort seems less than inspired, the fault lay not with Holliday but with the SEC, which considered his work so racy that the agency regularly called Johnson to force him to tone it down. One touch Holliday always put in the ads was a little picture of a phone at the bottom corner. This was at Johnson’s insistence; he was sure the picture would offer a subliminal reinforcement to the basic message, which was that people should call Fidelity’s new 800 number and obtain a money market fund prospectus.

- And gradually, it all led to the next big idea: if you could sell money market funds directly to the public, why couldn’t you sell equity mutual funds that way too? Why did you have to continue relying on brokers who were so openly hostile? And why did you even have to impose a load on mutual funds? That money was supposed to be a commission for the brokers, but they had lost interest in selling the product. The answer was that you didn’t have to do any of those things. You could sell mutual funds the same way you sold money market funds: directly to the public, without having to charge a commission that went to a middleman. You could advertise mutual funds and promote their performance yourself. You ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1783))

You could turn your entire operation into a retail operation, instead of just the money market fund division. You could control all of your own destiny, not just a piece of it. To Johnson, this was the inescapable logic of the success of his money market fund. As he would prove over the next decade, it was a logic he willingly and eagerly embraced.

- By the spring of 1969, Hock had convinced all involved that the old licensing system was untenable. That May, with the Bank of America’s blessing, he formed one more committee, consisting of himself and three hand-picked allies. On a Monday morning, the four men checked into the Alta Mira Hotel in Sausalito, California, where they stayed for the rest of the week. Their mission was to devise the shape of the new organization that everyone now agreed needed to be created. As Hock later put it, in a speech, “We, like the founding fathers, have the need for a more sophisticated vehicle to insure to all the benefits to be derived from combined effort.” ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1827))

- Can you picture the joy with which Hock greeted the task that faced him that week? At the midpoint of his life, resigned to being a minor banking executive in Seattle, he was suddenly being handed the chance to leave his mark upon the world. (Just like the founding fathers!) If it worked as he hoped, his new organization would not only save a troubled industry, but would touch the life of every American who carried a credit card. One of Hock’s least attractive qualities is his false modesty, but he was never modest about what he created that week. He fell in love with what he did in Sausalito. What was there to love? Quite a bit, if you were Dee Hock. The organization that emerged from that week’s retreat was full of the kind of paradoxes that engaged his mind. For instance, although it was being set up to solve a specific set of credit card problems, Hock refused to discuss any such problems in Sausalito. The four men could only discuss principles, he said; if the principles2 of the new organization were sound, then the solutions would fall into place. The most basic principle: who should own the group? The member banks should own it jointly, they decided. This principle embodied not one but two paradoxes. The first was that through the creation of this cooperative venture, the member banks would be better able to compete with each other in the credit card business. The second was that such an organization, where bankers met regularly, abided by joint operating regulations, and shared data, managed nonetheless to stay on the right side of the nation’s antitrust laws. Another principle decided that week: the new organization would be run by a group of directors—“small enough to work effectively, yet large enough to represent all interests and areas adequately”—which would consist of officials of the member banks. Hock shrewdly worked out a cumulative voting system that prevented any one kind of bank from dominating the twenty-four-member3 board: eastern banks couldn’t blackball western banks, big banks couldn’t steamroller small ones.4 He replaced the loosely worded BankAmericard interchange payment system with a new system, based on a sliding scale of fees, that would be paid to the new organization. He established a series of stiff fines to prevent member banks from cheating the system. To assuage ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1832))

- the Bank of America’s pride, he devised a plan to give it a larger say for the first few years, granting it five board seats, a number that would be gradually reduced to one. By the time he was done, he had created a for-profit, member-owned, Delaware-incorporated company, which he named National BankAmericard Inc.: NBI for short. This is the organization we now know as Visa. In his more prosaic moments, Hock would describe NBI as an enabling organization, which it certainly was. Its purpose—in addition to keeping the BankAmericard system from collapsing—was to build the behind-the-scenes apparatus that would enable banks to run their credit card operations smoothly and profitably. The banks always saw its role as this and nothing more. Hock, however, viewed his brainchild as a great deal more, and at times, he could lapse into a description that bordered on the rhapsodic. “This was the first time in a 200- or 300-year-old industry—and perhaps the first time in any commercial enterprise—that an enormous number of… ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1850))

- And on July 9, 1970, even before the members had all joined, the new corporation held its first formal board meeting. Samuel Stewart, a courtly Southerner who was one of Bank of America’s three top executives, was elected chairman of the board.5 Then, according to the minutes of that meeting, “Mr. Stewart reviewed and the Board approved  . . . the provisions of an employment contract under which Dee W. Hock would be employed as president.” They gave him a three-year contract, a salary of $40,000, the authority to begin hiring a staff, and a mandate to save them from themselves. By the time that first contract expired, he had done that and quite a bit more. For better or worse, what Hock did in those early years at NBI is what made bank credit cards an integral part of American life.

- Similarly, if people harbored a suspicion that they bought more impulsively because their credit cards made such buying easy, they were right. People spent more in a store when they used a credit card than when they used cash—that was a verifiable fact. Indeed, it was a key selling point in the early days, when the banking industry was trying to persuade merchants to accept cards. Why would people spend more with cards than cash? Who could say? “Plastic cards have an anesthetizing effect,” speculates Stephen M. Pollan, the writer and financial adviser. “They allow people to temporarily ignore the question of whether they can really afford something or not.” Credit cards, in sum, were a psychological minefield, though not a minefield any banker wanted to muck around in. Consequently, the first serious inquiry into American attitudes ([Location 1892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1892))

- toward credit cards was conducted not by a banker but by a curious academic. His name was Lewis Mandell, who was then an economist at the University of Michigan.6 Each year, the university’s Survey Research Center, where Mandell worked, conducted a massive Survey of Consumer Finances. In the early 1970s, when he noticed that more than half of the people surveyed had a credit card, Mandell began including questions about credit card attitudes and habits. At around the same time Dee Hock was gearing up NBI, Mandell was arriving at a simple, startling conclusion: “Americans,” he wrote in a short book entitled Credit Card Use in the United States, “are far more likely to use credit cards than to approve of them.” “Few Americans tend to think of credit cards as a good thing whether they use them or not,” Mandell noted. “Some 75 percent of all respondents said that credit cards made it too easy to buy things that they may not really want or can’t really afford. On the other hand,” he added, noting the incongruity that still exists, “when asked about the advantages of credit cards, the most frequent response related to the credit feature—the fact that a family could buy without having the money and pay the bank back over time.” Mandell found that 81 percent of families with an income of at least ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1898))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- $25,000 used credit cards while fewer than 20 percent of families making less than $3,000 relied on credit cards. This made obvious sense, of course—as Mandell put it, “[I]t is reasonable to assume that persons with higher incomes, who purchase more goods, will be more apt to use a mechanism such as the credit card which facilitates these transactions.” (They were also more apt to be able to get their hands on credit cards than low-income families.) Another of Mandell’s findings was that the younger the family, the better the chance that it relied on credit cards. This, too, made sense, partly because of the stiff resistance to credit cards among older people, but also because credit cards have always felt less threatening to younger people, whose careers are just beginning, and who can feel optimistic about their prospects for promotions and raises. It was logical that young married couples, with small children, were the most likely to carry large revolving balances, and that people in the western half of the country were more likely to carry credit cards than people in the East (since bank credit cards had begun as a West Coast phenomenon). Logic explained only so much, however. Because the subject of money is so fraught with emotion, there would always be patterns of behavior that were inexplicable except to the person exhibiting the behavior. How to explain, for instance, that people who used credit cards tended to write more checks per month than those who didn’t? This finding directly contradicted the theory, widely held in banking circles, that credit cards would help eliminate checks. When asked to name the advantages of credit cards, almost no one mentioned one of their biggest advantages—the initial “float” that gave users a month-long, interest-free loan before the bill came due. When asked to name the disadvantages of credit cards, barely 10 percent of those surveyed mentioned the biggest disadvantage: the 18 percent-a-year interest rate, which was much higher than the interest on other kinds of loans. In fact, Mandell noted, “There is some recent evidence that a large proportion of credit card users don’t know the interest that they must pay on their account.”7 The economist was particularly perplexed by the percentage of wealthier families who carried a credit card balance. It was only 15 percent, but that seemed awfully high to Mandell,… ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1909))

Yes, when the occasion called for it, he could trot out the statistics that proved that the middle class could handle debt.8 He could defend the 18 percent interest rate with the best of them. But on the question of whether debt was good or bad, healthy or unhealthy, an engine of American prosperity or the surest route to hell—that was a debate that never engaged him. When it came to the one thing cards were most often used for—the creation of an instant, unsecured personal loan—he would say only what was expected of him, and nothing more. Did he prefer not to talk about debt because it diminished, in his mind at least, the true potential of the bank card? Probably. Was he averting his gaze from something he preferred not to dwell on? Quite possibly. Did he think that his central idea—namely that a plastic card should be seen as a “medium of exchange” interchangeable with cash—was so compelling that the issue of debt scarcely deserved to be uttered in the same breath?… ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=1938))

- Most of all, none of these men—or any of the hundreds of employees who followed them—had ever come up against a boss like Dee Hock before. It was not so much that he was a benevolent tyrant; it was that he seemed to have a small handful of personalities residing within him, one of which was the benevolent Hock, another the tyrannical Hock. In one moment, he was asking you about your health and insisting you take some time off, sending flowers to your wife because you’d been away from home for so long, fighting with the board to get you a bonus he felt you deserved. In the next moment, he could turn on you, transforming himself into a different creature, dark and unlikable. He would “devastate” people, recalls one former NBI hand; “he could be fairly savage to people,” says another. He employed a style of management that would later be called “creative tension,” pitting one executive against another. Occasionally, he held “blue sky sessions” with his staff, meaning that any idea was open to discussion. But as soon as someone brought up an idea Hock disagreed with, he would cut him down mercilessly. “It seemed that the only way he could build himself up was by tearing the people around him down,” recalls an ex-employee. Those were two of Hock’s personalities. Here was a third: It would be late in the afternoon, and Hock would wave you into his office. He was in a mood to talk. He would talk about his frustrations with the board and about his dreams for his beloved payment system, about his childhood in hard-scrabble Utah and his love of the Great Books. Two or three hours later, you went home feeling that you knew this boss better than you’d ever known a boss in your life, and feeling closer to this boss as well. Yet that warm feeling passed quickly, because you also knew the lengths to which Hock went to keep you at a distance. It was extraordinarily rare for an NBI employee to so much as step inside Hock’s house, for instance. The distance between his personal life and his work life was both absolute and unbridgeable. A fourth personality: Hock was the micromanager from hell—so obsessive about details that for the first year he insisted that no letter could leave NBI headquarters without his personal approval.

He had an obsession with neatness; employees who left papers on their desks were sure to find a cranky note from Hock the next morning. Even after he had stopped reading the outgoing correspondence and was delegating responsibility, “he continued”—in the flowery words of the Harvard professor who wrote the Visa case study—“to probe the thoughts of his key managers with a meticulous precision that bordered on inquisition.” He had other idiosyncrasies as a manager, not the least of which was that he didn’t view himself as a manager, but rather as a leader—an important distinction in his mind. “Most great leaders,” he declared to the man from Harvard, “don’t follow strict rules . . . . Management,” he continued, “is an art . . . . ” Hock, of course, saw himself as an artist of the first rank, but from his staff’s point of view, he used some awfully strange brush strokes. He wouldn’t allow employees to put nameplates on their office doors. He insisted that the corporate directory be alphabetized by first names, even after the staff had grown to several hundred. And every six months or so, he would reorganize the executive ranks.

His most dramatic technique, which he resorted to more often than he should have, was to threaten to resign; such threats often came during negotiations over Hock’s salary.

He made it possible for people to believe what he himself believed: that in creating this new payment system, they were doing something that mattered a great deal. “He saw himself as a revolutionary,” recalls one longtime Visa employee, “and he made you think of yourself that way too.” A job interview with Hock consisted of listening to him talk, as he spun out his vision of a plastic future, in which a small card would unlock the financial universe. He could be mesmerizing at such moments, especially to someone who had never thought about payment systems or the nature of money as an “exchange device.” It was hard not to be hooked. “In the early years,” says a longtime Visa hand named Robert Miller, “I would have done anything for him.” NBI offered no benefits in the beginning. The pay was miserable. The hours were long. It didn’t matter. What mattered was that Dee Hock—with your help!—was changing the world.

- Here, then, was another paradox: computers weren’t important only because they managed highly complex tasks; they were important because they disguised highly complex tasks. By making a complicated process invisible, computers allowed people to forget about the complexity, and focus instead on what was visible: namely, how easy the thing was to use. “For a great financial device to catch on,” says banking consultant Edward Furash, “it must appear simple.” That was true of money market funds; it was true of mutual funds; it was true of automatic teller machines; and it was especially true of credit cards. Hock is the one who stitched together the disguise. Even the bankers who dislike him give him his due for erecting the system—“the switch,” as they call it in the trade—that exists today.

- He did it by building a huge computer network, anchored by two monster mainframes that took up the better part of a new low-rise office building in nearby San Mateo, California. Once they were up and running, the mainframes would act as the pulsing heart of Hock’s payment system. Just as the heart circulates blood through the body, so did NBI’s computers keep the flow of information moving, sucking in authorization requests from merchants and pushing out answers, absorbing the day’s transactions from around the world—more than 200 million transactions in 1974, nearly 6 billion by 1992—and automatically settling up with every bank in the system, so that each banker that issued a BankAmericard knew when he got to work in the morning how much his bank had paid out the day before and how much it had taken in. The idea of setting up a national computer network was not original to Hock. Even before NBI was formed, many bankers had concluded that such a system was necessary. Most immediately, computers were needed to handle the authorization process. Computers, as everyone in the business realized, would cut down drastically on the time it took for a merchant to obtain an authorization; they would make authorizations more accurate; they would eliminate the time-zone problem, in which a person from Boston couldn’t charge something late in the day in Los Angeles because his bank back at home was closed. And on and on. In fact, the first organization to propose a central authorization system wasn’t a bank at all; it was American Express. The company had in mind a giant system that would handle not only BankAmericard but Master Charge cards and American Express cards. Although many bankers were ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2033))

- amenable to this idea, Hock was not among them. Because American Express issued its own plastic card—its own “medium of exchange” as he tended to think of it—Hock believed that the company was the implacable enemy of the nation’s banks, and he was determined to treat it as such. At one of his first board meetings, Hock stopped the American Express effort cold. We have to control our own destiny, he argued to the board; we can’t be at the mercy of a potential competitor like American Express. Therefore, he said, NBI would build its own system, for the exclusive use of its members. A few days later, a small notice appeared in The American Banker, the daily newspaper of the banking industry, announcing that NBI was abandoning the talks with American Express and would build its own authorization system. To the general disbelief of the industry, Hock set out to build his system. He called it BankAmericard Service Exchange: BASE I. The only thing their disbelief really showed was how paralyzed the banking industry had become. As it turns out, the hardware Hock employed to create his system was strictly off the shelf. Special software had to be written, but IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation were already building machines with more than enough power to handle the needs of a nationwide credit card system. And businesses like the airlines had already shown that you could create a network linking computers across the country via telephone lines. By May of 1972, Hock had hired a computer staff to his liking—he’d fired his first computer staff after it drew up plans for a $10 million state-of-the-art system—and he had a design he could live with: by using existing technology, the new team had cut the price to $3 million. Hock took that figure to the board, which approved the expense. He also promised the board that their long-awaited authorization system would be up and running by April 1, 1973—an impossible deadline, of course. It was also a dangerous deadline, for Hock had never tried to build something for the system before. As an outsider in the tight little world of consumer banking, he didn’t have a lifetime… ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2045))

Did they meet the deadline? Of course they did. In July, Tootelian was hired to oversee the project. Four months later, NBI took delivery of several Digital mainframe computers, though they could not be installed because the San Mateo building had not been completed. It was a mess that fall; heavy rain turned the San Mateo construction site into a pool of mud. A feeling of gloom descended upon the NBI computer staff. But then, in January, they held a big meeting with the seventy-six largest member banks,9 and it was there that they could see that they were closing in on their goal. The members were no longer squabbling with each other; progress was visible. By February, small-scale testing had begun.

- by May 1, 1973, the system was running twenty-four hours a day. The project had taken nine months, start to finish. It had cost $3 million, just as Hock had promised. Within a year, it had saved its members at least $30 million. And it finally smoked out Interbank. After Hock introduced BASE I at a press conference in San Francisco, Interbank hastily announced that it was also working on a proprietary authorization system for Master Charge. That system would be up and running, Interbank promised, by May . . . 1974. You could almost hear the chortles at NBI. That first system was not completely computerized—not the way authorization is today, when a credit card purchase can be approved without the intervention of a single human being. Still, it was a huge step forward. When a merchant called to get a purchase approved, the call was automatically “switched” by the NBI system to the right bank: no more fumbling for the correct phone number.

On the day BASE I went into effect, the average time it took to approve an authorization request dropped from over five minutes to around fifty-six seconds. By today’s standards—with the average approval time now down to around seven seconds—this still seems like a long time. But for someone standing at a checkout counter in 1973, the difference between five minutes and fifty-six seconds was enormous.

- of competition. Schwab desperately wanted to be one of those forces. It was a speck of a firm then, located not on Wall Street but in the outback of San Francisco, and founded expressly in anticipation of Mayday. Its founder and namesake, a short, shy, thirty-eight-year-old man whose previous financial venture had ended in ignominious failure, believed that an event as seismic as Mayday might create for him, at long last, a place in the financial firmament. His idea—and as usual in the money revolution, he was not the only one who had it—was that the deregulation of commissions would give rise to a new kind of brokerage firm: a firm that competed solely on the basis of price. His firm would not offer advice the way a traditional brokerage house did; it would not compile reams of research reports; it would not be staffed with energetic brokers who made handsome livings persuading customers to trade stocks. It would simply execute stock trades efficiently, for rock-bottom commissions. Even before Mayday arrived, a dozen different firms had popped up hoping to do the same thing Schwab wanted to do.1 They were called discount brokerages.

- The way the discounters went about their business violated too many of the ancient truisms of the brokerage business. “Stocks are sold, not bought” went one such axiom—meaning that most Americans still did not come easily to a decision to buy or sell a stock or bond. They had to be cajoled, prodded, convinced. Brokers activated this process by picking up the phone, planting an idea, slowly reeling in the customer. Ross Kenzie, the longtime manager of Merrill Lynch’s Cleveland office, was legendary within the firm for the way he supposedly trained new brokers: in order to impress upon them the importance of making phone calls, he used to tape one of their hands to the phone during their first week on the job.12 At Schwab, however, it was the customer who had to pick up the phone. Employees were supposed to sit at their desks and wait for people to call; then, when people did call, they were under explicit instruction not to offer advice or suggestions. Their job was to write down the caller’s order, and pass it along the Schwab pipeline, where other employees made the trade and billed the caller. At that point, of course, the caller became a customer, with an “account” at Schwab. Yet even then, no one at Schwab solicited additional business, something a wirehouse would have ([Location 2384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2384))

- done as a matter of course. Discounters were operating on a different theory, which grew out of another truism of the brokerage business: “Ten percent of the customers provide 90 percent of the revenues.” It was this 10 percent, the most active investors, that discounters hoped to attract—investors who knew their own minds, and were tired of the incessant phone calls from their brokers. In one of his first ads, Schwab’s slogan was: “Call us because no sales person will ever call you.” Although Schwab would always trumpet this difference between his firm and the wirehouses, he was to some degree making a virtue out of necessity. The path he chose was every bit as preordained as Regan’s post-Mayday path. The same arithmetic that applied to Regan applied to him: it was simply impossible to employ full-service brokers earning commissions while offering cut-rate commissions to customers. Thus he hired glorified telephone operators and paid them around $10,000 a year, because that’s what he could afford.13 An even more onerous straitjacket was an SEC regulation called the know-your-customer rule. It said that a broker couldn’t give a customer advice until he understood something of the customer’s circumstances. Once a broker knew (for example) that his client was an elderly man dependent on dividend income, he was expected—nay, he was bound— ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2394))

- to suggest an appropriately conservative portfolio. Paradoxically, the only legal way the discounters could get around the know-your-customer rule was by knowing nothing about their customers’ financial circumstances. You couldn’t be accused of giving out inappropriate advice if you gave out no advice at all. Schwab’s no-advice policy, besides being cost-effective, kept him on the right side of the law. The creation of the discount business was, in hindsight, another of those moments that one could find from time to time in this early phase of the money revolution—a moment when you could see a subtle shift taking place between buyer and seller. Unlike the big firms, the discounters were placing the onus on the buyer to make his own decisions, and to take… ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2404))

For Kahr, this turned out to be a far more miserable experience than Harvard had been, and when he quit that job two years later, he promised himself that he’d never work for anyone else again.

They could only legitimately describe what they had done in the past, and why: why they had four life insurance policies instead of one; what had caused them to open a new bank account; how frequently they paid down their credit card debt.

[and] in both income groups, females are more risk averse than are males with similar incomes.” The implications of this finding could be seen in a dozen different ways. How else to explain why relatively few people had moved their savings to money market funds? Such funds may have been a much better deal than a bank account, but they lacked deposit insurance, which meant they were necessarily riskier. How else to explain that only around 10 percent of the households surveyed had ever used an automatic teller machine? Because ATMs were still so new they too were seen as risky.

In reality, a mere of 1 percent of households could be considered active traders. Worse, the wirehouses didn’t even have these customers to themselves. Many of them had relationships with up to twenty other financial institutions, including other brokerage firms. The SRI study was filled with illuminating nuggets like that. Its authors saw the coming popularity of home equity loans. They showed that most people did not view their credit card balance as a loan. They documented the fact that even with the growth of bank cards, the most widely dispersed credit card in America was the Sears charge card, which was held by half the families in the country. (Sears executives, of course, had long known this fact, and were not at all happy about having to share it with the rest of the world.)

- Several events coincided to made the Citibank drop possible, converging so neatly that they must have seemed to Reed like a gift from the gods. The first, which took place in June 1976, was Dee Hock’s reluctant decision to abandon his long-held position on an issue called duality. “Duality” refers to the now-common practice of allowing a bank to issue both Visa and MasterCard. In the mid-1970s, however, this practice was very much against the rules, thanks mainly to Hock, who violently opposed duality. Banks could be part of one system or the other, but they couldn’t be part of both. Hock’s rationale was that it was as important for Interbank and NBI to compete with ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2895))

- each other as it was for the banks to compete among themselves, and that duality would destroy the competition between the two organizations. The minute banks could join both organizations, he believed (correctly, as events would prove), the two systems would be seen as interchangeable. ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2900))

- The second event was Hock’s announcement a few months later that he was renaming both the organization he ran and the card it supported “Visa.” Hock could toss off a raft of good reasons for doing this but the main reason was that the word “BankAmericard” just didn’t roll trippingly off the tongue, especially the tongues of people in Japan and Argentina and Germany, and all the other countries where Hock was trying to establish beach heads for his payment system. He loved the fact that the word “visa” was pronounced the same way in every language. He saw the name change as another small step in his never-ending drive to create a new international currency—a currency that he hoped would now be called Visa. Hock unveiled the name change at a banking convention in Orlando in the fall of 1976. The name change would take place the following year, he said, and added that Visa would spend around $50 million on “brand” advertising to acclimate people to the change. Most of the bankers in the room that day viewed the announcement as typical Hock—much ado about very little11—but the two Citibank representatives attending the conference felt otherwise. Their names were David Phillips, a direct marketing expert who was one of Reed’s top aides, and Richard Kane, who ran the consumer group’s credit card division. “A sum like that wasn’t quite what they spend on a Colgate campaign, but in the banking business in 1977 it was an incredible number,” Kane recalls. “We sat around afterward reflecting on how the American ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2910))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There was one other piece of information, culled from Reed’s extensive research, that made the opportunity irresistible. “We understood that the consumer didn’t have the slightest idea which bank he had his card with,” recalls Phillips. “We had tested that.” This was also in no small part Dee Hock’s doing; because of his unyielding insistence that the word “BankAmericard” be the prominent name on the card, the individual banks were forced to put their own names on the back of the card, practically in fine print.12 Over time, people tended to forget that they got the card not from some central BankAmericard behemoth, but from a local bank. Now Citibank planned to take advantage of that forgetfulness. It would use the name change from BankAmericard to Visa as its cover.

- A bank couldn’t just drop credit cards in America anymore; that was against the law. It had to send direct mail solicitations, asking people if they wanted its card, and wait for a positive response. The Citibank solicitations, which were mailed in the late summer and early fall of 1977, read in part: A person with your excellent credit standing deserves the best there is. So, we have set aside a new Visa card especially for you. To get your Visa card, all you have to do is return the Reserved Invitation below . . . . Visa is replacing BankAmericard and is now the most widely accepted personal credit card in the world . . . . Best of all . . . THERE’S NO CHARGE TO OBTAIN YOUR VISA CARD. You will notice that the word “Citibank” never appears in the above paragraph. Later, as news stories began to be written about Citibank’s massive credit card blitzkrieg, its executives would strongly deny that there was anything deceptive about what they had done. But that was public relations double-talk. Citibank was counting on the fact that people wouldn’t realize they already stood to receive a Visa card—it would come automatically from whichever bank had issued their BankAmericard. Clearly, the mailing was supposed to make people think that only by sending in their application to Citibank could they get this wonderful new card they were hearing so ([Location 2942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=2942))

When you added its Master Charge portfolio to its new Visa portfolio, Citibank had become, in one stroke, the largest issuer of bank cards in the world. This is a position it has never relinquished.

- DONALD REGAN once said in a speech that his favorite Merrill Lynch branch was one located near Tampa, Florida. What he liked about it, he went on to explain, was that it was shaped like a box—more specifically, a box with four entrances, one in each direction. And it was the four doors that captured his imagination, because they seemed a kind of physical embodiment for his scheme to transform Merrill Lynch as the money revolution approached. As he envisioned it, one door would be the entrance to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, member of the New York Stock Exchange, brokerage to the middle class, wirehouse extraordinaire. A second door would lead to Merrill Lynch Realty, a business Regan thought would go hand in hand with the brokerage industry.1 The third door would open into Merrill Lynch’s Insurance—another business that Regan was sure would mesh well with selling stocks and bonds.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And as for the fourth door, Regan’s most fervent hope was that it would someday be the entrance to the Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust. Walter Wriston had it right: Don Regan wanted to be in banking. More precisely, he wanted to be in the business of attracting the consumer deposits that had always flowed to banks as a matter of course. Later they would come up with a phrase for what Regan wanted to do; it was called “gathering assets,” and it would soon be the key to everything.

- Regan was never especially generous in parceling out credit for things that happened on his watch; with Braun, he was positively niggardly. “I played the catalyst!” he later boasted. Well, maybe. At the least, Braun and Regan were thinking along the same lines. The stock market, Braun (and Regan?) believed, was a fickle mistress—when it was up, business boomed; when it was down, business vanished. Merrill Lynch did more than 10 percent of the stock trades conducted on the New York Stock Exchange, but the volume of those trades could careen wildly from year to year, and even from month to month. This was an impossible situation for a soon-to-be-public company with enormous fixed costs: it needed earnings that didn’t rise and fall with each blip of the Dow Jones average. “If we didn’t diversify,” Regan would later say (echoing Braun?), “we would never control our own destiny.” As for the second instrumental person, that was Andrew Kahr.

- They met maybe twice, Regan and Kahr, in circumstances so unremarkable that years later, Regan would draw a blank when asked about Kahr. Yet their effect on each other was profound. Regan gave Kahr the thing he most needed as he began to make his way as a consultant: credibility. Once Kahr left his mark on Merrill Lynch, there could be no doubting the power of his ideas. And Kahr gave Regan something he needed just as badly. He handed Regan a product that ripped away the old financial barriers like nothing that had come before. Kahr’s product was called a cash management account, and it was the one that woke everyone up—especially bankers, who understood at last the threat they faced. What was it about a cash management account that made it such a threat to the existing order? The short answer was that it took disparate elements—each of which had previously been connected to one particular segment of the financial world—and gathered them together in one account. So: a CMA was anchored by a stock and bond portfolio, which firms like Merrill Lynch traditionally offered. But it also had a money market fund attached to it—a product that had been the province primarily of mutual fund companies like Fidelity and Dreyfus. In addition to paying “market” interest on any cash a customer put into his CMA, the money fund also regularly swept in dividends and other payouts, allowing that ([Location 3127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3127))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- money to begin earning interest for the customer. The money fund, of course, had check-writing privileges—formerly the sole province of banks. And to top it off, a CMA came with a Merrill Lynch plastic card, thus cutting into the banking business in yet another way. The card alone was a remarkable creature. It could serve as a debit card or a credit card depending on the circumstances: If the customer had enough cash in his money market account, funds would be immediately “debited” to cover the charge. If he didn’t, the charge would trigger a margin account—in effect, allowing the customer to borrow the money retroactively against the value of his stock portfolio. This was not a small point: just as home equity loans would later “liquefy” the rising value of a… ([Location 3136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3136))

- What everyone involved does agree on is that the cash management account grew out of that daylong meeting at SRI. Having just been put in charge of Merrill Lynch’s new holding company—a job that meant he was supposed to lead the diversification effort—Chrystie found on his new desk a stack of proposals from SRI. “They wanted to write books about financial services that we would underwrite,” he says derisively. He called Carl Spetzler intending to turn the proposals down, but Spetzler persuaded him to spend a day at SRI first, where he could sit in an office and listen as the SRI consultants pitched him their best diversification ideas. Grudgingly, he agreed. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3152))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Kahr had conceived of something along the lines of a cash management account even before he signed on with SRI; he had tried to get Wells Fargo interested in it in an earlier consulting stint. During Chrystie’s visit, caught up in the spirit of the moment, he basically handed the idea over to Merrill Lynch. SRI wound up with a $100,000 contract to develop the CMA in concert with Merrill Lynch, over the next six months. With the SRI financial group not even a year old, it seemed a healthy sum to Spetzler. In retrospect—with Merrill Lynch’s CMA now holding more than $250 billion in assets, and all the competing CMAs holding tens of billions more—he gave the thing away. From the point of view of a wirehouse, circa 1975, the CMA had a serious drawback: by making it possible for customers to earn interest on their cash, through the money market feature, a brokerage firm would be depriving itself of the easy profits that resulted from investing its customers’ free credit balances for its own account. Chrystie, of course, immediately understood this, and according to one published account,8 he and Kahr began arguing about the importance of the free credit balance: By paying customers interest on their money [in a CMA], Chrystie contended, the firm would be throwing away its “ace in the hole.” Kahr had a different view of things. “It’s not your ace in the hole,” he declared coolly. “It’s your Achilles’ heel.” At a time of ravaging inflation and high interest rates, he argued, people were less likely to sit back while a financial intermediary earned interest on their money. Before he left that day, Chrystie recognized that Kahr was right. For someone steeped in the traditions of a wirehouse, it was a significant break-through.

- Years later, after the CMA had become an acknowledged success, they would all concede that that meeting was the key moment. Regan himself would happily recount the story over the years—as it became Exhibit A in the case he would build for himself as the “godfather” of the CMA. That was when the sandbagging jackasses had to stop their sniveling and get on board. And it was a lucky thing they did. The loss of the free credit balance turned out to be a nonevent,11 more than made up for by the annual fee attached to the CMA. Chrystie had estimated that the CMA might attract 100,000 customers; by the time the bull market was in full swing in the mid-1980s, it had well over a million customers, making up 20 percent of the Merrill Lynch customer base. Many of those customers were new ones, who moved their brokerage business to Merrill Lynch specifically to open a CMA.

- The cash management account also turned out to be an illumination for Merrill Lynch, for as a gatherer of assets, it was an astonishing thing. The total assets in a CMA—the combined value of the stocks, bonds, and cash—were much larger than Merrill Lynch had expected—as much as ten times larger. Chrystie had based his early predictions about the size of individual accounts on the size of traditional Merrill Lynch accounts. But the CMA was a far stronger magnet than a traditional brokerage account. People really liked the idea of being able to use one account to do a half-dozen different things; it did make life simpler. As a result, the CMA attracted billions of dollars of assets that Merrill Lynch had never seen before—stock certificates residing at other firms, cash from bank CDs, money salted away in money market funds. “For the first time,” says one executive, “we got a true picture of our customers’ assets.” It was an eye-opener. It reinforced the firm’s realization that its piece of the financial pie was a mere sliver in the large scheme of things. Even the densest executives had to see that the CMA offered the best chance of grabbing a larger piece.12 Yet one also winds up feeling that those years of internal resistance took a toll.13 Although the CMA became, in time, a significant weapon in Merrill Lynch’s arsenal, it was never as powerful as it might have been.

- And so it went. Early in 1978, as Merrill Lynch prepared to introduce the CMA in Oregon, Stein flew to Eugene to meet the state banking commissioner, a man named John Olin. “This is to let you know,” Olin began, “that if you offer it here, we’ll have to take you to court.” Olin was a colorful character, and when reporters asked him about Merrill Lynch’s new financial ([Location 3270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3270))

Therefore, he concluded, “it should be regulated by whoever is charged with regulating the ducks.” ([Location 3273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3273))

- And yet, even as interest rates and inflation were setting postwar records, bank savings accounts were still paying only 51/4 percent interest, thanks to Regulation Q. The disparity had become intolerable. If you had money in the bank, as most middle-class Americans did, you could no longer afford to ignore the growing differential. It was costing you too much. For the first time, you had to begin exploring alternatives that had always been a little beyond your frame of reference, like money market funds and cash management accounts. Suddenly, you had to start thinking about where best to put your money, and what to do with it, and how to keep pace with this new threat to your savings. You had to start thinking this way because you were suddenly living in the Age of Inflation. ([Location 3287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3287))

- Kahn aside—and on a matter of this magnitude, his opinion carried zero weight—Carter’s advisers were unanimously opposed to Volcker’s scheme. They were appalled, actually. What appalled them was not so much Volcker’s desire for tighter money, which everyone in the White House knew was coming; rather, it was the way Volcker was planning to regulate the money supply that horrified them. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve regulated money indirectly, by fiddling with interest rates, moving them up or down a quarter of a percent at a time. Volcker was convinced that this approach was too incremental to curb an inflation so powerful that it was causing people to feel, in his words, “that things were out of control.” Feeling the need to do something more drastic, he decided that the Federal Reserve should control the growth of money directly, by regulating the amount of money ([Location 3608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3608))

- the nation’s banks had to hold in reserve. “In effect,” he later wrote, “our emphasis would shift from controlling the price of money to its quantity.” One strong possibility was that interest rates, no longer controlled by the Federal Reserve, would skyrocket. But no one could say for sure, since the radical solution Volcker was proposing was untested in postwar America. In a universe still dominated by Keynesian economics, Volcker was about to put into practice a theory that had been devised by—and was being actively promoted by—a group of conservative economists known as “monetarists.” Led by Milton Friedman, the monetarists were challenging some of the most basic tenets of Keynesian theory. Although Volcker would later take pains to disassociate himself from “the extreme claims” of the monetarists—a veiled dig at Friedman—he had come around to their view that taking control of the money supply directly was the only way to slow down virulent inflation. He also thought it might help change the inflationary psychology. “People don’t need an advanced degree in economics to understand that inflation has something to do with too much money,” Volcker wrote. “[I]f we could get out the message that when we say we’re going to control money, we mean we’re going to deal with inflation, then we would have ([Location 3615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3615))

- a chance of affecting ordinary people’s behavior.” As the days passed, Volcker received a series of ever-more pressing phone calls from Schultze and other White House officials, urging him to reconsider. But there was never such a call from Carter himself, which Volcker took to mean that the President would not oppose him. His instincts were right. When, in early October 1979, he finally called the White House to tell Schultze that he and his board of governors had formally agreed to move in this new direction, Schultze quickly acquiesced. “I told Volcker the President wouldn’t attack him,” says Schultze, and except for a single lapse in the heat of the election campaign, Carter never did, not even as Volcker’s tight money policy sank what slim political hopes he had left. “What the hell,” shrugs Schultze now. “We didn’t have a better mousetrap.” Although Volcker did turn out to have the better mousetrap in the end, this would not become apparent for quite some time—far too late, certainly, for Jimmy Carter.… ([Location 3624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3624))

Ted Kennedy, out on the stump, began calling for mandatory wage and price controls as the only way to bring inflation down. Kahn, in a speech to the National Press Club around this time, said bluntly (of course!) that if Carter lost the upcoming election, it would be “overwhelmingly” due to his failure to bring down inflation. Then, in January, the Labor Department confirmed that the Consumer Price Index rose 13.3 percent in 1979, and two days after that, Carter released his annual economic report to Congress, which has to rank as one of the most pessimistic documents ever released by an American President, gloomier even than Carter’s malaise speech. In the report, the administration said that it anticipated that the Gross National Product would drop by 1 percent in 1980, while unemployment would rise to 7.5 percent. In other words, the President of the United States was predicting that the country would be thrown into a recession—and in an… ([Location 3634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3634))

- program would help restrain borrowing now. When Carter finally decided to include credit controls in his last inflation package, against the advice of people like Schultze and Treasury Secretary Miller, one gets the strong sense that he was thinking that since nothing they had suggested was working, why not give this thing a shot? What harm could it do? Under the law, only the Federal Reserve could impose credit controls, and Volcker was distinctly unenthused about the notion. The Fed chairman went along largely because he felt he owed it to the President, who a few months before had backed Volcker’s monetary shift. Even after agreeing to controls, however, he and his staff had tried to water them down, exempting, writes Greider, “automobiles, furniture and appliances, home-improvement loans and mortgages.” “When the President and the Federal Reserve chairman announced their initiatives,” added Greider, “[Fed officials] joked among themselves about the many loopholes written into the controls.

- were confident that lenders and borrowers would find them.” What happened next was amazing. People not only didn’t find the loopholes, they refused to look for them. The entire country simply stopped borrowing. “No one had ever seen anything like it,” recalls Volcker. Kahn made speeches suggesting that people cut up their credit cards, and thousands did so—sending their sliced-up cards to the White House in a show of support for the President’s program. It was quickly apparent, however, that cutting up their credit cards was the worst thing they could have done, both for Carter and themselves. For months, consumer borrowing was the only thing that had kept the recession at bay; when the borrowing stopped, the economy collapsed—“within a matter of days,” writes Volcker. Embroiled in a nasty fight for the nomination, grappling by then with the hostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, his popularity at an all-time low—this was the moment that Jimmy Carter finally got “his” recession.15 As quickly as he “decently” could, Volcker undid the credit controls. By July, they were gone. He also loosened the money supply temporarily to revive the economy. Meanwhile, the balanced budget was quickly jettisoned, as Congress added ([Location 3690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3690))

- billions in additional spending to revive the economy. Interest rates plummeted, the recession ended almost as quickly as it had begun, and even the CPI slowed down for a few months, though not enough to prevent a second consecutive year of double-digit inflation. But it was too late for Jimmy Carter. Everything he had tried had failed, and he had nothing left. He was done trying to fight inflation. Inside the White House, the anti-inflation machinery was still in place, its gears whirring louder than ever, but that’s all it was now: noise and motion. Right up until election day, nothing changed. Once, when the CPI dropped, Jody Powell pathetically suggested that Carter make a self-deprecating remark about it to reporters, just to draw attention to this rare bit of good news. And to the bitter end, Carter could never make the “hard choices” that were needed to put even the tiniest dent in inflation. Not long before the election, Kahn tried to get Carter to take a large Army contract away from Kerr-McGee, the Oklahoma oil company, which COWPS had found in violation of the price guidelines. But then the Army weighed in, claiming that the Kerr-McGee contract was important to the national security, and that was that.

- And all the while, Carter’s opponent in the general election, Ronald Reagan, was using inflation as a club with which to bludgeon the President. The first page of the first campaign memo Reagan received, back in 1979, had said, “By a wide margin, the most important issue in the minds of voters today is inflation.” He never forgot it. “When [Carter] took office,” Reagan used to say in his stump speech, “inflation was 4.8 percent and he said he was going to do something about it. And he did. It’s now averaging 16.4 percent.” A week before the election, the two men held their one and only debate. Reagan was well ahead in the polls, but toward the end of that debate, he administered the coup de grace when he looked into the camera and asked: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Thanks to inflation, we were not better off, and we knew it. At that moment, Jimmy Carter’s last, flickering hopes of winning reelection were gone for good. ([Location 3709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3709))

And how did people react to these cataclysmic changes? They adapted. Economists used to marvel at the dramatic, quantifiable changes in the behavior of the middle class. “It turns out that people can scramble and keep up longer than you think they can,” Barry Bosworth once remarked. That’s part of the reason why stamping out inflation was so hard: people spent as much time adapting to it as they did complaining about it. Americans who lived on fixed incomes devised strategies to keep their income rising with the inflation rate. People who could feel their standard of living slipping away tried to figure out ways to pull it back up.

- “Paying off the mortgage on the family home,” The New York Times lamented in the spring of 1979, “was once as ingrained in the national psyche as buying the home.” The Times went on to describe these payments as a “sacred American value” that was being abandoned. But there was never anything sacred about paying off a mortgage; it was simply a sensible way to act given the economic conditions of the time. In an era of inflation and high interest rates, such behavior no longer made sense. What made sense instead was not paying off the mortgage, refinancing whenever rates dropped or selling one house for a new one, which kicked in a new adjustable rate mortgage. No longer was a house “merely” a roof over one’s head, either. Gradually, it grew into something quite a bit more: for most families, it was their largest and most important financial asset. It was also the one asset whose value only seemed to go in one direction: up. This is the phenomenon Theodore White had been referring to when he described a house as “your main stake in the great gamble  . . . the only safe investment.” As people latched onto this fact, a mad scramble ensued, and Americans used every penny they could spare to buy the most expensive house they could afford. Between 1975 and 1978, home mortgages in America rose from $479 billion to $737 billion. That houses went up in price was a direct by-product of inflation; hard assets always rise in inflationary times. That people began thinking about their homes in this fundamentally new way was a direct by-product of the fact that they were rising in ([Location 3741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3741))

- value. People no longer bought a house so much as they “invested” in one; the down payment was their “equity stake.” And after four or five years, by which time their investment had doubled in value, they might well be moved to treat it like any other investment—by engaging in some profit taking and plunging the capital gains into a more expensive investment—i.e., another house. Of course, everyone else’s house was also doubling in value, but never mind. It happened all the time. Sometimes, in fact, it could border on the ridiculous. There were middleclass Americans—not a lot, but enough so that you noticed—who became so caught up in making money on their homes that they would purchase a new one every six months or so. After living in it long enough to escape the short-term capital gains tax, they would then “flip” it to the next buyer and start all over again. So long as real estate prices went only upward, this was a no-lose strategy—unless, of course, you wanted to live someplace for longer than six months.

- OF THE MANY WAYS AMERICANS ADAPTED TO INFLATION, two changes stood above the rest. The first was a pronounced shift in the attitude of the middle class, particularly those young enough to have missed the Depression, toward credit and credit cards. The second was a shift away from regulated bank passbook accounts and toward “savings” vehicles that offered market rates of returns. In the first instance, Americans began borrowing as they’d never borrowed before—borrowing that was facilitated by the near universal acceptance of credit cards, a condition that had arrived by the late 1970s. In the second instance, Americans in large numbers finally realized, to their dismay, that they were being killed by Regulation Q, which held bank interest rates down even as “market” interest rates were rising rapidly. This was when the imperatives of inflation overtook the power of inertia, as the middle class began moving its savings out of bank passbook accounts and into money market funds. It was also the moment when it was clear beyond all doubt that the money revolution had arrived. ([Location 3772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3772))

By 1973, when Hock installed NBI’s computerized authorization system, credit card spending was growing at a rate of about $3.5 billion a year and had reached $13.8 billion. Then it really began taking off: $22 billion in accumulated bank card spending in 1976; $31.7 billion the following year; $44.5 billion the year after that.

- Around 60 million people held either a Master Charge or a Visa card by 1978; according to one estimate,2 only 11.5 million people in the entire country who could qualify for a bank card chose not to have one. Most Americans had at least two credit cards,3 while around 20 million people had three or more. And they were using them to buy more expensive things: the typical credit card purchase had risen from less than $20 to around $60 in the 1970s. “If this current rate of growth continues,” wrote Spencer Nilson, the credit card newsletter publisher, “the major banking interests will be in a position to dominate the credit card industry—and through it, influence  . . . the credit spending habits and lifestyle of all consumers.” Nilson was only half right. Banks were indeed poised to dominate the credit card business, finally overwhelming the long-standing resistance of most major retail chains, while rendering competing cards such as Carte Blanche and oil company cards practically obsolete. Ultimately, only American Express had the wherewithal to withstand the onslaught of bank credit cards.4 But Nilson was wrong to predict that credit cards would be responsible for changing the “credit spending habits” of Americans. He had it backward: it was the credit spending habits of Americans that was responsible for increased credit card use. Credit cards were undoubtedly making it easier for Americans to borrow with newfound abandon. But credit cards were not the only reason this was happening or even the main reason.… ([Location 3786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3786))

- rapidly: it was closing in on $315 billion. This was the real eye-popping figure, and the one that held the most significance. A 90 percent jump in total consumer borrowing in only three years represented the kind of frenetic borrowing that hadn’t been seen in America since the early 1950s. In the 1950s, however, interest rates had been low, consumer desires were ready to explode, and the burgeoning middle class had been full of optimism about the future. The conditions for borrowing were ideal. In the mid- and late 1970s, by contrast, interest rates were at historic highs, and Americans were decidedly pessimistic about the future. And yet the middle class in the 1970s seemed to be outborrowing its 1950s counterpart. Historically, whenever consumer debt reached 2.5 percent of total disposable income, it would be followed by an immediate slowdown in borrowing; collectively Americans seemed to know that they had reached a danger point. But in 1978, consumer debt regularly topped 3 percent of… ([Location 3802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3802))

- At variance with previous experience? Previous experience was meaningless. It had been obliterated by inflation. That was the whole point: the old rules no longer applied. Thrift, for instance, had long been the great American virtue, something good people practiced as a matter of course. In a time of double-digit inflation, however, thrift was something foolish people practiced. Thrift in an inflationary age meant paying for tomorrow’s more expensive goods with yesterday’s diminished dollars. It was dumb. Borrowing, on the other hand, meant purchasing yesterday’s less expensive goods with tomorrow’s inflated dollars. That was smart. “The buy-in-advance syndrome,” one economist called it. Why did people continue to take on more debt when previous experience suggested they should be slowing down? Because borrowing was the economic response that made the most sense. Early in 1980, Kenneth Larkin gave a speech at a banking convention in which he outlined some of the new… ([Location 3811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3811))

Inflation was shaping them every bit as much as the Depression had shaped their parents. Here, for example, was a young Paine Webber economist named Christopher Rupkey making the case for borrowing by his generation—something he did with a glee that his elders could only have found unseemly. “ ‘Never buy what you can’t afford’ was the admonition of our parents,” he began in a New York Times article he wrote in the spring of 1979. “Today, the statement has been changed to, ‘You can’t afford not to buy it.’ ” More young couples live in the same comfortable homes and sit in the same sumptuous sofas that are equal or better than those of their parents, many of whom worked for years to obtain what their children get with a… ([Location 3831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3831))

- Millions of credit card customers all over the country reacted by pulling their business away from their bank; Bank of America lost several hundred thousand accounts to such protests. But the protests were futile, because when the protesters searched for a new “free” credit card, they discovered that they all now came with fees attached. The only other option was to refuse to take a credit card altogether, and though surveys suggested that as many as half the country’s credit card users were vowing to do precisely that, they never did. By 1980, refusing to use a credit card wasn’t much of an option anymore. With usury laws conquered and annual fees a reality, all the bankers needed to do was wait: Wait for inflation to subside; wait for interest rates to go down; wait for the profits to start rolling in. Soon enough, they did. ([Location 3914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=3914))

- And that only describes one side of the S&L balance sheet. On the other side—the lending side—things were even worse. S&Ls existed to do one thing: lend money for home mortgages. In the days before inflation, an S&L would write thirty-year mortgages by the bushelful, charging, say, 7 percent interest, which would be enough to turn a nice little profit. But when interest rates began reaching 10 percent and beyond, those mortgages resembled nothing so much as a noose, slowly strangling the institutions that had written them. S&Ls were “borrowing short and lending long,” as they used to say—paying high short-term rates to attract money, while carrying a huge portfolio of low-interest, long-term loans. As a result, hundreds of S&Ls were technically insolvent, their doors kept open mainly because the government feared the cost of closing them down.8 As rates kept rising, recalls Todd Conover, comptroller of the currency under Reagan, “people actually calculated the month a particular S&L was going to go out of business.” ([Location 4204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4204))

- That summer was when it all came to a boil—when the consequences of Volcker’s anti-inflation crusade were so painful that Americans were entitled to wonder whether the cure was worse than the disease. In attempting to squeeze inflation out of the economy, Volcker threw the country into the deepest recession since the Depression.15 Interest rates were off the charts. They had already risen to new heights during the last year of the Carter administration, but it was the summer of 1981 when interest rates peaked. The prime lending rate seemed to be stuck at around 20 percent. Government debt of every kind—three- and six-month T-bills, as well as the “long bonds” of fifteen- and thirty-year durations—were paying out stratospheric yields, around 16 percent in the case of Treasury bills, with the long bond hovering close to 14 percent. Most of the summer, the average money market fund yield was between 16 and 17 percent; in August, at least three funds broke the 18 percent barrier.

- In their whole history, they would never yield more than they did that summer. And the middle class was paying attention. The relationship between interest rates and the movement of middle-class money was never so clear as it was that summer. Money didn’t stay in one place anymore; it went wherever interest rates were highest. During its June meeting, for instance, the DIDC voted to raise the interest rate ceiling on something called a small saver’s certificate—essentially a thirty-month CD that had been created by Congress to help the small saver. With the ceiling lifted, the rates paid on the certificates jumped from around 12 percent to 16 percent. Instantly, the small saver’s certificates swelled with new money; in August alone, S&Ls pulled in $6.5 billion. That was just one of a dozen examples of how middle-class savings had begun to follow interest rates. Of course the preeminent example of this practice remained money market funds. When 1981 began, money market funds held a record $80 billion in assets. By the end of the year, that $80 billion figure had been washed away in a tidal wave of new money. During the course of the year, assets poured in at the rate of $2 billion a week, bringing the 1981 total to $183 billion in assets. And that 125 percent gain, impressive though it was, represented a mere fraction of the total 1981 money market sales. The latter amount—the amount of money that flowed through money market funds during the course of the year—was a staggering $452 billion. That is to say, only one out of every four dollars that went into a money fund during 1981 was still there at year’s end. Where had the rest of that money gone? A good deal of it, surely, had left money funds to pay bills.16 But it also seems clear that people were moving their savings in and out of money funds for another reason: They were shopping around for the best yields they could find. Once people began to pay attention to interest rates, they realized that the financial universe was full of competing interest rates. Small saver’s certificates offered one rate, T-bills another, money funds a third. They also discovered that money market funds were not generic, the way passbook accounts were. Different funds offered different yields, and though the gap between the highest yielding fund and the lowest yielding fund was small, it was still a gap. That gap mattered, in a way it never had before. Money magazine was publishing a monthly list of the highest yielding money funds by then, and it was startling, the effect that list had. Every month, the money funds at the top of the list were flooded with new money. Around this same time, a term came into vogue to describe this new phenomenon of Americans moving their money around from place to place, in search of an extra percentage point in interest. It was called ([Location 4380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4380))

- “chasing yield,” and it represented one of the great behavioral shifts in American finance. There are, in retrospect, any number of reasons why the humble money market fund turned out to be the critical financial innovation of the money revolution. One of them, surely, was that it was largely responsible for instilling in millions of Americans the idea that chasing yield was something worth doing. More compelling still, it instilled the idea that those who failed to chase yield would lose. Just as the aversion to risk would be ingrained in anyone who had lived through the Depression, so would this new lesson embed itself in the subconscious of those who lived through the Age of Inflation.

- THE GREAT BULL market of the 1980s—the second greatest bull market of this century, and the event that most dramatically shaped personal finance as Americans emerged from the Age of Inflation—began in the middle of August 1982. Or so it was always said later, once the extent and importance of the bull market had become clear, and it had entered the pantheon of watershed moments that comprised the money revolution. August 1982 would eventually be seen as the time when the stock market finally began to matter to the middle class, just as Charlie Merrill had hoped some sixty years before. And it was true enough. On an otherwise inauspicious Friday in August—Friday the 13th, as it happens—the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened at 776.92. Up until then, all but one trading session that month had been a losing one; indeed, most trading sessions for the previous year and a half had resulted in losses. Volume was light. The market seemed moribund. But ([Location 4581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4581))

- when trading ended that day, the Dow had risen twelve points. The following Monday it rose another four points, and the day after that, the 17th of August, it closed at 831.24, for a gain—highly unusual in the early 1980s—of close to forty points. Volume wasn’t just heavy, it was history-making: More shares were traded the third week of August 1982 than had ever been traded in any five-day stretch before.1 By the end of the month, the Dow stood at 901.31. It had gained 125 points in thirteen sessions. The thing about big market shifts, though, is that their beginnings are always easy to pinpoint after the fact. You look at a graph of the market, find the lowest (or highest) point before the trend reverses and, voilà, that’s when the bull (or bear) began. The moment of change is rarely so obvious when you’re in the middle of it, surrounded by the chaos and white noise of the market, with no way of knowing whether today’s good fortune is a harbinger or an aberration. Most certainly, that was true in August 1982. The signals being sent by the larger economy—signals that might propel the stock market in a particular direction—were ambiguous. The recession had not yet ended, unemployment was still very high, and corporate profits were mediocre—not exactly encouraging signs for the stock market. On the other hand, inflation and interest rates were coming down quickly; in fact, the August surge was triggered by the pronouncement ([Location 4588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4588))

- What an eternity it had been between bull markets! What a long time it had been, in fact, between markets that could reasonably be described as decent. More than a decade had passed since the Go-Go era had ended, but one could make a strong case that the drought in stock prices had begun well before then and that much of the seeming bullishness of the late 1960s had been a cruel mirage. The charts clearly showed that the powerful postwar bull market had ended in February 1966, with the Dow peaking at 995.15.3 Between then and the late summer of 1982—a sixteen-year period—the market had been characterized by a series of peaks and valleys so pronounced that a picture of the Dow Jones average resembled nothing so much as a mountain range. At the top of each peak, the Dow would graze the 1,000 point mark, sometimes barely topping it, sometimes just missing it. At the bottom of each subsequent valley, the market would drop anywhere from 250 to 400 points. In August 1982, the Dow stood 219 points below its February 1966 peak. No doubt there were people who could maneuver their way through these peaks and ([Location 4613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4613))

- valleys, but there weren’t many, and virtually none were small investors. For a small investor, negotiating such a market really was about as treacherous as climbing a mountain range. Not that there were many small investors left. What was the point? Americans were far too concerned with figuring out ways to keep up with inflation to give much thought to a market that was going nowhere. Besides, the stock market didn’t have much to offer people who were trying to ward off the corrosive effects of inflation. The stereotypical elderly investor, for instance, who traditionally held conservative stocks that paid out steady dividends, was far better off in a money fund, because the yield was much higher. A real speculator, of course, might be able to find a stock or two that could outsprint inflation, but for most people that course seemed awfully risky. By contrast, an investment in inflation-sensitive real estate seemed a sure thing. In 1978, the New York Stock Exchange confirmed the widespread sense that the market had become an unwatched sideshow. In conducting one of its occasional surveys of “investor attitudes,” it discovered “pervasive public preoccupation with ‘preserving’ capital and purchasing power to keep abreast of inflation.” The exchange added, “Investments that are perceived as involving the least amount of risk rank highest today in the estimation of people who have funds ([Location 4621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4621))

- For instance: during the Age of Inflation, Fidelity became a company that eschewed commissions. Money funds, of course, couldn’t be sold on a commission basis, because the commission would cut too deeply into the funds’ yields and negate their appeal. But once Fidelity learned how to market its money fund directly to the public, without relying on a commissioned sales force, Johnson took a far more dramatic step: he abandoned the commissions on Fidelity’s other funds as well, and began selling them all directly to the public, cutting out the traditional broker-dealer network. This happened in 1979. ([Location 4676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4676))

- Though Johnson was not the first to take this step—that distinction belongs to his archrival Jack Bogle at the Vanguard Group, who made the move two years before—it was still a risky thing to do for someone in the fund business, which had always used brokers to distribute funds. Yet to hear Johnson tell it now, the decision to bring the business in-house was just so . . . obvious. “Brokers weren’t selling our funds anyway,” he says with a shrug. But the move had a host of repercussions, the most important of which was that it changed the focus of the company. Commission revenue is inexorably tied to the performance of the stock market; therefore, eliminating commissions helped bring employees around to the idea that Fidelity no longer lived and died by the vagaries of the Dow Jones average. Instead, Fidelity executives began to see that their real function was not trading stocks, or researching companies, or even selling mutual funds. It was gathering assets.

- Upon hearing the question, Johnson sighed a little, and scratched his head, and screwed up his mouth in a way that conveyed his discomfort at having to reply. When he finally did reply, his answer was hopelessly mundane. “I just assumed that the equity market would eventually come back,” he said with a small, sheepish shrug. “It always has before.” It always has before. So it has. Except that this time, when it came back, millions of middle-class Americans who had never given a thought to the stock market would have money “invested” in a money market fund. Which was operated by a mutual fund company. Which also had stock funds. These customers would have been trained by inflation to search for the highest yields they could find, wherever they might be. They would have learned the importance of paying attention to the broader financial world, which, they now knew, directly affected them. In other words, thanks to the changes wrought by inflation, the next bull market was bound to be noticed by the very people Charlie Merrill had always tried to lure into the market.

- To put it another way, he was not a smoothie. He wore crumpled seersucker suits, and spoke in simple aphorisms that anyone could understand. And he could seem weirdly naive at times. Once, when he was in Detroit with another Fidelity fund manager, Lynch spent an hour one afternoon with Lee Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. Lynch’s decision to invest heavily in Chrysler in the early 1980s, when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, was probably the single greatest stock bet he made in his storied career at Magellan; perhaps not surprisingly, Lynch tended to think highly of Iacocca. Afterward, though, as the two Fidelity men were leaving the building, Lynch said, with absolute sincerity, “You know, Iacocca is one of the five greatest books of all time.” ([Location 4792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4792))

- By 1974, Lynch had plainly paid his dues. But still his wait continued, for no funds were available for him to manage. So he spent the next three years as the head of the research department. Yet even after all that time, he was still surprised when, at the age of thirty-three, “they finally tapped me on the shoulder” in May 1977. The surprise was not so much that they were handing him the ball; rather, it was that the ball they were handing him was Magellan. It was a small fund, true enough, barely known to the outside world. But within Fidelity, it loomed large. Magellan was Ned Johnson’s baby. It had been started in 1963, with Johnson himself as its original fund manager. Two years later, it was closed to the public, and became primarily an investment vehicle for what might be called in-house money. Its assets included some employee profit-sharing funds and corporate funds, but mostly it contained Johnson family money. By the time Lynch took it over, Johnson no longer ran the fund, but it was still closed to the public, and its assets were still mostly his and his family’s. It held, at that point, $6 million. To beef it up a bit, Fidelity merged it with another fund, Essex, which had virtually collapsed in the 1970s, its assets dwindling from $100 million to $14 ([Location 4865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4865))

- million. That gave Lynch $20 million to work with. (The merger also resulted in some tax advantages for Magellan.) But the fund remained closed to the public, which gave Lynch an important advantage: he didn’t have to worry about coping with an influx of money from enthusiastic investors. Then again, in those days one would have been hard-pressed to find an enthusiastic investor anywhere in America. There was, however, one obvious disadvantage to having your first portfolio be the one that contained the boss’s money. The boss was going to watch what you were doing very closely. And for the next year, that’s pretty much what happened. Lynch bought and sold stocks, and Ned Johnson looked over his shoulder. It was, Lynch would say later, “the greatest interplay I had with Ned Johnson in all my years at Fidelity.” Johnson had a tendency to pop into his office around 6:00 P.M., and then just linger, asking Lynch why he was buying this or that, or reminiscing about the old days when he was running funds. By the time he got up to leave, two hours would have passed. Lynch used to commute home with his wife, and after this had happened a few times, he came up with a code phrase—he can’t remember what it was—so that he could discreetly call her and tell her that the boss had just popped in, and they wouldn’t be getting home any time soon.

- You might expect the young novice to be intimidated by so much scrutiny from the man who signed his paychecks. But he wasn’t. Lynch’s distinctive, unorthodox style seemed to be fully formed from the moment he became a portfolio manager, and he was fearless about following his instincts—instincts that could not have been more different from Ned Johnson’s. Lynch was a contrarian by temperament, a huge believer that you bought when everyone around you was selling. The more mundane the company, the better he liked it—he wanted to buy stock in companies he understood. (“I like to buy a business that any fool can run because eventually one will” was one of his aphorisms.) An anecdote he would recount endlessly after he became famous was the one about how he purchased stock in Hanes, the company that produced L’Eggs pantyhose, after his wife began buying the new pantyhose at the supermarket. But he was eclectic too: although Magellan was an aggressive growth fund, Lynch was willing to buy conservative stocks like textiles and utilities if he liked their “stories.” His only rule, he once said, was that he had no rules. He wanted to be open… ([Location 4884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4884))

- Johnson had always been fascinated by the technical side of the market; Lynch could not have cared less about the technical indices. He didn’t even much care which direction the market was heading, for he didn’t believe that the direction of the market could tell him anything about the direction of a particular stock. And it was particular stocks he was interested in. If you bought the right stocks, he believed, it didn’t matter what the broader market was doing: over the long haul, your stocks would go up. After he became well known, and people asked him where he thought the market was headed, he would reply that he had no idea. The “market,” he felt, was a big distraction, and his ability to shut it out was another of his advantages. Finally, he liked to have a lot of stocks in his portfolio. There was nothing so distinctive about his style as his willingness to stuff hundreds upon hundreds of stocks into Magellan—and nothing that so clearly set him apart from Johnson. Johnson’s strategy had always been to hold a small handful of stocks, concentrated in an even smaller handful of industries.

- What can be said with some certainty is that the decision to open Magellan to the public spoke volumes about the kind of company Fidelity had become. It was a company that tried to respond to the wishes of the public, and there was a growing segment of the public that quite explicitly wanted Magellan. Fidelity knew this because, by the late 1970s, it had begun to receive letters and phone calls from customers who wanted to know why they couldn’t get into this terrific fund they had noticed.

- Johnson did one other thing that would affect both Magellan’s fortunes and those of the mutual fund industry. In opening Magellan to the public, Johnson decided to slap a small, 2 percent commission on it, making it the nation’s first “low-load” fund. The difference between this commission and the commission the company used to charge in the old, Go-Go days—besides being much smaller—is that Fidelity got to keep the money itself instead of handing it over to a broker. The move itself was pure instinct. Johnson felt that if a fund truly performed, people wouldn’t mind paying a small fee to get into it. Fidelity could then use that money to buy more advertising, and do more marketing, and have more people to answer the phones. The loads that Johnson imposed on his funds became, in time, a cash machine, helping make him one of the wealthiest men in America, and helping create the behemoth that Fidelity became. Gradually, other mutual fund companies that sold directly to the public did likewise, and soon the direct-market mutual fund universe was divided into two groups: the no-loads—which, as the name implies, consists of companies that do not put any loads on the funds they offer—and the low-loads, of which Fidelity is the preeminent example.9 Putting loads on his funds brought criticism that Johnson and Fidelity were acting piggishly—that the loads imposed far outstripped the company’s need for the money. But Johnson’s instincts were right. People were willing to pay extra for a fund that generated the kind of yield Peter Lynch was producing—the kind that allowed people to brag about their mutual fund. And if you wanted proof, all you had to do was look at what happened to Magellan. More money flowed into Magellan when it had a 2 percent load than when ([Location 4932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4932))

- it had been free. In 1982, just as stock funds started to become popular again, Johnson upped the load to 3 percent. Now the money really streamed in. For nearly four years, Lynch had been able to become a hot fund manager without having to face the hot fund manager’s problem: finding enough good stocks to invest the new money that comes streaming in from investors, all of whom want a piece of the hot fund. Suddenly Lynch faced that problem in spades. It got to the point where he went to Johnson and complained, for the one and only time in his career, that the fund was getting too big, and maybe they should close it to the public. Johnson said he’d think about it. The subject never came up again. Magellan held around $200 million when that conversation took place. By the end of 1982, it was up to $458 million. It had been, of course, another glorious year for Magellan, which gained 48 percent while the S&P 500 rose a “mere” 21 percent. It was poised to become the fund with the best ten-year record, something it would achieve the following year. It was right around then that reporters began taking note not just of the fund but of its manager. Rukeyser was calling to ask if Lynch would appear on his show. Barron’s added him to its regular panel of investment gurus. By the time 1983 had ended, Magellan’s assets had grown to $1.6 billion, and interview requests for Lynch had ([Location 4945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=4945))

- Except in two cases. In 1981, Fuller, who had recently left SRI for Charles Schwab & Co., introduced Kahr to Schwab, who commissioned him to come up with a financial product that would do for Schwab what the CMA had done for Merrill Lynch. This Kahr accomplished with his usual flair—the ensuing product, called the Schwab One Account, improved on the CMA in several respects, and remains one of Schwab’s most popular offerings to this day. Since Chuck Schwab saw himself as an entrepreneur, like Kahr, he had no problems turning over 20 percent of the profits to Kahr and his partner, who in this case was Fuller. After all, that’s how entrepreneurs operated. The other company to do business with Kahr in this era was a bit more surprising. It was a big, lumbering, Dallas-based finance company called the Associates, which at the time was owned by a well-known, New York-based conglomerate, Gulf + Western.2 Then again, maybe it shouldn’t have been such a surprise, since finance companies were no less immune to the effects of the money revolution than their more exalted brethren, the banks and brokerage houses and ([Location 5019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5019))

- insurance companies. They, too, had to cope with a formerly well-defined world that had turned upside down. For finance companies, it was the widespread acceptance of bank credit cards that had changed their world—that, and the concomitant discovery by the banks that the middle class, as a group, were extremely desirable customers, which of course finance companies had long known. Once credit cards became commonplace, finance companies found themselves scrambling to maintain their loan portfolios, as banks began making the everyday loans to middle-class Americans that had always been the bread and butter of most finance companies. ([Location 5027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5027))

- Two months later, the Associates mailed solicitations to potential customers, and got a response so high that it virtually assured that the company’s new Execu-Charge card—as it was called—would be a smash. Despite the glut of bank credit cards, Kahr had designed the Associates’ card in such a way as to make it particularly attractive to a certain segment of the middle class—a segment, as it happened, that had no qualms about generating debt to maintain its standard of living.4 Thus, while most bank credit cards had 50 percent of its customers “revolving” its debt, the Associates had upward of 90 percent of its customers taking on debt. Within six months, the Execu-Charge card had generated some $50 million worth of debt. By 1980, a mere two years after it had been inaugurated, the Associates had some 250,000 credit card customers across the nation, and was among the twenty-five largest credit card operations in America.

- And still Kahr had one more trick up his sleeve—one more startling example of how good he was at exploiting the “Swiss cheese of regulation.” He had never liked having to do business with a bank in order to issue credit cards; it put too many variables outside his control. What happened if the bank started making mistakes? Or if it decided one day that it no longer wanted to help out a finance company? Or if it started demanding changes in the contract? Kahr could envision a dozen scenarios like that, every one of which could only mean trouble for his client, the nonbank financial institution dependent on the goodwill of a bank, which in every other respect was a competitor. As its card program grew, the Associates also began to get nervous about the arrangement, fearing that the government might object. So once the Execu-Charge card was running smoothly, Kahr began contemplating an idea as outrageous as any he’d ever had. He started thinking about the possibility of having the Associates process its own credit card transactions, through its own bank. Here he was truly entering a Houdini-like realm. Despite all the changes that had taken place in American finance, the laws preventing a nonbank entity ([Location 5069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5069))

It was one of the true untouchables; the long-held belief, in Washington and elsewhere, that permitting nonbanks to own banks could only lead to abuse still held sway. Merrill Lynch and all the other nonbank financial institutions could try to perform banklike functions, and could create products that mirrored the workings of bank products, but nobody even thought about simply buying a bank outright. That was unambiguously against the law. But what was a bank, exactly? It’s not the sort of question most people would ever ask, and if they did, their answer would probably resemble Justice Potter Stewart’s famous line about pornography: he might not be able to define it, but he knew it when he saw it. Yet, in the law, there were specific criteria separating banks from nonbanks. According to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1960, a bank was defined as an institution that did two things: accept deposits and make commercial loans. Kahr knew this because, as was his habit, he had gone back and read the Bank Holding Company Act, searching for loopholes that others had missed. He found his… ([Location 5078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5078))

- like a bank, and acted like a bank. But technically, it wouldn’t be a bank, and therefore could be owned by a finance company. A bank that wasn’t a bank. A nonbank bank. Thus did the money revolution take one more lurch forward. On August 12, 1980, the Associates received the go-ahead from the comptroller of the currency, and transferred its credit card operation to newly named Associates National Bank, in Concord, California. Formerly, this institution had been known as Fidelity National Bank, and it had been a speck of a thing, with no more than $10 million in capital and seven employees. That’s what everybody at the Associates and Gulf + Western wanted: a bank so tiny, so out-of-the-way, that nobody would notice what they were up to. Publicity, they knew, could only queer their deal. Even without publicity, it was a dicey proposition because, despite the comptroller’s quick agreement that the loophole Kahr had found did indeed exist—and that the purchase of the bank by Gulf + Western was therefore legal—Volcker’s Federal Reserve was also required to rule on… ([Location 5088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5088))

Now it seemed as though both the written and unwritten rules of American finance, which had been so inviolable for so long, hadn’t just gotten a little hazy; they had disappeared entirely. “The genie was out of the bottle,” wrote Tim Carrington of the Wall Street Journal, and the consequence was that companies felt restrained only by the limits of their own imagination. The same month Kahr and the Associates set up the first nonbank bank, an investment banker named Sandy Lewis held the first in a series of meetings that would lead American Express to buy the brokerage firm of Shearson Loeb Rhoades. In April 1981, at about the same time that deal was completed, Prudential Insurance bought Bache Securities, meaning that an insurance company would be offering, in addition to insurance, stocks and bonds and mutual funds. Dreyfus, the mutual fund company, bought a bank in New Jersey, and quickly transformed it into a nonbank bank by selling off its commercial loan portfolio. Merrill Lynch soon followed suit.

- Unfortunately, Parker Pen’s plans for First Deposit were quickly changing. The recession of the early 1980s had hurt the company badly, and by 1982, it was losing money. Having no other choice, it turned off First Deposit’s money spigot. Its executives began talking about the need to “focus our resources  . . . in the areas where we had expertise”—which were decidedly not financial services. At this point, Kahr had some forty employees, divided among California, New Hampshire, and Arkansas. Parker Pen had not only stopped putting money into First Deposit, but was shopping its subsidiary around. And for all his talk, Kahr wasn’t even close to developing a product. It would be an overstatement to say that First Deposit was in dire straits, but it was going to need some cash in the not-too-distant future to remain afloat, and it was hard to see where that cash might come from. And then an odd thing happened. Rich Arnold, the chief financial officer at Schwab, whom Kahr had befriended when he had been working on the Schwab One Account, called him to say Schwab needed to buy Kahr out of their profit-sharing agreement.

- they negotiate something both sides could be happy with? Kahr’s predicament being what it was, they certainly could. Putting aside his usual vehemence about the inviolability of his 20 percent share, he agreed to a deal that paid First Deposit $1.5 million in return for releasing Schwab from the profit-sharing agreement. That money gave Kahr a little breathing room. This was in November 1982.7 Why, though, was Schwab so insistent that its agreement with Andrew Kahr be rescinded? The answer was, Because it was a condition of Schwab’s own soon-to-be completed sale. And who was purchasing Schwab? That was the oddest part of all. Charles Schwab & Co., which was by then America’s largest and best-known discount broker, was in the process of being purchased by . . . BankAmerica.8 If the deal went through, Chuck Schwab, who thought of himself as the quintessential entrepreneur, would be running just another subsidiary of the country’s biggest bank. Well, maybe that’s not all he’d be. Since the terms called for BankAmerica to pay for the discounter with stock, Chuck Schwab would also be the bank’s largest stockholder. Here was the loophole BankAmerica had found in the otherwise impregnable fortress of Glass-Steagall. Banks still couldn’t buy insurance companies or sell mutual funds or take over Wall Street investment firms.

- couldn’t buy discount brokerages. Of course, the main reason this loophole existed was because discounting had yet to be invented when the great Depression-era banking laws were written. But so what? The working assumption of loophole exploiters like Kahr had always been that if the law did not explicitly outlaw an activity, then that activity was, by definition, legal. To a large degree, both the courts and the regulators accepted this interpretation.9 During the Reagan administration, certain deregulation-minded officials, particularly Comptroller of the Currency Todd Conover, openly encouraged the loophole-seekers, believing that the increased competition among financial firms would be good for consumers. In the case at hand, Glass-Steagall forbade the underwriting of stocks and bonds by banks. But discounters didn’t underwrite: all they did was make stock trades for customers. Of course, SRI had pointed out this loophole to the nation’s bankers back in the mid-1970s, when it first began producing studies about the shape of the financial future.

Odd as this may sound at first, a strong argument can be made that one middle-class tax break in particular played a surprisingly large role in luring the middle class into the stock market. That same 1981 tax bill contained a provision allowing any working person in America to lower his taxable income by $2,000 simply by putting that amount in a special tax-deferred retirement account, known as ([Location 5694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5694))

- an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA for short.7 At the time, no one really anticipated much interplay between IRAs and the stock market; it was generally assumed that IRA money would wind up in bank and thrift accounts. And at first, that’s what happened. But over time, IRA money began gravitating away from banks and toward brokerage firms and mutual fund companies, drawn in part by the bull market and in part by a marketing blitz that dwarfed anything that had come before. With IRAs, Congress wound up creating yet another battle line in the continuing war between banks and thrifts on the one hand, and nonbank institutions on the other, for the savings of the middle class. With IRAs, the nature of America’s postinflation behavior became that much clearer. *   *   * In 1982, the first year the new IRA rules went into effect, around 10 million American households had at least some savings in money market funds. These households, and the 15 million or so customers they represented, had become the most active customers of the mutual fund companies and brokerage houses that operated money funds, overshadowing old line equity investors who had remained in the market during the dog days of the 1970s.8 Those people who lived in these 10 million households tended to be younger than their equity fund counterparts; although a quarter of them were over the age of sixty, their median age was still a relatively youthful forty, according to a survey conducted by the Investment Company Institute that year. They were also resolutely middle class. Although 63 percent of them had incomes over $30,000, only 8 percent had incomes over $70,000. These young, demographically attractive money fund users represented pretty much the only new customers the fund and brokerage industries had attracted in a decade. They also represented the future. There was a rub, however. These new customers were still not investors—or rather, they didn’t think of themselves as investors. They still thought of themselves as savers. Moving their money from a bank account to a money market fund had not changed that self-image at all. About half the nation’s money fund customers held no other investments, for example, while over 53 percent of money fund customers flatly told the ICI surveyers that their “investment purpose” was “general savings.” Money market funds had thus brought not only a new customer into the tent, but a new kind of customer: a bank customer. The trick now was to keep these new customers in the tent, while whetting their interest in the growing array of financial products fund companies had begun to offer. The trick, in other words, was to transform these savers into investors. Over the next five years, right up until that awful day in October 1987, when the stock market crashed, that is what the mutual fund industry went about doing, with no small amount of success. To be sure, this process was propelled by broad, historical forces, such as the fact that baby… ([Location 5697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5697))

Jarvie’s bona fides included a short, unhappy stint as a top executive of Dr Pepper, as well as an earlier, happier stretch with Procter & Gamble. “I’m a mass marketer,” Chuck Jarvie would declare proudly; in his time at P&G, he had marketed Tide, the laundry detergent, and Pringles, the potato chip. Like most people who got their first taste of marketing at P&G, he took the lessons he learned there to heart. He was a huge proponent of “brand” management.

In the financial world at that time, there were two discontinuities, one created by the government, and the other created by inflation. The discontinuity created by inflation caused people to question the way they were saving. The discontinuity created by the government, the IRA, gave them a different way to save.

- ONE OF THE defining characteristics of the 1980s, perhaps the defining characteristic, was the willingness of American society to take on debt. This, at least, is the conventional wisdom as it’s been handed down; it is what “the eighties” have come to mean. Just as the fifties would conjure up Joe McCarthy and the suburbs, and the sixties would bring to mind Vietnam, so would the phrase “the eighties” act as a kind of shorthand for living beyond our means. Debt is what turned “the eighties” into a term of opprobrium. It is unarguably true that debt drove the decade; as is often the case, the conventional wisdom about the 1980s is irrefutable on the face of it. Virtually every person we now characterize as “a creature of the eighties”—Donald Trump, Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, Henry Kravis, Boone Pickens, Robert Campeau, Carl Icahn, and a hundred others—was fundamentally a creature of debt. It was their embrace of debt that brought them fame and fortune, and for ([Location 5910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=5910))

In a way, debt even made Ronald Reagan possible; had he not been willing to add $1 trillion to the national debt, his presidential joyride would not have been nearly as smooth. Surely you recall that the 1980s was when the United States went from being the world’s largest creditor nation to its largest debtor nation.

- So why was there such a proliferation of borrowing when it was surrounded by so much ambivalence? Lieber had two explanations. The first was that many Americans in the 1980s truly did feel optimistic about the future. Borrowing has always tended to rise rapidly at such times, because people feel more comfortable about their ability to repay their debts; this was the same psychology that drove much of the borrowing in the 1950s. Lieber’s second reason was that the psychological detritus left over from the Age of Inflation was driving Americans to borrow. Although inflation was well under control by the mid-1980s, the habits that had been formed during that earlier era were still prevalent. “Although inflation is more in check in 1985,” Lieber wrote, “consumers continue to act as if the rapid conversion of income to possessions is the order of the day. No more pressing message has caught their attention and made them change the assumptions ([Location 6007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6007))

- Finally, the losses that resulted from this impersonal method of granting consumer credit became part of the new numbers game. Such losses were a statistical inevitability, of course; indeed, the number crunchers in the back office could usually gauge in advance how high they would go in a particular season. Nobody in banking believed anymore that losses were avoidable—not when you were mailing solicitations to people on the other side of the country, some of whom would turn out to be credit junkies, others of whom would lose their jobs or face some financial catastrophe that credit cards could delay but not prevent. But no one in banking cared anymore; one thing that often surprised people filing for bankruptcy was ([Location 6050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6050))

- Of all the credit card executives who had reason to be pleased with how successful a business it had become, none had more reason than Dee Hock. The organization he had devised in the dark days of 1970 had performed, to a remarkable degree, exactly the way he had said it would. It had been singularly responsible for making credit cards both a financial success and a commodity that most Americans felt compelled to carry. Along the way, Visa had overtaken MasterCard as the more widely used credit card; by the mid-1980s Visa had cards in the hands of 53 percent of the public compared to 46 percent for MasterCard. And Visa had penetrated not just the United States but most of the globe; its ability to act as a form of international currency was among Hock’s proudest accomplishments: “No other business or political entity,” he once boasted in a speech, “has approached [this feat], not even the United Nations.” Bank cards had become the dominant form of credit card, and were poised to take on their last genuine nemesis, American Express, something they would do with increasing success through the 1980s and into the 1990s. For these efforts, Hock had reaped his share of rewards. By the early 1980s, he was reportedly paid a salary package worth around $800,000 a year. And he was rewarded as well with the knowledge that he remained the single most compelling figure in his universe;8 Spencer Nilson, the newsletter publisher, regularly placed Hock at or near the top in his occasional compilations of the most important figures in the credit card industry. Above all, even though banks could now issue the cards of both credit card organizations, and even though the two systems had become virtually indistinguishable in the eyes of the public, Visa still remained the superior organization to those in the know. Except in one respect. The bankers who sat on the MasterCard board could say without hesitation that theirs was an organization that did the bidding of its member banks—who, after all, were the owners of the system. The bankers who sat on the Visa board never had the same feeling; they were too busy feuding with ([Location 6070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6070))

- their employee, Dee Hock. Which is perhaps why, despite everything he had done, these were not the best of times for Hock. In many ways, they were the worst of times. The crux of the matter was that the bankers considered Hock’s work essentially finished, while Hock believed that he was just getting warmed up. They wanted him to run the “switch,” compile useful data, help stamp out credit card fraud, and handle marketing and advertising for Visa. These were all things Visa did more or less as a matter of course; it was the bread and butter of the place. Hock, on the other hand, wanted Visa to go head-to-head with American Express in the traveler’s check business. He wanted to ensure that Visa would be the beating heart of electronic banking.9 He wanted to create a Visa debit card program that was every bit as successful as the Visa credit card. Hock had a dozen ideas like that, all of which he firmly believed would be beneficial to banking, and which he strove relentlessly to turn into reality. His membership, however, became uneasy with Hock’s big ambitions for Visa, and by the 1980s, they had come to believe, in the main, that Hock was trying to dominate banking, and even control it. He was acting more like a competitor than a facilitator, they believed. By 1983, a writer for Fortune magazine could quote Hock quoting Emerson—“To be great is to be misunderstood”—and then quip, “The fifty-four-year-old ([Location 6085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6085))

- there are important differences. Whereas a credit card gives a user access to an unsecured loan, a debit card gives a user access to his deposits—that is, to money he already has in the bank rather than money he is borrowing from the bank. One way to use a debit card is to insert it into an automatic teller machine, which electronically connects a cardholder to his checking and savings accounts. When he withdraws some of that money, even when the ATM he is using is located on the other side of the country, the funds are instantly deducted from his balance. A second way to use a debit card is as a payment device at a checkout counter.12 Indeed, to the merchant, a debit card and a credit card work almost exactly the same way; the main difference is that most debit cards require a PIN (PIN stands for “personal identification number”) to work, which in turn requires the installation of an additional piece of equipment so that the cardholder can punch in his number. To the user of the card, the key difference is that after he’s bought something with a debit card, he never has to pay off the debt at the end of the month since no debt has been created. The card has burrowed its way electronically into the customer’s bank account, and withdrawn the money needed to make the purchase. It’s not hard to understand the appeal of debit cards to Hock. A successful Visa debit card would bring him that much closer to his goal of having Visa develop ([Location 6116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6116))

- into America’s preeminent payment system. He believed, in particular, that those consumers who used credit cards primarily for reasons of convenience (as opposed to those who used it primarily as a borrowing device) would be drawn to a debit card. He also believed that a debit card, far more than a credit card, could be marketed as an alternative to checks at places like grocery stores. Because checks were used far more frequently by Americans than credit cards, they were, to Hock’s way of thinking, every bit as much the enemy as American Express. Finally, Hock saw debit cards as the first step toward his climactic idea, which Business Week once accurately labeled the “all-in-one card.” If Hock had his way, Americans would one day carry a single card that acted as an “access device”13—a card that gave customers a means to get at not just their deposits, but all their financial assets. The choice of which asset to use—“a credit asset, a deposit asset, an investment asset, a mortgage equity asset, cash value of life insurance, or any other asset,” as Hock once described it in a speech—would be “the customer’s prerogative.” Hock was convinced that… ([Location 6127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6127))

- Americans again, the way it had been before all those other institutions began crashing through the walls of banking. It would forcefully bind a customer to his bank—though it was also true that that bank no longer had to be the one across the street; it could just as easily be one across the country. The only problem with Dee Hock’s big idea was that the rest of the world stubbornly refused to go along. Forget about the all-in-one card; Hock couldn’t even sell the world on the simple debit card. Throughout the 1970s, customers were oblivious to the alleged advantages of debit cards, preferring to stick with those old standbys, checks and credit cards.14 Merchants resisted the technology necessary to allow debit card transactions at the point of sale. But the fiercest resistance came from Visa’s own member banks. Hock launched Visa’s first debit card in the mid-1970s; some five years later, only 130 banks marketed them. It wasn’t so much that bankers were against the idea of debit cards. But they were violently opposed to the idea of a Visa debit card. They wanted debit cards that they controlled, not Dee Hock.

- savings and checking accounts]. You’re hitting bankers where they live. They weren’t going to let anybody, especially Dee Hock, tell them how to manage their deposit stream. Debit cards thus evolved in their own peculiar way, quite apart from Dee Hock’s grand designs. Hock’s dream of using debit cards in stores faded somewhat, despite periodic attempts to revive it. The interest just wasn’t there, at least not then.15 Instead, most debit card activity in America centered around ATM use, which grew rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and became as much a staple of American financial life as the credit card itself. In the beginning, most ATM systems were proprietary, meaning that customers could use their cards only in the very small handful of machines operated by their own bank. This, of course, put severe limits on their usefulness, and led in time to the emergence of a wide variety of ATM networks, which linked machines in different parts of the country to a centralized switch. Just as it had once taken years for a national credit card system to evolve—years of chaos and losses and… ([Location 6149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6149))

- His second revelation was that everything about credit cards, not just the structure of the back office, meshed remarkably well with Kahr’s mathematical cast of mind. The credit card business is surprisingly compatible with the kind of complicated mathematical modeling that came so naturally to Kahr. It was a business, he would later note, where one could do demonstrably better “by using data, by testing, by gaining insights that could lead to successful levels of improvements.” He adds, “When I saw that credit cards were amenable to very systematic, rigorous, reiterative thinking, I felt like I had come home.” Finally, he recalls, choosing his words carefully, “I saw that there were things that could be done to better build a profitable customer [base].” By this, he is referring to the most basic fact of all about the credit card business: profits are derived from customers who use the card to go into debt, rather from those who pay their balances in full. It was during his stint at Wells Fargo that Kahr first began to realize that if one could get hold of the right data, and analyze it properly, one could predict the kind of person most likely to become ([Location 6364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6364))

- a “profitable customer.” Or, rather, Andrew Kahr could predict it. Building this kind of customer base was a key part of Kahr’s work with the Associates, and his ability to predict behavior, on the basis of incomprehensible streams of numbers, was the reason close to 90 percent of the finance company’s first credit card customers were “revolvers.” Indeed, during his time with the Associates, Kahr became so annoyed at those who paid off their balances each month that he wanted to cut them off, by refusing to renew their cards when they expired. This was one Kahr idea that was met with an unequivocal rejection. You just couldn’t do that, the executives told him. And they were right; it would have been a public relations disaster. Yet from his Wells Fargo days onward, this was Kahr’s ideal: to create a customer base where every single customer was “profitable.” And that meant finding the person “who gets in debt, stays in debt, and always pays [the minimum balance] on time,” says John Decker, a former First Deposit hand, choosing his words with a good deal less care than Kahr himself. Decker continues, “The way you make a credit card profitable is very simple. You get people to borrow a lot of money. That is the most important thing. Secondly, you identify people who are likely not to become delinquent. And thirdly, you make it easy for them to get into debt.” At both the Associates and First ([Location 6373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6373))

- Deposit, this concept was at the core of Andrew Kahr’s credit products. The truth of Decker’s blunt comment, it has to be said, is indisputable. But it’s an ugly truth, which is why it is virtually never spoken aloud among bankers, and why even Kahr shies away from phrasing it as straightforwardly as Decker. Credit card bankers don’t want to see themselves as people whose essential goal is to entice customers to pile on debt—even though, as the years progressed and the business grew increasingly cutthroat, that’s frequently what they became. This ugly truth is the reason the credit card industry has so often felt itself on the defensive, why it has been the object of continual criticism from consumer advocates and credit counselors and congressmen over the years, why even Americans who can afford to pay their credit card bills each month can resent the banks that make the cards available to them. It harkens back to our centuries-old Puritanical feelings about debt, our feeling, as a society, that those who dangle the lure of debt in front of us—notwithstanding our own eagerness to take on that debt—are doing something wrong.… ([Location 6383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6383))

- and is—a brilliant man, but his was a mathematical brilliance, cold and ruthlessly logical. He was neither a philosopher nor a moralist; to him, if something was not illegal, it was, therefore, possible. “I never went to work feeling that I was there to improve the world,” he says. “I’m in business to make money, not only stay out of jail but off the front page and so on.” He adds: “I [think] that if you’re in business doing something consistently and you make money over a period of years, it implies fairly strongly that you’re producing [something of] value . . . . I never tire of saying that it’s the guy who goes broke who’s socially destructive.” Unencumbered by the societal baggage that held others back, Kahr was only too happy to take credit cards to their logical conclusion—which he did brilliantly. The same mind that brought us the CMA and the nonbank bank now brought us a credit card that dangled the lure of debt more nakedly than anyone ever had before. There were a number of ways Kahr created his “profitable” customer base at First Deposit. He eliminated the annual fee on his “First Select” Visa card (as it was called), which gave… ([Location 6393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6393))

- just about anyone else in the country. The First Select card carried an interest rate that approached 22 percent when banks were charging 18 or 19 percent, for Kahr knew that “the most profitable customers are not very price sensitive.” What they were sensitive to, Kahr also knew, was the minimum they had to pay each month, so while First Deposit was charging 22 percent interest, it was dropping the minimum payment to the lowest of any institution in the country. Requiring only the tiniest sliver of principal repayment, the First Select card more closely resembled the repayment structure of a home mortgage than a traditional credit card. Finally—and this was a classic Kahr twist, which he had first used at the Associates—in order to accept the card, one also had to accept a check from First Deposit that ranged from $1,000 to $3,000. This check served as a cash advance, and in its direct mail packages, First Deposit promoted the check as a way to pay off other credit card debt. The ostensible appeal to the consumer was that, although his total debt load would not go down (in fact, it would go up), the monthly minimum… ([Location 6404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6404))

- the ways Kahr ensured that First Deposit’s customers were “profitable.” Here was the other way: from his Wells Fargo experience, Kahr knew that there was a particular group of Americans who combined the two behavioral traits he was looking for: a willingness to use a credit card to build up debt, and a fierce unwillingness to default on that debt. Kahr himself will not divulge who these people are, but from the veiled comments of others, one can make a calculated guess. They are most likely middle class, though not upper middle class. They’re strivers, perhaps the first generation in their family to break into the white collar work force. They live on the right side of the tracks, though perhaps a little closer to the tracks than they might like. They’re young enough to harbor no fear of debt, though their station in life does cause them to fear for their credit rating, which is why they go to great lengths to avoid becoming delinquent. One source describes them as “the lower end of the yuppies, making good money, but spending ahead of their income, [yet] with a predictable ability to increase their income.” For his part, Kahr will… ([Location 6414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6414))

- Yet even after Kahr knew, in a broad sense, who these people were, how did he track them down, sitting in his small office in San Francisco? This is also a verboten subject; Kahr’s technique for targeting the profitable 10 percent was, and remains, First Deposit’s trade secret. Suffice it to say that it brought to bear all his considerable skill at analyzing data in innovative ways—data about demographics, about spending preferences, about dozens of different traits and tendencies. He was using, he says now, “all the instruments of analysis, using the most fervent and intense application of the available techniques to deal with the complicated issue of behavior.” He would get lists of names from credit agencies based on one set of data,27 set those names into a complex matrix, match them against other lists based on other data, and the names that emerged from this lengthy sifting process would be the ones to get solicitations for the First Select card. Then he would track their credit card behavior, always refining his criteria, so that the next time he sifted through the American middle class, his success ratio would be higher. “We would generate thousands… ([Location 6424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6424))

- Chuck Schwab himself was a big fan of no-load mutual funds; aside from his BankAmerica stock, his portfolio consisted primarily of no-load funds. This interest led him in 1984 to one of his best ideas: the establishment of a Schwab “mutual fund marketplace,” where customers could invest in a variety of no-load funds simply by calling Schwab. In effect, Schwab created his own “family of funds,” using other companies’ funds. By the end of 1985, Schwab was approaching 1.2 million customers, compared to some 375,000 just prior to the buyout, and its revenues had more than tripled, going from around $67 million to more than $200 million. Most significant of all, 1985 was the first year Schwab could report profits that were remotely in line with its income. It made $20 million that year.

In thirteen days in June, he sold off about a third of his shares,2 at an average price that was some three dollars below the price at the time of the buyout. Because of Schwab’s position on the board, this sale was duly reported to the SEC, which meant the news wound up in the newspapers. The sale of that much stock sent an unmistakable signal: BankAmerica’s largest shareholder had lost faith in the bank.

- Then came July, and the news that the second quarter loss was $338 million; Schwab took his second drastic action. Wanting to know (as Hector would later put it) “whether Armacost had covered up the company’s loan problems,” Schwab hired the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells to conduct what amounted to an audit of the bank’s publicly available numbers going back to the early 1980s. In its report to Schwab, Deloitte showed how BankAmerica officials had, in effect, manipulated its loan loss reserve in order to report higher profits than circumstances warranted. Indeed, the Deloitte report strongly implied that this had been going on since before BankAmerica had completed its purchase of Schwab & Co. In August, when the BankAmerica board met for the first time since the announcement of the loss, Schwab took his third drastic action. After the meeting began, he passed around copies of the Deloitte study, arguing as he did that contrary to Armacost’s assertions, the bank was understating its potential loan losses, and that a full-fledged audit was needed. He got nowhere; none of the other board members would even second the motion. He then urged the board to take a step that was, if anything, more ([Location 6572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6572))

But he felt that the bank needed to use the money it was paying out to shareholders (himself included; Schwab received $1 million a year in BankAmerica dividends) to turn itself around. This time his motion was voted on, and though the board decided to trim the dividend a bit, he essentially lost again. Finally, he said openly the things he had been telling Armacost privately. “The bank must trim employment,” Schwab argued,3 “trim expenses by such means as selling the corporate jet . . . cut executive pay, rescind the recent directors’ fees increase [and] reassess the loan management system.” For the third time, the board declined to take Schwab’s advice. But there could be no doubt where Schwab stood. He had become a dissident board member. To Armacost, he had become the enemy. And still Schwab wasn’t done. Having been rebuffed by the full board, Schwab flew to Washington, where he met quietly with several of the outside board members,4 again pressing… ([Location 6580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6580))

- A few days later, Schwab took the most drastic step of all: he resigned from the board. The stock dropped to $13 a share. Although he refused to comment on the move, the message could not have been clearer. Later, when Schwab finally felt he could speak candidly, he told the writer Moira Johnston that “it was a great, liberating thing to be free from the bank’s problems.” Adds Johnston, “He felt the exhilaration soldiers feel when a decisive campaign is about to begin.” *   *   * The “campaign,” of course, was to get his company back. Although this was something Armacost had vowed would never happen on his watch, Armacost’s watch was nearing its conclusion. Less than two months after Schwab left the board, the bank’s directors finally gave up on Armacost and ousted him. In his place, they installed—implausibly, it seemed at the time—Tom Clausen. Clausen, who had done so much to create the bank’s problems, was being brought back to fix them. Even more implausibly, Clausen succeeded in this task—though he did so largely by importing executives from rival banks such as Wells Fargo. One such man, Richard Rosenberg, eventually succeeded Clausen as CEO. ([Location 6603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6603))

Schwab brought along a friend of his, George Roberts, a principal in the well-known leveraged-buyout firm of Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts. During the meeting, Roberts played good cop to Schwab’s bad cop. Schwab spent most of the meeting telling the bank officials that he would not budge from his original low-ball bid; Roberts, meanwhile, was walking these same officials through some sleight-of-hand financing he had devised that would allow the bank at least to save face.8 When the papers were signed a few months ([Location 6639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6639))

- later, and Schwab finally had his company back, the bank was able to announce a sale price of $280 million. But the executives at Schwab knew better. The true price had been $190 million—and of that amount, only $16.5 million in equity had been raised by the firm’s new owners, who consisted primarily of the top executives. The rest was borrowed money. It was a classic leveraged buyout. After the deal was signed, and the two companies were officially separated, they broke open some champagne in Schwab’s office, and in the firm’s San Francisco headquarters, people wore little buttons that read, “Schwab . . . Free At Last!” But mainly, the celebration was subdued. Most Schwab employees were too busy to spend much time celebrating; in the early part of 1987 the firm felt like an oversized version of its old self, when the entire staff had too much to do, and could never seem to catch up no matter how late they stayed or how many new people they hired. As for Schwab himself, he had his own reasons for cutting short the celebration. His mind was elsewhere. After a few sips of the champagne, he turned to Arnold and said quietly: “I want you to get started on a public offering.” Arnold was startled. “I said, ‘Chuck, come on! We’ve just pulled off a phenomenal deal.’ ” Arnold went on to argue that if they could show several strong years while the company remained in private hands, they could then take ([Location 6644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6644))

That day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2,304.69. The top was coming soon. ([Location 6654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6654))

- Peter Lynch likes to recall that by the early part of 1987, whenever he went to a cocktail party, he would be surrounded by people wanting to talk about the market. But instead of asking his advice on stocks, they would offer theirs. That, says Lynch, is when he began to realize that things were veering a bit out of control. One could get the same feeling by looking at Money magazine, circa 1987; the covers of nine of the first eleven issues in 1987 promised sure-fire strategies for making money in the market. But the bull market had also found its way into other, less likely Time, Inc., publications, such as People magazine, which ran one article on a formerly obscure money manager named Martin Zweig,17 and another, a few months later, about a summer camp devoted to teaching preteens about the stock market. In Rhode Island, a psychologist began advertising himself as the country’s first “investor psychologist.” The “Stock Doc,” he called himself. During this same time, a handful of new investment gurus emerged, heirs to Howard Ruff and Joe Granville. Their new prominence also seemed to suggest that things were getting out of hand. Probably the best known of the new gurus was Robert Prechter, a thirty-seven-year-old market technician who lived in Gainesville, Georgia, and was proclaiming loudly that the Dow would top 3600 before the bull market ended. This was an extremely appealing message to a great many people, to say the least, and reaped him an enormous amount of publicity. It also helped get him some 20,000 subscribers to his own highly priced newsletter. What was strange about Prechter’s appeal ([Location 6840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6840))

- was not so much his message, but what it was based on. Prechter believed in something called the Elliot Wave Theory, which, to put it bluntly, was virtually incomprehensible to anyone but him. It didn’t seem to matter. Prechter was saying what people wanted to hear, at a time when they wanted to hear it. So he gained followers. The first part of 1987 was a time of true euphoria, when investing seemed like fun and the prospect of losing money seemed dim. Just as middle-class Americans had once talked about real estate at dinner parties, now they talked about the stock market. The smell of money was in the air. This, after all, was the era that glorified the conspicuously wealthy and made heroes out of corporate-takeover artists. Some of the more adventurous of the new breed of middle-class investors even began speculating in rumored takeover stocks, though they played this game at a distinct disadvantage, since they usually got these rumors from the Wall Street Journal—which meant, essentially, that they were the last to know. Still, the rumors were often right; many of these Main Street speculators made money. ([Location 6852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6852))

- Yet in the face of these huge attitudinal changes, Merrill Lynch seemed oblivious.

And when, late in the summer of 1987, a veteran broker went to his supervisor to suggest that ([Location 6880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6880))

Besides, the manager added happily, “We’re not going to have a bear market. The market is going to 3600!” ([Location 6883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6883))

- “The market climbs a wall of worry.” So goes one of the great truisms of the stock market. What happened in the summer of 1987 was that everybody stopped worrying—sophisticated investors as well as rank novices, Wall Street as well as Main Street.

- The point is, the bears were prescient; they were forceful; and in some cases (Garzarelli’s especially), they were practically begging people to get out of the market. Yet it was only later, after their prophecies had come true, that their forceful statements were underlined, their prescient articles clipped, their videotaped pleadings replayed over and over again.

- (this, again, was doubly true of the strikingly attractive Garzarelli) that we realized they were the ones who’d been right—as opposed to, say, Robert Prechter. But then, how could we possibly know beforehand who was going to turn out to be right and who was going to be wrong? We never know ahead of time what the market is going to do: that’s what makes it so interesting and so nerve-racking all at once. It’s only in hindsight that the path it takes seems preordained, and the signals it sends seem obvious. When we’re in the middle of it, nothing seems preordained or obvious. We are deluged with contradictory advice, as every market “expert” argues his position as loudly as he can. When a market gets as crazy as the one in 1987, those voices can start to drown each other out, until they have become merely noise.

- The middle class was discovering something else about the money revolution: taking control of one’s finances was not necessarily an enjoyable experience—not when the market seemed to be suddenly going against you and you felt as though you had no place to turn for help. And it was certainly not simple either—not when every day brought news of some new financial product that had to be investigated, and that was as likely to be offered by General Electric as by Fidelity. There were moments when all the changes wrought by the money revolution could seem terrifying, for their net result was to force people to make choices about where to put their money, and every single choice entailed risk. What if you moved your money into a nice, safe money fund and the market went up another 1,000 points? What if you stayed in the market and it crashed?

- And what was Fidelity saying that August and September, as the market seesawed violently, and its customers became increasingly anxious about what lay ahead? Fidelity wasn’t saying much of anything. It continued to do what it had done throughout the bull market: provide an ever-expanding menu of choices, as its mutual fund factory churned out new funds, and its marketing department sold them. This is how it had come to view its mission. “People want control,” Rodger Lawson told one interviewer at the time, outlining Fidelity’s worldview. “They want to make their own decisions.” Well, maybe.

- the other hand, Fidelity heavily influenced those decisions with its torrential marketing campaigns. And though it may not have been saying anything overtly to its customers, its own actions seemed to suggest that it, too, had become a bit nervous about what the end of the bull market might mean. In the early part of 1987, Ned Johnson made the decision that Fidelity would stop advertising Magellan—not that it did much good; the fund still swelled by an additional $4 billion that year. Soon afterward, the company began to downplay most of the other aggressive stock funds as well. If and when the downturn came, those funds would be the ones hit hardest. In their place, Fidelity began promoting some of the more conservative funds, such as Puritan Fund and Balanced Fund, which were bound to perform better in a down market. There was, however, a more significant move Johnson could have made to protect his customers from the full force of the coming crash. He could have changed the company’s firm but unspoken rule that… ([Location 6971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6971))

- that people who handed over their money to Fidelity did so in the expectation that it would be invested in the market. That belief did not change once the market peaked in 1987. Surely, though, Johnson was giving his customers too much credit. Most middle-class investors found mutual funds appealing precisely because they wanted someone more knowledgeable than they to make market decisions on their behalf. The decision about whether or not to be fully invested was exactly the kind of judgment a novice investor would want his fund manager to make. Yet after everything that had happened during the past decade—after all his prescient moves to draw middle-class money to his company—Johnson still seemed to perceive his customers as investing sophisticates, which they were not. If, late in the summer of 1987, he had allowed his fund managers to begin moving… ([Location 6979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=6979))

He wanted to talk about where to invest.” “I don’t know about you guys but I think the big risk is that the Fed pulls the punchbowl from the market and consumer spending stops.” After listening to everyone speak his piece, Johnstone piped up. “Four or five months ago,” he said, “we thought we were in the ninth inning. Now it looks like we’re in extra innings.” At that, everyone laughed, but it was an edgy laugh, the kind that means the joke has struck close to the bone. “This meeting sure is bearish,” Terrana said with a sigh. As the meeting drew to a close, a young woman, new to Fidelity, suddenly asked for a straw poll on when the bull market would end. It was an embarrassing moment. Every fund manager in the room suddenly looked down at his shoes. The young woman persisted. Again the assembled portfolio managers demurred, more firmly this time.

- ON SEPTEMBER 22, 1987, CHARLES SCHWAB & Co. WENT PUBLIC. It was, in almost every respect, an astounding deal. Less than six months after it had broken away from BankAmerica, the company sold 8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, at a price of $16.50 a share, instantly raising $132 million in capital. Those 8 million shares, however, represented only a third of the total outstanding, meaning that the offering established a market value for the company of around $400 million. To put it another way, the market was saying that Schwab was worth more than twice what its executives had paid BankAmerica to buy it back the previous March. The $16.50 share price also meant that Schwab stock sold at a p/e ratio of 15, significantly higher than other brokerage stocks. Although the offering prospectus had been full of cautionary notes, investors—many of them Schwab’s own customers—had been undeterred. On the contrary, demand for the stock had been so strong that Schwab had been able to offer more stock, and at a higher price, than originally planned. And, of course, the deal made Chuck Schwab and his immediate circle of executives instant multimillionaires. Schwab, who had put up $9 million during the buyout for a little less than a third of the company, was worth well over $100 million after the stock offering. And the timing of the deal! In hindsight, that was the most spectacular part of all. On September 22, the Dow Jones average opened at 2492.82. That was more than 200 points below its late-August peak,4 though no one yet knew for sure that the bull market had ended. Wall Street was describing the month-long skid as a “sell-off” or a “correction”—a temporary phenomenon in any case. On the very day Schwab chose to sell stock to the public, hope was suddenly renewed when the market did an abrupt about-face, and rose an unheard-of seventy-five points. Thus did Schwab sell its shares into the biggest one-day gain in… ([Location 7029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=7029))

- been the slightest hitch along the way the deal would never have taken place. The crash would have wiped the offering off the table, and Schwab would have been back in his familiar position of having to scramble for capital. And that’s the best-case scenario. A far more plausible scenario is that, had the offering not taken place, the entire company would have been wiped off the table, or at least swallowed up by someone bigger and better capitalized. So, yes, Chuck Schwab had very good instincts.

- Once upon a time, there might have been some chortling about the apparent end of the bull market, as Main Street sat back and waited for Wall Street to get its comeuppance. But the divide between Main Street and Wall Street was too narrow now for that kind of smugness: Main Street’s money was now so commingled with Wall Street’s that anything hurting the latter would also hurt the former. That was one of the logical consequences of bringing Wall Street to Main Street. ([Location 7069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=7069))

- Far more than the late orders, however, Schwab had been hurt for another reason: it had allowed a small number of customers to trade so-called naked options, which are an extremely dangerous form of stock speculation. This too was part of losing control. No command decision had even been made about option trading; it was just one of those things that seemed to have happened at Schwab when no one was paying much attention.* In fact, a single customer, based in Hong Kong and conducting his business through Schwab’s small Hong Kong branch, was responsible for $13 million of the $22 million loss. The customer’s account had grown so large that on Black Monday he had margin calls of $124 million. Although the customer’s name was not divulged, the magnitude of Schwab’s error was clear to everyone at the press conference. “That someone was not aware of the potential for this kind of swing was just unforgivable,” a brokerage source later told the Wall Street Journal, and Schwab himself pretty much conceded the point.

Thanks to its miraculously timed public offering, this was quite true. ([Location 7172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=7172))

- By October 1987, his main strategy was to short “put” options. Since a put option is a bet that the market is going down, Wang, in effect, was betting against the speculators who were betting against the market. What he was doing, of course, was gambling, in the highest stakes game he could find. Obviously, if you spent most of the bull market shorting put options, you made a lot of money. Wang did indeed make a lot of money—possibly as much as $100 million. It’s equally obvious, though, that if you continued shorting put options through August and ([Location 7210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=7210))

- September 1987, when the market was making its jagged trip downward—and Wang had consolidated all his trading with Schwab—your losing days would far outnumber your winning days. This was also true of Wang. Yet right up until the crash, he always met his margin calls—met them promptly and without complaint. The week before Black Monday, he had wired $10 million to Schwab in response to a margin call. One suspects that if Schwab officials had taken the time to focus on the sheer size of the account, they would have realized that Wang was a disaster waiting to happen. But they never got around to focusing on the account, in part because the firm lacked the kind of controls that would have alerted the executives to the danger lurking in Hong Kong. But they also missed it because disaster hadn’t happened. The warning bells that a missed margin call would have triggered never went off.

- Options work much like commodities, acting essentially to bind a customer to a promise to buy or sell an underlying stock, or basket of stocks, at a later date. To put it another way, an option is a bet on the future price of a stock, or on the direction of the market itself. What makes it so dangerous is that options traders put up very little of the purchase price at the time they buy their option; in the case of a “naked” option, they put up no money at all. Should the market suddenly turn against them, the margin calls can be enormous. And should the customer be unable to meet the margin call, then the responsibility for paying up falls on the brokerage firm that sold him the option in the first place.

- There are exceptions to every rule, and to the rule that those companies aligned with the money revolution did better after the crash than those that weren’t, the exception was Schwab. To be sure, Schwab’s postcrash life wasn’t as grim as the struggle endured by many of the full-service wire-houses, but it was far more trying than the relatively pain-free experience of the mutual fund companies. What Schwab’s ordeal probably proved was that in the face of hard times, vision and foresight—which Schwab demonstrably had—needs to be accompanied by competent management—which Schwab demonstrably lacked. Schwab suffered not because it hadn’t grabbed onto the money revolution with sufficient fervor, but because it had performed miserably in the crash.

- who doesn’t at least try to keep pace with inflation can be hurt badly. But a decade later, the situation was completely reversed: now it was low interest rates and low inflation rates that were going hand in hand. Now, while your money market fund was yielding 3 percent, the inflation rate was still below the fund’s return. As a result, real interest rates in the 1990s were somewhere in the range of 1.5 percent. To put it another way: real interest rates in the 1990s were almost exactly what they had been during the Age of Inflation. This is what people missed as they hunted so frantically for higher yields in the 1990s. And that’s why, when the bond market did finally turn in early 1994, people got hurt. Many of them lost money they had viewed as “savings.” By the end of the first quarter, the typical municipal bond fund had dropped almost 6 percent—a “debacle,” The New York Times called it. That’s where chasing yield could lead sometimes: it could lead to losses. This was something people had understood implicitly but were now having to deal with rather explicitly. Not surprisingly, assets began to flow back into money market funds. ([Location 7912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AYIDT74&location=7912))
