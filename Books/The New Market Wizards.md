## Highlights
- Here’s what I believe: The markets are not random. I don’t care if the number of academicians who have argued the efficient market hypothesis would stretch to the moon and back if laid end to end; they are simply wrong. The markets are not random, because they are based on human behavior, and human behavior, especially mass behavior, is not random. It never has been, and it probably never will be. There is no holy grail or grand secret to the markets, but there are many patterns that can lead to profits. There are a million ways to make money in markets. The irony is that they are all very difficult to find. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=86))

- The markets are always changing, and they are always the same. The secret to success in the markets lies not in discovering some incredible indicator or elaborate theory; rather, it lies within each individual. To excel in trading requires a combination of talent and extremely hard work—(surprise!) the same combination required for excellence in any field. Those seeking success by buying the latest $300 or even $3,000 system, or by following the latest hot tip, will never find the answer because they haven’t yet understood the question. Success in trading is a worthy goal, but it will be worthless if it is not accompanied by success in your life (and I use the word success here without monetary connotation).

- In conducting the interviews for this book and its predecessor, Market Wizards, I became absolutely convinced that winning in the markets is a matter of skill and discipline, not luck. The magnitude and consistency of the winning track records compiled by many of those I interviewed simply defy chance. I believe the Market Wizards provide role models for what it takes to win in the markets. Those seeking quick fortunes should be discouraged at the onset.

- The Jademaster One cold winter morning a young man walks five miles through the snow. He knocks on the Jademaster’s door. The Jademaster answers with a broom in his hand. “Yes?” “I want to learn about Jade.” “Very well then, come in out of the cold.” They sit by the fire sipping hot green tea. The Jademaster presses a green stone deeply into the young man’s hand and begins to talk about tree frogs. After a few minutes, the young man interrupts. “Excuse me, I am here to learn about Jade, not tree frogs.” The Jademaster takes the stone and tells the young man to go home and return in a week. The following week the young man returns. The Jademaster presses another green stone into the young man’s hand and continues the story. Again, the young man interrupts. Again, the Jademaster sends him home. Weeks pass. The young man interrupts less and less. The young man also learns to brew the hot green tea, clean up the kitchen and sweep the floors. Spring comes. One day, the young man observes, “The stone I hold is not genuine Jade.”   I lean back in my chair, savoring the story. My student interrupts. “OK. OK. That’s a great story. I don’t see what it has to do with making money. I come to you to find out about the markets. I want to learn about the bulls and the bears, commodities, stocks, bonds, calls and options. I want to make big money. You tell me a fable about Jade. What is this? You…” “That’s all for now. Leave those price charts on the table. Come back next week.” Months pass. My student interrupts less and less as I continue the story of The Trader’s Window. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=113))

- This was the situation one day when, in reviewing my charts in the afternoon, I found myself with the firm conviction that the British pound was about to collapse. In the previous two weeks, the pound had moved straight down without even a hint of a technical rebound. After this sharp break, in the most recent week, the pound had settled into a narrow, sideways pattern. In my experience, this type of combined price action often leads to another price decline. Markets will often do whatever confounds the most traders. In this type of situation, many traders who have been long realize they have been wrong and are reconciled to liquidating a bad position—not right away, of course, but on the first rebound. Other traders who have been waiting to go short realize that the train may have left without them. They too are waiting for any minor rebound as an opportunity to sell. The simple truth is that most traders cannot stand the thought of selling near a recent low, especially soon after a sharp break. Consequently, with everyone waiting to sell the first rally, the market never rallies. In any case, one look at the chart and I felt convinced this was one of those situations in which the market would never lift its head. Although my strong conviction tempted me to implement a short position, I also felt it was an inappropriate time to resume trading. I looked at my watch.

- There were exactly ten minutes left to the close. I procrastinated. The market closed. That night before leaving work, I felt I had made a mistake. If I was so sure the market was going down, I reasoned, I should have gone short, even if I didn’t want to trade. So I walked over to the twenty-four-hour trading desk and placed an order to go short the British pound in the overnight market. The next morning I came in and the pound was down over 200 points on the opening. I placed a token amount of money into the account and entered a stop order to liquidate the trade if the market returned to my entry level. I rationalized that I was only trading with the market’s money, and since my plan was to cease trading on a return to breakeven, I was not really violating my beliefs against trading with inadequate capital. Thus, I found myself trading once again, despite a desire not to do so. This particular trade provides a good illustration of one of the principles that emerged from my interviews for Market Wizards. Patience was an element that a number of the supertraders stressed as being critical to success. James Rogers said it perhaps most colorfully, “I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime.” In essence, by not wanting to trade, I had inadvertently transformed myself into a master of patience. By forcing myself to wait until there was a trade that appeared so compelling that I could not stand the thought of not taking it, I had vastly improved the odds. During the next few months, I continued to trade and my equity steadily increased, as I seemed to be making mostly correct trading decisions. My account grew from $0 (not counting an initial $4,000 deposit that was quickly withdrawn once profits more than covered margin requirements) to over $25,000. It was at this juncture, while traveling on a business trip, that nearly all my positions turned sour simultaneously. I made some hasty decisions between meetings, virtually all of which proved wrong. Within about a week, I had lost about one-third of my gains. Normally, when I surrender a meaningful percentage of my profits, I put on the brakes, either trading only minimally or ceasing to trade altogether. Instinctively, I seemed to be following the same script on this occasion, as my positions were reduced to minimal levels. At this time, I received a call from my friend Harvey (not his real name). Harvey is a practitioner of Elliott Wave analysis (a complex theory that attempts to explain all market behavior as part of a grand structure of price waves).* Harvey often calls me for my market opinion and in the process can’t resist telling me his. Although I have usually found it to be a mistake to listen to anyone else’s opinions on specific trades, in my experience Harvey had made some very good calls. This time he caught my ear.

- “Listen, Jack,” he said, “you have to sell the British pound!” At the time, the British pound had gone virtually straight up for four months, moving to a one-and-a-half-year high. “Actually,” I replied, “my own projection suggests that we may be only a few cents away from a major top, but I would never sell into a runaway market like this. I’m going to wait until there are some signs of the market topping.” “It will never happen,” Harvey shot back. “This is the fifth of a fifth.” (This is a rerference to the wave structure of prices that will mean something to Elliotticians, as enthusiasts of this methodology are known. As for other readers, any attempt at an explanation is more likely to confuse than enlighten—take my word for it.) “This is the market’s last gasp, it will probably just gap lower on Monday morning and never look back.” (This conversation was taking place on a Friday afternoon with the pound near its highs for the week.) “I really feel sure about this one.” I paused, thinking: I’ve just taken a hit in the markets. Harvey is usually pretty good in his analysis, and this time he seems particularly confident about his call. Maybe I’ll coattail him on just this one trade, and if he’s right, it will be an easy way for me to get back on a winning track. So I said (I still cringe at the recollection), “OK Harvey, I’ll follow you on this trade. But I must tell you that from past experience I’ve found listening to other opinions disastrous. If I get in on your opinion, I’ll have no basis for deciding when to get out of the trade. So understand that my plan is to follow you all the way. I’ll get out when you get out, and you need to let me know when you change your opinion.” Harvey readily agreed. I went short at the market about a half-hour before the close and then watched as prices continued to edge higher, with the pound closing near its high for the week. The following Monday morning, the British pound opened 220 points higher. One of my trading rules is: Never hold a position that gaps sharply against you right after you have put it on. (A gap refers to the market opening sharply higher or lower than the previous close.) The trade seemed wrong. My own instincts were to just get out. However, since I had entered this trade on Harvey’s analysis, I thought it was important to remain consistent. So I called Harvey and said, “This short pound… ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=191))

- Trying to make the best of a bad situation, I related my recent trading experiences to Ed. I explained how I started trading again despite my reluctance to do so and the incredible string of errors I committed on the one British pound trade—errors that I thought I had vanquished years ago. I told him that, ironically, at one point before I put on the British pound trade, when I was still up about $20,000, I was in the market for a new car that cost exactly that amount. Since my house had virtually drained me of assets, I was tempted to cash in the account and use the proceeds to buy the car. It was a very appealing thought since the car would have provided an immediate tangible reward for a few months of good trading without even having risked any of my own funds. “So why didn’t you close the account?” Ed asked. “Well,” I said, “how could I?” Although I managed to turn a few thousand dollars into $100,000 on a couple of occasions, I had always stalled out. I had never been able to really break through and extend it into some serious money. If I had decided to cash in my chips to make a purchase, I would always have wondered whether this would have been the time that I would have realized my trading goals. Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, I would have been much better off taking my profits, but at the time ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=252))

- I couldn’t see giving up the opportunity. I rationally explained all this to Ed. “In other words, the only way you could stop trading was by losing. Is that right?” Ed didn’t have to say anything more. I recalled that in my interview of him for Market Wizards, his most striking comment was: “Everybody gets what they want out of the market.” I had wanted not to be trading, and sure enough that’s what I got. The moral here is: You don’t always have to be in the market. Don’t trade if you don’t feel like it or if trading just doesn’t feel right for whatever reason. To win at the markets you need confidence as well as the desire to trade. I believe the exceptional traders have these two traits most of the time; for the rest of us, they may come together only on an occasional basis. In my own case, I had started out with the confidence but without the desire to trade, and I ended up with neither. The next time I start trading, I plan to have both.

- “Missing an opportunity is as bad as being on the wrong side of a trade,” he said. During our second interview, Lipschutz wanted to short the Deutsche mark and was waiting for a small bounce to sell. When noticing that the mark had started to move lower instead, he said, “It looks like I’m going to miss the trade.” “That sounds just like last week when you missed getting long the Australian dollar by using a limit order,” I said. “If you feel that strongly,” I asked, “why don’t you just sell the Deutsche mark at the market?” “What! And pay the bid/ask spread?” Bill exclaimed. I wasn’t sure whether he was serious or joking—or perhaps some combination of the two. (Incidentally, the Deutsche mark kept going lower.)

- Is having contacts important in order to be plugged into the news?   Absolutely. Those of us who did well were generally the ones who were accepted by the interbank circle. The traders who stayed aloof tended to be the ones who couldn’t make any money trading foreign exchange. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=588))

- Were you trading off of this information flow?   That’s what foreign exchange trading is all about. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=595))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Can you give me a recent example of how information flow helps in trading?   At the time the Berlin Wall came down, the general market sentiment was that everyone would want to get money into East Germany on the ground floor. The basic assumption was that large capital flows into Eastern Europe would most directly benefit the Deutsche mark. After a while, the realization set in that it was going to take a lot longer to absorb East Germany into a unified Germany. How does that shift in attitude come about? Kohl makes a statement; Baker makes a comment; statistics reveal very high East German unemployment. The East Germans, who have lived all their life under a socialist system, begin saying, “We don’t want to work as hard as those West Germans, and by the way, how come the state is not paying for our medical bills anymore?” The investment community begins to realize that the rebuilding of Eastern Europe is going to be a long haul. As this thinking becomes more prevalent, people start moving capital out of the Deutsche mark.   You could have made all those same arguments when the wall first came down.   I don’t think many people saw it that way at the time, and even if they did, that’s not important. What is important is to assess what the market is focusing on at the given moment.   And the way you get that information is by talking to lots of participants in the foreign exchange market?   Yes. Not everyone is going to interpret things in the same way, at the same time, as you do, and it’s important to understand that. You need to be plugged into the news and to know what the market is looking at. For example, one day the foreign exchange market may be focusing on interest rate differentials; the next day the market may be looking at the potential for capital appreciation, which is exactly the opposite. [A focus on interest rate differentials implies that investors will shift their money to the industrialized countries with the highest interest rate yields, whereas a focus on capital appreciation implies that investors will place their money in the countries with the strongest economic and political outlooks, which usually happen to be the countries with lower interest rates.] ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=597))

- He had been trading a market that had gone into a narrow range, and trading activity had dried up. During this period, a lot of stops had built up right above this trading range. One day, this trader’s clerk on the floor calls and says, “Listen, the talk is that tomorrow [a day on which the liquidity was expected to be substantially below normal because of a holiday affecting the cash market] they’re going to gun for the stops above the market.” At that point, the stops were relatively close—about 40 or 50 ticks higher. The next day, this trader’s plan is to sell the market heavily once the stops are hit, because he believes such a rally would be artificial and that the market would be vulnerable to a subsequent sell-off. During the morning, the market trades sideways and nothing happens. Then around 1 P.M., prices start to move—down.   You did say that the stops were above the market?   That’s right. Anyway, the market moves down 50 points, 100 points, and within a few minutes the market is down over 200 points. What happened was that the floor traders went for the stops below the market, which were 200 points away, instead of the stops above the market, which were only 50 points away. The reason was that everybody was ready for the rally to take out the stops on the upside. Therefore, everyone was long, and the direction of greatest price vulnerability was on the downside. During the sharp break, my friend realizes that the market is way overextended on the downside. He screams at his clerks, “Buy ’em! Buy any amount they’ll sell you. Just buy ’em!” He was bidding for hundreds of contracts between 100 and 200 points lower, and he was only filled on fifty, even though the market traded down over 200 points, with a couple thousand lots trading at those levels.   What happened to his bid?   You’ve obviously never traded on the floor of an exchange. In a trading pit, it’s possible for the market to trade at several different prices at the same moment during periods of rapid movement. They were looking right past my friend’s floor brokers, who were bidding higher. It was a fast market. [When an exchange designates “fast market” conditions, floor brokers can’t be held for failing to fill orders that were within the day’s traded price range.] A fast market gives the floor brokers a special license to steal, above and beyond their normal license to steal.

- [If two countries have different interest rates, forward months of the currency with lower rates will invariably trade at a premium to the spot currency rate. If such a premium did not exist, it would be possible to borrow funds in the country with lower rates, convert and invest the proceeds in the country with higher rates, and buy forward currency positions in the currency with lower interest rates to hedge against the currency risk. The participation of interest rate arbitrageurs assures that the forward premiums for the currency with lower interest rates will be exactly large enough to offset the interest rate differential between the two countries.] ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=745))

- On the subject of risk control, how do you handle a losing streak?   When you’re in a losing streak, your ability to properly assimilate and analyze information starts to become distorted because of the impairment of the confidence factor, which is a by-product of a losing streak. You have to work very hard to restore that confidence, and cutting back trading size helps achieve that goal.

- How does your current trading for your own management firm differ from your trading at Salomon?   At the moment, I’m trading a lot smaller than at Salomon, which is a disadvantage.   How is large size an advantage?   You’re kidding.   No, I’m serious.   If a big buyer comes in and pushes the market 4 percent, that’s an advantage.   He still has to get out of that position. Unless he’s right about the market, it doesn’t seem like large size would be an advantage. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1048))

- Do you believe your scaling type of approach in entering and exiting positions is an essential element in your overall trading success?   I think it has enabled me to stay with long-term winners much longer than I’ve seen most traders stay with their positions. I don’t have a problem letting my profits run, which many traders do. You have to be able to let your profits run. I don’t think you can consistently be a winning trader if you’re banking on being right more than 50 percent of the time. You have to figure out how to make money being right only 20 to 30 percent of the time. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1096))

- Let me ask you the converse of the question I asked you before: Let’s say that the dollar started to go up—that is, in favor of the direction of your trade—but the fundamentals that provided your original premise for the trade had changed. Do you still hold the position because the market is moving in your favor, or do you get out because your fundamental analysis has changed?   I would definitely get out. If my perception that the fundamentals have changed is not the market’s perception, then there’s something going on that I don’t understand. You don’t want to hold a position when you don’t understand what’s going on. That doesn’t make any sense. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1102))
    - Tags: [[post trade stratefy]] 
- Generally speaking, I don’t think good traders make gut or snap decisions—certainly not traders who last very long. For myself, any trade idea must be well thought out and grounded in reason before I take the position. There are a host of reasons that preclude a trader from making a trade on a gut decision. For example, before I put on a trade, I always ask myself, “If this trade goes wrong, how do I get out?” That type of question becomes much more germane when you’re trading large position sizes. Another important consideration is the evaluation of the best way to express a trade idea. Since I usually tend not to put on a straight long or short position, I have to give a lot of thought as to what particular option combination will provide the most attractive return/risk profile, given my market expectations. All of these considerations, by definition, preclude gut decisions. Having said this, there are instances when, despite all my planning, trading decisions are made that might best be described as instinctive.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- How do you gauge when a panic has run its course?   I think it’s a combination of market experience and innate feel. Many currency traders operate under rules that if they lose a certain amount of money, they must liquidate the position. Those are not the type of decisions that are made rationally given the specific situation at a given moment; rather, they are general rules that have been established previously. How do you decide when that type of last-ditch selling is nearly exhausted? It’s probably largely a matter of past experience that has suffused your subconscious. In this sense, what people describe as gut feel is probably better described as subconscious market experience.

- What do you believe are the characteristics of the truly superior traders?   Let me start with an analogy. When I was in college, my impression was that people who were really smart could do very well, even if they didn’t work that hard, and people who really worked hard could also do very well, even if they weren’t outstandingly bright. In contrast, in trading, I think you need both elements. The best traders I know are really quite brilliant, and they all work very hard—much harder than anyone else. By the way, when I talk about working hard, I mean commitment and focus; it has nothing to do with how many hours you spend in the office. These traders have tremendous commitment to the markets—to their craft, so to speak. They develop scenarios, reevaluate scenarios, collect information, and reevaluate that information. They constantly ask themselves: What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong? How can I do what I am doing better? How can I get more information? It’s obsessive.   Is this type of analysis something that’s ongoing during all your waking hours?   Absolutely. Some professional traders may claim that they separate their personal life from their business life and are able to completely turn off on the weekends. I don’t believe that for a second. I think that when they’re relaxing in their sailboats, at some level they’re still focused on the market.   I know you like to play golf. When you’re out on the course, are you still thinking about the markets? ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1277))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Probably so. The really best traders around don’t think twice about how many hours they’re working or whether they come in on a weekend. There’s no substitute for that level of commitment.   When you’re interviewing someone for a job as a trader, how do you determine whether they have that type of commitment?   Sometimes it’s obvious. For example, in an interview someone might ask you, “What time do I have to come to work in the morning?” In my opinion that’s a very bizarre question. Come in whatever time you believe is appropriate. “How late do I have to stay in the afternoon?” Leave whenever you want. I’m not going to tell someone when to come in and when to leave.   Besides intelligence and extreme commitment, are there any other qualities that you believe are important to excel as a trader?   Courage. It’s not enough to simply have the insight to see something apart from the rest of the crowd, you also need to have the courage to act on it and to stay with it. It’s very difficult to be different from the rest of the crowd the majority of the time, which by definition is what you’re doing if you’re a successful trader. Many people think that trading can be reduced to a few rules. Always do this or always do that. To me, trading isn’t about always at all; it is about each situation. So many people want the positive rewards of being a successful trader without being willing to go through the commitment and pain. And there’s a lot of pain.   The pain being what?   You give up a lot of things. It’s all tradeoffs. It’s the middle of the night, everyone else is asleep, and you’re sitting in front of a machine with glowing green numbers, with a pain in your psyche because the market is going against you and you don’t know whether the fundamentals have changed or whether it’s just a meaningless short-term move. Those are very trying times.   Trading is such a pervasive element in your life, including being up half the night on a regular basis. Does this obsession, as you yourself termed it a little earlier, create a source of friction in your married life?   Not at all. My wife was a bond salesman at Goldman Sachs for many years. Personally, I think she would make a very good… ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1293))

- Another lesson to be learned from this interview is that if you have a strong conviction about a trade and the market has a large move because of a news event, the best decision may well be to bite the bullet and buy on extreme strength (or sell on extreme weakness). A perfect example of this concept was provided by the way the trader in Lipschutz’s group handled trading the market following the G-7 meeting. In Market Wizards, Marty Schwartz made the observation that if a trade that you are very worried about does not turn out as badly as feared, don’t get out. The rationale is that if there is no follow-through in a direction adverse to your position, then there must be some very strong underlying forces in favor of the direction of the original position (since the reasons—fundamental or technical—for your own fears are probably shared by many others in the marketplace).

- One item I found particularly curious was that, after more than four years of steady trading gains in his stock option account, Lipschutz lost virtually the entire amount in a few days’ time. Ironically, this loss coincided with his start of full employment at Salomon Brothers. Interestingly, as expressed in the interview, he had strong feelings against simultaneously trading personal and company accounts. The demise of his own account, therefore, played neatly into avoiding any potential source of conflict. In our conversation, Lipschutz insisted that the loss was probably coincidental since he was only in the training class and not yet aware of any potential conflict. Despite Lipschutz’s denial, I couldn’t help but be reminded of the provocative aphorism: “Everybody gets what they want out of the market.”* I wondered whether Lipschutz’s subconscious was perhaps a bit more foresightful than he realized. In any case, the timing of this large loss and its relative uniqueness in Lipschutz’s trading career does seem somewhat ironic. Whether this interpretation is strained conjecture or fact, one thing is certain: Lipschutz did indeed get what he wanted—a perfect job, huge trading profits, and an absence of conflict between his personal and company trading.

- I read your other book [Market Wizards]. There are traders you interviewed whom I respect tremendously. Many of them talked about their early experiences of going broke two or three times before they made it. I didn’t have that experience. I don’t want to sound arrogant, but I was successful at trading right from the start. The trade that was a turning point for me was the one that took me from being a twenty-to-forty-lot trader to trading hundreds of contracts. In 1976, the British government announced that they weren’t going to allow the pound to trade above $1.72. They were concerned that the pound’s strength would lead to increased imports. At the time, the pound was trading in the mid-160s. To my surprise, the market responded to the announcement by immediately going to $1.72. The pound then fell back to $1.68 and rebounded again up to $1.72. Every time it reached $1.72, it fell back, but by smaller and smaller amounts each time. The price range steadily converged until the pound was trading narrowly just below the $1.72 level. Most of the people I knew said, “They’re not going to let it go above $1.72. We might as well sell it. It’s a no-risk trade.” I saw it differently. To me, the market looked like it was locked limit-up. [In many futures markets, the maximum daily price change is restricted by a specified limit. “Limit-up” refers to a price rise of this magnitude. When the market’s natural equilibrium price lies above this limit price, the market will lock at the limit—that is, trading will virtually cease. The reason for this is that there will be an abundance of buyers but almost no sellers at the restricted limit-up price.] I felt that if the government announced that they weren’t going to let the price go above a certain level and the market didn’t break, it indicated that there must be tremendous underlying demand. I thought to myself, “This could be the opportunity of a lifetime.” Up to that point in time, the largest position I had ever taken was thirty or forty contracts. I went long two hundred British pound contracts. Although intellectually I was convinced that I was right, I was scared to death because the position was so much larger than what I had been trading. In those days, there was no Reuters or similar service providing cash market quotes in the currencies. I was so nervous about my position that I woke up at five o’clock each morning and called the Bank of England to get a quote. I would mutter something about being a trader from CitiBank or Harris Trust and needing a quote quickly.

By that time, I had gotten my brother and a number of my friends into the trade, and I was so excited that I called all of them with the news. I was so confident that I even bought some more contracts for myself.

- How do you define the “easy part”?   It’s the meat of the move. The beginning of a price move is usually hard to trade because you’re not sure whether you’re right about the direction of the trend. The end is hard because people start taking profits and the market gets very choppy. The middle of the move is what I call the easy part.   In other words, the markets you’re least interested in are the tops and bottoms.   Right. I never try to buy a bottom or sell a top. Even if you manage to pick the bottom, the market can end up sitting there for years and tying up your capital. You don’t want to have a position before a move has started. You want to wait until the move is already under way before you get into the market.   Do you see that as a mistake that many traders make, spending too much effort trying to pick tops and bottoms?   Absolutely. They try to put their own opinion of what will happen before the market action. ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=1731))

- In catastrophic situations, when a surprise news event causes futures to lock at the daily limit and the cash market to immediately move the equivalent of several limit days in futures, do you find that you’re generally better off getting out right away, as opposed to taking your chances by waiting until the futures market trades freely?   There’s a principle I follow that never allows me to even make that decision. When I get hurt in the market, I get the hell out. It doesn’t matter at all where the market is trading. I just get out, because I believe that once you’re hurt in the market, your decisions are going to be far less objective than they are when you’re doing well. And if the market had rallied 1,800 points that day to close higher, I couldn’t have cared less.

Once you can figure that out, you can become more selective in your trading and avoid those trades that are more likely to be losers.   What other advice would you have for traders?   The most important advice is to never let a loser get out of hand. You want to be sure that you can be wrong twenty or thirty times in a row and still have money in your account. When I trade, I’ll risk perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the money in my account. If I lose on that trade, no matter how strongly I feel, on my next trade I’ll risk no more than about 4 percent of my account. If I lose again, I’ll drop the trading size down to about 2 percent.

My own experience in this regard is detailed in the final section of this book. In a more general sense, it is remarkably common for traders to adopt methods entirely unsuited to their personalities. There are traders who are good at system development but end up consistently overriding and interfering with their own systems, with disastrous results. There are traders who are naturally inclined toward developing long-term strategies but end up instead trading short term because of impatience or a compulsion to “do something.” There are naturally born floor traders with great intuitive skills who abandon their environment of expertise and become mediocre portfolio managers. And there are theoretically oriented individuals who develop intricate, low-risk arbitrage strategies but then decide to become position traders—an approach that may require a degree of risk acceptance far beyond their comfort levels in order to be applied successfully. In all the above cases, individuals with a natural bent for one style of trading end up utilizing a diametrically opposite style, usually to fulfill some emotional need.

- As a former Ph.D. candidate in mathematics, did you miss the intellectual challenge in what you were doing?   Initially, yes. But I eventually got into serious research on prices, and that was as tough a problem as anything I ever came across in academia.   Were any of the areas you studied in mathematics applicable to developing trading systems?   Certainly—statistics. The analysis of commodity markets is prone to pitfalls in classical statistical inference, and if one uses these tools without having a good foundational understanding, it’s easy to get into trouble. Most classical applications of statistics are based on the key assumption that the data distribution is normal, or some other known form. Classical statistics work well and allow you to draw precise conclusions if you’re correct in your assumption of the data distribution. However, if your distribution assumptions are even a little bit off, the error is enough to derail the delicate statistical estimators, and cruder, robust estimators will yield more accurate results. In general, the delicate tests that statisticians use to squeeze significance out of marginal data have no place in trading. We need blunt statistical instruments, robust techniques.   Could you define what you mean by “robust”? ([Location 2094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=2094))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A robust statistical estimator is one that is not perturbed much by mistaken assumptions about the nature of the distribution.   Why do you feel such techniques are more appropriate for trading system analysis?   Because I believe that price distributions are pathological.   In what way?   As one example, price distributions have more variance [a statistical measure of the variability in the data] than one would expect on the basis of normal distribution theory. Benoit Mandelbrot, the originator of the concept of fractional dimension, has conjectured that price change distributions actually have infinite variance. The sample variance [i.e., the implied variability in prices] just gets larger and larger as you add more data. If this is true, then most standard statistical techniques are invalid for price data applications.   I don’t understand. How can the variance be infinite?   A simple example can illustrate how a distribution can have an infinite mean. (By the way, a variance is a mean—it’s the mean of the squares of the deviations from another mean.) Consider a simple, one-dimensional random walk generated, say, by the tosses of a fair coin.

- interested in the average waiting time between successive equalizations of heads and tails—that is, the average number of tosses between successive ties in the totals for heads and tails. Typically, if we sample this process, we find that the waiting time between ties tends to be short. This is hardly surprising. Since we always start from a tie situation in measuring the waiting time, another tie is usually not far away. However, sometimes, either heads or tails gets far ahead, albeit rarely, and then we may have to wait an enormous amount of time for another tie, especially since additional tosses are just as likely to increase this discrepancy as to lessen it. Thus, our sample will tend to consist of a lot of relatively short waiting times and a few disquietingly large outliers. What’s the average? Remarkably, this distribution has no average, or you can say the average is infinite. At any given stage, your sample average will be finite, of course, but as you gather more sample data, the average will creep up inexorably. If you draw enough sample data, you can make the average in your sample as large as you want.   In the coin toss example you just provided, computer simulations make it possible to generate huge data samples that allow you to conclude that the mean has… ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=2122))

We witnessed one example in the one-day, 8,000-point drop in the S&P on October 19, 1987.

- Do you use chart patterns in your systems?   Most things that look good on a chart—say, 98 percent—don’t work.   Why is that?   The human mind was made to create patterns. It will see patterns in random data. A turn-of-the-century statistics book put it this way: “Too fine an eye for pattern will find it anywhere.” In other words, you’re going to see more on the chart than is truly there. Also, we don’t look at data neutrally—that is, when the human eye scans a chart, it doesn’t give all data points equal weight. Instead, it will tend to focus on certain outstanding cases, and we tend to form our opinions on the basis of these special cases. It’s human nature to pick out the stunning successes of a method and to overlook the day-in, day-out losses that grind you down to the bone. Thus, even a fairly careful perusal of the charts is prone to leave the researcher with the idea that the system is a lot better than it really is. Even if you carry it a step further by doing careful hand research, there is still a strong tendency to bias the results. In fact, this bias exists in all scientific research, which is why they have persnickety double-blind tests. Even the most honest researcher will tend to bias data toward his or her hypothesis. It can’t be helped. When I did research by hand, I took the attitude that I had to discount my results by 20 to 50 percent.

- I remember one time when I was on a flight from San Francisco to New York, I had a new system idea that I was excited about and wanted to test preliminarily off the charts. The system involved using a conventional indicator (stochastics, I believe) in an unconventional way. I tried the system on several different markets, and it seemed to do terrifically. When I eventually had the system computer tested, I discovered that it actually lost money. What happened was that my alignment between the indicator on the bottom of the chart and the price on top was off by a day or so. Since the signals tended to come during periods of rapid price movement, being off by one day could mean the difference between being on the wrong side of the market for a 500-point move (say, in a market such as the S&P) instead of on the right side—a 1,000-point ($5,000 in the S&P) difference altogether. So what had actually looked like a great system proved to be totally worthless. Ever since then, I’ve been very cautious about drawing any conclusions from hand testing. I now wait until the computer results are in.   The desire to find patterns is the same human quirk that convinces people that there is validity in superstitions, or astrology, or fortune tellers. The successes are much more startling than the failures. You remember the times when the oracle really hit the nail on the head, and you tend to forget the cases in which the prediction was ambiguous or wrong.   Your comments basically seem to imply that chart reading is just laden with pitfalls and unfounded assumptions.

Every pattern recognition chart trader I know makes the trades he really likes larger than the trades he doesn’t like as much. In general, that’s not a good idea. You shouldn’t be investing yourself in the individual trades at all. And it’s certainly wrong to invest yourself more in some trades than others. Also, if you think you’re creating the profitable situation by having an eye for charts, it’s very difficult not to feel excessively responsible if the trade doesn’t work.   Which, I assume, is bad.   Yes, it’s very destabilizing.   Whereas if you have a mechanical system, that’s not a problem.   That’s right.

- When I have an idea based on a chart pattern, I try to reduce it to an algorithm that I can test on a computer. If a method is truly valid, you should be able to explain it to a computer. Even if you can’t define it precisely, you should still be able to concoct an algorithm that approximately describes the pattern. If your algorithm gives you an expected gain near zero—as is typically the case—then don’t delude yourself into believing that the pattern has validity that depends on some indescribable interpretation you bring to it.   In other words, the computer doesn’t lie; believe it rather than your intuitive notions of a pattern’s reliability.   Yes, because, as I mentioned before, the human mind will tend to find patterns where none exist.   Do you follow your systems absolutely, or do you sometimes intervene?   At this stage of the game, computer trading systems are rote algorithms. They may be complex, but they are still simpleminded. Any system that I know of, if traded at a level that is large enough, will occasionally stray into overly risky terrain. Of course, this vulnerability can be avoided by trading too small—that is, scaling to the worst cases—but that is a costly solution in terms of overall performance. It’s better to trade at a reasonable level, and when you find yourself with too much exposure, override your system and cut back. Also, a good system will occasionally direct you to do something stupid. In such cases, your own judgment is vital. Generally speaking, however, if your system is any good, don’t override it, except when it’s clearly violating the intentions of its design. Don’t get into the habit of finagling the system day in and day out. Save your ingenuity and creativity for research.   Can you give me an example of a system violating the intentions of its design?   On the day of the stock market crash [October 19, 1987], I was short S&Ps, and I was also short Eurodollars. At the close, the S&Ps were down 8,000 points, but the Eurodollars were down only 5 points.

- If you find yourself repeatedly running into a certain kind of problem, or if you find a structural flaw in the system, then it’s time to change the system. But you shouldn’t change it every time it does something you don’t like. No system of reasonable algorithmic complexity is going to behave according to the intentions of the designer under all constellations of circumstances. A designer cannot anticipate all possible situations. Even if he could, it would be unwise to add a degree of freedom to the system for something that happens less than once a year.   Any other examples of overriding your system that stick in your mind?   Yes, around the time of the Gulf War. This was a completely unprecedented situation. We had never before had a war by deadline. My instinct was to not trade, but I had other concerns. I take the point of view that missing an important trade is a much more serious error than making a bad trade. In any worthwhile system, you have all kinds of backups to protect you (that is, to assure that you get out) when you take a bad trade. On the other hand, typically, if you miss a good trade, you have nothing to protect you—that is, nothing in the system will assure that you eventually get in.

Such willfully missed opportunities hurt more than losses.   On balance, have you found that your intervention has helped or hindered your performance?   I had the experience of simultaneously trading for myself, which is what I’ve done for most of my career, and also managing an account for an associate, which I traded exclusively on a mechanical system. Although the performance in my account was good, the account trading entirely on the mechanical system definitely did better. I had known that a good system would outperform me in a windfall year, but I thought I could outperform the system in a mediocre year.

- In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of money being managed by professional traders using computerized, trend-following strategies. Will this proliferation eventually kill the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg?   The question of whether the preponderance of system traders, especially the group of large managers, is spoiling systems trading is difficult to answer because there are two very different kinds of evidence that yield opposite conclusions. First there is the quantitative statistical evidence that systems continue to work. Then there is the qualitative argument that a preponderance of system traders has to change the market in such a way that profit can no longer be extracted in this manner. In other words, the random walk theorists may still have the last ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=2470))

- Well, both arguments can’t be right. Which do you believe?   System traders still have an important old ally: human nature. Human nature has not changed. Fortunately, there are still a lot of people trading on their instincts. But there’s no question that the game has become much more difficult. In evolutionary biology, one of the proposed solutions to the question of why sexual (as opposed to asexual) reproduction is so abundant is the Red Queen Hypothesis, based on the character in Alice in Wonderland in whose country you had to run as fast as you could just to stay in place. The idea is that competition is so severe that a species has to evolve as fast as it can just to stay where it is; sexual reproduction provides a kind of evolutionary overdrive. Similarly, there is such strong competition in the systems trading niche that the trader has to develop systems as fast as he or she can to merely stay in place.

- How much do you risk on a single trade? Do you have a formula you go by?   You shouldn’t plan to risk more than 2 percent on a trade. Although, of course, you could still lose more if the market gaps beyond your intended exit point. On the subject of bet size, if you plot performance against position size, you get a graph that resembles one of those rightward-facing, high-foreheaded cartoon whales. The left side of the graph, corresponding to relatively small position size, is nearly linear; in this range an increase in trading size yields a proportionate increase in performance. But as you increase size beyond this range, the upward slope flattens out; this is because increasingly large drawdowns, which force you to trade smaller, inhibit your ability to come back after strings of losses. The theoretical optimum is reached right about where the whale’s blow-hole would be. To the right of this optimum, the graph plummets; an average position size only modestly larger than the theoretical optimum gives a negative performance. Trading size is one aspect you don’t want to optimize. The optimum comes just before the precipice. Instead, your trading size should lie at the high end of the range in which the graph is still nearly straight.   How important is intelligence in trading?   I haven’t seen much correlation between good trading and intelligence. Some outstanding traders are quite intelligent, but a few aren’t. Many outstandingly intelligent people are horrible traders. Average intelligence is enough. Beyond that, emotional makeup is more important   I assume you were probably involved in developing the systems that were taught to the Turtles.

- statistics will take care of future profitability. Two of the cardinal sins of trading—giving losses too much rope and taking profits prematurely—are both attempts to make current positions more likely to succeed, to the severe detriment of long-term performance.   Having seen people who have survived as traders and those who haven’t, what do you think are the characteristics that differentiate these two groups?   The people who survive avoid snowball scenarios in which bad trades cause them to become emotionally destabilized and make more bad trades. They are also able to feel the pain of losing. If you don’t feel the pain of a loss, then you’re in the same position as those unfortunate people who have no pain sensors. If they leave their hand on a hot stove, it will burn off. There is no way to survive in this world without pain. Similarly, in the markets, if the losses don’t hurt, your financial survival is tenuous. I know of a few multimillionaires who started trading with inherited wealth. In each case, they lost it all because they didn’t feel the pain when they were losing. In those formative first few years of trading, they felt they could afford to lose. You’re much better off going into the market on a shoestring, feeling that you can’t afford to lose. I’d rather bet on somebody starting out with a few thousand dollars than on somebody who came in with millions.

I think it’s important not to be emotionally attached to large profits. I’ve certainly made some of my worst trades after long periods of winning. When you’re on a big winning streak, there’s a temptation to think that you’re doing something special, which will allow you to continue to propel yourself upward. You start to think that you can afford to make shoddy decisions. You can imagine what happens next. As a general rule, losses make you strong and profits make you weak.

- with only hundreds of dollars and ended up making hundreds of millions in less than two decades—that’s quite motivating. If you’re playing for the emotional satisfaction, you’re bound to lose, because what feels good is often the wrong thing to do. Richard Dennis used to say, somewhat facetiously, “If it feels good, don’t do it.” In fact, one rule we taught the Turtles was: When all the criteria are in balance, do the thing you least want to do. You have to decide early on whether you’re playing for the fun or for the success. Whether you measure it in money or in some other way, to win at trading you have to be playing for the success. Trading is also highly addictive. When behavioral psychologists have compared the relative addictiveness of various reinforcement schedules, they found that intermittent reinforcement—positive and negative dispensed randomly (for example, the rat doesn’t know whether it will get pleasure or pain when it hits the bar)—is the most addictive alternative of all, more addictive than positive reinforcement only. Intermittent reinforcement describes the experience of the compulsive gambler as well as the futures trader. The difference is that, just perhaps, the trader can make money. However, as with most of the “affective” aspects of commodity trading, its addictiveness constantly threatens ruin. Addictiveness is the reason why so many players who make fortunes leave the game broke. ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=2632))

What kind of lessons is the tutor teaching?   Since most small to moderate profits tend to vanish, the market teaches you to cash them in before they get away. Since the market spends more time in consolidations than in trends, it teaches you to buy dips and sell rallies.

- A basic theme that runs through Eckhardt’s comments is that what feels good is usually the wrong thing to do. As one example, decision theorists have demonstrated that people consistently prefer to lock in a sure win rather than accept a gamble with a higher expected payoff. They also prefer to gamble with a loss, even when the bet has a worse expected outcome than a sure loss alternative. These instinctive preferences run counter to perhaps the most fundamental principle of successful trading: Cut your losses short and let your profits run. Just because this aphorism has become a cliché makes it no less valid. Another example of counterproductive instincts is what Eckhardt terms “the call of the countertrend.” Selling on strength and buying on weakness appeals to people’s desire to buy cheap and sell dear. While such trades may feel better at the moment of implementation, following a countertrend strategy is almost inevitably doomed to failure. (This contention does not, however, imply that the reverse strategy—trend following—is assured success, since both approaches incur transaction costs.) Traders’ excessive concern regarding their current positions involves yet another example of the detrimental impact of gravitating toward comfortable actions. Taking profits before intended objectives are reached so that the market won’t take away the gains, holding positions beyond intended loss liquidation points in the hopes that the market is only witnessing a retracement, and liquidating positions before stop-loss points are reached because of the fear of losing are all examples of actions intended to make current positions feel better. However, all of these actions are likely to negatively impact long-term performance.

Eckhardt’s advice is that system designers should believe their results only after they have done everything possible to disprove them. Eckhardt proposes that the tendency to do what is comfortable will actually lead most people to experience even worse than random results in the markets. In effect, he is saying that most people don’t lose simply because they lack the skill to do better than random but also because natural human traits entice them into behavioral patterns that will actually lead to worse than random results—a particularly compelling observation.

Although I hesitate to use gambling as an example, I believe it provides a close analogy. Those people who are wise and prudent gamblers would probably also be wise and prudent investors, because they have a somewhat detached view of the value of money.

- The example of a common stop point you mentioned earlier—the area right beyond a prior high or low—is kind of obvious. Are there any other less obvious examples of popular stop points?   Round numbers. For instance, when the Dow Jones starts creeping up toward 3,000, I’ll start buying some in anticipation of it going through 3,000. The 3,000 level acts like a magnet.   So the markets are drawn to round numbers. Do markets usually reach the round number, or do they often stop just short of it?   I believe markets almost always get to the round number. Therefore, the best place to get in is before that number is reached and play what I call the “magnet effect.” For example, I might buy the stock index markets when the Dow is at 2,950, looking for it to go to 3,000. When the market gets close to 3,000, things get more difficult. When that happens, I like to have everybody in the trading room get on the phone with a different broker and listen to the noise level on the floor. How excited does it sound down there? What size trades are hitting the market? If it doesn’t sound that loud and order sizes are small, then I’ll start dumping our position because the market is probably going to fall off. On the other hand, if it sounds crazy and there are large orders being transacted, I’ll tend to hold the position.

I’ve been trying for years to get rid of anger completely when I lose money, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it is impossible. I can work toward that goal, but until the day I die, I don’t think I’m ever going to be able to look a big loss in the face and not get angry.   Does anger affect your trading?   No. I’d say that I’m pretty good about that.

- Is it meaningfully tougher to lose 4 percent when you’re trading $100 million than when you’re trading $1 million?   It is tougher. Dollars have a lot to do with it, too. There are plenty of traders I know who show track records with an amazing cumulative winning percentage. I’ve seen situations where they might be up 1,000 percent over a five-year period, but if you examine their track record in terms of net dollars made or lost, you discover they are actually down.   Because they made the large percentage returns with small capital and then lost money when they were managing large sums?   Exactly. I’m not in the business of picking CTAs. But if I were, one of the first screens I would use would be a person’s total dollar profit—how many dollars did the CTA pull out of the market. If that number were negative, I would eliminate the CTA from consideration, regardless of the percentage return.

- Trout’s basic message is twofold. First, you have to have an edge to beat the markets. Everything else is secondary. You can have great money management, but if you don’t have an approach that gives you an edge, then you can’t win. This may seem obvious, but many traders enter the markets without any evidence that they have an edge. Second, assuming you have an edge, you must exercise rigid risk control to protect against those infrequent events that cause enormous, abrupt price moves that can quickly decimate overleveraged accounts. And, as demonstrated in Trout’s own thesis, the probability of sharp price moves is far greater than suggested by standard statistical assumptions. Hence, risk control is essential. The trader who gets wiped out by a sudden, large, adverse price move is not simply unlucky, since such events occur often enough that they must be planned for.

The problem is that the markets operate more on psychology than on fundamentals. For example, you may determine that silver should be priced at, say, $8, and that may well be an accurate evaluation. However, under certain conditions—for example, a major inflationary environment—the price could temporarily go much higher. In the commodity inflation boom that peaked in 1980, silver reached a high of $50—a price level that was out of all proportion to any true fundamental value. Of course, eventually the market returned to its base value—in fact, in the history of markets, I can’t think of a single commodity that didn’t eventually move back to its base value—but in the interim, anyone trading purely on the fundamentals would have been wiped out.

- It’s obvious from your earlier comments that you consider cycles important. Could you please elaborate?   There are cycles in everything—the weather, ocean waves, and the markets. One of the most important long-term cycles is the cycle from inflation to deflation. About every two generations—roughly every forty-seven to sixty years—there’s a deflationary market. For example, in respect to the commodity markets, we’re currently in a deflationary phase that began in 1980. Over the past two hundred years, these deflationary phases have typically lasted between eight and twelve years. Since we’re currently in the twelfth year of commodity price deflation, I think we’re very close to a major bottom in commodity prices.

- Another important consideration in regard to cycles is that their lengths vary greatly from market to market. For example, in the grain markets, which are heavily weather dependent, you may get major bull markets about five times every twenty years. In the gold market, however, a major bull cycle may occur only three to five times in a century. This consideration could make a market such as gold very frustrating for traders trying to play for the next bullish wave.   What is the single most important statement you could make about the markets?   The essential element is that the markets are ultimately based on human psychology, and by charting the markets you’re merely converting human psychology into graphic representations. I believe that the human mind is more powerful than any computer in analyzing the implications of these price graphs.

- Tell me about your early experiences as a stock analyst.   The director of investments was Speros Drelles, the person who had hired me. He was brilliant, with a great aptitude for teaching, but he was also quite eccentric. When I was twenty-five and had been in the department for only about a year, he summoned me into his office and announced that he was going to make me the director of equity research. This was quite a bizarre move, since my boss was about fifty years old and had been with the bank for over twenty-five years. Moreover, all the other analysts had M.B.A.’s and had been in the department longer than I had. “You know why I’m doing this, don’t you?” he asked. “No,” I replied. ([Location 3714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3714))
- “For the same reason they send eighteen-year-olds into war.” “Why is that?” I asked. “Because they’re too dumb to know not to charge.” Drelles continued, “The small cap [capitalization] stocks have been in a bear market for ten years [this conversation transpired in 1978], and I think there’s going to be a huge, liquidity-driven bull market sometime in the next decade. Frankly, I have a lot of scars from the past ten years, while you don’t. I think we’ll make a great team because you’ll be too stupid and inexperienced to know not to try to buy everything. That other guy out there,” he said, referring to my boss, the exiting director of equity research, “is just as stale as I am.” ([Location 3722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3722))

- What kind of analytical approach did you use in evaluating stocks?   When I first started out, I did very thorough papers covering every aspect of a stock or industry. Before I could make the presentation to the stock selection committee, I first had to submit the paper to the research director. I particularly remember the time I gave him my paper on the banking industry. I felt very proud of my work. However, he read through it and said, “This is useless. What makes the stock go up and down?” That comment acted as a spur. Thereafter, I focused my analysis on seeking to identify the factors that were strongly correlated to a stock’s price movement as opposed to looking at all the fundamentals. Frankly, even today, many analysts still don’t know what makes their particular stocks go up and down.   What did you find was the answer?   Very often the key factor is related to earnings. This is particularly true of the bank stocks. Chemical stocks, however, behave quite differently. In this industry, the key factor seems to be capacity. The ideal time to buy the chemical stocks is after a lot of capacity has left the industry and there’s a catalyst that you believe will trigger an increase in demand. Conversely, the ideal time to sell these stocks is when there are lots of announcements for new plants, not when the earnings turn down. The reason for this behavioral pattern is that expansion plans mean that earnings will go down in two to three years, and the stock market tends to anticipate such developments. Another discipline I learned that helped me determine whether a stock would go up or down is technical analysis. Drelles was very technically oriented, and I was probably more receptive to technical analysis than anyone else in the department. Even though Drelles was the boss, a lot of people thought he was a kook because of all the chart books he kept. However, I found that technical analysis could be very effective.

The irony is that less than a week after we went bust, interest rates hit their high for the entire cycle. They’ve never been that high since.

- How much were you up during the first half of 1987 before you switched from long to short?   The results varied depending on the fund. I was managing five different hedge funds at the time, each using a different type of strategy. The funds were up roughly between 40 percent and 85 percent at the time I decided to switch to a bearish posture. Perhaps the strongest performer was the Dreyfus Strategic Aggressive Investing Fund, which was up about 40 percent during the second quarter (the first quarter of the fund’s operation). It had certainly been an excellent year up to that point. Many managers will book their profits when they’re up a lot early in the year. It’s my philosophy, which has been reinforced by Mr. Soros, that when you earn the right to be aggressive, you should be aggressive. The years that you start off with a large gain are the times that you should go for it. Since I was well ahead for the year, I felt that I could afford to fight the market for a while. I knew the bull market had to end, I just didn’t know when. Also, because of the market’s severe overvaluation, I thought that when the bull market did end, it was going to be dramatic.   Then I assume that you held on to your short position until the market actually topped a couple of months later.

- That’s right. By October 16, 1987, the Dow had come down to near the 2,200 level, after having topped at over 2,700. I had more than recouped my earlier losses on the short position and was back on track with a very profitable year. That’s when I made one of the most tragic mistakes of my entire trading career. The chart suggested that there was tremendous support near 2,200 based on a trading range that had been built up during most of 1986. I was sure that the market would hold at that level. I was also playing from a position of strength, because I had profits from my long positions earlier in the year, and I was now ahead on my short positions as well. I went from net short to a 130 percent long. [A percentage greater than 100 percent implies the use of leverage.]   When did you make this transition?   On Friday afternoon, October 16, 1987.   You reversed from short to a leveraged long position on the day before the crash? You’re kidding!   That’s right, and there was plenty of liquidity for me to switch my position on that day.   I’m not surprised, but I’m somewhat puzzled. You’ve repeatedly indicated that you give a great deal of weight to technical input.

- didn’t the technical perspective make you apprehensive about the trade?   A number of technical indicators suggested that the market was oversold at that juncture. Moreover, I thought that the huge price base near the 2,200 level would provide extremely strong support—at least temporarily. I figured that even if I were dead wrong, the market would not go below the 2,200 level on Monday morning. My plan was to give the long position a half-hour on Monday morning and to get out if the market failed to bounce.   When did you realize that you were wrong?   That Friday afternoon after the close, I happened to speak to Soros. He said that he had a study done by Paul Tudor Jones that he wanted to show me. I went over to his office, and he pulled out this analysis that Paul had done about a month or two earlier. The study demonstrated the historical tendency for the stock market to accelerate on the downside whenever an upward-sloping parabolic curve had been broken—as had recently occurred. The analysis also illustrated the extremely close correlation in the price action between the 1987 stock market and the 1929 stock market,… ([Location 3895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3895))

- Actually, there’s a second important element to the story. In early August of that year, I had received a call from a woman who was about to leave for a vacation to France. She said, “My brother says that the market is getting out of hand. I have to go away for three weeks. Do you think the market will be all right until I get back?” I tried to be reassuring, telling her, “The market will probably go down, but I don’t think it will happen that quickly. You can go on your vacation without worry.” “Do you know who my brother is?” she asked. “I have no idea,” I answered. “He’s Jack Dreyfus,” she informed me. As far as I knew, Dreyfus was busy running a medical foundation and hadn’t paid much attention to the market for the past fifteen or twenty years. The following week, Howard Stein brought a visitor to my office. “This is Jack Dreyfus,” he announced. Dreyfus was wearing a cardigan sweater and was very polite in his conversation. “I would like to know about the S&P futures contract,” he said. “As you know, I haven’t looked at the market for twenty years. However, I’ve been very concerned about the conversations I’ve been hearing lately when I play bridge. Everyone seems to be bragging about all the money he’s making in the market. It reminds me of everything I read about the 1929 market.” Dreyfus was looking for evidence of margin buying to confirm his conjecture… ([Location 3910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3910))

- this theory, he wanted me to do a study to see if there had been any unusually heavy speculative buying of S&P futures. Since we didn’t have the data readily available, it took us a while to complete the study. Ironically, we finished the analysis on Friday afternoon, October 16, 1987. Basically, the data showed that speculators had been consistently short until July 1987 and after that point had switched to an increasingly heavy long position. I went to see Jack Dreyfus on Saturday, October 17, to show him the results of the analysis. Remember, he had expressed all his concerns about the market in August. At this point, I was already very upset because Soros had shown me Paul Tudor Jones’s study. Dreyfus looked at my study and said, “I guess we’re a bit too late to capitalize on my fears.” That was the clincher. I was absolutely convinced that I was on the wrong side of the market. I decided that if the market opened above the support level on Monday morning, which was about 30 Dow points lower, and didn’t immediately rally, I would sell my entire position. As it turned out, the market opened over 200 points lower. I knew I had to get out. Fortunately, there was a brief bounce shortly after the opening, and I was able to sell my entire long position and actually go net short. That same afternoon, five minutes to four, Dreyfus came by. He said, “Forgive me for not telling you before,… ([Location 3926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3926))

The S&P futures are trading at a 4,500-point discount based on the Dow!” He looked at me and asked, “What’s a discount?”   So did he cover his position at that… ([Location 3943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=3943))

- Did your relationship with Soros change once you started working for him?   The first six months of the relationship were fairly rocky. While we had similar trading philosophies, our strategies never meshed. When I started out, he was going to be the coach—and he was an aggressive coach. In my opinion, George Soros is the greatest investor that ever lived. But even being coached by the world’s greatest investor is a hindrance rather than a help if he’s engaging you actively enough to break your trading rhythm. You just can’t have two cooks in the kitchen; it doesn’t work. Part of it was my fault because he would make recommendations and I would be intimidated. After all, how do you disagree with a man with a track record like his? Events came to a head in August 1989 when Soros sold out a bond position that I had put on. He had never done that before. To make matters worse, I really had a strong conviction on the trade. Needless to say, I was fairly upset. At that point, we had our first let-it-all-out discussion. Basically, Soros decided that he was going to stay out of my hair for six months. Frankly, I wasn’t too optimistic about the arrangement because I thought that he had been trying to do that all along but was simply incapable of it. The situation was saved, however, by events heating up in Eastern Europe in late 1989.

- Soviet Union from communist to capitalist systems has been Soros’s main endeavor in recent years. He has set up foundations in eleven countries to help achieve this goal. With George off in Eastern Europe, he couldn’t meddle even if he wanted to. Everything started to come together at that time. Not only was I trading on my own without any interference, but that same Eastern European situation led to my first truly major trade for Soros’s Quantum Fund. I never had more conviction about any trade than I did about the long side of the Deutsche mark when the Berlin Wall came down. One of the reasons I was so bullish on the Deutsche mark was a radical currency theory proposed by George Soros in his book, The Alchemy of Finance. His theory was that if a huge deficit were accompanied by an expansionary fiscal policy and tight monetary policy, the country’s currency would actually rise. The dollar provided a perfect test case in the 1981–84 period. At the time, the general consensus was that the dollar would decline because of the huge budget deficit. However, because money was attracted into the country by a tight monetary policy, the dollar actually went sharply higher. When the Berlin Wall came down, it was one of those situations that I could see as clear as day. West Germany was about to run up a huge budget deficit to finance the rebuilding of East Germany. At the same time, the Bundesbank was not going to tolerate any inflation. I went headlong into the Deutsche mark. It turned out to be a terrific trade.

- Your long-term performance has far surpassed the industry average. To what do you attribute your superior track record?   George Soros has a philosophy that I have also adopted: The way to build long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs. You can be far more aggressive when you’re making good profits. Many managers, once they’re up 30 or 40 percent, will book their year [i.e., trade very cautiously for the remainder of the year so as not to jeopardize the very good return that has already been realized]. The way to attain truly superior long-term returns is to grind it out until you’re up 30 or 40 percent, and then if you have the convictions, go for a 100 percent year. If you can put together a few near-100 percent years and avoid down years, then you can achieve really outstanding long-term returns.   What else have you learned from Soros?   I’ve learned many things from him, but perhaps the most significant is that it’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important, but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong. The few times that Soros has ever criticized me was when I was really right on a market and didn’t maximize the opportunity.

- As an example, shortly after I had started working for Soros, I was very bearish on the dollar and put on a large short position against the Deutsche mark. The position had started going in my favor, and I felt rather proud of myself. Soros came into my office, and we talked about the trade. “How big a position do you have?” he asked. “One billion dollars,” I answered. “You call that a position?” he said dismissingly. He encouraged me to double my position. I did, and the trade went dramatically further in our favor. Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the jugular. It takes courage to be a pig. It takes courage to ride a profit with huge leverage. As far as Soros is concerned, when you’re right on something, you can’t own enough. Although I was not at Soros Management at the time, I’ve heard that prior to the Plaza Accord meeting in the fall of 1985, other traders in the office had been piggybacking George and hence were long the yen going into the meeting. When the yen opened 800 points higher on Monday morning, these traders couldn’t believe the size of their gains and anxiously started taking profits. Supposedly, George came bolting out of the door, directing the other traders to stop selling the yen, telling them that he would assume their position. While these other traders were congratulating themselves for having taken the biggest profit in their lives, Soros was looking at the big picture: The government had just told him that the dollar was going to go down for the next year, so why shouldn’t he be a pig and buy more [yen]? Soros is also the best loss taker I’ve ever seen. He doesn’t care whether he wins or loses on a trade.

- According to Druckenmiller, superior performance requires two key elements: preservation of capital and home runs. The first principle has been quite well publicized, but the second is far less appreciated. From a portfolio perspective, Druckenmiller is saying that in order to really excel, you must take full advantage of the situations when you are well ahead and running a hot hand. Those are the times to really press, not rest on your laurels. Great track records are made by avoiding losing years and managing to score a few high-double-digit-or triple-digit-gain years. On an individual trade basis, going for home runs means really applying leverage in those infrequent circumstances when you have tremendous confidence. As Druckenmiller puts it, “It takes courage to be a pig.” Another important lesson to be drawn from this interview is that if you make a mistake, respond immediately! Druckenmiller made the incredible error of shifting from short to 130 percent long on the very day before the massive October 19, 1987, stock crash, yet he finished the month with a net gain. How? When he realized he was dead wrong, he liquidated his entire long position during the first hour of trading on October 19 and actually went short. Had he been less open-minded, defending his original position when confronted with contrary evidence, or had he procrastinated to see if the market would recover, he would have suffered a tremendous loss. Instead, he actually made a small profit. The ability to accept unpleasant truths (i.e., market action or events counter to one’s position) and respond decisively and without hesitation is the mark of a great trader. Although Druckenmiller employs valuation analysis and believes it is important in gauging the extent of a potential future price move once the current market trend reverses, he emphasizes that this approach cannot be used for timing. The key tools Druckenmiller applies to timing the broad market are liquidity analysis and technical analysis.

- Druckenmiller’s entire trading style runs counter to the orthodoxy of fund management. There is no logical reason why an investor (or fund manager) should be nearly fully invested in equities at all times. If an investor’s analysis points to the probability of an impending bear market, he or she should move entirely to cash and possibly even a net short position. Recall Druckenmiller’s frustration at being extremely bearish in mid-1981, absolutely correct in his forecast, and still losing money, because at the time, he was still wedded to the idea that a stock manager had to be net long at all times.

Most people believe high turnover is risky, but I think just the opposite. High turnover reduces risk when it’s the result of taking a series of small losses in order to avoid larger losses. I don’t hold on to stocks with deteriorating fundamentals or price patterns. For me, this kind of turnover makes sense. It reduces risk; it doesn’t increase it.

- What are the major misconceptions people have about the stock market?   They tend to confuse short-term volatility with long-term risk. The longer the time period, the lower the risk of holding equities. People focus too much on the short term—week-to-week and month-to-month price changes—and don’t pay enough attention to the long-term potential. They look at all movement as negative, whereas I look at movement as a constructive element. For many investors, the lack of sufficient exposure to high-returning, more volatile assets is their greatest risk. In my opinion, investment vehicles that provide the least short-term volatility often embody the greatest long-term risk. Without significant price movement, you can’t achieve superior gains. One market paradigm that I take exception to is: Buy low and sell high. I believe that far more money is made buying high and selling at even higher prices. That means buying stocks that have already had good moves and have high relative strength—that is, stocks in demand by other investors. I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.

If you were out of the market on the forty best days, which represent only 2 percent of the trading days, the return would drop to under 4 percent. The moral is that the penalty for being out of the market on the wrong days is severe—and human nature being what it is, those are exactly the days that most people are likely to be out of the market.   What are the traits of the people who are successful in this business?   They’re open-minded and flexible. They’re also risk takers, because they believe in what they’re doing.   I understand that you have several people at your firm trading their own small funds. Did you train these people?   Yes, none of them had any previous experience in the business before starting with us. There are three people involved, and they’re all doing very well.   I guess that means that you believe successful trading can be taught?   It can be taught as long as the person has an open mind. I like to say that the mind is like a parachute—it’s only good when it’s open. Of course, each person must still develop an individual philosophy and tailor basic trading concepts to his or her own personality.

- Most investors would find the typical stock in Driehaus’s portfolio hard to buy. Think of a broker espousing the same strategy in a telephone solicitation. “Hello, Mr. Smith. I have a real interesting stock for you to consider.” (Pause) “What is the P/E ratio? Well, it’s 60 to 1.” (Pause) “How far is it from its low? Well, it’s making new highs. Mr. Smith? Hello? Mr. Smith?” Driehaus’s method provides yet another example of the principle that successful strategies often require doing what most people find instinctively uncomfortable. Quite simply, the natural inclination of most people toward comfortable approaches (e.g., buying stocks that are near their lows, buying stocks with low P/Es) is one of the reasons the vast majority of investors experience such poor results. Another example in which Driehaus’s ability to do what is uncomfortable enhances his profitability is his willingness to buy a stock on extreme strength following a significant bullish news item. In such situations, most investors will wait for a reaction that never comes, or at the very least will place a price limit on their buy order. Driehaus realizes that if the news is sufficiently significant, the only way to buy the stock is to buy the stock. Any more cautious approach is likely to result in missing the move. In similar fashion, Driehaus is also willing to immediately liquidate a holding, even on a sharp one-day decline, if he feels a negative news item has changed the outlook for the stock. The rule is: Do what is right, not what is comfortable. Another important point to emphasize is that a small percentage of huge winners account for the bulk of Driehaus’s superior performance. You don’t have to be right the majority of the time, but you do have to take advantage of the situations when you are right. Achieving this dictate requires two essential elements: taking larger positions when one has a high degree of confidence (e.g., Home Shopping Network was Driehaus’s largest position ever) and holding such positions long enough to realize most of the potential. The latter condition means avoiding the temptation to take profits after a stock has doubled or even tripled, if the fundamental and technical conditions still point to continued higher prices. The steely patience necessary to hold such positions to fruition is one of the attributes that distinguishes the Market Wizards from less skilled traders. Even though Driehaus and Druckenmiller employ dramatically different approaches, “home run” trades are an essential ingredient to the success of each.

- Blake’s confidence in his approach also permeates his unique fee arrangement. He charges his clients 25 percent of total annual profits, but—and here’s the unusual part—he also agrees to pay 25 percent of any losses and 100 percent of losses incurred in a new account during the first twelve months. Obviously, he has not had to pay out on these guarantees yet. ([Location 4529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4529))

- In researching the price behavior of individual stocks, I have found that significant daily price changes (with relative strength) have about a 55 percent chance of being followed by a similar directional move on the following day. After allowing for commissions and bid/ask spreads, that is not a sufficient probability edge to be tradable. Now, as an analogy, assume you have a stack of coins, and each has a 55 percent chance of landing on heads. If you toss a single coin, the odds of getting heads are 55 percent. If you toss nine coins, the odds of getting more heads than tails go up to 62 percent. And if you toss ninety-nine coins, the odds of getting more heads than tails go up to about 75 percent. It’s a function of the binomial probability distribution. Similarly, assume you have ninety-nine chemical stocks, which on average are up 1 or 2 percent today, while the broad market is flat. In the very short run, this homogeneous group of stocks tends to behave like a school of fish. While the odds of a single chemical stock being up tomorrow may be 55 percent, the odds for the entire chemical group are much closer to 75 percent.

- Did you consider diversifying your money by trading different sectors at the same time?   I’m not a big fan of diversification. My answer to that question is that you can diversify very well by just making enough trades per year. If the odds are 70 percent in your favor and you make fifty trades, it’s very difficult to have a down year. ([Location 4697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4697))

- How did you go about soliciting accounts?   All my accounts were either friends or neighbors. For example, I would invite a neighbor over for a beer in the evening and say, “I’ve been doing this for a couple of years now, and I’d like you to take a look at it.” Some people had no interest at all and others did. It’s interesting how different people are when it comes to money. Some people don’t do any homework at all and give you their money immediately. Others wouldn’t dream of giving you $10, no matter what you showed them. Finally, there are those that do a lot of homework and ask the right questions before they invest. Everyone falls into one of these three categories. ([Location 4717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4717))

- For how long did you maintain the 100 percent guarantee against first-year losses?   I still maintain that offer, but I’ve accepted only two new clients during the past five years.   Given your performance, I assume that implies that you’re no longer accepting any new accounts.   I stopped accepting new accounts five years ago. I made an exception in these two cases because they were very close friends.   Why did you stop accepting new accounts? Did you feel there was a limit to the amount of money you could handle without it negatively impacting your performance?   It’s not a limit to how much money I can handle but rather a limit to how much money may be welcome in the funds I’m trading. I’m very sensitive to any potential impact I might have on the fund manager or on the other shareholders who don’t move as actively as I do. I prefer to restrict the amount of money I move to only a couple of million dollars in a fund of several hundred million dollars, so that the impact will be minimal. Also, I have found that when I enter orders, I often get a comment like, “You’re getting out? Most of the calls we’re getting today are getting in.”   What does that tell you?   It tells me that I’m running counter to a lot of money that’s being switched in and out; hence, the impact of my activities is not great. I’ve also been told by fund employees that most of the people who do a lot of switching in their own accounts end up doing worse than if they had done no switching at all.   Did you decide to limit your size to a certain dollar amount in order to not rock the boat?   The most important factor here is my risk. Sharing 25 percent of both profits and losses is the exact equivalent of leverage. What I did not fully appreciate at first was the psychological importance of finding and maintaining a stable proportion of client money to my own capital. Actually, I prefer this proportion (or leverage) to decline over time. ([Location 4737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4737))

- Did you ever find yourself managing funds beyond your comfort level?   In 1986 I took on new money too rapidly. I found myself rationalizing taking 50 percent positions. For example, a green light would come on, and I would trade only $200,000 of a $400,000 account. I would think, “Yes, I’ll feel much more comfortable tomorrow having only $200,000 in.” I soon realized that as a result of my caution, I was reducing my clients’ return by one-half. I decided that a better approach was to have fewer clients, if necessary, and to trade all of them fully. When I first cut back on the percentage of an account that I was trading, I wasn’t aware of the motivations for my actions. In hindsight, I came to understand that I was really uncomfortable with the size of the risk. It wasn’t just a matter of whether I won or lost the next day but also how I would feel until the verdict came in. I have a routine of internalizing how I would feel given what might happen on the next day. ([Location 4761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4761))

- That routine being what?   My approach is to confront losses even before they materialize. I rehearse the process of losing. Whenever I take a position, I like to imagine what it would be like under the worst-case scenario. In doing so, I minimize the confusion if that situation actually develops. In my view, losses are a very important part of trading. When a loss happens, I believe in embracing it.   Why is that?   By embracing a loss, really feeling it, I tend to have less fear about a potential loss the next time around. If I can’t get over the emotions of taking a loss in twenty-four hours, then I’m trading too large or doing something else wrong. Also, the process of rehearsing potential losses and confronting actual losses helps me adapt to increasing levels of risk over time. The amount of money I’m managing is growing by 15 to 20 percent a year, which means that the dollar risk I’m taking is increasing at the same rate. The best way I can deal with that reality is by being willing to feel the risk at each level. ([Location 4770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4770))

- Have the markets changed in the past decade?   In a micro sense—yes; in a macro sense—no. Opportunities change, strategies change, but people and psychology do not change. If trend-following systems don’t work as well, something else will. There’s always money being lost, so someone out there has to win.   What do you believe are the major myths about markets?   A prevailing myth on Wall Street is that no one can consistently beat the market year in, year out, with steady returns of 20 or 30 percent a year. On the other hand, the sales side would have you believe that it can be done by anyone. Neither is really the truth.

- Why do traders lose?   First of all, most traders don’t have a winning strategy. Second, even among those traders who do, many don’t follow their strategy. Trading puts pressure on weaker human traits and seems to seek out each individual’s Achilles’ heel.   What makes a good trader?   A critical ingredient is a maverick mind. It’s also important to have a blend between an artistic side and a scientific side. You need the artistic side to imagine, discover, and create trading strategies. You need the scientific side to translate those ideas into firm trading rules and to execute those rules.   Can people be successful using a purchased system?   I believe that systems tend to be more useful or successful for the originator than for someone else. It’s important that an approach be personalized; otherwise, you won’t have the confidence to follow it. It’s unlikely that someone else’s approach will be consistent with your own personality. It’s also possible that individuals who become successful traders are not the type to use someone else’s approach and that successful traders don’t sell their systems.

- How would you respond to Burton Malkiel [the author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street]?   Well, I’m more in agreement than in disagreement with him. The markets are mostly random, and most people can’t beat or “time” the market. One hundred money managers each believe that they can consistently outperform the market. My feeling is that the number is a lot closer to zero than one hundred. Trading is probably more of an art than most people want to believe. I guess I’d also be tempted to show him my numbers.   What advice would you give to a novice trader?   There are five basic steps to becoming a successful trader. First, focus on trading vehicles, strategies, and time horizons that suit your personality. Second, identify nonrandom price behavior, while recognizing that markets are random most of the time.

- At the core, the quality of open-mindedness is responsible for Blake’s success and, for that matter, his entire career. For many years, Blake sincerely believed that the markets were random. When confronted with contradictory evidence, he didn’t dig in his heels and argue his position—the reflexive response most people would have in such a situation. Instead, he researched the question, and when the evidence suggested that his prior views had been wrong, he changed his mind. The ability to change one’s mind is probably a key characteristic of the successful trader. Dogmatic and rigid personalities rarely, if ever, succeed in the markets. Another attribute that has allowed Blake to excel is his adaptability. The markets are a dynamic process, and sustained trading success requires the ability to modify and even change strategies as markets evolve. Blake began by trading municipal bond funds. However, when the reliability and profitability of his approach in that sector started to diminish, he didn’t just blindly keep repeating the same strategy that had worked for him in the past. Instead, he used the changing market conditions as a spur to start an intensive research project, which eventually yielded an entirely new and even more effective approach. When hourly switching became available in the Fidelity sector funds, he altered his methods accordingly. Then, when Fidelity made it virtually impossible to use its funds for switching strategies (by imposing prohibitively high fees), Blake switched to different fund families and different strategies. Blake’s ability to adapt has allowed him to maintain a remarkable consistency of performance, despite profound changes in his trading environment. Perhaps Blake’s most important message lies in his amazingly consistent track record, which provides compelling empirical evidence that the markets are indeed nonrandom. Of course, this nonrandomness is hardly blatant. If it were, we would all be millionaires. However, Blake’s ability to win in an astounding twenty-five months for every month he loses, allows us to say “Yes, Virginia, the markets can be beat.” How can the markets be beat? Certainly not by… ([Location 4908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4908))

- After about six months, Sperandeo finally decided that if he were going to get a fair deal, he would have to make it himself. After finding a partner to finance the operation, Sperandeo launched his own firm, Ragnar Options, in 1971. Sperandeo claims that Ragnar was the first option dealer to offer guaranteed quotes on options without charging exceptionally high premiums. If they couldn’t find an existing option contract in the market to meet a buyer’s request (which they could purchase and resell at a premium), they wrote the option themselves. (At the time, options were tailor-made to the customer’s specifications, as opposed to being traded as uniform instruments on an exchange.) As a result of this policy of offering reasonable firm quotes, according to Sperandeo, within six months Ragnar was the largest OTC option dealer in the world. Ragnar was eventually merged with another Wall Street firm. Sperandeo stayed on for a while but then joined Interstate Securities in 1978. At Interstate, Sperandeo was given a company account and a few private accounts to manage at a 50/50 split (expenses as well as profits). Sperandeo had finally landed the perfect job: complete independence to trade any markets in any way he desired, capital backing, and a meaningful split of profits (and losses). This ideal arrangement finally came to an end in 1986 when Interstate went public and decided to dissolve its trading group. Sperandeo traded his personal account for a little over a year before deciding to start his own money management firm—Rand Management Corporation. Throughout his entire career, Sperandeo has placed a greater emphasis on loss avoidance than on scoring large gains. He was largely successful at this objective, stringing together eighteen consecutive winning years before registering his first loss in 1990. Over this period, his average annual gain was 72 percent, with results ranging from a single loss of 35 percent in 1990 to five years of triple-digit gains.

- I think my first related interest was an enthusiasm for poker. As a teenager, I literally earned a living by playing poker. When I first started playing, I read every book I could find on the game and quickly learned that winning was a matter of managing the odds. In other words, if you played only the hands in which the odds were in your favor and folded when they were not, you would end up winning more times than you lost. I memorized the odds of every important card combination, and I was very successful at the game. ([Location 4985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=4985))

- You said earlier that you were drawn to a trading career because of the analogy to playing cards. Do you then see trading as a form of gambling?   I’d say that gambling is the wrong term. Gambling involves taking a risk when the odds are against you. For example, betting on a lottery or playing a slot machine are forms of gambling. I think successful trading, or poker playing for that matter, involves speculating rather than gambling. Successful speculation implies taking risks when the odds are in your favor. Just like in poker, where you have to know which hands to bet on, in trading you have to know when the odds are in your favor.

- How do you define “the odds” in trading?   In 1974 I missed the huge October-November rally in the stock market. That error served as a catalyst for an intensive two-year study. I wanted to know the answer to questions like: How long do bull and bear markets last? What are the normal percentage price moves a market makes before it forms a top or a bottom? As a result of that research project, I found that market price movements are like people—they have statistically significant life-expectancy profiles that can be used to measure risk exposure. For example, the median extent for an intermediate swing in the Dow during a bull market is 20 percent. This doesn’t mean that when the market is up 20 percent, it’s going to top; sometimes it will top earlier, sometimes later. However, what it does mean is that when the market is up more than 20 percent, the odds for further appreciation begin to decline significantly. Thus, if the market has been up more than 20 percent and you begin to see other evidence of a possible top, it’s important to pay close attention to that information.

- As an analogy, consider life insurance, which deals with the life expectancy of people instead of price moves. If you’re writing life insurance policies, it’s going to make a great deal of difference whether the applicant is twenty years old or eighty years old. If you’re approached by an out-of-condition twenty-year-old, you might judge that the odds of his survival are pretty good. However, you’d be a lot less anxious to write a policy on an eighty-year-old. If the eighty-year-old is the Jack LaLanne of eighty-year-olds—he can do two hundred push-ups; he can swim the English Channel—then fine, you can write him a policy. But let’s say the same eighty-year-old smokes three packs of Camels a day, drinks a quart of scotch a day, and has pneumonia—then you probably wouldn’t want to write him a policy. The older the individual, the more significant the symptoms become. Similarly, in a market that is in a stage of old age, it is particularly important to be attuned to symptoms of a potential end to the current trend. To use the life insurance analogy, most people who become involved in the stock market don’t know the difference between a twenty-year-old and an eighty-year-old. In my opinion, one reason why many types of technical analysis don’t work too well is because such methods are often applied indiscriminately. For example, if you see a head-and-shoulders pattern form in what is the market equivalent of a twenty-year-old, the odds are that the… ([Location 5030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5030))

- The first factor is related to value. Roger Ibbotson did a study spanning sixty years of data in which he compared the returns of different forms of investment. He found that, over the survey period, the stock market returned an average of 9.2 percent annually, including dividends. Therefore, if the market rises 20 percent in, say, 107 days—which happens to be the median time duration of an intermediate upmove—then you’ve squeezed out a lot of value in a very short amount of time. The market as a whole has become much less of a value. The second factor is psychological. Let’s say you go to the super-market to buy ingredients for a salad. A head of lettuce is selling for $1.00, and a pound of tomatoes is selling for $1.00. You go back two weeks later and lettuce is still selling for $1.00, but tomatoes are now $1.50. In that situation, a lot of people will look for a substitute for tomatoes. They’re going to… ([Location 5052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5052))

In addition, the volume on the break to new lows was relatively light. Also, we had been in a bear market for a long time, and bearish sentiment was pervasive.

- Was there any correlation between intelligence and success at trading?   Absolutely, but not in the way you think. For example, one of the people I picked was a high school dropout, who I’m sure didn’t even know the alphabet. He was one of the five who made me a great deal of money.   Why did you pick him?   He was my phone clerk on the American Stock Exchange, and he was very aggressive and alert. Also, he had been in Vietnam and had a hand grenade explode near him, leaving shrapnel in his pancreas. As a result of this experience, he was always afraid of everything. When it came to trading, he was more worried about losing than winning. He took losses very quickly. On the other extreme of the intelligence spectrum, one of the people I trained was a genius. He had a 188 IQ, and he was on “Jeopardy” once and answered every question correctly. That same person never made a dime in trading during five years. I discovered that you can’t train people how to trade by just imparting knowledge. The key to trading success is emotional discipline. Making money has nothing to do with intelligence. Think of all the bright people that choose careers on Wall Street. If intelligence were the key, there would be a lot more people making money trading.

- To be a successful trader, you have to be able to admit mistakes. People who are very bright don’t make very many mistakes. In a sense, they generally are correct. In trading, however, the person who can easily admit to being wrong is the one who walks away a winner. Besides trading, there is probably no other profession where you have to admit when you’re wrong. Think about it. For example, consider a lawyer who, right before a big case, goes out with his girlfriend and stays up half the night. The next day, he’s drowsy and inadequately prepared. He ends up losing the case. Do you think he’s going to tell the client, “I’m sorry, I went out last night and stayed up too long. If I were sharper, I would have won the case. Here’s your money back.” It will never happen. He can always find some excuse. He would probably say something like, “I did the best I could, but the jury was biased.” He will never have to admit he was wrong. No one will ever know the truth except him.

- Why do you think the majority of people you trained lost money?   They lacked what I call emotional discipline—the ability to keep their emotions removed from trading decisions. Dieting provides an apt analogy for trading. Most people have the necessary knowledge to lose weight—that is, they know that in order to lose weight you have to exercise and cut your intake of fats. However, despite this widespread knowledge, the vast majority of people who attempt to lose weight are unsuccessful. Why? Because they lack the emotional discipline.   If you were going to repeat this experiment again—which obviously you are not—do you think that you’d be able to pick a higher percentage of winning traders?   Yes, because this time around I would pick people on the basis of psychological traits.   Specifically, what traits would you look for?

- Essentially, I would look for people with the ability to admit mistakes and take losses quickly. Most people view losing as a hit against their self-esteem. As a result, they postpone losing. They think of all sorts of reasons for not taking losses. They select a mental stop point and then fail to execute it. They abandon their game plan.

- I know this will sound like a cliché, but the single most important reason that people lose money in the financial markets is that they don’t cut their losses short. It is a curiosity of human nature that no matter how many books talk about this rule, and no matter how many experts offer this advice, people still keep making the same mistake.   What other mistakes do people make?   They don’t approach trading as a business. I’ve always viewed trading as a business.   Can you elaborate on your business plan for trading?   I view the objectives in trading as a three-tiered hierarchy. First and foremost is the preservation of capital. When I first look at a trade, I don’t ask, “What is the potential profit I can realize?” but rather, “What is the potential loss I could suffer?” Second, I strive for consistent profitability by balancing my risk relative to the accumulated profits or losses. Consistency is far more important than making lots of money. Third, insofar as I’m successful in the first two goals, I attempt to achieve superior returns. I do this by increasing my bet size after, and only after, periods of high profitability. In other words, if I have had a particularly profitable recent period, I may try to pyramid my gains by placing a larger bet size assuming, of course, the right situation presents itself. The key to building wealth is to preserve capital and wait patiently for the right opportunity to make the extraordinary gains.

- Probably your best-publicized market call was a prediction for a major top in the stock market, which you made in Barron’s in September 1987—one month before the crash. What made you so confident about an impending collapse in stock prices?   At the August 1987 high, the stock market had gained nearly 23 percent in ninety-six days. These figures were almost exactly in line with the historical medians for the magnitude and duration of intermediate bull market moves. This consideration was only a cautionary note. If all the other factors were positive, then fine. However, to recall an analogy I used earlier, this market was no Jack LaLanne. In August, the Dow Jones Industrial index made a new high, but the advance/decline ratio did not—a bearish divergence. The price/earnings ratio at the time was at its highest level in twenty-five years. Government, corporate, and consumer debt were at record levels. Virtually any indicator you looked at was screaming caution against the possibility of an impending collapse.   Were you short going into the October 19 crash? If so, what considerations did you use to actually time your entry into the market?   The first major timing signal came on October 5, when I read Fed Chairman Greenspan’s comment in the Wall Street Journal, in which he was quoted as saying that interest rates could become “dangerously high” if inflation fears were to “mushroom” in the financial markets. Although Greenspan indicated that he felt such concerns were unwarranted, he also hinted that the discount rate might have to be raised to alleviate such worries. On October 15, Dow Theory gave a sell signal, and I initiated my short position. The straw that broke the camel’s back was Secretary of State James Baker’s dispute with Germany, in which he urged Germany to stimulate its economy. When Germany refused to cooperate, Baker made a weekend announcement that the United States was prepared to “let the dollar slide.” In my opinion, there’s no doubt that this statement was the trigger for the October 19 stock market collapse. An unknown devaluation of a currency is not something that any foreign investor wants to live with. What does “slide” mean? Five percent? Ten percent? Twenty percent? How much are you going to let it slide? Investors who hold dollar-denominated securities are going to sell until they know what “slide” means. At that point, I was absolutely convinced that the stock market was going to collapse because of this unknown dollar devaluation. On Monday morning, I immediately added to my short position, even though the Dow Jones index opened over 200 points lower.   I know that you also caught the October 1989 minicrash. Was the analysis process similar to that in October 1987?   Very much so. In October 1989, the market had been up for 200 days without an intermediate downtrend [by Sperandeo’s definition, a decline of fifteen days or longer], versus a historical median of 107 days. Moreover, the market was up over 24 percent,… ([Location 5391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5391))

- One way or another, it all comes down to odds. Unless you can find some way to get the odds in your favor, trading, like any other 50/50 game with a cost to play (commissions and execution slippage in this case), will eventually be a losing proposition. Sperandeo has taken the definition of odds to an actuarial-like extreme. Just as insurance companies guarantee that the odds are in their favor by classifying policyholders according to risk, Sperandeo categorizes the stock market by risk. When it comes to the stock market, he can tell the difference between a twenty-year-old and an eighty-year-old. Another somewhat related element behind Sperandeo’s success is that he varies his bet size considerably. When he implements a position in a market that he perceives to be in the beginning stages of a new trend and various indicators confirm the trade, he will tend to trade much larger than in situations where these conditions are lacking. In this way, Sperandeo places his largest bet when he estimates that the odds are most favorable. (Incidentally, this strategy is essentially the key to success in games such as blackjack; see the Hull interview.) Sperandeo emphasizes, however, that when trading large, it is essential that the market go immediately in your favor; otherwise, the position should be pared down quickly. This measure is essential to ensure financial survival when you are wrong in a situation that you thought was highly favorable. While his view is hardly universal, Sperandeo downplays the significance of intelligence to trading success. Based on his experience in training thirty-eight traders, Sperandeo concluded that intelligence was virtually irrelevant in predicting success. A far more important trait to winning as a trader, he says, is the ability to admit mistakes. He points out that people who tie their self-esteem to being right in the markets will find it very difficult to take losses when the market action indicates that they are wrong. One sacred cow that Sperandeo believes is really a bum steer is the standard advice to use a buy-and-hold strategy in the stock market. Sperandeo provides some examples of very extended periods in which such a strategy would have been disastrous.

- In your description of your first trade, you come across as being filled with tension and anxiety. How did you go from that mind-set to your current extraordinarily relaxed attitude?   I realized that every time I had a loss, I needed to learn something from the experience and view the loss as tuition at the College of Trading. As long as you learn something from a loss, it’s not really a loss.   When did you adopt that mental attitude?   Very early; probably right after the corn trade.   Did it help?   Definitely. By adopting that perspective, I stopped looking at the losses as problems and started viewing them as opportunities to elevate myself to the next plateau. Over the next five years, I gradually improved and lost less each year.   After losing money for five consecutive years from your start in trading, didn’t you ever think that you might not be cut out for this endeavor?   No, never.   What gave you the confidence? You obviously weren’t getting any reinforcement from the market. ([Location 5523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5523))

- My reinforcement came when my losses gradually became smaller and smaller. I was getting very close to the breakeven point. I also kept my losses at a manageable level. I always traded a very small account—an amount that I could afford to lose without affecting my life-style.   Did you stop trading when you lost whatever amount of money you had set aside to risk in a given year?   That never happened. I had developed the concept of never taking a trade that would jeopardize my ability to continue trading. I always limited the risk on any trade to a level that I knew would permit me to come in and play the game again if I were wrong.

- I probably do more mental exercises now than I ever did. Each morning while I’m driving to work, I make a conscious effort to relax. I mentally rehearse any conflict that might happen that day. The process of mentally organizing and relaxing before I get to work helps me start my day in a very positive frame of mind.   In effect, are you visualizing all possible crises or tensions that might occur and how you would respond to them, so that if they do arise, they’re not stressful?   Exactly.   Can you give me an example in which that mental attitude was put to the test of fire?   A good example is the recent Gulf War. On the evening of January 16, 1991 [the night the United States launched the air war against Iraq], I had come into the office to do some computer work. While I was there, the news of the war broke, and crude oil prices shot up to $40. I happened to have a substantial long position at the time.

- “We’re going to have a great day tomorrow.”   Actually, I think my most immediate thought was, “We’re going to have a lot of volatility and risk control alarms going off tomorrow, and we better be prepared.” I called our managing director, George, at home to make sure he was aware of the situation. He said, “I know, it’s on all three networks. I’ll be in early.” The next morning, I was drying my hair after coming out of the shower, while my wife was watching the news in the next room. I thought I heard the newscaster say that crude oil prices were at $22. Of course, I couldn’t believe the number. I thought to myself, “Was that $42? Or maybe $32?” I walked into the bedroom and asked my wife, “Did he say $22?” “I’m sorry,” she said, “I didn’t hear it.” I waited for the story to come back on and found that the price was indeed $22. I called up George and asked him, “Did you see the news? We’re really going to have our work cut out for us this morning.” We both got in early, ran all the programs, worked out all our risk alarms, and called in all the orders before the openings. We did everything we had planned to do. By 9:30, everything was done—all our orders had been placed, we had received our execution prices, and we had our new position balances figured out. I sat back, let out a sigh of relief, and asked George, “What do you think we lost on this today?” “I would guess about 15 percent,” he answered. “Yeah, I would guess about the same amount,” I said. I sat there for a moment and thought about all the events and actions of the previous evening and that morning.

- Sure.   It must have been a great shock then to discover that crude oil prices had gone from being up $8 the night before to being down $10 the next morning. What were your gut emotions when you realized that your profits of the previous evening had suddenly been transformed into a gargantuan one-day loss?   I wondered how my programs were going to deal with the volatility in crude oil going from $1,000 per day [per contract] to $18,000 per day. I was both excited and horrified at the thought of how my programs would handle the situation. I hoped that I had done a good job in preparing for a catastrophic event.   But on the inside, didn’t you have any hurt or depressed feelings?   No, I was more curious.   That is exactly the attitude I find so fascinating. Your portfolios went from being up sharply the night before to a 15 percent loss the next morning. Most people would have some very negative emotions in that type of situation. How were you able to respond with such emotional aloofness?   You have to put it into perspective. I’m fond of thinking of trading in terms of scores of years. If I live long enough, I’ll trade for fifty or sixty years. I figure that, over that time span, I’ll see devastating declines, spectacular advances that I virtually can’t believe, and everything in between. If you have done mental rehearsals to see how you would react in different catastrophic situations, then when such an event occurs, you become curious.   Curious to see if you’re going to follow your mental rehearsal?   Exactly. You feel like you’ve already seen this movie once before, and you wonder whether it’s going to come out the same way.   How do you handle such situations in your mental rehearsal?   My mental rehearsal for a catastrophic event is to picture a doctor in a triage situation. He’s in a battlefield emergency operating room. In come fifty bodies. Some are going to live; some are going to die. The doctor has been trained to handle the situation. He’s going to make all the necessary decisions. “This patient goes to operating room number one.” “This patient gets pushed aside.” He’s calm and collected, not nervous. He knows that he has the best chance of saving the maximum number of lives. He knows that he can’t save them all, but he’s going to do the best he can with what he has.   You just stay focused on what you have to do.   Exactly.   Does that… ([Location 5631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5631))

The second factor I worked on was risk management and volatility control. The third area I focused on was the psychology of trading. If I had it to do over again, I would reverse the process completely.

- If there is a single theme that keeps recurring in this volume, as it did in Market Wizards, it is that psychology is critical to success at trading. Certainly this idea is repeated strongly in the Basso interview. However, there is a more important lesson here: In order to achieve success in life, you must have the right mental attitude, without which success in trading is a Pyrrhic victory. If trading (or any other job or endeavor) is a source of anxiety, fear, frustration, depression, or anger, something is wrong—even if you are successful in a conventional sense, and especially if you are not. You have to enjoy trading, because if trading is a source of negative emotions, you have probably already lost the game, even if you make money. Basso is far from being the most successful trader I have interviewed in terms of performance statistics, but he is probably one of the first I would choose as a role model.

- What is your trading style?   My niche is short-term trading, which is how I make my bread and butter. The occasional long-term trades are frosting on the cake. I believe that only short-term price swings can be predicted with any precision. The accuracy of a prediction drops off dramatically, the more distant the forecast time. I’m a strong believer in chaos theory. ([Location 5855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=5855))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- [A basic concept of chaos theory is that for aperiodic systems—i.e., systems that never exactly repeat themselves and hence never find a steady state, such as weather or the markets—slight differences in variable values or measurements can be magnified to have huge effects over increasing periods of time. The technical name for this phenomenon—sensitive dependence on initial conditions—has become better known as the Butterfly Effect. As James Gleick described it in his excellent book, Chaos: Making a New Science, “In weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly known as the Butterfly Effect—the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next month in New York.”] There are too many unpredictable things that can happen within two months. To me, the ideal trade lasts ten days, but I approach every trade as if I’m only going to hold it two or three days. I’m also a firm believer in predicting price direction, but not magnitude. I don’t set price targets. I get out when the market action tells me it’s time to get out, rather than based on any consideration of how far the price has gone. You have to be willing to take what the market gives you. If it doesn’t give you very much, you can’t hesitate to get out with a small profit. I put a great deal of effort into getting the best entry price possible. I feel this is probably one of my strongest skills. In day trading, a good entry price is critical because it buys you time to see how the market will react. If you buy because you think the market should bounce, but it only goes sideways, you’d better get out. Part of the trading process is a matter of testing the water. If your entry timing is good enough, you won’t lose much even when you’re wrong. Some of the best trades come when everyone gets very panicky. The crowd can often act very stupidly in the markets. You can picture price fluctuations around an equilibrium level as a rubber band being stretched—if it gets pulled too far, eventually it will snap back. As a short-term trader, I try to wait until the rubber band is stretched to its extreme point.   How do you determine when the market is near such an extreme?   One of my favorite patterns is the tendency for the markets to move from relative lows to relative highs and vice versa every two to four days. This pattern is a function of human behavior. It takes several days of a market rallying before it looks really good. That’s when everyone wants to buy it, and that’s the time when the professionals, like myself, are selling. Conversely, when the market has been down for a few days, and everyone is bearish, that’s the time I like to be buying.

- I really have no fear of buying into breaks or selling into rallies. Sure, once in a while the market will keep on going, and I’ll immediately be down a full point or more on the S&P. However, by waiting for a sufficient extreme, even in such situations, the market will often snap back enough to let me out near even. Perhaps my number one rule is: Don’t try to make a profit on a bad trade, just try to find the best place to get out.   So when you have a bad trade, you don’t dump it immediately.

- That’s right. I find that I can usually get out at a better price if I have a little patience, since the reason I got into the trade in the first place was because the market was so overdone that a reaction seemed overdue. Once I’m out, it’s easy for me to get back in. If I buy back at a higher price, I just look at it as a fresh trade.

- Could you describe the mistakes you’ve made in your trading career that served as learning experiences?   My own particular weakness has always been being a bit premature on entering positions. As the saying goes, “The pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their backs.” I’ve learned to think to myself, “Patience, patience, patience.” I try to wait until things set up just right before I take a trade. Then, when I’m ready to take the trade, I slowly count to ten before I pick up the phone. It’s better to have the wrong idea and good timing than the right idea and bad timing. Another mistake I’ve frequently made is participating in too many markets at one time, which leads to sloppy trading. I’ve also found that it’s my smallest positions that cause my biggest losses, because they tend to be neglected. It’s natural to be cautious and attentive to big positions. With the small positions, it’s easy to fall into the trap of being complacent. My awareness of this pitfall has made me more careful with such positions.

I just try to make them less frequently, recognize them faster, and correct them immediately!   What percentage of your trades are profitable?   About 70 percent.   Is your average winner also larger than your average loser?   On my short-term trades, on a per contract basis, my average win is about $450 (the figure would be higher if I included longer-term trades), and my average loss is just over $200.   With both the percentage and average magnitude of your winning trades outdistancing the losers by a better than two-to-one ratio, it sounds like you would be profitable in every month.

- Why do you believe you have excelled as a trader?   I believe my most important skill is an ability to perceive patterns in the market. I think this aptitude for pattern recognition is probably related to my heavy involvement with music. Between the ages of five and twenty-one, I practiced piano for several hours every single day. In college, I had a dual major of economics and musical composition. Musical scores are just symbols and patterns. Sitting there for hours every day, analyzing scores, probably helped that part of my brain related to pattern recognition. Also, practicing an instrument for several hours every day helps develop discipline and concentration—two skills that are very useful as a trader.   Could you elaborate some more on the parallels between music and the markets?

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A musical piece has a definite structure: there are repeating patterns with variations. Analogously, the markets have patterns, which repeat with variations. Musical pieces have quiet interludes, theme development, and a gradual crescendo to a climax. The market counterparts are price consolidations, major trends, and runaway price moves to major tops or bottoms. You must have patience as a musical piece unfolds and patience until a trade sets up. You can practice, practice, practice, but you’re never going to play a musical piece perfectly, just as you’re never going to buy the low and sell the high on a trade. All you can hope to do is to play a piece (or trade) better than before. In both music and trading, you do best when you’re relaxed, and in both you have to go with the flow. A final analogy may explain the type of trading I’ve gravitated toward. You must be able to read individual notes and learn a piece of music measure by measure before you can play the whole piece through. Perhaps that’s why I spend most of my energy on short-term trades rather than analyzing the long-term picture.

- What advice would you give novice traders?   Understand that learning the markets can take years. Immerse yourself in the world of trading and give up everything else. Get as close to other successful traders as you can. Consider working for one for free. Start by finding a niche and specializing. Pick one market or pattern and learn it inside out before expanding your focus. My favorite exercise for novice traders is pick one market only. Without looking at an intraday chart, jot down the price every five minutes from the opening to the close. Do this for an entire week. Be in tune to the patterns. Where are the support and resistance levels? How does price act when it hits these levels? What happens during the last half-hour? How long does each intraday price move last? You won’t believe how much you can learn from this exercise. Never fear the markets. Never fear making a mistake. If you do make a mistake, don’t complicate the position by trying to hedge it—just get out. Stay actively involved with the market. Don’t just sit passively in front of a monitor, or simply stare at charts. Notice how many old-timers who have been successful for years still construct their own point-and-figure charts by hand intraday. They keep the same routine day after day. Develop your own routine for taking periodic market readings. Never be greedy. It’s OK to leave money on the table. If you can’t get in at a favorable price, let the trade go and start looking for the next trade. Finally, remember that a trader is someone who does his own work, has his own game plan, and makes his own decisions. Only by acting and thinking independently can a trader hope to know when a trade isn’t working out. If you ever find yourself tempted to seek out someone else’s opinion on a trade, that’s usually a sure sign that you should get out of your position.

- Occasionally, an interview provokes me to reassess my view of reality. I have long assumed that markets might be predictable over the long term but that short-term price movements are largely random. Raschke holds exactly the opposite point of view. She believes that in the markets, much as in weather forecasting, short-term predictions can be quite accurate but long-term forecasting is a virtual impossibility. With her ability to see patterns that others don’t, she has been able to trade short-term price swings with a consistency that would defy the laws of probability, if indeed there were no patterns in these movements. Raschke has made me a believer. Clearly, there are predictable movements in price even over periods as short as a few days or a single day. Raschke reminds us that traders are people who do their own work, make their own decisions. One particularly insightful observation made by Raschke is that the temptation to seek out other peoples’ opinions on a trade is a sure sign that the trade should be liquidated.

- In one sense, you have to be awfully honest to be in this business, where huge transactions take place with a nod of the head. Having said that, though, there’s tremendous opportunity to cheat. However, I don’t believe there are any more cheats in this business than, say, among plumbers or lawyers.   Now there is a raving endorsement. It reminds me of a sign I saw for sale in a country store saying simply, “Honest Lawyer.”   [Laughing] That’s probably the only one they made, and they’re still waiting to sell it! There’s no industry that has a corner on crooks. Think of the jokes we can make about dishonest politicians. Essentially, I think there’s probably the same percentage of dishonest people in our business as in any other. The difference is in the payoff for a dishonest act. There are people on the exchanges who would fill orders for nothing, simply for the opportunity to bucket trades. In fact, I have been told there are brokers who would even pay to fill orders—if they could do it with a straight face. The broker who told me this said that the conflict of interest between trading his own account and filling customer orders was so great that the only way he could sleep at night was to refuse to ever do any customer orders.

- How do you decide when a position is too large?   I have a rule that whenever I’m still thinking about my position when I lay my head on my pillow at night, I begin liquidation the next morning. I’m hesitant to say this because it could be misconstrued. You know that I’m a praying person. If I find myself praying about a position at any time, I liquidate it immediately. That’s a sure sign of disaster. God is not a market manipulator. I knew a trader once who thought he was. He went broke—the trader, I mean.

If it looks too good to be true, the rest of the market may know something that you don’t. But usually the way we miss opportunities in this business is by saying, “It looks too good to be true,” and then not doing anything. Too often we think that everybody else must know something that we don’t, and I think that’s a critical mistake. How many times have you heard someone put down an idea you’re excited about by saying, “If it’s such a good idea, why isn’t everyone doing it?” This is the battle cry of mediocrity. Think about it for a minute. Any investment opportunity that everyone else is doing is by definition a bad idea. I would always recommend doing the opposite.

I assume you either have it or you don’t. You can’t quite train yourself to act that way, can you?   I’m not sure, but I don’t think it’s innate. You can prepare for it by having a game plan, Once I had a coach who when I stepped up to the plate would yell, “Have an idea?! What are you going to do?” Investing is the same. You have to know what you’re going to do when the market gets out of line. Generally speaking, it’s human nature to hesitate.   What do you do to prepare?   I go through a mental process. I decide what I’m going to do when X, Y, or Z happens. If X, Y, or Z is a surprise, then you’re part of the crowd.

People off the floor have the idea that the traders on the floor are the first to know what’s going on. Nothing could be further from the truth. The market erupts long before we ever get the news. We’re the last to hear what’s driving the market. On that day. I had taken a large position in soybean meal at what looked like a great price. By the time I got out of the position, in what was probably only one minute, I had lost $100,000. ([Location 6441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=6441))

- In fact, this trade raises the whole question of how you view drawdowns. Most people don’t distinguish between drawdowns in open equity and drawdowns in closed equity. [The distinction is that open equity refers to unrealized profits on an existing position. In effect, what Ritchie is implying is that he views a given loss differently if it is a partial surrender of profits on a winning trade as opposed to if it is a drawdown in a losing trade.] If I protected open equity [i.e., open profits] with the same care I protected closed equity, I would never be able to participate in a long-term move. Any sensible overall risk control measure could not withstand the normal volatility in such a move.   In other words, in order to score the really large gains, you have to be willing to see those gains erode significantly before getting out of the market.   I can’t see any other way. If you get too careful about not risking your gains, you’re not going to be able to extract a large profit.   How much do you risk on any single trade or idea (measured from trade initiation, not peak equity)?   About one-half of I percent. I think it’s generally a good idea that when you put on a trade, it should be so small that it seems almost a waste of your time. Always trade at a level that seems too small.

My friend was teasing them about this and asked if they had ever thought of inspecting the horse. You won’t believe this, but it turns out that they had thought of it, but they didn’t go any further. So he said, “Well, you guys are all doctors; did you ever bend over and take a look under there to make sure he had the necessary tools?” If you asked those three doctors today what their mistake was, I’m sure they would tell you that they should have inspected the horse’s valuables. They still wouldn’t have learned the lesson: DON’T INVEST WHERE YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING. If they invest in another horse, they won’t get a gelding, but they’ll make some other mistake just as laughable.

- Do you mean to imply that people should just put their money in T-bills?   I think they can go with some of the managed funds or trading advisors that have proven track records. But I would take very seriously the standard disclaimer that says, “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” Also, I don’t think you can make money unless you’re willing to lose it. Unless you have money that you can afford to lose and still sleep at night, you don’t belong in the market. My willingness to lose is fundamental to my ability to make money in the markets.   And that’s not true of most people?   That’s right. Most people come into this business without a willingness to lose money. They also enter the market with unrealistic expectations. Even if they’re lucky enough to pick a successful trading advisor, they’re likely to pull their money out the first quarter he has a drawdown. So they end up losing even though they may have been in a winning situation. ([Location 6543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=6543))

In your own case, if the charity aspect were not there, do you think you would still be trading?   I’m not sure that I would be. I just don’t know. Incidentally, let me correct your use of the term charity. I don’t think in terms of charity. I think in terms of investing in the poor. If someone is starving and you hand him a buck, you’ve taught him that what he needs is for someone to give him a handout. I prefer to invest in the poor—to provide capital so they can enhance their own productivity. What the poor need are cottage industries that allow them to become self-sufficient.

- Five basic trading principles appear to be elemental to Mark Ritchie’s trading success. These can be summarized as follows: 1. Do your own research. 2. Keep each position size so small that it almost seems to be a waste of your time. 3. Have the patience to stay with a winning position as long as that position is working, even if it means keeping a single position for years. 4. View risk of open profits differently from the risk as measured from starting equity in a trade. The point is that in order to ride winning positions to their maximum potential, it is necessary to endure periodic losses in open profits greater than the risk level that would be advisable when a position is first implemented. 5. Recognize and control your greed. ([Location 6645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=6645))

- The 1979–80 silver market was one of the great bull markets of all time. [Silver soared from $5 per ounce to $50 per ounce in a little over a year.] Did you have any inkling of how high prices might go?   None whatsoever. In fact, even $10 per ounce seemed extremely far-fetched. I don’t know anybody who bought silver at relatively low prices and got out at over $20. The traders who bought silver at $3, $4, $5, and $6 did one of two things. Either, by the time silver got up to $7, $8, or $9 they got out, or they rode the position all the way up and all the way down. I’m sure there are exceptions, but I’ve never met one. I did, however, know traders that went short silver at $9 and $10 because the price seemed so ridiculously high and ended up riding the position until they had lost their entire net worth. That happened to some of the best professionals I knew in the silver market.   Would Hunt have succeeded if the exchange didn’t step in and change the rules by allowing trading for liquidation only, thereby averting a delivery squeeze?   The exchanges didn’t have to change the rules to prevent Hunt from taking delivery. According to the rules, the exchange has the power to step in and say, “Ok, you want silver, you can have your silver, but you’re going to have to spread out the delivery periods.” Or they can allow trading for liquidation only. If the exchanges had just stood aside and allowed a noneconomically driven demand for delivery, they would have been abrogating their responsibilities. At the time that the Hunts were standing for delivery of April silver, the forward contracts were trading at huge discounts. The Hunts had no immediate economic need for delivery. If all they really wanted was ownership of the silver, they could have switched their April contracts into the discounted forward months, locking in a huge net saving and also freeing up their capital for use in the interim. Or they could have purchased silver coins in the free market at $35 per ounce when the April contract was at $50. When instead of these economically sensible alternatives they insist, “No, no, no, we want to take delivery of the silver in April,” it indicates that they’re playing a game. That’s not what these markets are here for. So I feel that the Hunts got exactly what they had coming to them. A lot of innocent parties were hurt by the Hunt activity. For example, take a mine down in Peru whose cost of production is under $5 per ounce. When the price gets up to $15, the mine decides to lock in a huge profit by hedging their next two years’ worth of production in the silver futures market. This makes all the economic sense in the world. However, when the price keeps on going up to $20, $25, $30, $35, they have to keep putting up more and more variation margin on their short futures position. Eventually, they run out of money and are forced to liquidate their position, going broke in the process.   I know that CRT’s basic emphasis is option arbitrage, but I’m… ([Location 6793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=6793))

- What is your view of fundamental analysis versus technical analysis?   Back in the late I970s, I once gave a talk on technical analysis at a seminar. At lunch I ended up sitting at the same table as Richard Dennis. I asked him what percentage of his trading was technical and what percentage was fundamental. He answered with scorn in his voice, “I use zero percent fundamental information.” The way he answered, I was sorry I had asked the question. He continued, “I don’t know how you escape the argument that all fundamental information is already in the market.” I asked, “How do you escape the argument that all the technical information is already in the market?” He said, “I never thought of that.” I admired him for that. He had a humility about him that I think explains a lot of his success. My basic argument was that there are a number of technicians trading with the same information and the distribution of success is a matter of who uses that information better. Why shouldn’t it be the same with fundamentals? Just because all the information is in the market doesn’t mean that one trader can’t use it better than the next guy.

- An alternative interpretation is that the market is simply assuming that volatility in the period remaining until the option’s expiration will be different from the recent past volatility, called the historical volatility. The volatility assumption embedded in the market price is called the implied volatility. If option prices are a better predictor of future volatility than is the recent past volatility, then the question of whether an option is overpriced or underpriced is not only irrelevant but actually misleading. In essence, the question posed above is equivalent to asking whether there is any reason to assume that the strategy of buying options priced below their fair value and selling those that are above their fair value has any merit.]   Implied volatility seems better to me.   Conceptually or empirically?

The margins are a lot thinner than they used to be.   How do you handle that?   JOE: The margins go down, but the volume goes up. Also, in any business, the profit margin shrinks only up to a certain point. The margin can’t shrink so much that an efficient person in that business can’t put bread on the table. Therefore, if you can be the most efficient, there should always be a profit margin—maybe not all the time but certainly over the long run. I believe that’s true of virtually any business.

- On the day following the 508-point crash in the Dow Jones index [October 19, 1987], due to a combination of pervasive fear in the market and the increased capital requirements by the clearing firm, we couldn’t find anybody to execute our orders in the Major Market Index [MMI] traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. As a result, I was forced to go over there and trade in the pit myself. I heard rumors that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was considering calling a trading halt. [The CME trades the S&P 500 index futures contract.] If true, this would have represented a drastic action. I immediately ran to call up my desk to try to research what had happened after past trading halts. However, after about thirty minutes, they couldn’t find out anything. I sensed that the CME was about to halt trading. I called back the desk and said, “Make sure that we’re long on any trading halt.”   Why did you want to be long?   Because the fear was all out of proportion to reality. I had to be a buyer. We have a philosophy that involves always trying to provide liquidity to the market. The Merc eventually halted trading and about three minutes later a commission house broker was trying to get a bid on a one-hundred-lot sell order. The market was trading at 290 and nobody was bidding any size. I bid 285 and he sold me a hundred. A few minutes later, he sold me another fifty at the same price. Those were the only trades transacted at 285. The market closed at 400 that day.   Of course, in hindsight, that was a great trade—you ended up buying the low.

A lot of strategies promoted by brokers do not serve the interest of their clients at all.

- try to influence the price of the stock at expiration. Does that happen?   When I was a trader on the Pacific Stock Exchange, two smaller market makers wanted to pin the price of a particular stock to the strike. They wanted to sell the stock on the expiration date and make sure all the calls and puts went out worthless. They enlisted the aid of a large market maker in this scheme. The large market maker agreed to join their group and pin the stock at the strike. Instead, he took the opposite position and took them both out of the game. [He laughs at the recollection.] Actually, there is a natural tendency for stocks to finish at or near the strike. A few years ago I did some statistical work that was quoted in the Wall Street Journal. Speculators tend to be long the slightly in-the-money calls and they usually sell their option positions prior to expiration because they don’t want to exercise them. For example, let’s say a stock is trading at 60 1/2. Most of the open interest will be in the 60 calls. The public, which is long the 60 calls, will tend to sell this position as expiration approaches. The market maker will be on the other side of this trade, and in order to hedge himself he has to sell the stock.

- Jeff Yass started as an option trader on the floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 1981. He was so enthralled by the opportunities in option trading that he enticed a number of his college friends to try trading careers. During the early 1980s, he trained six of these friends as traders. In 1987, Yass and his friends joined to form Susquehanna Investment Group. The firm has grown rapidly and now employs 175 people, including 90 traders. Today, Susquehanna is one of the largest option trading firms in the world and one of the largest entities in program trading. Yass seeks out nuances of market inefficiencies through complex refinements of standard option pricing models. However, the essence of Yass’s approach is not necessarily having a better model but rather placing greater emphasis on applying mathematical game theory principals to maximize winnings. To Yass, the market is like a giant poker game, and you have to pay very close attention to the skill level of your opponents. As Yass explains it in one of his poker analogies, “If you’re the sixth best poker player in the world and you play with the five best players, you’re going to lose.

- A great example to illustrate this concept is a puzzle posed years ago by Fisher Black of the Black-Scholes option pricing model fame. Imagine that you’re on “Let’s Make a Deal,” and you have to pick one of the three doors. You pick door No. 1. Monty Hall says, “OK, Carol, open door No. 2.” The big prize is not behind door No. 2. Monty Hall, of course, knows which door the prize is behind. The way he played the game, he would never open the door with the real prize. Now he turns to you and asks, “Do you want to switch to door No. 3?” Do you stay with door No. ([Location 7756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=7756))

- l or switch’? [Reader: You might wish to think of your own answer before reading on.]   The obvious answer seems to be that it doesn’t make a difference, but obviously that must be the wrong answer.   The correct answer is that you should always switch to door No. 3. The probability that the prize is behind one of the two doors you did not pick was originally two-thirds. The fact that Monty opens one of those two doors and there is nothing behind it doesn’t change this original probability, because he will always open the wrong door. Therefore, if the probability of the prize being behind one of those two doors was two-thirds originally, the probability of it being behind the unopened of those two doors must still be two-thirds.   I don’t understand. This show was watched by millions of people for years, and yet no one realized that the odds were so heavily skewed in favor of switching!   You have to remember that you’re talking about a show where people had to wear funny rabbit ears to get picked. The thing that confuses people is that the process is not random. If Monty randomly chose one… ([Location 7760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=7760))

- The key is that he didn’t randomly select one of the doors; he always picked the wrong door, and that changes the probabilities. It’s a classic example of conditional probability. If the probability of the prize being behind door No. 2 or door No. 3 is two-thirds, given that it’s not door No. 2, what is the probability that it’s door No. 3? The answer, of course, is two-thirds.   Ironically, four weeks after my interview with Jeff Yass, the New York Times ran an article on the exact same puzzle. The Times article reported that when Marilyn Vos Savant answered this puzzle correctly in her Parade column in response to a reader’s inquiry, she received nearly a thousand critical (and misguided) letters from Ph.D.s, mostly mathematicians and scientists. The Times article engendered its own slew of letters to the editor. Some of these provided particularly lucid and convincing explanations of the correct answer and are reprinted below: To the Editor: Re “Behind Monty Hall’s Doors: Puzzle Debate and Answer?” (front page, July 21): One reason people have trouble understanding the correct solution to the puzzle involving three doors, two with goats behind them and one with a car, is that the problem uses only three doors. This makes the assumed, but incorrect, probability of picking the car (1 in 2) appear too close to the actual probability (1 in 3) and the solution difficult to arrive at intuitively. To illustrate better the right answer—that a player should switch the door picked first after one of the other two has been opened by Monty Hall, the game-show host—suppose the game were played with 100 doors, goats behind 99 and a car behind 1. When first offered a door, a player would realize that the chances of picking the car are low (1 in 100). If Monty Hall then opened 98 doors with goats behind them, it would be clear that the chance the car is behind the remaining unselected door is high (99 in 100). Although only two doors would be left (the one the player picked and the unopened door), it would no longer appear that the car is equally likely to be behind either. To change the pick would be intuitive to most people.

- There are actually two logical reasons. One I can tell you; the other I can’t. One basic factor is that there is a much greater probability of financial panic on the downside than on the upside. For example, once in a great while, you may get a day with the Dow down 500 points, but it’s far less likely that the Dow will go up 500 points. Given the nature of markets, the chance of a crash is always greater than the chance of an overnight runaway euphoria.   Did the markets always price puts significantly higher than calls for that reason?   No. The market didn’t price options that way until after the October 1987 crash. However, I had always felt that the chance of a huge downmove was much greater than the chance of an upmove of equivalent size.   Did you reach the conclusion about the bias in favor of larger downmoves based on a study of historical markets?   No, nothing that elaborate. Just by watching markets, I noticed that prices tend to come down much harder and faster than they go up.   Does this directional bias apply only to stock index options? Or does it also apply to individual stock options?   The options on most major stocks are priced that way [i.e., puts are more expensive than calls], ([Location 7858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=7858))

- A lot of these insider trading cases involve options, and we’re the people who lose the money. For example, just today they caught an employee of Marion Labs who obviously had inside information that Dow was going to offer a takeover bid for the company. This person had bought five hundred of the July 25 calls at $1 [total cost: $50,000], and the next day the options were worth $10 [total position value: $500,0001. In the old days—before options—someone with this type of information might buy the stock, and even assuming 50 percent margin, the profit percentage wouldn’t be that large. However, now, by buying options, traders with inside information can increase their profit leverage tremendously. Sometimes I feel sorry for some of these people because, until the recent barrage of publicity regarding insider trading, I’m not sure that many of them even realized they were breaking the law. However, since they come to the options market first, we’re the ones on the other side of the trade getting picked off.   I don’t understand. Doesn’t the SEC scrutinize the order flow when there’s an announced takeover to make sure there are no suspicious orders?   Yes, they do, and they’re getting particularly effective in catching people trading on insider information. They have also become much more efficient in returning money to those on the other side of these trades. However, in earlier years, the process took much longer. One famous example involved Santa Fe, an oil company that was a takeover target by the Kuwaitis in 1981. At the time, the stock was at $25 and the option traders on the floor filled ([Location 7914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=7914))

- an order for one thousand 35 calls at $1/16. Shortly afterwards, the stock jumped from $25 to $45 and the options went from $1/16 to $10. The floor traders had a virtual overnight loss of about $1 million. Although they eventually got their money back, it took years. If you’re a market maker and you’re broke, waiting to get your capital back is not pleasant. You live in fear that you’re going to be the one selling the option to an informed source. Eventually, everyone gets picked off, because if you try to avoid it completely, you’re going to pass up a lot of good trading opportunities. In a nutshell, if you’re too conservative, you won’t do any trades, and if you’re too aggressive, you’re going to get picked off a lot. The trick is to try to strike a balance between the two.   Can you think of a recent example in which you were picked off?   The options for Combustion Engineering are traded on the Pacific Coast Exchange. The options rarely trade. One morning, we received a call from the board broker (the exchange employee responsible for managing order imbalances). He said there was an order to buy several hundred options and inquired whether we wanted to take the other side. The stock was trading at around $25, and we agreed to sell three hundred of the 25 calls at approximately $2 1/2.

One obvious application of this concept is that regardless of your trading style, a betting (i.e., trading) strategy that increases the stakes on trades deemed to have a higher probability of success could significantly enhance the final results.

- One of the hazards of doing a book of this sort is that you can go through the arduous process of transforming a rambling 250-page raw transcript into a readable 25-page chapter only to have the interview subject withhold permission to use the material. (In order to provide an atmosphere conducive to openness on the part of those I interviewed, I felt it necessary to offer them the right of final refusal.) One of the traders I interviewed, an individual who had made several hundred million dollars in trading profits for his firm, felt that the resulting chapter, which contained a lot of copy related to intuition, dreams, Eastern philosophy, and trading anecdotes, presented an image of him that would be viewed askance by his corporate clients. I prevailed upon him, however, to allow me to use the following excerpt anonymously, as I felt it offered an unusual and insightful perspective on trading.   I still don’t understand your trading method. How could you make these huge sums of money by just watching the screen?   There was no system to it. It was nothing more than, “I think the market is going up, so I’m going to buy.” “It’s gone up enough, so I’m going to sell.” It was completely impulsive. I didn’t sit down and formulate any trading plan. I don’t know where the intuition comes from, and there are times when it goes away.   How do you recognize when it goes away?   When I’m wrong three times in a row, I call time out. Then I paper trade for a while.   For how long do you paper trade?   Until I think I’m in sync with the market again. Every market has a rhythm, and our job as traders is to get in sync with that rhythm. I’m not really trading when I’m doing those trades. There’s trading being done, but I’m not doing it.   What do you mean you’re not doing it? ([Location 8005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8005))

There’s just an awareness of what will happen. The trick is to differentiate between what you want to happen and what you know will happen. The intuition knows what will happen.

- NLP is based on principles different from those in psychology. Five essential principles or presuppositions guide NLP. The first is: The map is not the territory. The map is our thoughts and feelings; the territory is reality. We respond to our thoughts and feelings about reality; we don’t respond to reality. This is good news because it means that it is possible to get a better map—a better way to think and feel. The second fundamental principle of NLP is: Experience has a structure. In other words, the way in which memories are arranged in our minds determines what they will mean and how they will affect us. If we can change the structure of our memories, we will experience those events in our lives differently. Change the structure of our thoughts and our experiences will change automatically. The third major principle of NLP is: If one person can do it, anyone else can learn to do it. This is the great promise of NLP. Excellence and achievement have a structure that can be copied. By modeling successful people, we can learn from the experience of those who have already succeeded. If we can learn to use our brains in the same way as the exceptionally talented person, we can possess the essence of that talent. The fourth basic principle is: The mind and body are part of the same system. If you change your mind about something, your abilities will change. If you change your posture, breathing, or other parts of your physiology, your thoughts will change. The great psychiatrist R. D. Laing used to say, “Change your mind, change your body. Change your body, change your mind.” The fifth principle is: People have all the resources they need. In NLP, an image, a sound, or a feeling is a resource. Our brain has the ability to see inner pictures. Whether these pictures begin as fuzzy or clear, they can be built up into great motivating visions. Inner voices can criticize us or they can encourage and guide us. Any feeling we’ve had in our lives—confidence, challenge, indomitable will, whatever it is—even if we’ve only had it once, can be transferred to any situation in our lives where we want or need it.   When you say, “The map is not the territory,” do you mean that people have distorted views of reality that lead them astray?   NLP believes that all maps (mental and physical) are a distorted, or selected, view of reality.

- One NLP exercise that deals with this question is having people imagine themselves at the end of their lives. Some people are reluctant to do this exercise, but when I tell them to go ahead and imagine that it’s been a very long, healthy, and active life, they’re more willing to try it. Then I ask them to look back on what they have accomplished, and see whether they wish they had done something else or something more. Although it’s a mind trick, by adopting this end-of-life perspective, unconscious expectations are revealed, and people find it easier to make an assessment about what they really want to fill their lives. I ask my clients, “What is really worth the time of your life?” The idea for this exercise came out of an experience I had when I was in college. I worked as an orderly in a hospital ward that typically had lots of elderly patients. Over the course of three years, I spoke to hundreds of people who were near the end of their lives. I asked these people how their lives had been, what they liked about their lives and what they regretted, if anything.   What did you find out?   I found out that falling in love at nineteen was important. I found out that the willingness to take risks into the unknown, like leaving one’s small hometown, was important. On the other hand, just simply retiring because of age was something many of them felt was the biggest mistake of their lives. One thing that really struck me was that not one of these people said they truly regretted anything they had actually done—what they regretted was what they hadn’t done. They regretted that they had wasted their lives on petty ([Location 8203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8203))

- Obviously, motivation is critical to achieving goals. Is that the only critical factor, or is there more to it?   NLP research has shown that five conditions must he met in order for a goal to be achievable. First, the goal must be stated in positive terns. It’s not getting rid of something—for example, “I don’t want to lose money.” Rather, it needs to be stated in positive terms—for example, “I want to protect my assets.” The second condition is that the goal needs to be yours. “They want me to trade larger,” is an example of a goal that does not meet this condition. Instead, if your goal is, “When market conditions warrant it, I’m going to double my trading size,” you’re much more likely to reach that goal. Third, the goal must be specific. Nothing ever happens in general. The more richly detailed the description of your goal—what you’ll see, hear, and feel when you get it—the better. The fourth condition adds the when, where, and with whom. The fifth condition for achieving a goal is anticipating the effects of the goal. Is it worthwhile and desirable in itself and in its effects? This brings us full circle to having goals we really want and that will fulfill us.

- supply. No doubt the paucity of hard scientific experimental evidence is due to the extreme difficulty of measuring the results of NLP, which deal largely with feelings and beliefs. However, one of the hallmarks of NLP is that it virtually guarantees quick results. Therefore, if you try NLP in one of its forms (books, tapes, seminars, or one-on-one sessions), you should be able to make a fairly quick determination of whether the approach has any validity for you. The broader questions of NLP’s merits aside, I did find certain aspects of Faulkner’s message compelling. First, I found the concept of mission a highly useful mental construct for focusing goals and intensifying motivation. My listening to Faulkner’s tapes coincided with a surge in my personal efforts to further a commodity trading advisory venture and significant progress in that regard. I also think there is a great deal of merit to Faulkner’s list of the six key steps in achievement: Use both Toward and Away From motivation. Have a goal of full capability plus, with anything less being unacceptable. Break down potentially overwhelming goals into chunks, with satisfaction garnered from the completion of each individual step. Fully concentrate on the present moment of time—that is, the single task at hand rather than the long-term goal. Personally involve yourself in achieving goals (as opposed to depending on others). Make self-to-self comparisons to measure progress. ([Location 8501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8501))

- The above elements have important implications and applications to trading. As one example, the stress on self-involvement would imply that it is unlikely for people to succeed at trading by completely relying on someone else’s system. As another, the focus on self-to-self comparisons implies that traders should judge their progress based on their own past performance, not the performance of other traders. The image that Faulkner paints of a successful trader is in stark contrast to popular perceptions. Most people probably think of great traders as the Evil Knievels of the financial world—individuals willing to take great risks, drawn to their calling by the adrenalin-charged excitement. According to Faulkner, nothing could be further from the truth. Successful traders have learned to avoid risk, not seek it. Moreover, very few of them trade for excitement. On the contrary, based on Faulkner’s observations, one of the hallmarks of successful traders is their ability to maintain a calm, detached emotional state while trading. They may get excitement in their lives, but it’s not from trading. Many of Faulkner’s comments have relevance to more than just trading.

If the person is really hypnotized, you won’t be able to push the arm down, regardless of the force applied—even if the subject is a physically weak person.   Was there anything memorable about your first trading client?   I would like to say that the procedure was immensely successful, but the truth is that the person didn’t experience any overnight transformation. It took many years before I realized why hypnosis was very effective with some traders but not others.   What is the reason?   Some traders have a valid methodology that they have adequately back-tested and that their conscious mind is happy with. These are the traders who can usually be helped through hypnosis. The only thing hypnosis can do is to inform the subconscious mind that the person now has a valid methodology that the conscious mind has already accepted.

- Besides aiding in your transformation from losing trader to winning trader, how else did the exposure to hypnosis affect you?   It’s no exaggeration to say that hypnosis changed my perception of reality.   In what way?   I discovered that there was another world that I was totally unaware of: the subconscious. I realized that the subconscious mind had the power to overcome the conscious mind. Today, of course, I no longer think in those terms. I now understand that the subconscious and conscious minds have to be in harmony. The more closely the conscious mind is aligned with the subconscious, the easier it is to generate winnings. To keep those winnings,… ([Location 8675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8675))

- YES! YES! YES!   How can you be so certain?   Because I’ve seen the process time and time and time again.   Could you give me an anonymous case history?   A few years ago, I worked with a man who had traded very successfully for over thirty years. All of a sudden, he started losing six-figure amounts monthly. He had been losing this amount for about five consecutive months when he came to me for help. It turned out that the onset of his losing streak coincided with his being left by his wife, who was a much younger woman. As soon as I helped him realize that the breakup of his marriage was not his own fault and that his wife’s affections went only as deep as his pocketbook, his trading began to change dramatically. Within three days, he was breaking even, and within another three days, he was making money. Once he had begun winning again, I questioned him under hypnosis. “… ([Location 8686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8686))

- Why did he feel he didn’t deserve his winnings?   That was exactly my next question. Apparently, he believed that the breakup of his marriage was due to his inability to perform sexually at the same level he had as a younger man. Because at the subconscious level he felt that he had failed his wife, he was punishing himself by losing in the markets. He felt he didn’t deserve to win anymore because of his inadequacy.   Is the implication that people always lose because they feel that they don’t deserve to win? No. Some people lose because they feel they don’t deserve to win, but more people lose because they never perform the basic tasks necessary to become a winning trader.   What are those tasks? Develop a competent analytical methodology. Extract a reasonable trading plan from this methodology. Formulate rules for this plan that incorporate money management techniques. Back-test the plan over a sufficiently… ([Location 8701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8701))

- Can you describe a specific situation in which you advised a client to give up trading?   One person hated his wife but didn’t have the courage to divorce her. Ironically, it was his wife who had sent him to me. He was a successful professional man who had been trading for two years and losing money steadily. Under hypnosis, it came out that the only way he saw out of his dilemma was to make himself church-mouse poor so that his wife would walk out on him. The strategy was to make his financial losses look legitimate. He couldn’t make himself look bad through his own profession, because he was so good at it. So every month in which he made X thousand dollars in his profession, he would give back X thousand plus in the commodity markets.   Did he admit all of this under hypnosis? Or was this your analytical interpretation? ([Location 8761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8761))

- I asked him straight out under hypnosis, “Are you getting back at your wife? Do you feel that if you lose enough money in the markets, she’ll walk out on you?” He exclaimed. “That’s the idea!”   That was his subconscious talking?   Absolutely. In his conscious mind this man would never admit to this motivation.   Was this a person who believed he wanted to trade?   Not only did he want to trade, he felt he had to trade. He emphatically told me, “I love to trade the markets. I prefer trading to my profession.” ([Location 8769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8769))

- Any other unusual case histories come to mind?   There was one rather humorous situation that occurred while I was still in London. One day this man came to me and said, “Mr. Krausz, I’ve heard good things about you. I don’t know whether you can help me, but do you ever work with traders’ wives?” “It would be a first,” I admitted, “but I suppose it could be done. What seems to be the problem?” I asked. He said, “Every day, my broker sends me my runs, but I never receive them. My wife pinches them.” “What do you mean she pinches them?” I asked. “She hides them from me,” he answered. “She meets the mailman and intercepts my statements before I ever get them. At first I didn’t realize what was happening. I… ([Location 8778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8778))

- I said, “This is ridiculous. Can’t you go out and meet the mailman first?” “I can’t go!” he exclaimed. “The mailman comes in the middle of the trading day; I’m busy watching the quote screen. We’ve got to find out why she’s hiding my statements.”   “Why don’t you simply ask her?” I suggested. “She denies it,” he answered. “Go on and get her on the phone yourself. You’ll see that she’ll deny everything.” I called his wife and said, “I have your husband in my office. Exactly what is the problem with the missing statements?” She replied, “Mr. Krausz, I promise you that I never touch his mail.” So I asked her, “What then do you think happens to his statements?” “He hides them himself,” she answered. “He never opens them.” I thought to myself, That’s very interesting. I thanked her, hung up the phone, and said to her husband, “Why don’t we just have a short hypnotherapy session right now; no charge. Maybe I can help you in figuring out how to handle your wife with this problem.” “Good idea,” he enthusiastically replied. There are various levels of hypnosis. After about half an hour, I had him at the level I wanted. I asked him, “What is happening to your brokerage statements?” “Why, I… ([Location 8789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8789))

- “And do you send the money in?” I queried. “Oh yes,” he replied. “I have to. Otherwise, I would have to stop trading—wouldn’t I? My broker would just close the account.” I asked, “Would you like him to close the account?” “Oh no, I love trading!” he trumpeted. “Well, do you know that you’re losing money?” I asked. “Certainly, I’m not a fool,” he said authoritatively. “Where do you hide your statements?” I inquired. “Oh, I can’t tell you that,” he whispered. “You’ll just tell my wife.” “I promise that I won’t tell her,” I assured him. “But, tell me, what would happen if she found out?” “She’d be very cross,” he said. “She’d throw me out of the house.” “Why would she do that?” I asked. “Because I’m losing money that I should be giving her to buy new dresses.” I thought to myself, The best favor I can do for this chap is to stop him from trading. I brought him out of hypnosis and made an appointment to see him again the following week. Before he left, he turned to me and asked, “Do you think you can get my wife to tell us where she’s hiding the statements?” I said, “We’ll talk about that next time.” “Why don’t I bring her along… ([Location 8809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8809))

- I put him under hypnosis, and I told his wife exactly what had happened. She nonchalantly replied, “Oh, I know he’s hiding his statements. I even know where he’s hiding them, but I dare not say anything, because it will destroy him.” She was obviously a very clever woman. Under hypnosis I told him, “Your wife has agreed to turn over to you all your back statements. Moreover, she has promised that she will never stop the mailman again, as long as you take responsibility for your own actions and stop playing the fool.” “Are you sure?” he asked. “I’m sure,” I replied. “In fact, I’m going to bring you out of hypnosis now, and your wife is going to put this agreement in writing.” He thanked me energetically, and I brought him out of hypnosis. Three days later, his wife called to tell me he had closed his account.   What had been his motivation for trading?   Just thrills. He was leading a very boring life. He held a civil service position and this was just his way of seeking some excitement. [His job only required a minimal number of hours of attendance in a consulting capacity; hence he was able to trade during the day.]   What motivated him to stop trading?   When he was confronted with the piece of paper stating that his wife would turn over all his past statements, he knew that she knew where he had been hiding them because that was the only way that she could give him the mail that she had supposedly intercepted. At this point, his conscious mind realized what had been happening. His wife told me that, the next day. he pulled out the hidden statements, put them on the dining room table, and said, “Aha! I see that you have finally decided to give me all the mail.” She said, “Yes dear; here it is; take it.” The next day, he phoned his broker and closed the account.   What is the most surprising thing you have discovered about human behavior or human nature… ([Location 8829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8829))

Incidentally, traders who do not set goals or targets find it much more difficult to achieve high returns than traders who set such goals.   What do you mean by “creative visualization”?   Using trading as an example, in a deep-relaxation state you see yourself applying your methodology, and you then see this methodology succeeding.

- According to Krausz, the major factors traders cite as the reasons for why they lose—lack of confidence, fear of loss, and poor execution—are all a consequence of not having a trading plan. Clearly, based on this premise, the absolutely essential first step for a trader is to develop a trading plan. Once such a plan has been constructed, the trader must adequately back-test the method to gain the necessary confidence in the validity of the approach. Thus far, the advice is sound but hardly unconventional. Krausz offers a more unique view in his discussion of the role of the subconscious as an impediment to trading success. Krausz explains that subconscious beliefs will dictate a person’s actions. The point is that if the subconscious believes that a person is a losing trader based on prior experiences, it will continue to hold that view even after the trader has developed an effective methodology. These beliefs, predicated on past experiences, can cause a person to feel fears that may no longer he appropriate. These fears can lead to what Krausz’s mentor, Charles Drummond, called the “freeze.” Thus, Krausz believes that once an effective trading plan is developed, it is critical to convince the subconscious mind of the new reality. The greater the harmony between the conscious and subconscious… ([Location 8906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QTEA4C&location=8906))

- I am frequently asked whether writing this volume and the first Market Wizards helped me become a better trader. The answer is yes, but not in the way people expect when they ask the question. No trader revealed to me any great market secrets or master plan unlocking the grand design of the markets. (If this is what you seek, don’t despair, the answer is readily available—just check the ads in any financial periodical.) For me, the single most important lesson provided by the interviews is that it is absolutely necessary to adopt a trading approach precisely suited to one’s own personality.
