## Highlights
- These are the rules or principles that I’ve followed over the past 50 years of investing. I’ll talk about them in more detail as I go through the book, but taken as a whole, these provide some key lessons for the investor. Endeavour to buy shares on modest valuations – hopefully ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=193))

- with an attractive yield and single-figure price earnings ratio and/or discount to net asset value/real worth. Ignore the overall level of the stock market. Don’t make judgements on the macro outlook – leave that to commentators and economists. Focus on your particular selection. Be prepared to hold for a minimum of five years. Have a broad understanding of the PLC’s main business activity – one which makes sense to you. Ignore minor share price movements. Looking back years hence you will have got it either right or wrong; whether you originally paid, say, 55 pence rather than 50 pence will be totally irrelevant. Seek established companies with a record of profitability and dividend payments – avoid start-ups and biotech or exploration stocks. Look for moderately optimistic or better chairman’s/CEO’s most recent comments. Focus on preferably conservative, cash-rich companies or those with low levels of debt. Ensure the directors have meaningful shareholdings themselves in the PLC and ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=196))

- ‘clean’ reputations. Look for a stable Board – infrequent directorate changes. Similarly with professional advisers. Face up to poor decisions. Apply a 20% ‘stop-loss’ – sell and move on. However, ignore stop-loss if there is a major overall market fall. Let profitable holdings run. Don’t try to be too clever, i.e. selling and hoping the market will fall to ‘buy back’ at a lower price. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=204))

- However, do focus on directors’ shareholdings – any changes compared with last year, the level of borrowings and particularly the comments of the chairman and the CEO on future prospects. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=250))

- Personally, I like to buy shares on a modest valuation – ideally, say, a dividend yield of 5–6% – and on a single-figure PER. Apart from the obvious attractions of receiving the dividend, the payment of a dividend acts as a significant discipline on the Board of a PLC in that it has to find the cash, each year, to pay those dividends.

- Now what should you look for in the ideal investment? What we want is a company that increases profits (and hopefully dividends) each year and where the rating (PE ratio) that the stock market/investors place on the company’s shares increases significantly. This is the ‘double whammy’ any investor should be seeking. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=347))

- Smaller caps, established, profitable, conservative dividend-paying companies, cash positive, or with low levels of debts are for me, preferably having a recognised ‘brand’ or unique selling point (USP) and preferably also trading internationally. The FTSE Small Cap Index contains smaller companies outside the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 indices. These companies make up about 2% of the UK market.

- you are losing on a particular stock. My advice is to apply a 20% stop-loss, i.e. sell shares if they fall 20% below the original purchase price. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=1238))

- As the legendary Warren Buffett famously said: ‘Lethargy bordering on sloth remains the cornerstone of our investment style.’ Definitely an attitude to be encouraged. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=1252))

- However, two rules: first, always buy property shares at a discount to net assets, and second, once again put time into the equation – be patient, your ship will eventually come home. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H83R154&location=1696))
