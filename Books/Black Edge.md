## Highlights
- If there was one person who personified the rise of hedge funds, and the way they transformed Wall Street, it was Steven Cohen. He was an enigmatic figure, even to those in his own industry, but his average returns of 30 percent a year for twenty years were legendary. What was especially intriguing about him was that his performance wasn’t based on any well-understood strategy, unlike other prominent investors such as George Soros or Paul Tudor Jones; he wasn’t famous for betting on global economic trends or predicting the decline of the housing market. Cohen simply seemed to have an intuitive sense for how markets moved, and he entered the industry at precisely the moment when society reoriented itself to reward that skill above almost all others. He traded in and out of stocks in rapid-fire fashion, dozens of them in a single day. Young traders longed to work for him and rich investors begged to put their money in his hands. By 2012, SAC had become one of the world’s most profitable investment funds, managing $15 billion. On Wall Street, “Stevie,” as Cohen was known, was like a god.

- Hedge funds are always trying to find what traders call “edge”—information that gives them an advantage over other investors. At a certain point, this quest for edge inevitably bumps up against, and then crosses, a line: advance knowledge of a company’s earnings, word that a chipmaker will get a takeover offer next week, an early look at drug trial results. This kind of information—proprietary, nonpublic, and certain to move markets—is known on Wall Street as “black edge,” and it’s the most valuable information of all. Trading on it is also usually illegal. When one trader was asked if he knew of any fund that didn’t traffic in inside information, he said: “No, they would never survive.” In this way, black edge is like doping in elite-level cycling or ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=307))

- At Gruntal, Aizer had implemented a strategy called “option arbitrage.” There was a precise mathematical relationship dictating how the price of the option should change relative to the price of the underlying stock. Theoretically, in a perfect market, the price of a put option, the price of a call option, and the price at which the stock was trading would be in alignment. Because options were new and communication between markets was sometimes slow, this equation occasionally fell out of line, creating a mismatch between the different prices.

- “Which constitutional right is that?” the staff attorney asked. “The provision that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself,” Obermaier answered. “That’s his ‘Fifth Amendment right,’ ” the staff attorney said. Frustrated, the SEC attorney tried to insist that Cohen answer the question about the documents himself. During depositions there was usually a struggle over this point. It was always a goal of the SEC to get a witness to admit that ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=620))

- he was “taking the Fifth” on the record when he was refusing to answer their questions; it could be used later as an inference of guilt. If you were innocent, the thinking went, why wouldn’t you use the opportunity to tell the SEC all about it? White collar defense attorneys were well aware of this, of course, so it was their job to resist and try to avoid letting the client say that he was “taking the Fifth,” even when he was taking the Fifth, for precisely the same reason. It was standard legal maneuvering. “He has to assert personally his right not to produce documents under the Fifth Amendment,” the SEC staff attorney said, trying again. “I don’t think he does,” Obermaier replied. He had no intention of letting Cohen say a word. “I’m responding as his lawyer.” “What is your date and place of birth?” the staff attorney asked. Cohen and Obermaier had rehearsed this. “Upon the advice of counsel,” Cohen said, “I respectfully decline to answer the question on the ground that I’m being compelled to be a witness against myself.” “Did you purchase securities on behalf of Gruntal & Co. in December of 1985 while in possession of nonpublic information concerning RCA?” “Same response,” Cohen said. They went back and forth. The staff attorney asked more questions: Did Cohen purchase RCA shares in his own account in December 1985? Did anyone tell him that RCA would be involved in a merger ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=624))

- with General Electric prior to the public announcement? Did Cohen, in December 1985, recommend that anyone else buy RCA shares? Each time Cohen repeated the same answer, taking the Fifth without saying that he was taking the Fifth. Then the staff attorney asked, “Are you familiar with an entity known as J. Goldman & Company?” The attorney was referring to Cohen’s close friend Jay Goldman, a.k.a. “J-Bird,” who had formed his own trading firm after leaving Gruntal the previous year. Cohen barely registered any recognition. “Same response,” he said. The testimony was over in twenty minutes. Riding the elevator back down to the lobby, Obermaier felt confident that he had done the best he could to save his client from prosecution. Cohen, however, was badly shaken by the experience. Refusing to answer questions before a law enforcement agency usually made people sound guilty, even if they weren’t. The RCA investigation was still ongoing. He felt he was now at risk of losing his livelihood. He was more irritable than usual during the day and spent most evenings… ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=636))

- Within a relatively short time, the gloom of Black Monday went away. The stock market started another long climb. The SEC’s RCA insider trading investigation petered out, apparently without charges or sanctions against anyone. The same happened with the criminal case. Through it all, a lesson that many other suspects of financial crime would come to understand in the future had emerged: Taking the Fifth ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=711))

- The way to make money in the stock market, Cohen believed, was by taking intelligent risks. If you had a good investment idea but you were too scared to put a lot of capital behind it, you couldn’t make abundant profits. Cohen figured that 5 percent of his trades accounted for most of the money he made. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=737))

- Cohen was a little different. He wasn’t particularly fantastic at math, he didn’t study global economies, he had no unique investing philosophy. He was just a great trader, one who was so good that a traditional Wall Street career couldn’t contain him. Having his own hedge fund gave him an entrée to a new universe of wealth and power.

- Between 1998 and 1999, SAC reached an important marker, surpassing $1 billion a year in assets, which was achieved after five years of almost doubling their money each year. As SAC grew, though, the drawbacks of its bare-knuckled investing approach became increasingly hard for Cohen to ignore. He had hundreds of millions of dollars to invest, and, by necessity, the size of the positions the fund took were larger than they’d ever been before. But Cohen’s trading method, which continued to be a form of day-trading, only worked with a smaller pool of money, where one could build more modest, but significant, positions and get out of them quickly.

- In late 2004, an ambitious young employee approached Cohen with an idea: What if they developed an exclusive new unit at SAC, a trading group that was driven by in-depth research? The concept was to have traders who were focused on developing industry expertise, in the mold of the famous investor Warren Buffett, who took large stakes in companies and held them for decades ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1124))

- through his wildly successful firm Berkshire Hathaway. They wouldn’t be concerned with tiny stock price movements when companies announced their earnings each quarter, for example, and as a result, the firm would be less dependent on Cohen and his intuition for those kinds of trades. These new traders and analysts would become authorities on the companies they were researching. Over a series of meetings, the employee, a manager in his twenties named Matthew Grossman, outlined his vision for Cohen. He referred to it as SAC’s “top gun.” Part of the purpose of the new unit, Grossman explained, would be to manage Cohen’s own portfolio, which deserved to be handled by the best people at the firm. They would hire a bunch of new analysts and traders to staff it, and it would become the firm’s equivalent of the Navy SEALs. Cohen was intrigued. It was really an extension of what he was trying to do already. The concept appealed to his sense of vanity in that it made him sound more like a visionary than a profiteer. Even people who disapproved of Wall Street generally admired Warren Buffett, who got calls from bank presidents and Treasury secretaries seeking his counsel. But the research unit also made business sense. SAC was now managing billions of dollars; a more studious, longer-term approach was wise. Cohen liked Grossman, who was privileged and precocious. He’d attended Deerfield Academy, an elite boarding school in Massachusetts, and gone to college at Columbia, and then finagled ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1126))

- himself a job as the first-ever college intern at Julian Robertson’s trailblazing hedge fund Tiger Management. Grossman had been with SAC since 2002. Before his boss could get too excited, Grossman told Cohen that he had three conditions before he would agree to help build the new group: that if the new unit didn’t work out, he would be given a job as a portfolio manager; that he would be paid a percentage of the new unit’s overall performance; and that he would command the same level of authority within SAC as Cohen—specifically, that everyone at SAC had to know that a directive from Grossman was as important as one from Cohen himself. Much to the surprise of many at SAC, Cohen told Grossman to go ahead. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1137))

- Finding people to work at CR Intrinsic, SAC’s new division, was the focus of Sol Kumin’s job. The new traders had to have more than a track record; they had to be brilliant and have industry expertise, and they weren’t easy to find. He heard about one portfolio manager who sounded promising, a biotechnology specialist at a small hedge fund called Sirios Capital Management, in Boston. The biotechnology industry was booming, with dozens of companies competing to produce new drugs with enormous economic potential. Understanding what they all did was not easy. The young man projected a serious, inscrutable eggheadedness, as if he were a surgeon or medical researcher rather than a mere investor in medical companies. He had recently gotten an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, one of the top business schools in the country. His name was Mathew Martoma. “Would you be open to considering a job at SAC?” Kumin asked him. Martoma wasn’t sure. Like everyone in his industry, he had heard stories about SAC, and he wasn’t sure if he was suited to the intense culture. He was quiet and courteous, not someone who handled open conflict well. Still, one aspect of the job was very interesting—the money. Kumin explained the details. Martoma would have a portfolio of about $400 million to invest, putting it in the ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1205))

- middle in terms of relative size at the firm. He would also have a guarantee that he’d take home more than 17 percent of the profits he made in his portfolio, as well as a portion of any profit Cohen made based on the ideas Martoma supplied. If he returned just 15 percent at the end of the year, he’d make more than $10 million. Almost no other hedge fund offered such a generous arrangement. Plus, he would be part of SAC’s new research team, working with the most talented people at the company. At home that night, Martoma debated the job offer with his wife, Rosemary. She was a doctor, and she was involved in every decision he made. They concluded, based on the compensation and the prestige of working at one of the best-known hedge funds in the industry, that it was worth pursuing the job. On June 2, 2006, SAC sent him an official job offer. It included a base salary of $200,000 and a signing bonus of $2 million. Kumin noted in an internal report that Martoma had great sources of information in the biotechnology world, including a network of doctors “in the field.” Martoma signed the offer letter and sent it back. If he was smart about it, no one in his family would ever have to work again. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1215))

- One in particular was of great interest to him, the Gerson Lehrman Group, which was an “expert network” or “matchmaking” firm. The matches it made were between Wall Street investors like Martoma and people who worked inside hundreds of different publicly traded companies, people responsible for ordering new truck parts or buyers for retail chains who could provide insight on their industries, their competitors, or even their own firms. The investors paid GLG a fee to connect them with these company employees, who in turn were paid handsomely—sometimes as much as $1,000 an hour or more—to talk to the investors. The company employees were supposed to share only information that was publicly available, to avoid breaking any laws. Or at least that was the idea. By the 2000s, after years of regulatory scrutiny, most traders had become more careful about sensitive mergers and acquisitions information. The Michael Milken case had taught traders to avoid buying shares of companies right before takeovers were announced; big price movements in stocks right before takeovers were announced often drew the attention of the SEC. Still, investors were desperate for information that might provide them with an advantage, and they went to a lot of effort to get it. Hedge fund analysts monitored shopping mall parking lots and sent spotters to China to watch trucks driving in and out of factory loading bays, searching for unique insights into how companies were doing. It was understood that information already in the public domain, like a company’s SEC filings or earnings releases, was essentially worthless for trading purposes. In the years since the Milken case, short-term investors had turned their attention to quarterly earnings announcements instead, particularly of companies in the technology and science sectors, where the stocks could move dramatically after the results were made public. Setting up the right trade anticipating a company’s earnings release became an incredibly profitable strategy, but it only worked if you got good information about the earnings before they were announced. Getting earnings intelligence, then, was what hedge fund traders became focused on. They badgered corporate executives for hints about what might happen. Would the third-quarter results be disappointing? Was a big announcement about next year’s growth plan coming up? The traders used whatever crumbs they gathered from these interactions—from the “body language” of the CFO to explicit details provided by investor relations staff—to trade in and out of the stock. In 2000, the SEC, deciding that such shenanigans were bad for the market, passed a rule called Regulation Fair Disclosure, often called “Regulation FD.” It prohibited public companies from offering important information ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1250))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- about their businesses to some investors and not others. After the rule passed, companies had to tell everyone everything at the same time through public announcements and press releases. This made it much easier to get the information, but it also made the information much less useful, because everyone else had it as well. Traders had to find some other way to gain an advantage in the market. Companies like GLG rose up to help provide it, by offering access to the heart of a company’s operations. Hedge fund traders saw the expert network firms as a way to fill the information gap. “We thought it was kind of ridiculous that the hedge fund business got so much information by asking for favors—‘Could I please have 15 minutes of your time?’—when they would certainly pay for that information,” Mark Gerson, one of GLG’s founders, said shortly after starting the company. “We just thought there should be a way to get the two connected.” Of course, GLG told the company employees it signed up as consultants not to share material nonpublic information with their Wall Street clients. But the employees often had only a fuzzy understanding of where that line was. The hedge fund investors, on the other hand, knew exactly what they were after and would do whatever they could to get it. SAC traders loved the service and had a $1.2 million annual subscription. It enabled them to have conversations with employees who worked at all levels of companies in healthcare, telecommunications, energy, and countless other industries, people they never could have found or persuaded to talk to them on their own. SAC was one of GLG’s best customers. On August 30, 2006, Martoma sent GLG a list of twenty-two medical experts he might want to talk with, all of whom were involved in the clinical trials for bapineuzumab. “Are any of these docs in your database?” he wrote. “I would like to seek consultations with all of them on Alzheimer’s Disease and AAB-001. For those not available, can we recruit?” One physician in GLG’s network replied to him. “I am Chair of the Safety Monitoring Committee for this trial,” the doctor wrote in response to Martoma’s request. “Although I know more than is publicly available, I have a confidentiality agreement and will share only information that is openly available, of course.” The doctor was a respected neurologist in his seventies, a leading expert in Alzheimer’s research who held an endowed chair at the University of Michigan medical school. His name was Sid Gilman. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1270))

- “We both know that if you have tons of money at stake and nobody is watching, you will find bad conduct,” Bowe said. On Wall Street, he argued, you were likely to find a range of misdeeds: some close to the line, some over it, and a few that went way beyond. The worst stuff, Bowe was convinced, was happening at hedge funds. “You don’t have to believe me, you just have to go and look, start talking to people,” he said. “This is like gambling at Rick’s.

- A typical weekday morning in the life of a henchman might hypothetically go as follows: After the oatmeal was consumed and the market opened, Cohen would shut off the “Steve-cam,” an audio and video feed that broadcast his movements and his conversations to everyone on the trading floor, and take a phone call. After a few minutes he would hang up. Because he was in “private” mode, his staff could only guess what was being said. Then he might turn to one of his execution traders with an order: “Short 500,000 Nextel.” The trader would turn to the guy in charge of stock-loan, the department responsible for borrowing shares of a stock from another firm so that SAC could sell them short: “Get me a borrow on 500 Nextel.” The trader would then make a call to, say, his Bear Stearns broker with an order to short the stock. “I’m a seller of 500 Nextel.” The Bear broker would know that the order was coming from Cohen and, for self-preservation reasons, would try to find out as much as he could about the motives behind it before responding. “What are you thinking?” the Bear guy might ask. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1702))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “You know where it’s coming from,” Cohen’s trader might reply. Translation: “Stevie is selling, that’s all you need to know.” The Bear broker then had a decision to make: Either take the 500,000 shares off of Cohen’s hands and try to get rid of them, knowing full well that the greatest trader on Wall Street, Stevie Cohen, was selling them short for a reason. Or refuse what was certainly the crappy end of a transaction—taking the opposite side of a trade with Cohen—and risk alienating one of the firm’s most valuable customers. In all likelihood, Bear Stearns would buy the stock, and Cohen’s trader would report back to his boss: “Sold 500 Nextel.” “You get the best price you could get?” Cohen would ask. Yes, the trader would say, he got the best price. Great, Cohen would say, now go short 500,000 more. Then Cohen’s trader had a dilemma. “Do you call Bear Stearns again?” said a trader at a rival fund who was familiar with the strategy. “No, ’cause they’re going to ask what the fuck you’re doing. So you call Morgan Stanley.” So Cohen’s trader would call Morgan Stanley and say, “I’m a seller of 500 Nextel. It’s gotta be tight,” meaning, it’s got to be for the best possible price. Morgan Stanley might offer to buy it at $21¾. The trader would say, No, it’s got to be $22. Morgan would go through the same calculus Bear had, take the shares, and then turn around and try to sell them in ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1710))

- the open market, and that would push the price down even more. Suddenly Bear Stearns, which had managed to sell only 200,000 shares out of the 500,000 it just bought from SAC, would want to know what the hell was going on. The SAC trader would stall—he didn’t fucking know, he was the execution trader and he was doing his job: executing. Then the SAC trader would have to go to his other brokers and keep selling Nextel, shorting more shares until Cohen said he didn’t want to sell any more. After the market closed, Nextel might preannounce negative earnings, warning Wall Street that its next quarter would be a disappointment. The stock would dive $3. Cohen would have made $3 million, while the Bear trader lost $900,000, Morgan $1.5 million. Cohen’s trader promised to pay them back with future commissions. Every day it was “I’m going to destroy you today and make it up to you… ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1721))

- Each week, Cohen’s portfolio managers were supposed to send him written updates on the investment ideas they were following and offer recommendations for trades. The SAC compliance department had set up a special email address for these writeups, steveideas@sac.com, so that they could keep an eye on what was in there. Martoma used it to push bapi hard. The writeups followed a prescribed format, with the name of the stock at the top, followed by “Target Price”—where the portfolio manager thought the stock might go—and the timing that was suggested for the trade. The most important part of the memo was the “Conviction” rating, a number on a scale of 1 to 10 that conveyed how certain the portfolio manager was about what he was suggesting. Martoma sent a memo to Cohen on June 29, 2008, recommending Elan with a target price of $40 to $50. The stock was trading in the $26 range, so the increase he was predicting based on the research he had done so far was huge. Under “Catalysts,” which were the events he expected to move the stock price higher, Martoma wrote that there was an upcoming Phase II Alzheimer’s drug trial presentation at ICAD, an industry conference, at the end of July. For “Conviction” he wrote “9.” He ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1758))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- sent a similar note for Wyeth, with a “9” attached to it as well. A conviction rating of 10 was reserved for “absolute certainty,” a level that would seem to be impossible to achieve through conventional research methods. How could a person be 100 percent certain about any event in the future, let alone the performance of a stock? The rating was how the traders communicated the value of their information to Cohen without exposing him to the details of how they knew something. Cohen relied on it to decide whether to buy for his own account. The rating system had been the idea of the compliance department, which was always trying to find ways to protect Cohen and keep him from explicitly receiving material nonpublic information—it was like a moat around the company’s most valuable asset. As SAC’s main healthcare trader, Tim Jandovitz was responsible for buying the shares of Elan and Wyeth that Martoma was recommending. Jandovitz was well suited to the job, with a brain that could execute complex calculations in seconds. He arrived most mornings by 7 A.M. and started the daily ritual of culling through dozens of research notes from Wall Street firms, making sure to forward the ones that were relevant to Martoma. He and Martoma usually huddled around 9:15 A.M., just before the market opened, to strategize on their trades for the day. By closely monitoring the market and striking at opportune moments, he helped Martoma build a bigger and bigger position in the ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1768))

- two drug companies Elan and Wyeth, while Martoma also pushed Cohen to do the same. “I spoke to Steve about it,” Martoma would say after giving Jandovitz another buy order. He wanted to make it clear that their boss approved. Jandovitz wondered what it would take for a portfolio manager to label something a 10, indicating 100 percent conviction about a stock they were recommending. For that matter, he… ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1778))

- As part of his role as an advisor to the more junior traders, Jason Karp developed a system for categorizing information that he taught to all of his analysts, a way to understand what was safe and what might be illegal. There was “white edge,” which was obvious, readily available information that anyone could find in a research report or a public document, information that wasn’t worth much, frankly, but wasn’t going to get anyone in trouble. Then there was “gray edge,” which was trickier. Any analyst doing his job well would come across this sort of information all the time. For example, an investor-relations person at a company might say something like, “Yeah, things are trending a little lower than we thought….” Was that material nonpublic information? The only way to be sure was to talk to SAC’s legal counsel, Peter Nussbaum, who’d been with Cohen since 2000. Nussbaum was not ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1941))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- an imposing figure, but he had a drawing of a shark lurching out of the water on the wall outside his office, which some employees interpreted as a bit of art direction intended to make himself seem intimidating. If Nussbaum decided that a particular bit of information could get SAC in trouble, the stock in question was put on the restricted list and they couldn’t trade it. Of course, for that very reason, traders only went to him if they absolutely had to. Nussbaum was the firm’s equivalent of Internal Affairs. Karp’s third category of information was “black edge,” information that was obviously illegal. If traders came into possession of this sort of information, the stock should be restricted immediately—at least in theory. In the course of doing their work, analysts inevitably came across this type of information—a company’s specific earnings numbers before they were released, say, or knowledge that the company was about to get a big investment—although the vast majority of what the traders trafficked in was gray. Karp found the color-coded euphemisms to be helpful for the guys working for him; it enabled them to talk more openly about what they were doing. “If you do one thing wrong, you’re in jail and your life is ruined,” Karp told them. “There is no trade that’s ever worth it.” In reality, of course, they were all playing a game, trying to get the most valuable information they could without getting into trouble. Edge was the water, and they were swimming in it. And ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1948))

- Cohen prided himself on hiring the most determined swimmers. In Karp’s view, Martoma was disregarding simple rules for assessing the quality and legality of his information. The thought crossed Karp’s mind that Martoma might also be bluffing. He’d seen it before, portfolio managers faking conviction to prompt Cohen to build a big position, essentially a gamble that would earn them a huge bonus if it happened to turn out well. Or maybe there was something illegal going on. Munno suspected something similar when he typed out another aggravated email to his colleagues, complaining about the fact that Cohen was listening to Martoma instead of them. “We’re idiots for getting involved… ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=1958))

- It was like Occam’s razor, or the law of parsimony: Among competing hypotheses, the simplest one was usually correct. Any other explanation defied common sense. ([Location 3215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=3215))

- To an outside observer, the Martoma case had never made much sense. Martoma had been given ample opportunity to testify against his former boss in exchange for a lighter sentence, and he had refused. Instead, he went through a humiliating trial and now faced more than ten years of jail time. Why? It was the question that surrounded his case for three years. Federal prosecutors who had pursued Steven Cohen for almost a decade were certain that Martoma had information to incriminate him. People charged with ([Location 4726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=4726))

- crimes like Martoma’s who were facing long sentences almost always flipped. Why hadn’t Martoma played along? There was always the possibility that he didn’t have any incriminating information about Cohen. But, even still, whatever he did have would likely have brought him a reduced sentence. The puzzling thing was, he didn’t even try. There were three theories that were most commonly discussed. The first was honor. Perhaps Martoma simply could not accept the idea of being an informant. Such a principled stand was highly unusual in white collar cases, and for someone with Martoma’s history it seemed particularly implausible. Could this be the moment when he suddenly chose the righteous path? The second was fear. Perhaps Martoma believed he would face some kind of retribution if he crossed Cohen. This, too, was hard to accept. Martoma had already left the financial industry, and for all his ruthlessness as a businessman, there was no evidence that Cohen had ever employed the loyalty enforcement methods of an actual gangster. Another hypothesis, the one that was mentioned most often by those involved in building the case, was material self-interest, or that Martoma harbored a desperate hope that Cohen would repay his loyalty. There was no evidence to support this theory, but it was easier to grasp than the others. Money, in the end, is what drives most people on Wall Street, and the case had left Martoma financially ruined. The government ordered him to forfeit his and Rose’s house in Boca Raton, $3.2 million in an American Express Bank account in Martoma’s name, $245,000 in an ING Direct account in Rosemary’s name, as well as $934,897 that was left in the Mathew and Rosemary Martoma Foundation. It turned out that, after establishing the foundation as a nonprofit in 2010 and depositing $1 million into the account, the Martomas had received a tax benefit for the gift and then barely gave any of the money away. That same year they charged $22,826 in travel and other expenses to the foundation. Everything that was left in the account would be going to the government. Rosemary argued that she and the children were at risk of ending up on the street. Neither of their families had the resources to help them, she pleaded to the judge through various court filings. The logistics of Cohen funneling resources to the Martomas would be tricky, to say the least. (It would also be illegal, the most blatant form of witness tampering.) Government accountants would quickly seize on any mysterious sources of income. Even though there was no evidence, observers of the case couldn’t resist speculating that something was going on. Rosemary didn’t exactly quell the rumors when she said, in tortured legalese: “There is not, and never was, and never will be, any discussion of Steve Cohen taking care of us.” It sounded to some like a line that had been fed to her by a lawyer. For now, Martoma’s motivations remain a mystery. ([Location 4729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M0T8H53&location=4729))
