- of like a matched set. So we ’ll check in on Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, who tried to look unflinchingly at deadness. Heidegger claimed that we actually need the anxiety of death to keep us from falling into “everydayness,” a state in which we’re only half alive, living with a deadening illusion. And Sartre told us to consider the alternative: the only beings that don’t have death anxiety are those that are already dead as doornails—like doornails, for example. Get real, they admonish us. We’d like to, but first we have to stop shaking. So we’ll take a short break from all this heavy philosophizing to examine a popular form of death-denial: reassuring ourselves that we will live on in the hearts of those ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=166))

- Fred and Clyde had had many conversations over the years about the afterlife. They agreed that whoever died first would try to contact the other and tell him what Heaven was like. Fred was the first to pass on. A year went by. One day the phone ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=185))

- rang, and when Clyde answered, it was Fred! “Is that really you, Fred?” he asked. “You bet, Clyde. It’s really me.” “Great to hear from you! I thought you’d forgotten. So tell me! What’s it like there?” “Well, you won’t believe this, Clyde. It’s absolutely wonderful! We’ve got the most delicious veggies from the lushest fields you have ever seen. We get to sleep in every morning, have a fabulous breakfast, and then make love the rest of the morning.After a nutritious lunch, we go out in the fields and make love some more.Then it’s time for a gourmet dinner and some more love-making until bedtime.” ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=187))

- Why we desire to deny our mortality is pretty obvious: the prospect of death is terrifying! It brings on the ultimate angst. It gives us the fantods to face the fact that we are only here for a short time, and when we are gone, we’re gone for eternity. How can we enjoy life with the clock ticking so loudly in our ear? According to Becker, the only way most of us deal with this situation is delusion—in fact, the Big Delusion. The B.D. is the basic human drive—way more basic than the sex drive, he says—and it gives rise to “immortality systems,” nonrational belief structures that give us a way to believe we’re immortal.

- Just because the whole God-religion-eternal-hereafter package comes from our unconscious doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s all hog swill, argued Freud’s onetime disciple, the Swiss analytical psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Maybe our unconscious is wiser than our conscious mind. Maybe what Sigmund calls unconscious ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=299))

- fabrication is really unconscious confirmation. Maybe we don’t make up religions, we discover them inside us. And just maybe, as the unconscious psyche gets passed on from generation to generation, it evolves on its own, getting smarter while our conscious minds merely continue to limp along.

- In 1996, this Harvard neuroscientist watched in fascination as the left hemisphere of her brain shut down. In the process, Dr. Taylor came to know a spiritual reality that Jung only dreamed of. Taylor explains that the right hemisphere of the brain processes what is going on for us at the present moment. It thinks in pictures, taking all of the sights and sounds and smells occurring for us right now and putting them together in a whole. In our right brain, we are “perfect, whole, and beautiful.” We experience ourselves as an “energy being” that ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=314))

- is connected to all the energy in the universe and to the energy of the whole human family. By contrast, our left brain is linear and methodical. It takes the present moment and picks out details, connects them to past learning, and projects future possibilities. It thinks in language, not pictures, and one of the things it says is “I am.” It experiences the self as separate from the energy flow around it and separate from other human beings. It is the function of this left brain that Taylor largely lost during her stroke. As her left brain shut down, she experienced herself as boundaryless and at one with ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=318))

- all the energy in the universe. She felt peaceful and euphoric. At the same time, her left brain—her anxious brain—would intermittently kick in with the message, “You are in danger of dying! You must get help!” But getting help without the sustained assistance of her left brain was nearly impossible. Even after she managed to phone for help, as she tried to explain her situation, all she could do was bark like a dog. Later, in the hospital, she experienced the world around her as chaos and noise, but then suddenly felt her spirit soar through a “sea of euphoria.” ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=323))

- Taylor’s conclusion? The world is full of loving, peaceful people who can “step to the right of their left brain.” We are at once beings who are “the life-force power of the universe” and also beings who are separate from the world and separate from others. And most significantly, to some degree we can choose to be in either place at any given time.1 ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=327))

- Jung says that the unconscious psyche is not only instinctually aware of the fact that we die, but actually accepts this fact. The psyche prepares itself for death, usually many years before it happens. While our rational, conscious mind sees death as an anxiety-provoking, grim finale, our psyche—our right brain?—accepts it. Jeez, I guess there is more to death than coffin nails, isn’t there? Yes, Daryl, and we’re afraid it only gets scarier.

- break. What’s more, he’s depressing the hell out of me. Okay, Daryl! Here comes the Final Answer—Søren’s clincher. There is a way out that doesn’t come up against the dead ends of autoanesthesia, solipsistic confinement, busy-bee-ing, or self-aggrandizement. But, we’ve gotta warn you, it’s not exactly a walk in the park. Angst itself is the way out! Pretty cool, eh, Daryl? It’s only when we dare to experience the full anxiety of knowing that life doesn’t go on forever that we can experience transcendence and get in touch with the infinite. To use an analogy from gestalt psychology,1 Non-Being is the necessary ground for the figure of Being to make itself known to us. It’s only when we’re willing to let go of all of our illusions and admit that we are lost and helpless and terrified that we will be free of ourselves and our false securities and ready for what Kierkegaard calls “the leap of faith.” We can’t resist telling this golden oldie just one more time.

- Oh, there you are, Daryl, curled up in the fetal position under the porch. Well, take a deep breath, my friend. We know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for. It is kind of a downer at first blush, but Schopey is an acquired taste. As it happens, the Schopster did have several interesting ideas about death on his mind. One thing he meant is that life is a constant process of dying. The past, when you really think about it, is just a repository of death, a heap of no-longer-existing events—gone forever, irretrievable, dead as a doornail (or… ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=460))

- Of course, one of the big things we get attached to is our own continued survival: we have this crazy will-to-live. How self-destructive can we get, eh, Daryl? Wanting to live only makes us suffer more! So we need to let go, resign ourselves to the futility of the world of appearances, and accept the fact that both life and death are unreal. Still unconvinced that Schopenhauer’s not a downer? That’s because you haven’t heard the good news: Will-itself never dies! It has no “death event,” because events occur only in the world of appearance. Will (capital W) is indestructible.

- near-death experience. No, Heidegger’s big contribution to the phil. of D is his injunction to confront death head-on in order to live authentically—to live honestly, realizing what life really is. Without death-consciousness, we’re only half alive. According to one scholar, Marty actually put this very clearly: If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life—and only then will I be free to become myself.

And I must admit to you that right now I can’t afford to pay your bill.” “Okay,” says Dr. Lewis,“I’ll give you a year to live.” ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=595))

Halfway through the first quarter, Joe sees through his binoculars an empty seat ten rows off the field, right on the fifty-yard line. He decides to take a chance, and makes his way to the empty seat. As he sits down, Joe says to the guy sitting next to him, “Excuse me, is anybody sitting here?” The guy says, “No.” Joe says, “This is incredible! Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Super Bowl and not use it?” The guy says, “Well, actually, the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away.This is the first Super Bowl we haven’t seen together since we got married in 1967.” Joe says, “That’s really sad. But couldn’t you find anyone to take the seat? A friend, or a close relative?” The guy says, “No, they’re all at the funeral.” ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=672))

- Indian thought—Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—to become immortal means to transcend our individuality and “step off the wheel of birth and death.” Oh, yeah? What about reincarnation, then? I always thought that sounded like a good deal. Like I used to be Napoleon, then I was Daryl, next I may be a bunny rabbit. You’re not alone, Daryl. A lot of Westerners think that reincarnation is the Eastern version of immortality of the soul. But no way, Sanjay! First of all, Buddhists, the chief source of the Western idea of reincarnation, don’t even believe in the soul. Their concept of reincarnation is the passing of a flame from one candle to another.

- gets transferred in the deal, because there ’s no self to transfer. Secondly, reincarnation isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Sure, our subtle body gets to keep on truckin’, but it’s still truckin’ on the same old gravel road. Reincarnation merely subjects our psyche to another round of struggle and purification on the way to finally realizing our true and universal Self. To get there, we must step off the gravel road of multiple deaths and reincarnations, become one with the universal Self, and ride on eternally in an Off Road Vehicle. In fact, reincarnation is just an extension of the law of karma. People who do evil become evil—in this life and beyond.

- So what exactly is the link between Body and Mind? Another seventeenth-century philosopher, the German rationalist Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, maintained that Mind and Matter don’t actually get into each other’s knickers.

- want to lay off the mind-altering substances for a while. The nineteenth-century Darwinist T. H. Huxley said the mind is merely a side effect of bodily functions, an “epiphenomenon” like shadows on the ground. Physical brain states can cause changes in mental states, said the epiphenomenalists, but mental states can’t cause anything, even other mental states. So while our bodies, brains included, go about their business, our minds simply show the pictures. The “logical behaviorists,” including the twentieth-century British philosopher Gilbert Ryle, took it a step further. Ryle ridiculed Descartes’s view that mind and body are two different kinds of beings, ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=953))

- with the mind somehow “inhabiting” the body. Ryle called that idea “the ghost in the machine.” He said Descartes had led us in a centuries-long detour trying to define what sort of entity this ghost is, when in fact the mind is not an entity at all. To have a mind isn’t to possess a certain thing; it’s simply to have certain capacities and dispositions. We go around thinking that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, cause our behavior. In fact, our behavior is caused by dispositions to behave in certain ways, and our mental states simply reflect those dispositions. That doesn’t seem to leave anything to be immortal; it’s hard to picture immortal capacities and dispositions. But then again, who knows? Lots of us find it hard ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=958))

- to picture an immortal mind or soul of any kind. The development of computer technology has raised interesting questions in the mind-body debate. In 1950, A. M. Turing, one of the founders of computer science and a celebrated British World War II codebreaker, asked the question whether it is theoretically possible for a large enough computer to answer questions in such a way as to fool us into thinking that it is a human being—like Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If we could be fooled by Hal, what does that tell us about the role that our mental states may or may not play in determining our behavior? Maybe, like Hal’s, our behavior is caused by sophisticated programming, and our impression ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=963))

- Wow! Finally something I get—philosophers have nothing better to do than to dream up little Disney characters. Sure, but after they dream them up, they ask some pretty interesting questions about them. Yeah, maybe interesting to a Disney character. Anyway, I think the soul is something different from the mind. Like it’s deeper. If I say somebody’s soulful, I don’t mean anything about his mind. You know, like Aretha Franklin is the Queen of Soul, not the Queen of Mind, and barbecued soul food is way more appealing than any “mind food.” (I’m thinking ginkgo biloba here.) And oh, one more thing—souls are good or bad morally. A good mind is just sharp at plane geometry or gets straight As in French, but someone with a good soul, that’s a whole different deal—that’s a person who feels your pain. He’s, like, in touch, you know? Excellent points, Daryl. And the twentieth-century psychologist and philosopher of psychotherapy Otto Rank agrees with you. He says the modern view that equates the soul with the mind is way off the mark. He says that in primitive times “soul” meant “life-power.” (Think James Brown singing “I Feel Good.”) And this life-power, or mana, was everywhere and in everything.

- In those good old primitive days when a man was a man, and kids still helped out around the cave, death-anxiety had not raised its scary head, because this universal life-power was immortal. Not only was the Force with us, but we were part of the Eternal Force. But soon the notion of life-power got mixed together with the notion of individual will-power, and once that happened, it was only a matter of time before people realized that the will of some folks could break the will of other folks. This could be life-threatening for the folks of the second part—first of all literally, but secondly because the primitive idea of will-power was so wrapped up with their notion of life-power that any limit on their will-power ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1015))

- brought on the heebie-jeebies of death-anxiety. In other words, the possibility of having their will crushed raised the threat of having their souls crushed in the process. Say goodbye to the happy innocent days of equal-access mana. But even more powerful than the will of any individual was the will of the tribe, so people hooked up their individual wills to the will of their group and kin. This move had a fabulous extra benefit: because each individual was a part of the tribe, and the tribe was immortal, individuals could claim immortality. According to Rank, around the biblical era, this collective will of the tribe got projected onto an even more transcendent entity—a monotheistic God—and that’s when all hell broke loose. Now individual expressions of will were seen as rebellious, and ideas of sin and guilt developed. (One of the benefits of identifying with a group is that groups don’t do guilt, or at least when they do, it gets nicely diluted.) With individual sin came the old death-anxiety blues again. Bad will = bad soul = bad life-power. “The wages of sin is death” is… ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1020))

Well, yeah, I guess so. But I’m one of those guys who’re not too good at self-surrendering love. Who is these days? And that artist cure doesn’t do it for me.

Plato “proved” the immortality of the soul in several of his dialogues, but probably his best-known proof is in the dialogue “Meno,” where Socrates demonstrates that the soul must have existed before a person was born. Interestingly, most people aren’t all that concerned with the possibility of eternal life before arriving on earth, possibly because even if they did exist then, they can’t remember it. This sheds new light on the old question of what our post-earthly consciousness would be like if the soul were immortal.

- As it turns out, Saint Peter’s in-depth interview technique yields critical admissions data:   It got crowded in Heaven, so Saint Peter decided to accept only people who’d had a really bad day on the day they died. On the first morning of the new policy, Saint Peter said to the first man in line, “Tell me about the day you died.” The man said,“Oh, it was awful. I was sure my wife was having an affair, so I came home early from work to catch her in the act. I searched all over the apartment and couldn’t find her lover anywhere. So finally I went out on the balcony, where I found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. So I went inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some bushes and survived. So I went inside, picked up the refrigerator, and pushed it out over the balcony. It crushed him, but the strain of hefting the fridge gave me a heart attack and I died.” Saint Peter couldn’t deny this was an awful day and that it was a crime of passion, so he let the man enter Heaven. He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. “Well, sir, it was terrible. I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my apartment when I slipped over the edge. I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below me but then some maniac came out and started pounding my fingers with a... hammer! I fell, but I landed in some bushes and lived! But then this guy came out again and dropped a refrigerator on me!

These days it is routine to freeze sperm, human eggs, and embryos for later defrosting and use. So why not freeze entire human beings for later use, say for a future time when the diseases that once threatened a body now have a cure? Well, for one thing, some sticky practical problems arise from the fact that the best way to freeze a body for future reanimation is when that body is still alive. This can be a major dilemma if you are in the middle of a major financial transaction or a wild love affair at the time of your optimum freezing point. So far, the folks who have opted for full or partial (i.e., brain) freezing have chosen the chancier ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1795))

- route of being frozen as soon after the instant of death as possible. We consider that a choice based on lack of faith. Another problem with the cryogenic route is also related to faith, the faith that some person in the future—possibly somebody who never knew you—will decide it’s worth her time and expense to thaw you out and fix whatever ailed you. Exactly what is going to motivate her? Perhaps lawyers could work out a contract that would impel this future thawer to open your freezer door, but somehow it doesn’t feel like a sure thing. Unfrozen people change, you know. A guy buys an expensive talking parrot that has a large vocabulary. This bird is quoting Shakespeare ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1803))

- and Dylan Thomas all the way home to the guy’s house, but once inside the bird lets loose with a tirade of foul language. “You #@&*! You call this @%# a house?” On and on he goes, swearing like a sailor, and whenever the guy tells him to stop, he just gets more foulmouthed. Finally, the guy says,“Okay, into the cooler for you until you can talk decent,” and he grabs the bird and stuffs him in the freezer. After several minutes of ranting, the bird suddenly falls silent, and the guy opens the freezer door. The parrot hops out onto the man’s shoulder. “I am so sorry, Master, please forgive me,” he coos. “By the way, what did the chicken do?” ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1808))

- minute of living is another man’s (or turtle’s) month of living, so just who or which is having the richer life?   Some turtles went on a picnic. It took them ten days to get there, and when they arrived, they realized they’d forgotten the bottle opener, so they told the littlest one to go back for it. He said, “No, as soon as I go, you’ll eat the sandwiches.” They promised him they wouldn’t, so he left. Ten days passed, twenty days, thirty days. Finally, they were so hungry, they decided to eat the sandwiches. As soon as they took a bite, the little turtle came out from behind a rock and said,“See? That’s why I’m not going.” ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=1907))

- Reggie married one of a pair of identical twins. Less than a year later, he was in court filing for a divorce. “Okay,” the judge said, “tell the Court why you want a divorce.” “Well,Your Honor,” Reggie began, “every once in a while my sister-in-law would come over for a visit, and because she and my wife are so identical-looking, every once in a while I’d end up making love to her by mistake.” “Surely there must be some difference between the two women,” the judge said. “You’d better believe there is a difference,Your Honor.That‘s why I want the divorce,” he replied.

- given a chance to relive one day in her life. She chooses her twelfth birthday. At first she is overcome with joy reliving this day, but pretty quickly she realizes how fast life passes by and how much of life she took for granted. “We don’t even have time to look at one another!” she cries. At the end of her visit, she turns to the Stage Manager and asks, “Doesn’t anyone ever realize life while they live it? Every, every minute?” And the Stage Manager says, “No. Saints and poets, maybe; they do some.” Thanks for coming, everybody. I know you came to see Freddy and not me, but Freddy’s indisposed. I appreciate your giving me a listen. Oh, one more story—last one, I promise. ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002N83HHU&location=2107))
