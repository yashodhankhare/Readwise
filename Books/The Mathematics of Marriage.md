## Highlights
- We then discovered new parameters that distinguish happily and unhappily married couples, such as the level of negativity required before a spouse reacts. We called this parameter the negative threshold effect. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=185))

- It turns out that a great deal of order exists in people’s behavior at an interpersonal level of analysis. Is this really so amazing? Let us consider von Frisch’s studies of the behavior of bees. Von Frisch discovered the famous “dance of the bees,” in which a bee who has found a nectar-rich field of flowers returns to the hive and does a complex dance that tells the other bees how to fly with respect to the sun and how far to fly (von Frisch, ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=379))

- 1953). The strange dance of the bee can be understood only by realizing that the bee’s dance is communication. Had von Frisch taken a solitary bee into the laboratory and placed it on a table, he would have concluded that bees are motivated only to bat their heads repeatedly against glass windows. The order he discovered in studying bees came from going directly to the hive and the fields of flowers that are the business of the hive. Are we Homo sapiens less social than bees? Maybe not. Hence, when modern social psychology brings an individual into a laboratory room, it must then become imaginative about how to “create” a social situation out of this isolated individual. This choice of paradigm is often made in the interests of experimental control of particular social processes, and then it may have great merit, but it has little to recommend it if the goal is to understand interpersonal relationships.

- In many ways, the study of personality has become lazy methodologically, and it has paid the price. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=403))

- Glop refers to high correlations among variables obtained using a common method of measurement, usually with just one reporter. In the marital field, this method is usually to self-report data obtained from a single reporter. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=405))

- The conclusion we must reach from these studies is clear: we should refuse to accept constructs as explanatory if they have not dealt adequately with the glop problem. It is absolutely critical that any theory of marriage be very careful about how a construct was measured in drawing conclusions. This is a simple admonition that all studies of marriage employ multiple methods to operationalize central constructs.

- It turned out that the affect (nonverbal and verbal) in dysfunctional marriages (and families) was simply more negative than the affect in functional marriages (and families). ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=464))

- The basic sequential result is that greater reciprocated negative affective interaction is an absorbing state for dissatisfied couples. This result has profound implications for the interaction process. The result means that negativity becomes an absorbing state for dissatisfied couples; in other words, it is a state that is difficult to exit ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=559))

- What goes hand in glove with this phenomenon is a constriction of social processes. The constriction of available social processes is the fascinating structural dynamic that maintains the absorbing state. How does this work? For example, assume that a message has two parts, one positive and one negative (for example, the message “Stop interrupting me,” which is an attempt to repair the interaction, may have been said with some irritation). In a happy marriage, there is a greater probability that the listener will focus on the repair component of the message and respond by saying, “Sorry, what were you saying?” On the other hand, in an unhappy marriage, there is a greater probability that the listener will respond only to the irritation in the message and say something like, “I wouldn’t have to interrupt if I could get a word in edgewise.” In this case, the attempted repair mechanism does not work. The response to the negativity now continues for long chains of reciprocated negative affect in dissatisfied marriages. Negativity as an absorbing state implies that all these social processes have less of a chance of working because what people attend to and respond to is the negativity. Interestingly, a side effect of this analysis is that the interactions of dissatisfied couples show a higher degree of interaction structure, more predictability of one spouse’s behaviors from those of the other, and less statistical independence than is found in the interactions of satisfied couples. The interaction of happily married couples is more random than that of unhappily married couples. This is precisely what Raush et al. (1974) predicted. One interesting finding that may be related to this phenomenon is that this greater structure may come to pervade positive as well as negative interaction. The latter result is not as consistently found across laboratories, but this problem may not be so much a failure to replicate as the lack of studies that do sequential analyses of data and the inconsistency across laboratories in conceptualizing, generating, and measuring positivity.

- In their book, Raush et at. (1974) raised two critical questions about what is dysfunctional in ailing marriages. The first question was why in some marriages minor conflicts “escalate far beyond their apparent triviality” (p.2). This question was also more broadly about what makes conflict constructive or destructive in marriages. Raush et al. gave the example of a couple arguing about which television show to watch. They were impressed by the fact that many couples got quite involved with their role-play improvisations. One wife became extremely upset and said, “Damn it, you always watch what you want to see. You’re always drinking beer and watching football. Nothing else seems important to you, especially my wishes.” The seemingly small discussion of which TV show to watch had led her to escalate and to express her complete exasperation with her partner and with the marriage. The second question was whether the avoidance of conflict in marriage was functional or dysfunctional. Raush et al. concluded that conflict avoidance is dysfunctional and that conflict or bickering about trivial issues is also ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=609))

- First, using a balance theory of marriage, Gottman (1994) reported that the ratio of positive to negative codes during the conflict discussion was about 5.0 for the three types of stable marriages, whereas it was 0.8 for the unstable marriage. Second, couples headed for divorce were high ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=661))

- on four behaviors that Gottman (1994) called the “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”; they are criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and “stonewalling,” or listener withdrawal; consistent with the demand-withdraw pattern, women were significantly more likely than men to criticize, while men were more likely than women to stonewall.

- The View from Observing. Only a few phenomena are consistently characteristic of ailing marriages. The first we call “the triumph of negative over positive affect.” Once there is a neutral category, so that positive and negative codes are not logically mirror images of one another (or very highly correlated), this phenomenon is that negative codes in a marital interaction coding system are consistently more likely to be negatively correlated with marital happiness and predictive of divorce than positive codes are to be positively correlated with marital happiness and predictive of stability The second phenomenon is negative affect reciprocity, which is the greater than base rate likelihood that one partner will subsequently be negative if the spouse has just been negative. This reciprocation may be a result ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=666))

- of the failure of repair processes. However, our recent research with newly weds suggests that the major component of negative affect reciprocity that is dysfunctional is not the reciprocation of negative affect in kind (e.g., anger reciprocated by anger), which appears to be characteristic of all marriages during a conflict discussion. Instead, what is dysfunctional is the escalation of negative affect. Gottman et al. (1998) suggested that this escalation was an index of the rejection of influence—that is, that it tapped into a power struggle in the marriage. The third phenomenon is the “demand-withdraw” pattern. This is a pattern in which one partner pursues solution of a problem and change, whereas the other partner is avoidant and tries to withdraw from the discussion. Usually this is a female-demand/male-avoid pattern. It seems to be characteristic of most marriages, but it is exacerbated when the marriage is ailing. The fourth phenomenon is the presence of particular forms of negativity—namely, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling—and their ability to predict divorce.

- In our modeling of marriage, we integrate the study of affect (emotions) and power. We broadly define power, or influence, as the ability of one person’s emotions to ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BT3H22G&location=794))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- affect the partner’s emotions, but this definition has meaning throughout the emotion continuum. That is, we can assess the subsequent result on the wife of a husband’s mild positive affect or mild negative affect, and so on. The same function can be defined for the wife. We thus complicate the study of power by making of “power” two functions. From this simple definition of power, we wind up defining two influence functions that specify the ability of each person’s affect to influence the other person’s affect which leads us to a discussion of the affect continuum (our “Dow-Jones Industrial Average” of a marital conversation), which we compute for modeling.

- We have now been able to derive the same data using a weighting of the codes of the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF; Gottman, 1995), which can be coded on-line in real time and, with a numerical weighting scheme for each coding category, provides 150 observations for each person in each couple. SPAFF also has the advantage that it can be coded for any conversation, not just for conflict resolution conversations. Later in this book, we discuss this new observational system.

- All couples, even happily married ones, have some amount of negative interaction; similarly, all couples, even unhappily married, have some degree of positive interaction. Computing the graph’s slope was guided by a balance theory of marriage—namely, that those processes most important in predicting dissolution would involve a balance or a regulation of positive and negative interaction. Low-risk couples are defined as those for whom both husband and wife speaker slopes were significantly positive; for high-risk couples, at least one of the speaker slopes was not significantly positive. By definition, low-risk couples were those who showed, more or less consistently, that they displayed more positive than negative RCISS codes. Classifying couples in the current sample in this manner produced two groups consisting of forty-two low-risk couples and thirty-one high-risk couples. Figure 2.1 illustrates two cumulative graphs, one from the interaction of a low-risk couple and one from the interaction of a high-risk couple.
