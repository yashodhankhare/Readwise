## Highlights
- How does a person, over the course of a decade, go from being opposed to the “gay agenda” to happily attending a same-sex wedding? How does an entire nation go from smoking on airplanes and in offices to banning smoking in bars and restaurants and daytime television? What makes hemlines go up and down and beards appear and disappear? How did marijuana go from a prescription for madness to a prescription for glaucoma? Why don’t you agree with the person who wrote your teenage diary, want or believe the same things, or cut your hair the same way as the person you were just a decade ago? What changed your mind? How do minds change? ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=166))

- We will see that the speed of change is inversely proportional to the strength of our certainty, and certainty is a feeling: somewhere between an emotion and a mood, more akin to hunger than to logic. Persuasion, no matter the source, is a force that affects that feeling. When we wade into the techniques, you might feel some misgivings about the ethics of it all. Even if we feel like our intentions are good or that the facts are on our side, persuasion can seem like a form of manipulation. But it may put you at ease to learn that by its scientific definition, persuasion is the act of changing a mind without coercion. As Daniel O’Keefe, a professor of communication, defines it, persuasion is “a successful intentional effort at influencing another’s mental state through communication in a circumstance in which the persuadee has some measure of freedom.” ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=180))

- Persuasion is not coercion, and it is also not an attempt to defeat your intellectual opponent with facts or moral superiority, nor is it a debate with a winner or a loser. Persuasion is leading a person along in stages, helping them to better understand their own thinking and how it could align with the message at hand. You can’t persuade another person to change their mind if that person doesn’t want to do so, and as you will see, the techniques that work best focus on a person’s motivations more than their conclusions.

- We will learn that, in many ways, persuasion is mostly encouraging people to realize change is possible. All persuasion is self-persuasion. People change or refuse based on their own desires, motivations, and internal counterarguing, and by focusing on these factors, an argument becomes more likely to change minds. As psychologist Joel Whalen once put it, “You can’t move a string by pushing it, you have to pull it.” This is why it is so important to share your intentions up front. Not only does that keep you on solid ethical ground, but it also increases your chances of success. If you don’t, people will assume your intentions. Whatever they assume will become your “actual” position in their minds, and you run the risk of not having the conversation you intended. If they believe that your position is that they are gullible or stupid or deluded or in the wrong group or a bad person, then of course they will resist, and the facts will now be irrelevant. Early in the research, I applied some of this with my father in an argument over a conspiracy theory that had made its way into his politics. We were debating the facts—for a long time. Exhausted, I took a breath and asked myself what I actually wanted. Why did I want to change my father’s mind? I said, “I love you, and I’m just worried that you are being misled.” The debate ended instantly. We then ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=196))

- entered a conversation about who we can trust on the internet. He softened, and admitted he was open to changing his mind about the facts, just wary of where they came from. When I asked myself why I wanted him to change his mind, my answer was, “I don’t trust his sources, and don’t want him to trust those sources either.” Why? “Because I trust other sources who disagree, and I wish he did too.” Why? “I want us to be on the same side.” Why? You can keep asking until you are contemplating quarks and gluons, but it’s crucial you at least share your intentions for challenging someone’s ideas, or else both of your positions will be: “I am right, and I think you are wrong.” I hope you will carry that question—Why do I want to change their mind?—in your mental backpack as you travel with me chapter by chapter. And I hope that question will blossom, as it did for me, into a series of questions. You are reading these words because we each have the power to give up old beliefs, to replace old ignorance with new wisdom, to shift our attitudes… ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=206))

- head. But when and what and who should we be trying to change? What counts as dangerous ignorance or outdated dogma? What qualifies as a malignant tradition, defunct politics, or a misguided practice? What norms are so harmful, what beliefs are so incorrect that, once we know how to change minds, we should take every opportunity to do so? And here’s the kicker: How do we know when we are right and they are wrong? But also, what does the phrase “change your mind” even mean? We will answer all of these going forward, but I didn’t start this journey with these questions in mind. They came later, after a good deal of my own ignorance revealed itself. That’s why I think we must ask ourselves these questions here, before we begin, and bring them along to the lessons and conversations ahead. The ability to change our minds, update our assumptions, and entertain other points of view is one of our greatest strengths, an evolved ability that comes free with every copy of the human brain.

- A darling of the conspiracy community, a rising star on YouTube, Charlie saw himself as an up-and-coming celebrity provocateur. Hated by some. Beloved by others. He thought the trip to New York would be his big break, the event that would take him mainstream. But once there, at the height of his fame, he did something unbelievable and, as it would turn out, unforgivable. He changed his mind.

- But after learning about Charlie Veitch, I couldn’t stop wondering: If we now live in a post-truth world, if facts can’t change people’s minds, then what explained the fact that Charlie did change his mind when presented with facts? That’s why I traveled to Manchester to meet him, and after hearing his story, I started to feel the same kind of doubts he had felt in New York. I didn’t know it when I first met Charlie Veitch, but the answer to why the facts that changed his mind didn’t change the minds of his peers would reveal why so many of us resist some facts and not others. So we will return to his story after we visit activists, neuroscientists, and psychologists to help us understand how we form our beliefs, attitudes, and values in the first place; and how those mental constructs shift, mutate, and change as we move through the world, learning and experiencing things that challenge our preconceived notions and received wisdom. In a newly flattened, online world, where we are more likely to engage with people who disagree with us than ever before, widespread resistance to change—on issues as wide-ranging as whether Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to put microchips in your blood ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=395))

Inside this new information ecosystem where everyone had access to facts that seemed to confirm their views, we began to believe we were living in separate realities. We’ve come to see the people on the other side as unreachable as the truthers who accompanied Charlie to New York. I used to see things this way, too, but in writing this book, I changed my mind. That all began when I ventured out to meet professional mind changers in Los Angeles. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=404))

- Like the other canvassers disembarking across the city, they were to go door-to-door as a pair, one person trying to change a mind and one person recording the effort. On this trip, on our team, Steve would be talking while I worked the camera. I was sweating in the California sun a few months after the Supreme Court voted to legalize same-sex marriage, because the work Steve and his organization had been doing for years had made headlines around the world, both in mainstream newspapers and in academic journals. Some were saying it was a breakthrough in the art and science of persuasion, something that could change politics and public discourse forever. It seemed to me that if I was going to understand how minds change, and how to change them, this was the best place to start. I sent an email, talked on the phone, explained my interest, and within a week was in California training with Steve’s organization, the Leadership LAB. On most Saturdays, the LAB heads out with a rotating but loyal group of volunteers to talk with people at their front doors. After doing this for more than a decade and having more than fifteen thousand conversations, most recorded so they could pore over each exchange to improve their rhetoric, the LAB had slowly honed a method so fast and reliable, so new, ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=418))

- that social scientists began buying plane tickets to study it in person. They call it deep canvassing. Not every time, but often, people using their technique could get a person to give up a long-held opinion and change their position, especially about a contentious social issue, in less than twenty minutes. I, too, wanted to know how it worked and what it revealed, and so I set out with Steve to see it in action. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=427))

- Deep canvassing wasn’t invented. It was discovered. That discovery was the result of one man’s obsession with answering a single question. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=474))

- The LAB soon noticed a pattern in the responses. People’s explanations for voting against same-sex marriage clustered around three values: tradition, religion, and the protection of their children. But that pattern disappeared after a few months of canvassing. As time passed, justifications mentioning children faded away, leaving behind only tradition and religion. The LAB couldn’t make sense of it. When protecting their children had been a justification, it had also been their primary justification, and now they were reporting it wasn’t a concern at all. That’s when Fleischer had his great insight. People’s fears about their children had likely disappeared because the anti-gay ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=521))

- gay advertising had ceased. Almost all of those opposition ads had focused on how schools would deal with same-sex marriage. One in particular was very effective. Thirty seconds long, it featured a little girl excitedly telling her mom that she had learned in class she could marry a princess, and a boy could marry a prince. Then the ad explained that if Prop 8 became law, parents would have no right to object to those kinds of lessons. Fleischer noted that of the 687,000 Californians who supported same-sex marriage but then later flipped, 500,000 were parents with children living at home under the age of eighteen. The answer seemed obvious. Before those ads ran, the people who polled as supporters didn’t think of themselves as anti-gay. In fact, the polling showed many of them typically voted liberal and Democrat. They were unaware they harbored a prejudice that could be stoked by the right kind of fear tactic—beware, they want to indoctrinate your children. To Fleischer, that was actually good news, because it meant that those voters were persuadable. Their values were in conflict between protecting their children and protecting the rights of others. They held both positive and negative attitudes about same-sex marriage, and if they were ambivalent, that meant they might be open to reconsidering their vote.

- realize it. They talked themselves into a new position so smoothly that they were unable to see that their opinions had flipped. At the end of the conversation, when the canvassers asked how they now felt, they expressed frustration, as if the canvasser hadn’t been paying close enough attention to what they’d been saying all along.

- “There is no superior argument, no piece of information that we can offer, that is going to change their mind,” he said, taking a long pause before continuing. “The only way they are going to change their mind is by changing their own mind—by talking themselves through their own thinking, by processing things they’ve never thought about before, things from their own life that are going to help them see things differently.” He stood by a paper easel on which Laura had drawn a cartoon layer cake. Steve pointed to the smallest portion at the top with a candle sticking out. It was labeled “rapport,” the next smallest layer was “our story,” and the huge base was “their story.” He said to keep that image in mind while standing in front of someone, to remember to spend as little time as possible talking about yourself, just enough to show that you are friendly, that you aren’t selling anything. Show you are genuinely interested in what they have to say. That, he said, keeps them from assuming a defensive position. You should share your story, he said, ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=628))

- pointing to the portion of the cake that sat on top of the biggest layer, but it’s their story that should take up most of the conversation. You want them to think about their own thinking. The team tossed out lots of metaphors like these. For instance, Steve later said to think of questions as keys on a giant ring. If you keep asking and listening, he told the crowd, one of those keys was bound to unlock the door to a personal experience related to the topic. Once that real, lived memory was out in the open, you could (if done correctly) steer the conversation away from the world of conclusions with their facts googled for support, away from ideological abstractions and into the world of concrete details from that individual’s personal experiences. It was there, and only there, he said, that a single conversation could change someone’s mind. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=636))

- Steve explained that after thousands of recorded conversations they had found that battling over differing interpretations of the evidence kept the people they met from exploring why they felt so strongly one way or the other. People could remain in the logic space doing battle with the canvasser’s facts for hours and never leave, safe and unable to tap into why those facts evoked such powerful feelings. The LAB tried arguing the facts for years, and it had long proved a waste of time. “Doing this work has taught me that people make their decisions about issues like this, in their life and when they’re voting, at a really emotional, visceral level,” said Steve. “What I envision when I’m standing in front of a voter is that people have this intellectual, logical reasoning process. That’s one part of how they process the world and make decisions. But they have this almost entirely separate emotional reasoning ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=659))

- process which is based on feelings and things they’ve experienced.” Steve said they used to hand-hold people and try to walk them through why certain facts should be compelling, why they should obviously change their minds, but his hunch now is that it will never work. A canvasser’s reasoning can’t be copied and pasted into another person. The facts that matter to them probably won’t matter to the other person at all.

- Once people see where their ideas come from, they become aware that they come from somewhere. They can then ask themselves if they’ve learned anything new in the time since they last considered them. Maybe those ideas need updating in some way. Deep canvassing is about gaining access to that emotional space, Steve explained, to “help them unload some baggage,” because that’s where mind change happens. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=682))

- Steve would tell me later that they had learned over many conversations that reasons, justifications, and explanations for maintaining one’s existing opinion can be endless, spawning like heads of a hydra. If you cut away one, two more would appear to take its place. Deep canvassers want to avoid that unwinnable fight. To do that, they allow a person’s justifications to remain unchallenged. They nod and listen. The idea is to move forward, make the person feel heard and respected, avoid arguing over a person’s conclusions, and instead work to discover the motivations behind them. To that end, the next step is to evoke a person’s emotional response to the issue. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=709))

- Once the LAB abandoned fact-based arguing for this approach, everything seemed to fall into place. The more Fleischer’s team talked with people, the better they got at flipping them, and with a video database of their successes they could accelerate that improvement. The LAB added scripts with guidelines to help canvassers open up and elicit stories from people, and they added intense training sessions to spread the word and quickly bring new volunteers into the fold. “The result was that over time we had gotten to a point where we were pretty sure we were having an impact,” said Fleischer.

- With the controversy fading in the public’s mind, scientists went to work doing as Paluck suggested, and more studies are forthcoming. Deep canvassers are now experimenting with issues like health-care reform, criminal justice, climate change, immigration, vaccine hesitancy, and racism—in Los Angeles as well as the Midwest, Chicago, and the Deep South. With satellite groups crisscrossing the country, the core team at the LAB turned their attention to conflicted Trump supporters.

- “It’s sort of like if you start off and there’s this old wisdom from 2,500 years ago that if you would chew on this one tree bark, then you wouldn’t get headaches,” Broockman told me. “Later, we realized that was aspirin, and then we distilled aspirin. Now we know, it’s actually a particular chemical in aspirin. We’re at the tree bark stage right now. If you do this thing, you get effects, but we have no idea what’s doing the work or why, or what the underlying chemistry is. Now the real work begins.” We will return to Broockman and Kalla later, after we look at the science of how minds do and do not change. For instance, I’d later find research that helped explain the phenomenon I saw in the archives, something psychologists call belief-change blindness: when people seemed unaware that their arguments from the beginning of the conversation didn’t match the ones they shared at the end. A series of experiments conducted by psychologists Michael Wolfe and Todd J. Williams in 2017 captured this process in action. They asked college students whether spanking, a relatively neutral topic for that age group, was effective… ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=874))

- spanking beliefs a second time. A portion of the group returned to Wolfe and Williams with changed opinions. Considering the persuasive essays, if they were pro-spanking before, they had become anti-spanking in the time since, and vice versa. But when Wolfe and Williams pulled those subjects aside and asked them to recall how they had originally answered at the beginning of the research, most reported that their answers hadn’t changed. Though the researchers had proof of it, the subjects themselves had no awareness of their own flips. The research of Wolfe and Williams is consistent with the literature on something psychologists call consistency bias: our tendency, when uncertain, to assume our present self has always held the opinions it holds today. In one of the landmark papers on the topic, researchers asked the opinions of high school students about topics like the legalization of drugs, the rights of prisoners, and other contentious issues. They returned to those subjects a decade later, and then again a decade after that. They found that among those who had changed their perspectives, only 30 percent were aware… ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=885))

In one of the most famous instances, in 2004, when John Kerry was running for president, many of the attack ads called him a flip-flopper for saying he voted for an appropriations bill before he realized it was a mistake and then later voted against it. For updating his opinion in light of new evidence, the opposition said he couldn’t be trusted. People even brought flip-flops to the Republican national convention and chanted, “Flip-flop, flip-flop!” But the research is clear: the people brandishing casual… ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=895))

- When we gain a theory of mind, we also gain the ability to imagine what it must be like to be another person, to see and feel things as they do, to have different opinions because of different exposure to different experiences. That’s analogic perspective taking, a higher-level cognition that takes a lot of effort. We don’t often attempt it unless prompted. When I asked the late psychologist Lee Ross about it, he told me that when he worked on conflict resolution in Northern Ireland and in talks between Israel and Palestine, where the stakes were very high, people rarely considered the other side’s perspective until asked to do so. In his experience both parties were only ever interested in communicating their own perspectives. Not once, he said, in forty years of doing conflict negotiation had anyone ever arrived eager to learn how others saw the issues at hand. Giving up your own viewpoint for a while and trying on someone else’s is difficult, and we don’t do it by default. Research into perspective taking shows that people opposed to affirmative action, for example, often blame income disparity on a lack of willpower or strong work ethic instead of widespread prejudice or institutional racism. Yet, when experimenters asked those same people to look at a photo of a black man and write an essay about a day in his life, including as much vivid detail as possible about his thoughts and feelings, subjects reported a strong shift in attitudes concerning affirmative action. By empathizing, even hypothetically, people softened their positions—something subjects could have done at any time but, until prompted, never considered. Broockman and Kalla said people rarely engage in perspective taking, which is what makes it such a powerful persuasion tool in the hands of a deep canvasser. “Perspective taking is not just getting someone to feel sad, and therefore you change their minds,” said Kalla. Everyone already knows that prejudice is bad. Deep canvassers evoke memories charged with emotion so that people recall what it is like to be ostracized or judged or made to feel lesser than, and it challenges ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=932))

- their categorization of otherness. “Now all of a sudden when I say discrimination is wrong, I’m feeling that in a different way,” said Broockman. “I can now understand, ‘Oh yeah, it’s really awful to be discriminated against and treated differently. I can see what it might be like to be that person.’ It becomes difficult to justify making a fellow human being feel that way.” By the time I left the LAB, I felt as though jumping into the science of persuasion was getting ahead of myself. Their hypotheses about why deep canvassing worked all sounded plausible, but I still didn’t understand what tied all these ideas together. I needed to resolve a question that my time with the LAB had only made more mysterious. If facts don’t work on some people—if in fact they can make it less likely to change their minds—that would explain why the truthers didn’t change their minds when presented with evidence; but why was it that those same facts did convince Charlie Veitch? It seemed to me that there was a lot missing from all this, and if I was going to make sense of it, I’d need to look into the science that the deep canvassers had not, the science Broockman and Kalla were about to wade into. In the following chapter, that’s where we will head as well, starting with some neuroscientists who study disagreement itself. Fleischer asked me to check back when I knew more. He, too, was interested in the science behind how it worked, but he wanted to be clear: in the end, ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=948))

We did not invent the concept that one human being can talk with another human being,” he told me, laughing. “So in a way, there’s nothing original here at all, and yet it is very original, because it is so much against the grain of the dominant political culture.” He recalled a conversation years ago with a man who rushed out on to his porch when Fleischer explained why he was visiting. “The guy jumps out, he’s so eager to tell me how against gay marriage he is.” He was in his seventies, and he excitedly told Fleischer how terrible it would be for the country to make same-sex marriage legal. Fleischer asked if he knew anyone who was gay, and the man said, “Absolutely!” He and his wife had visited Disneyland recently, and to their dismay they had gone on Gay Day. “There were all these gays there, including this guy we saw wearing a big feather boa!” he told Fleischer.

- I had traveled to New York to meet Pascal and Karlovich because if I wanted to understand why the evidence that changed Charlie Veitch’s mind didn’t change the minds of the other truthers, I needed to first answer, scientifically, how minds change. That question seemed inextricably linked to another question: What is it that is changing when we use that phrase? Both of those questions seemed wrapped inside an even larger question: How is that thing, whatever it is that we call a mind, made in the first place? That is, how does our understanding of the world get baked into the goop wiggling around inside our skulls? So I wanted to take a step back, a few thousand steps back actually, all the way to neurons. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=995))

- The Dress was a meme, a viral photo that appeared all across social media for a few months. For some, when they looked at this photo, they saw a dress that appeared black and blue. For others, the dress appeared white and gold. Whatever people saw, it was impossible to see it differently. If not for the social aspect of social media, you might have never known that some people did see it differently. But since social media is social, learning the fact that millions saw a different dress than you did created a widespread, visceral response. The people who saw a different The Dress seemed clearly, obviously mistaken and quite possibly deranged. When The Dress started circling the internet, a tangible sense of dread about the nature of what is and is not real went as viral as the image itself.

- For many, it was an introduction to something neuroscience has understood for a long while, which is also the main subject of this chapter: the fact that reality itself, as we experience it, isn’t a perfect one-to-one account of the world around us. The world, as you experience it, is a simulation running inside your skull, a waking dream. We each live in a virtual landscape of perpetual imagination and self-generated illusion, a hallucination informed over our lifetimes by our senses and thoughts about them, updated continuously as we bring in new experiences via those senses and think new thoughts about what we have sensed. If you didn’t know this, for many The Dress demanded you either take to your keyboard to shout into ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1038))

- Uexküll realized the subjective experience of every living thing was confined to a private sensory world he called an “umwelt”: different sense organs, different umwelt, distinctive from that of another animal in the same environment. Each creature, therefore, was tuned to take in only a small portion of the total picture. Not that any animal would likely know that, which was Uexküll’s other big idea. Because no organism can perceive the totality of objective reality, each animal likely assumes that what it can perceive is all that can be perceived. Objective reality, whatever it is, can never be fully experienced by any one creature. Each umwelt is a private universe, a different subjective experience fitted to its niche, a perceptually bounded internal world. The umwelten of all of Earth’s creatures are like a sea filled with a panoply of sensory realities floating past one another, each unaware that it is unaware and none knowing what it does not know. Uexküll’s ideas weren’t completely new. Philosophers had wondered about the differences between subjective and objective reality going back to Plato’s cave, and are still wondering. When the philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked “What is it like to be a bat?” he suggested there could be no answer to that question because it would be impossible to think in that way. Bat sonar, he said, is nothing like anything we possess, “and there is no reason to suppose that ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1053))

In doing so, he generated lines of academic research into neuroscience and the nature of consciousness that are still going today. One of those studies is going to seem a bit icky, so bear with me, because it will illustrate something important.

Outside of that environment, when Blakemore and Cooper held a stick vertically and wiggled it around, all the cats’ heads bobbed in unison and turned together to follow the stick as the scientists darted it about. But as soon as the stick turned sideways, the cats looked away in different directions, and then they lost interest and wandered off. The vertical stick was fascinating, but the horizontal stick was not, because in their shared internal reality horizontal did not exist.

When the bandages fall away, people don’t suddenly see the people around them. Instead, they see only shapes and colors, like an infant. After a few weeks, though, they can reach out for objects and tell them apart, but at first they can’t tell whether those objects are near or far. They need years of experiences conjuring the third dimension before they can competently operate within it.

- For brains, everything is noise at first. Then brains notice the patterns in the static, and they move up a level, noticing patterns in how those patterns interact. Then they move up another level, noticing patterns in how sets of interacting patterns interact with other sets, and on and on it goes. Layers of pattern recognition built on top of simpler layers become a rough understanding of what to expect from the world around us, and their interactions become our sense of cause and effect. The roundness of a ball, the hard edge of a table, the soft elbow of a stuffed animal, each object excites certain neural pathways and not others, and each exposure strengthens their connections until the brain comes to expect those elements of the world and becomes better at making sense of them in context.

- to effects, our innate pattern recognition takes notice and forms expectations—Mom will come when I cry at night; mashed potatoes will make me happy; bees hurt when they sting. We start our lives awash in unpredictable chaos, but the regularity of our perceptions becomes the expectations we use to turn that chaos into predictable order. But when novel information arrives via the senses, something unusual or ambiguous, it doesn’t get added to subjective reality right away. It remains noise if it doesn’t seem to match a pattern in that layered archive of prediction. The brain needs some repeated experience with it, like the horizontal lines for those sensory-deprived cats and the shapes and colors for the patients in India. And since all reality is subjective, an umwelt bounded by the senses available to that creature, the patterns that never get noticed never become part of that animal’s internal world. If you can’t sense ultraviolet, you could live your entire life never knowing it existed, and so the private universe of a mantis shrimp is painted with colors humans can never see nor imagine. What research like this demonstrates is that each and every brain enters the world trapped in a dark vault of a skull, unable to witness firsthand what is happening outside. Thanks to brain plasticity, through repeated experience, when inputs are regular and repeating, neurons quickly get burned into the reciprocal patterns of activation. It creates a unique predictive model in each individual nervous system, a sort of bespoke resting potential for those same networks to light up in the same way in similar circumstances. Together, they form an internal representation, an artificial model within that darkness of what the outside world must be like, via the regular and recurring information arriving from the senses. As Bertrand Russell put it, “The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself.” The neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran told me that he likes to think of it like a general deep in a bunker directing a battle using a big table covered with miniature tanks and soldiers. The brain, like that general, depends on scouts to send reports from the battlefield to know how to update the model. The general never sees the world outside, only the simplified representation on the table in the bunker. In between reports, he can only use the existing representation in front of him to make sense of the present situation outside. Whatever is on that model, at the moment, that’s what he uses to plan, make judgments, and settle on goals and commit to decisions about the future.

- If we do disagree over what we see, it’s usually because the image is ambiguous in some way, and the brain of one person is disambiguating the image in a way another person is not. Pascal said that in neuroscience the go-to examples of disambiguation are called intrapersonal bistable visual illusions—bistable because each brain settles on one interpretation at a time, and intrapersonal because every brain settles on the same two interpretations. You’ve likely seen a few of these: the duckrabbit for example, which sometimes looks like a duck and sometimes looks like a rabbit. Or the Rubin vase, which sometimes looks like a vase and sometimes looks like two people facing in silhouette.

- The Duckrabbit originally appeared, unattributed, as a drawing in an 1892 issue of Fliegende Blätter, a German magazine, with a caption asking which two animals are most alike. It was later popularized by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein to illustrate the difference between perception and interpretation. He wrote, “We find certain things about seeing puzzling, because we do not ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1162))

- find the whole business about seeing puzzling enough.” Like all two-dimensional images, whether blobs of paint or pixels on a screen, if the lines and shapes seem similar enough to things we’ve seen in the past, we disambiguate them into the Mona Lisa, or a sailboat, or in the case of a bistable image, either a duck or a rabbit. But The Dress was something new, an interjacent bistable visual illusion—bistable because each brain settles on one interpretation at a time, but interjacent because each brain settles on only one of two possible interpretations. That’s what made The Dress so confusing to Pascal. The same light was going into everyone’s eyes, and every brain was interpreting the lines and shapes as a dress, yet somehow all those brains weren’t converting that dress into the same colors. Something was happening between perception and consciousness, and he wanted to know what that was. So he acquired some funding and shifted the focus of his lab at NYU to tackling the mystery of The Dress while it was still going viral.

- Pascal’s hunch was that different people saw different dresses because when we aren’t sure what we are seeing, when we are in unfamiliar and ambiguous territory, we disambiguate using our priors, short for “prior probabilities”—the layers of pattern recognition generated by neural pathways, burned in by experiences with regularities in the external world. The term originates from statistics and has come to mean any assumption the brain carries about how the world outside should appear given how it has appeared in the past.

- The photo had been taken on a dreary day. It was taken with a cheap phone. One portion of the image was bright, and the other was dim. Pascal rushed through these details in a frenzied staccato, then asked, “So what does that tell us?” “The lighting was ambiguous?” I offered. “Exactly!” Pascal said, pushing on. He explained that the color that appeared in each brain was different depending on how each brain disambiguated the lighting conditions. For some, it disambiguated the ambiguous as black and blue and for others, white and gold. As with the strawberries, people’s brains accomplished this by lying to them, by creating a lighting condition that wasn’t there. What made this image different, he said, was that different brains told different lies, dividing people into two camps with incompatible subjective realities. But why were they so different? Chasing that hypothesis, Pascal thought he had an answer. After two years of research with more than 10,000 participants, Pascal discovered a clear pattern among his subjects. The more time a person had spent exposed to artificial light (which is predominantly yellow)—typically a person who works indoors or at night—the more likely they were to say The Dress was black and blue. That was because ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1200))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- they assumed, unconsciously, at the level of visual processing, that it was artificially lit, and thus their brains subtracted the yellow, leaving behind the darker, bluish shades. However, the more time a person had spent exposed to natural light—someone who works during the day, outside, or near windows—the more likely they were to subtract the blue and see it as white and gold. Either way—and this is the important point for us going forward—the ambiguity never registered. Whatever colors people saw subjectively, the image never seemed ambiguous because consciously people experienced only the output of their processes, and the output differed depending on a person’s prior experiences with light. The result was a lie told to them by their brains that felt obviously true. Pascal’s lab came up with a term for this. They call it SURFPAD. When you combine Substantial Uncertainty with Ramified (which means branching) or Forked Priors or Assumptions, you will get Disagreement. In other words, when the truth is uncertain, our brains resolve that uncertainty without our knowledge by creating the most likely reality they can imagine based on our prior experiences. People whose brains remove that uncertainty in similar ways will find themselves in agreement, like those who saw the dress as black and blue. Others whose brains resolve that uncertainty in a different way will also find themselves in agreement, like those who saw the dress as white and gold. The essence of SURFPAD is that these two groups each feel certain, and among the like-minded it seems those who disagree, no matter their numbers, must be mistaken. In both groups, people then begin searching for reasons why so many people in other groups can’t see the truth without entertaining the possibility that they aren’t seeing the truth themselves.

Most people weren’t experts on vaccines or epidemiology, so the information on how it worked and what to do was both novel and ambiguous. To resolve that uncertainty, people used their prior experiences with vaccines and doctors, their existing levels of trust in scientific institutions, and their current attitudes toward the government to make sense of it all. For some, that led to the conclusion that vaccines were probably safe and effective.

- them as such, your brain, without your knowledge, would then edit the image by subtracting the green-tinted overexposure while adding back the pink hues to the shoes. If Karlovich and Pascal were right, depending on what people unconsciously assumed, they would disagree on what they saw. Once they settled on this hypothesis, they went store to store all over Manhattan buying what they needed, then took everything to Pascal’s crawlspace where Karlovich donned the socks and Crocs while Pascal photographed them under green grow lights. They then showed the photos to subjects and asked them what they saw. The results? It worked exactly as they thought it would. Some people saw gray Crocs and green socks, and others saw pink Crocs and white socks. Like with The Dress, if subjects saw it one way, they couldn’t see it the other. They had their nuclear bomb. They had created from scratch something that before that moment only appeared in nature in about one in ten billion photographs. That alone would be a triumph, as far as scientific methodology and experimental design are concerned, but for Pascal and Karlovich this was evidence, at the level of neurons, that SURFPAD was true, because there was something deeper in the data: older people ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1286))

- were more likely to see the Crocs as pink, and younger people were more likely to see them as gray. Why? Because older people have had more life experiences with white socks, so that’s what they expected to see. That’s what socks are supposed to look like, and so they disambiguated the ambiguous to make them so. Their brains then assumed the lighting was green, which meant the Crocs must be pink in real life. Since younger people have had more experiences with colored socks, their priors told them the socks actually were green, and so they saw the image without any unconscious editing. Pascal brought up the image on a giant television hanging from a wall above his treadmill deck in his office at NYU and said, “If you take what is hitting your retina at face value, you see gray, but older people say, ‘Oh no. I know what these are! I’ve seen these before, they must be white! This light must be white.

Pascal was feverish about the implications. Neither side was right nor wrong, so arguing for only one side or the other wouldn’t arrive at a deeper understanding: that objective reality and subjective realities can differ. Only the two truths combined, the combination of shared perspectives, would alert people there was a deeper truth, and only through conversation would they have any hope of solving the mystery. “One’s beliefs can demonstrably color perception,” he cheekily explained when writing about the research. “We derived a principle underlying the nature of disagreement,” he added, allowing scientists to create disagreements like these in the future, “and—in turn—understand how disagreement comes about in general.” The white sock group didn’t update their priors; instead,… ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1306))

They believe it literally sheds light on other kinds of polarized disagreements surrounding politics, conspiracy theories, current events, and science denial. “There are more than thirty steps in visual processing before an image reaches consciousness,” Pascal said. You are only aware of the result, not the processes. At no point in processing the image of The Dress did anyone feel the uncertainty that led to their disambiguation. It’s the fact that uncertainty is eliminated so stealthily—that these processes are both unconscious and undebatable—that leads to our most intractable disputes.

- “Introducing challenging evidence does not change their beliefs. If anything, it strengthens them,” explained Pascal. “This might appear puzzling, but makes complete sense in a SURFPAD framework.” He said to imagine a trusted news source continuously paints a political figure in a bad light. If another news source paints them in a positive light, the brain doesn’t update. Instead, it would do just as it did with his white socks. It will assume the lighting is off and delete it, and subjectively it will feel like objectivity. That leads us to the second lesson. Since subjectivity feels like objectivity, naive realism makes it seem as though the way to change people’s minds is to show them the facts that support your view, because anyone else who has read the things you have read or seen the things you have seen will naturally see things your way, given that ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1366))

This is why you continue to ineffectually copy and paste links from all our most trusted sources when arguing your points with those who seem misguided, crazy, uninformed, and just plain wrong. The problem is that this is exactly what the other side thinks will work on you. The truth is that we are always reaching our conclusions through disambiguation, but all of that work is done in our different brains without us knowing it. We just experience, in consciousness, the result. You think you are experiencing the world as it truly is, and when a lot of people are sure their version of reality is the really real version at the same time that a lot of other people are sure that no, in fact, their version is, you get arguments that break the internet (like The Dress), but also the Inquisition, the Hundred Years’ War, QAnon, and anti-mask protests during global pandemics.

- both parties to focus on their processing, on how and why they see what they see, not what. The science behind how brains go about updating their priors suggests this is true; in fact, it’s how we’ve overcome every hurdle our species has ever faced. It’s literally how minds change. But there’s a catch, and that’s what we are going to explore in the next chapter. Pascal and Karlovich’s next experiment will be trying to see if the people who see white socks and pink Crocs are given some other information ahead of time, will that allow them to see the image as it truly is? They want to see if people can be taught to see the Crocs differently, to circumvent their own assumptions—in other words, they are going to try to change people’s minds by exposing them to new things. They hypothesize that it shouldn’t take an entire lifetime of new experiences to realize you might be wrong, to realize you need to update your priors and gain a new perspective. Pascal said, “They need to experience something that will make it unambiguously clear what the light is.” I told Pascal that I was planning on spending some time with former members of cults, hate groups, and conspiracy theory communities. Based on what I’d read, people often leave groups like those not because their beliefs are directly challenged, ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1421))

- How we settle on what is and is not true is a two-thousand-year-old conversation, one that has led people smarter than me to set aside the pursuit and go live in cabins where they could focus on needlepoint and perfecting their pancakes. To avoid that, instead of getting deep into the philosophy of knowledge, we will focus mostly on psychology and neuroscience. That’s not to say that philosophy isn’t worth our time; it’s just that if you’ve ever picked up a book on epistemology, the study of how we know things, it might take several hundred pages to explore how we determine whether free will is an illusion and yet still not reach a satisfying conclusion. We can escape the semantics, somewhat, by spending more time looking at how brains generate the foundations of those semantics. As we touched on earlier, information encoded in the brain is the on-and-off firing of neurons. It’s written onto a living substrate, but zoomed in it’s as neutral as words printed on a page. When we say the brain stores information, it just means that when the brain interacts with the outside world through its senses, or when it interacts with itself through thinking, the process at the deepest level is physical. Chemical and electrical activity rearranges molecules and atoms in your head, and the brain before an interaction is physically different than a brain after. When you listen to a song, meet a dog, have an argument about mustard, connections between neurons are strengthened, weakened, pruned, and altered so that the brain is no longer the same shape and arrangement of very tiny parts as it was before those events. How does that translate to information? Just as when you press a mark on a page with a pen or press an emblem into a wax, the physical form of that which is shaped changes. As senses respond to the natural world, they deliver signals to the brain, and those signals alter the brain’s physical structure. Like a foot pressed into mud or a mark burned into wood, a cause leads to an effect, and the effect carries with it information. Add some biological machines to notice the information, some others to notice the patterns within it, some others to notice the patterns in the patterns, and you have the making of a mind. These patterns can also help us to discover truths hidden between them. Psychologist Steven Pinker created a thought experiment to demonstrate this. Imagine sawing down a tree, Pinker begins, then imagine a machine that could sense the rings in the stump. For each ring, it makes a mark. Five rings, five marks. The pattern in the rings is now encoded elsewhere. He then asks us to imagine a second machine that could produce truth without “thinking.” Here is how it would work: the second machine would sense the rings on a stump and make a mark for each one. Five rings, five marks. Then it senses the rings on a second, smaller stump. Three rings, three marks. If we added a feature to the machine so that for each ring it sensed on the smaller… ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1448))

- this purely mechanical process would produce a hidden truth. The rings correspond to years, the marks correspond to rings, so the two marks after subtraction correspond to how old the larger tree was when the smaller tree was planted: two years old. But we can go further. Since the rings are also a cause left behind by an effect, in this case the dark and light circles left behind as a tree grows fatter over the course of a single orbit of the Earth around the sun, the marks also correspond with two orbits. After the first tree was planted, the Earth traveled around the sun two times before the second tree sprouted. All of this would be true not because the machine was “itself intelligent or rational” but because it produced a “chain of ordinary physical events, whose first link was a configuration of matter that carries information.” That’s what is happening in the brain. It continuously “burns marks” into neurons to match the patterns it senses in the world outside, along with a continuous sanding away of those marks as it recognizes other patterns… ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1472))

- patterns get stronger; if not, they get weaker. Over time, the forces of natural selection favored biological machines that could better sense correlations and respond to them. In short, creatures with nervous systems that encode information, then compare and contrast correlations, became better at using that information to survive, thrive, and reproduce. Stimulus and response organisms like spiders and worms emerged from single-celled and free-floating jelly predecessors that moved toward rewards and away from danger. Generation after generation, that process produced even better biological machines with even better senses and even better responses. In time, second-order machines rose out of the first-order. They could read the information inside themselves as if noticing patterns in the outside world. And they could make use of those patterns on different levels, translating correlations into inferences and predictions, both of which led to better success when searching for resources and avoiding threats. On it went, until the first… ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1481))

- starving and not getting eaten, make decisions and judgments in moments of uncertainty based on how novel information compared to information already encoded. In other words, life learned how to learn. According to neuroscience, that’s what mind change really is: a learning machine incessantly and simultaneously burning in and sanding away encoded information. In complex organisms, survival depends on predicting what will happen next based on what happened before. It may seem odd, but our ability to notice errors in those predictions depends on dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for regulating motivation. As neuroscientist Mark Humphries puts it, the brain rests in a “soup” of dopamine, and from one moment to the next the concentration of the soup influences how motivated you feel to remain on task or abandon it for another. When the chemistry in our brains that keeps us at work, keeps us studying, keeps us watching a movie or standing in line or holding up our end of a conversation shifts, we then feel unmotivated and ready to move to something else. Or, in… ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1491))

- when outcomes don’t match our expectations, and varying dopamine levels then motivate us to notice, learn, and adjust our predictions going forward. For instance, if you took a flight to Iceland, and at the baggage claim you learned the airport offers free ice cream for arriving passengers, a spike in dopamine would bring your attention to an unexpected positive outcome. You become motivated to add a new behavior to your routines and choose that airport in the future. But if you had chosen that airport before and chose it again specifically for their complimentary ice cream at baggage claim, your dopamine would remain stable. Since your experience matched your predictions, you would likely maintain that behavior. However, if you had expected ice cream, and you learned upon arrival that the airport had discontinued the service, you would experience a dip in dopamine thanks to the unexpected negative outcome, and as a result you might not choose that airport again. As psychologist Michael Rousell told me, when experiences don’t match our expectations, a spike in dopamine lasting about a millisecond motivates us to stop whatever we were doing and pay attention. After the surprise, we become motivated to learn from the new experience so we can be less wrong in the future. For our ancestors, he said, “surprise meant imminent danger or enormous opportunity, but thinking about it instead of acting on it meant you might succumb to the danger or miss out on the opportunity, and either could remove you from the gene pool.” When our models don’t match our experiences, whether it’s an unexpected party waiting behind our front door or a missing hamburger in our take-out bag, surprises encourage us to update our behaviors. They change our minds without us noticing as the brain quietly updates our predictive schemas, hopefully eliminating the surprise by making it more predictable in the future. All subjective reality is constructed in this way, in layers of patterns and predictive schemas, but thanks to brain plasticity, that construction project never ends. Like neuronal masons constantly adding rooms to a cathedral of confidence, our brains are continuously deconstructing and rebuilding our models of reality from one moment to the next to make sense of novelty and surprise. Our minds are always changing and updating, writing and editing. And thanks to this plasticity… ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1502))

- In philosophy, the idea of “knowing” something doesn’t mean believing that you know something. It means knowing something that also happens to be true. For instance, if you believe that if you simultaneously flush one toilet in Australia and another in Canada the two waters will spin in opposite directions, well, that’s not knowledge, because it’s not true. The spin of a flush is always the result of where the water first starts flowing in that particular bowl, so if you believe otherwise, it doesn’t count as knowledge, just belief. To philosophers, beliefs and knowledge are separate, because you can believe things that are false. The problem with trying to answer the question of how we determine whether something is the truth comes from the fact that we must answer how we determine our definition of truth itself is true.

- This is where the term post-truth starts to seem rather silly, because philosophically for about two thousand years or so no one has been able to agree on what the word truth even means. We can’t be in a post-truth world if we never lived in a truth-filled paradise to begin with. And for millennia we’ve been debating not only what is the truth, but how we go about determining it. The only way out of this loop has been to study how we come to agree on facts in general, the academic discipline known as epistemology. Epistemology is the study of knowledge itself—facts, fictions, rationalizations, justifications, rationality, logic—all of it. Well before we had a word for it, this was the central concern of philosophy itself. Before we had microscopes and lasers, one could make a living by thinking deeply about the matter until you had created yet another epistemology to add to others in open competition for the best way to identify a fact. That’s what an epistemology is: a framework for sorting out what is true. Given how difficult this can be, one can empathize with people who get locked into arguments online about whether hotdogs are sandwiches and, by extension, with people who argue over whether the Earth is flat,… ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1540))

- dancing or changing a tire. This is procedural knowledge. In either case, if someone makes a claim to some form of knowledge, the way that claim was tested for a very long time was through the use of propositions. Propositions are neither true nor false, just claims that could go either way. Someone uses a sentence to state something that could be true, such as “Patrick Swayze played James Bond in A View to a Kill.” Then that proposition is challenged by asking for its justification. In this case, the evidence suggests that James Bond was played by several actors, none of which was Swayze. Then by the standards of propositions, this one is not justified. Therefore, it is false. Propositions also allow for what is called propositional logic. “There are 1.2 million stray dogs in Houston. Houston is a city in Texas. Therefore, there are more than 1.2 million stray dogs in Texas.” Sometimes, however, even when the evidence presented is verifiable and the logic is sound, you can’t depend on a proposition to reach a definite conclusion. For instance, if you claim that all swans are white, and if your justification is that all the swans you’ve ever seen have… ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1552))

- In the end, epistemology is about translating evidence into confidence. By taking what we believe and then sorting through some kind of system for arranging, organizing, and classifying it against the available evidence, our certainty in a truth should go up or down. But some ways of sorting out what the hell is going on are better than others, depending on what it is you want to know. In one epistemological framework, we might reach a degree of confidence that suggests the moon controls the tides. In another, we might grow ever more certain it controls our dreams. Thankfully for us, when it comes to the empirical truth, the epistemology called science seems to have won out, since it is the only one that can build iPhones and vaccines. Sometime in the 1600s, we developed the scientific method to test our fact-based beliefs and reach consensus on what is empirically true among what is observable and measurable. In science, you treat all your conclusions as maybes, and instead of thinking deeply using propositions or meditating using peyote, you spend time creating tightly controlled experiments. Then you use the outcomes to create piles of… ([Location 1563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1563))

When it comes to questions about the best policies and politics, about morality and ethics, science can only advise other epistemologies. But the philosophy of the scientific method works in those domains as well, from its insistence that we should always work to disconfirm our conclusions and those of others instead of confirming them, which is what we would usually rather do. Before we explore the science behind why we would rather confirm our conclusions, I want to look again at the overlap of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.

- When we first suspect we may be wrong, when expectations don’t match experience, we feel viscerally uncomfortable and resist accommodation by trying to apply our current models of reality to the situation. It’s only when the brain accepts that its existing models will never resolve the incongruences that it updates the model itself by creating a new layer of abstraction to accommodate the novelty. The result is an epiphany, and like all epiphanies it is the conscious realization that our minds have changed that startles us, not the change itself. Kuhn wrote that “novelty emerges only with difficulty, manifested by resistance, against a background provided by expectation.” In other words, when we don’t know what we don’t know, at first we see only what we expect to see, even when what we see doesn’t match our expectations. When we get that “I might be wrong” feeling, we initially try to explain it away, interpreting novelty as confirmation, looking for evidence that our models are still correct, creating narratives that justify holding on to our preconceived notions. Unless grandly subverted, our models must fail us a few times before we begin to accommodate. When this happens in science, Kuhn called it a “paradigm shift,” that moment when a model that can’t incorporate its anomalies is retired for one that can. As examples of how quickly this can happen, he pointed to optical illusions that can be seen in two different ways—a box that seems to be facing in two different directions, ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1666))

- or one of those bistable visual illusions like the duckrabbit, which looks like a duck when viewed one way and a rabbit when viewed another. Kuhn was suggesting that when we update, it isn’t the evidence that changes, but our interpretation of it. The natural world remains the same from one paradigm to the next, but as anomalies in our explanations build up over time, they require us to seek different explanations for what we previously thought was settled and understood. At a certain point, Kuhn said, “what were ducks in the scientist’s world before the revolution are rabbits afterwards.” ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1678))

- Jean Piaget agreed with much of what Kuhn had to say, but he disagreed on one major point. His research into the development of children through stages suggested that the old models are never tossed out; instead, we build upon them. He saw mind change as a sort of Ship of Theseus, replacing things bit by bit while at sea so as to never risk sinking the vessel. There’s enough overlap of these two views that one could argue they are basically the same, but Kuhn was talking about how paradigms shift in science, and Piaget was talking about how change occurs in individuals. Together, we can see that, yes, we do sometimes realize our old models are, in a word, wrong, but we never toss them into some sort of cognitive dumpster and start over. What Kuhn called a revolution, or a paradigm shift, Piaget saw as a moment of integration, not replacement. He wrote that all knowledge, “no matter how novel, is never at first, totally independent of previous knowledge. It is only a reorganization, adjustment, correction, or addition with respect to existing knowledge. Even experimental data unknown up to a certain time must be integrated with existing knowledge. But this does not happen by itself; it takes an effort of assimilation and accommodation.” Piaget spent most of his lifetime writing about how brains create knowledge from experience. We tend to think of him as the psychologist who established the stages of child development and object permanence. He created all those fun experiments to find out when children learn that when… ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1683))

- For instance, when a child first sees a small animal with four legs and a tail, and a parent says to them, “Dog!” the child then creates a category for nonhuman animals with four legs. Later, when that same child sees a horse and exclaims, “Dog!” the parent must correct them. “No, that’s a horse.” At that moment, the child abandons assimilation for accommodation, revising the old category that once held all four-legged creatures and creating a new one with space for more. Piaget introduced these two concepts, assimilation and accommodation, as part of his theory of constructivism, which is widely used today in education to develop modern lesson plans informed by the science of human development. Where Kuhn saw mind change as akin to punctuated equilibrium in evolution, long periods of stasis and resistance punctuated by bursts of sudden and often traumatic change, Piaget saw it as continuous and balanced. For Piaget, organisms continuously adapt in the pursuit of making their environment optimal until they feel like they have sufficiently mastered that environment. At that point, they’ve reached what he called “equilibration.” Equilibration is both… ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1697))

Most people intuitively and immediately go searching among friends, family, and the internet for new information, new perspectives, raw material for rebuilding themselves. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, psychologists like Richard G. Tedeschi and Lawrence G. Calhoun gathered evidence for a new theory about how people deal with extreme change. They found that for most individuals, surviving a trauma leads to an adaptive spiral of positive development, an awakening of a new self through what they call “posttraumatic growth.” In one of their studies, Tedeschi and Calhoun interviewed a musician who had become permanently paralyzed, unable to play, and like many of their subjects, he told them it was “the best thing that ever happened to me.” He said even if he could alter the way that things had turned out, he wouldn’t. Before, he was an alcoholic with no clear purpose, no plans beyond the next gig and the next bar.

The resolution of that panic necessitates new behavior, new thoughts, new beliefs, and a new self-concept. Not everyone shares the musician’s sentiment that they’d never change a thing, but Tedeschi and Calhoun’s research shows that after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, after losing a child, after a crushing divorce, after surviving a car accident or a war or a heart attack,people routinely report that the inescapable negative circumstances they endured left them better people. They shed a slew of outdated assumptions that, until the trauma, they never had any reason to question, and thus never knew were wrong.

- Still, total reboots of the self are sometimes unavoidable, and when that happens, in the aftermath, daily life can be intensely traumatic. In such a crisis, everything seems anomalous. Tedeschi and Calhoun write that a “psychologically seismic event” can “reduce to rubble many of the schematic structures that have guided understanding, decision making, and meaningfulness.” The traumatic event so contradicts and, in some cases, nullifies the understanding a person counts on for context and prediction that it calls into question the “general purpose and meaning of a person’s existence.” Extending that metaphor, Tedeschi and Calhoun say that the cognitive rebuilding process that takes place after such a traumatic event is akin to the reconstruction that follows an earthquake. Only the strongest structures survive, the ones that we slowly learn are still useful. Anything reduced to rubble won’t be rebuilt in the same, unreliable way again. The result is a new worldview that is “far more resistant to being shattered.” In crisis, we become radically open to changing our minds. Posttraumatic growth is an accelerated version of the normally invisible, continuous, and gradual process of updating our priors, that collection of conjectures that don’t feel like conjectures. Psychologist Colin Murray Parkes calls them our “assumptive world”: a constellation of mental phenomena that provides us with our notions of predictability and control, much of which is inherited and internalized from our cultures—a set of knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes that guides our actions, helps us understand the causes and reasons for what happens, and forms the self that gives a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose. The assumptive world serves us in three main ways. First, it puts the immediate present into context. It tells us the who, what, when, where, and why of our second-by-second existence. Who is my mother? When should I go to sleep? Where is my mailbox? Why did the egg shatter against the floor? This assumptive world also provides us with a library of if–then statements. These causal narratives tell us what will happen in the future when we interact with the world in a certain way. In the short term, we know if we turn the key, the ignition will fire. If we drop an egg, it will make a mess. If we slap our boss, we won’t get that bonus. The assumptive world allows us to… ([Location 1741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1741))

Unless otherwise motivated, the brain prefers to assimilate, to incorporate new information into its prior understanding of the world. In other words, the solution to “I might be wrong” is often “but I’m probably not.” The brain walks a tightrope of adaptiveness, switching back and forth between overwriting old information and conserving what it already holds. In other words, we are forever balancing between assimilation and accommodation, because if we changed our minds when we shouldn’t, we might become dangerously incorrect; at the same time, we might remain dangerously incorrect if we failed to change them when we should. To orient ourselves properly, we update carefully. So if novel information requires us to update our beliefs, attitudes, or values, we experience cognitive dissonance until we either change our minds or change our interpretations.

Some people may need a bit more disconfirmation than others. Also, some people may be in a situation where disconfirmation is unlikely, cut off from challenging ideas, curating an information feed that stays below the threshold. Depending on the source, a person’s motivations, the issue at hand, the amount of exposure to challenging ideas, and so on, the affective tipping point may be harder to reach, so the important point isn’t the specific number found in this one study, just that there is a number, a quantifiable level of doubt when we admit we are likely wrong and become compelled to update our beliefs, attitudes, and values.

- Kuhn and Piaget used different terms and metaphors, but their conclusions were similar. Both realized that people change their minds in much the same way that new theories in science supersede old ones. In science, if an experiment delivers a result that doesn’t match expectations, that doesn’t fit the prevailing model, researchers place the anomalies aside, in a holding bucket. That way they can continue to work on problems using the tools that the current model affords and come back to the bucket of abeyance later, should the anomalies accumulate and overflow. When incongruences appear, the first assumption is that the model is fine, that there must have been some mistake in the measurements, in the tools, in the scientists themselves maybe. But over time, that bucket of abeyance begins to fill with anomalies, and at a certain point it grows too heavy to ignore. Rules of thumb are no longer useful. Exceptions cease to prove the rule. Variation and nuance reveal stereotypes for what they are. Piaget showed us that this is similar to how minds update.

- As we experience objective reality through our limited senses, we construct subjective representations inside our heads to better navigate the world outside them. When confronting novel information in moments of uncertainty, we have no choice but to favor those representations. It’s dangerous to be wrong, but it’s also dangerous to be ignorant, so if new information suggests our models might be incorrect or incomplete, we first attempt to fit the anomalies into our old understanding. If they do, we continue using those models until they fail us too many times to ignore. But the research into posttraumatic growth and the affective tipping point reveals that we all have a breaking point after which we enter learning mode, eager to make sense of a relentless stream of disconfirming information. Unless you are a hermit in a cabin or a disciple in a cult, most of us regularly confront other minds that see the world differently than our own. In the previous chapter, we saw that the research at NYU indicated we often assume, at first, that the people who reach different conclusions must be mistaken. The SURFPAD model says that in moments of substantial uncertainty, people with different priors will reach different assumptions, and thanks to naive realism, ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=1874))

But as Redlawsk’s research revealed, there can come a moment when we realize that refusing to change is riskier than admitting we are probably wrong.

- But it wasn’t Grace who changed Zach at the Olive Garden that day; it was their waiter. At the end of their meal, instead of leaving them the check, the waiter told Zach that he wanted to pay for their food. In fact, he already had. Zach protested, but the waiter shushed him. He explained that he knew Zach had recently left Westboro. As a gay man, he wanted to show Zach a kindness. Zach didn’t know how to interpret what was happening. It seemed preposterous. For all his life he had believed that LGBTQ people were grotesque. He had spent years picketing with signs trying to convince others of the same. Recalling that moment, he said of gay men, “I didn’t know any. I just assumed that they were beasts.” ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2004))

- After that meal, he started wondering if all of the assumptions tied to his former life were true. If his beliefs about gay men were wrong, then what else? His first thoughts were of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry and how Westboro had told him the girls who go to their concerts were “simple sluts.” Simple-minded, stupid, and promiscuous. He immediately, and for the first time, questioned it. He felt overwhelmed by a torrent of information that he once considered noise. All at once, he began to feel an intense uncertainty not only about what was true, but about who he was. He said the most alarming thing was the realization that if he had gone to Olive Garden while he was still in the church, the waiter’s act of kindness might not have made any difference at all. He would have found a way to interpret it differently. Zach was still unpacking what it all meant. He was shocked to realize he was open to all sorts of change, and once he realized it, an array of alternative beliefs, attitudes, and values became newly acceptable. “The first time I talked to a Jewish person, I thought what Westboro taught me at first, and then I was like, ‘I don’t want to listen to that.’ I want to try to see reality for what it is. I want to think with an open mind and to make discoveries. There’s a great deal of mystery in this world that I walk in, in this universe.” Today, he said, “I have gay friends. I have bisexual friends. I have pansexual friends.” He was still struggling, though, still rebuilding his models, still expanding his mind. Zach said he recently began dabbling with Buddhism. Zach reiterated that he didn’t leave the church because he changed his opinions; he changed his opinions because he left the church. And he left the church because it had become intolerable for other reasons. Leaving opened him up to the possibility he could be wrong about many things, and that began a difficult period of rebirth. He had developed issues with trust and would go through a series of bad relationships while suffering intense bouts of depression. He’d check into a mental health clinic after fantasizing about harming himself. He said it was like clawing out from the bottom of a well. “They taught me to be very judgmental at Westboro. I feel kind of torn, because part of me wants to practice unconditional love, but then you can’t trust everyone out there, you know?” ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2010))

Why, then, I asked her, after all their interactions with people like her and the people at Equality House, do they keep updating that sign? Every day they see you aren’t monsters. Why do they persist? “When you grow up believing certain things, and the people you love and trust tell you those things, and you’re a kid, you are helpless to internalize that,” she said. “I bet a lot of Westboro members don’t actually want to kill anybody that’s different from them, or shun them from society, or send them to a fiery death. But it’s really hard when you spend all your time with a group of people who expect that from you.

In 2015, a New Yorker profile of Megan trended heavily on social media, prompting her to write her autobiography, Unfollow, which quickly became an international bestseller after its release in 2019. Her TED Talk has been viewed more than six million times, and the head of TED, Chris Anderson, said of her, “Rarely do you come across someone with the courage and clarity of Megan Phelps-Roper.” She went on to consult for law enforcement agencies that monitor extremist groups, and she continues to serve on Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council.

I ran through SURFPAD: how in moments of uncertainty we often don’t feel uncertain because the brain uses our priors to disambiguate without our knowledge. I explained that when that happens, it can make the people who see the world differently seem deluded or, in the most extreme cases, insane. She laughed and said it matched up perfectly with her experiences on the inside. Then I told her about assimilation and accommodation, how we first try to make novel and challenging information fit into our worldviews until those times when we realize we must update our worldviews to make room for them.

- that a horse isn’t a dog, she also learns that dogs and horses are part of a new category, a new level of abstraction to make sense of the world. I told her that Piaget said that when we learn to play a game like checkers, we don’t just learn the rules of the game, we learn that games have rules. When we move on to chess, we’ve already learned how to learn how to play a game, that games exist, which makes it easier to learn than if we had first started with chess. Megan began to tear up. “It still kind of surprises me how it was happening kind of little by little. And it’s exactly that process that you were describing, like trying to take in this new information and make it fit with what I believed. It was this process. And at the time, I remember thinking that it took such a long time, and now I think, ‘A year and a half. Is that really all it took?’ ” Megan said her doubts, like Zach’s, began with the new rules put in place by the elders. The church had always singled out “troublemakers,” but their treatment of family members like her sister Grace felt unjust. After Lindsey told the church about Grace texting her husband, Westboro held a meeting, as they often did, where she said “essentially everybody in the church” came together as if it were a court trial and laid out a case against Grace. No matter what someone said, “everything that looks bad is bad and everything that looks good is also bad. So, if the action isn’t wrong, then the intent is wrong. The heart is wrong. And it was terrifying. It’s terrifying to watch. Because you don’t want it to happen to you.” As a child, Megan said confrontations like those felt like an extension of parenting. People older than her knew better about how to deal with other people older than her. She knew she was never going to be a leader in the group, and so said nothing. Yet, “I would think so often, like, I don’t see what they’re seeing. I must be missing something. I must be wrong about this.” But that was before Twitter opened her up to the possibility that it was the church that might be wrong.

- Like Zach, Megan had left the church because she couldn’t tolerate her home life. It wasn’t until after she left that she changed her mind about specific beliefs and attitudes, especially concerning gay people. But, she said, “it was very easy for me to switch those gears. Part of that, of course, was because we believed that we were loving people. It’s not like I hated them and then I loved them. I thought I loved them. Then I realized that’s not really how you love people. This is a much better way.” I asked Megan why she and Zach weren’t swayed while they were still in the church. They had confronted people who saw the world differently thousands of times as they picketed across the country, as they interacted on social media. They had seen so many counterexamples of how to treat others, how to think and feel and believe. “Community,” she said, reiterating what Caitlyn had told me on the front porch of Equality House. “I’m surrounded by all these people that I love and who love me, who show me that they love me in all of these very practical ways, all of the time. That is the air that you breathe. And so, when you grow up in an environment like that, especially like Westboro, where it is extremely doctrinaire—” She searched for the right words. “—We were thinking and talking about Bible verses and all of the evidence to support our views—all of the time.

- Zach’s and Megan’s stories were different in many ways, but what they shared was the fact that it was the loss of a sense of community that prompted them to leave. It opened them up to the potential for changing their minds, and then they started to reconsider evidence that before had seemed invisible, nonsensical, and irrelevant. Still, even when they felt their first doubts, it took others, people on the outside who listened and showed them counterarguments wrapped in kindness, to truly pull them away. For Zach, it was medical school, then people like Caitlyn Cameron. For Megan, it was Twitter, then people like David Abitbol. For both, they couldn’t leave their worldviews behind until they felt like there was a community on the outside that would welcome them into theirs. With all these concepts and the science behind them fresh in my head, I felt I was ready to return to the story of Charlie Veitch. Listening to Megan, I recalled what Charlie said about the truthers; how his peers seemed like animals to him when, after he tried to convince them that they were wrong, they ridiculed the dead and the loved ones they left behind. In those arguments, the convictions of his companions grew stronger, but his grew weaker. I had missed it when I first heard his story, but now it seemed clear. Like Megan, he too had been spending time with people from the outside, but where Charlie’s story differed was that he wasn’t living in ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2323))

You know things.” “You’re in the army of the enlightened,” I said. “Yeah, you’re like Neo in the car after seeing the Oracle and you are looking at all those people, like, ‘Wow, look at the Matrix.

- After spending time with Megan Phelps-Roper and her brother Zach, I felt like I had seen the outlines of something they both shared with Charlie Veitch, and the first clues came when I interviewed two neuroscientists who challenged people while they lay supine in a brain scanner. In 2016, cognitive neuroscientists Sarah Gimbel, Sam Harris, and Jonas Kaplan identified a group of subjects who held strong opinions by asking them to mark on a scale from one to seven how strongly they believed in a variety of statements, some political, some neutral. They then placed them into an MRI machine and presented five counterarguments to each subject. For instance, if subjects thought Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, they read that it had been ([Location 2391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2391))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “invented 70 years before Edison.” If they thought gun control should be more restrictive, they read things like, “Ten times more people are murdered with kitchen knives each year than are killed by assault weapons.” The goal wasn’t to persuade the subjects to change their minds, just to measure what happened in their brains when challenged. After reading the counterarguments, subjects again saw the original statements, and the researchers again asked them to rank their feelings on a scale from one to seven. Comparing the two reactions, researchers found that people readily softened their beliefs for neutral statements, but for topics like abortion, same-sex marriage, and the death penalty, something else happened. As the arguments mounted, subjects responded to a threat to their convictions as if it was a threat to their very flesh and blood. When a person was challenged about political wedge issues like abortion or welfare or gun control, the scanner showed that their brains went into fight-or-flight mode, causing their bodies to pump adrenaline, stiffening the muscles and moving blood out of the nonessential organs. As Gimbel told me, “The response in the brain that we see is very similar to what would happen if, say, you were walking through the forest and came across a bear.” ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2396))

- Why such a bodily response? Because blood had rushed into a part of the brain called the default mode network, an interconnected set of regions that become active when people think about the self in relation to others. You know how meditation and psychedelics can make you feel like you are less attached to your identity and more one with everything? That’s what happens when you dampen activity within the default mode network. Increasing activity does the opposite, less one with everything and more attached to your identity. The more subjects considered their selves, the more blood rushed into the amygdala and the insular cortex, two regions of the brain involved with regulating anger, fear, and keeping a check on your heart rate and perspiration. “Remember that the brain’s first and primary job is to protect our selves,” Kaplan told me. “That extends beyond our physical self, to our psychological self. Once these things [beliefs, attitudes, and values] become part of our psychological self, they are then afforded all the same protections that the brain gives to the body.” But why? I asked. Kaplan said he didn’t know, but it likely had to do with group identity, and suggested I speak with psychologists who study how group identity affects our beliefs.

- We’ve been studying how groups affect the minds of their members since World War II, when psychological research into conformity and group conflict became the centerpiece of psychological experimentation. That work led to the famous Solomon Asch experiment in which people denied the truth of their own eyes when surrounded by actors who claimed a short line and a long line printed on a large card were the same length. A third of subjects bowed to social pressure and said they agreed, though later they said they internally felt at odds with the group. It also led to the Stanley Milgram experiments into obedience in which experimenters successfully goaded two thirds of subjects, who believed they were delivering electric shocks to strangers, to crank the electricity up to lethal doses. But the study of group identity began in earnest between those experiments, in 1954, when a group of psychologists created two tribes of children who nearly killed each other. At Robbers Cave State Park in Oklahoma, the same year Lord of the Flies was published, psychologist Muzafer Sherif and his colleagues, posing as camp counselors, took over a summer camp and, via separate buses, deposited twenty-two fifth-grade boys, ages eleven and twelve, into two neighboring campsites. For a while, the neighboring camps remained unaware of each other. They began to form their own cultures, and within days arbitrary nuances shared by group members became established norms and rules of conduct. They named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers, and each group developed differing rituals and differing taboos. When Sherif and his colleagues told the boys there was another group at the camp, each group started to describe the unseen others as “intruders” and “outsiders.” They then met for some games: baseball, tug-of-war, touch football, and so on. They hurled insults, and the spectators groused about how dirty the other boys seemed. At bedtime, each group spent all night talking about the disgusting aspects of the other, of them. The boys soon blamed every misfortune they suffered on the devious plots of the other group. When the swimming hole was colder than usual, they said the other group must have filled it with ice cubes. When they found garbage on the beach, they said the other group must have left it there, forgetting that it was their own garbage from a few days earlier. The experiment eventually had to be shut down in the third week. The animosity had built between them until the Eagles stole the Rattlers’ flag off the ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2417))

- baseball field, burned it, then returned it. As payback, the Rattlers organized a raiding party and burned the Eagles’ flag. The Rattlers then painted their bodies and raided the Eagles’ cabins. The Eagles retaliated and did the same. At night, they talked about engaging in open combat. Eventually, when the two groups started circling and gathering rocks for an all-out war, the scientists intervened. Fearing someone might get murdered any day now, they relocated the camps some distance apart. Fascinated by the Robbers Cave experiment, in the 1970s psychologist Henri Tajfel wanted to expand on the research. Tajfel grew up in Poland, and as a Jewish man he had become obsessed with answering the question of how one group could hate another so much that perpetrating genocide could seem reasonable. He studied prejudice throughout the 1950s, and at the time the assumption across most of psychology was that animosity between groups was based on aggressive personalities rising to power and influencing others. Tajfel was skeptical. Looking across many different… ([Location 2436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2436))

- Tajfel wondered what would happen if, in a laboratory setting, you stripped away every single salient difference between two groups of people, even their personalities, and simply told them they were in one group and not another? He then wondered, if you started adding small differences one at a time, like one group wears glasses and the other doesn’t, at what point would people start showing favoritism for their side and bias toward the other? If he could find a starting point, something he called the “minimal group paradigm,” it would establish a baseline for what sort of differences led to prejudice and discrimination. What he discovered was that there is no baseline. Any difference, of any kind, would activate our innate us-versus-them psychology. In one experiment, Tajfel gathered boys from a school in Bristol, many of them with identical backgrounds, many of them friends, and had them individually and anonymously look at a page of forty dots for half a second and then estimate how many they had seen. No matter what the subjects said, they were then randomly sorted and… ([Location 2446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2446))

- underestimators, boys like them, had just performed another assignment for which they would now determine a fair split of the rewards. He gave them a choice between a greater reward equally split, or a lesser reward split unevenly that favored one group and not the other. Tajfel expected that at this minimal level of identity, labeled only as underestimator or an overestimator, subjects would split the money evenly. Then he could add more differences to see when they began to show bias. What he found was just being labeled as an overestimator or underestimator of dots motivated the boys to favor their groups. Worse still, they vastly preferred a smaller reward if it meant their own imaginary group would be better off than the imaginary outsiders. Tajfel’s work has been replicated many times, with preferences for painters, with eye color, with hats, even with randomly assigned even and odd numbers, all with the same results: there is no… ([Location 2456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2456))

- Them. It’s a powerful word, and the research, in both psychology and neuroscience, suggests that because our identities have so much to do with group loyalty, the very word itself, identity, is best thought of as that which identifies us as, well, us—but more importantly not them. It’s a basic human drive, like hunger or sleep. We are built by primate genes that construct primate brains that carry within them innate mental states that can be triggered by sensory inputs. Among them are empathy, sympathy, jealousy, shame, and embarrassment. These mental states, which happen to us, which we feel without asking to feel them, clue us into our nature. As social primates, we can’t help but care a great deal about what others think about us. Humans aren’t just social animals; we are ultra-social animals. We are the kind of primate that survives by forming and maintaining groups. Much of our innate psychology is all about grouping up and then nurturing that group—working to curate cohesion. If the group survives, we survive. So a lot of our drives, our motivations, like shame, embarrassment, ostracism, and so on, have more to do with keeping the group strong than keeping any one member, including ourselves, healthy. In other words, we are willing to sacrifice ourselves and others for the group, if it comes to that. There are a lot of terms for this in modern psychology, political science, sociology, and so on—I prefer “tribal psychology,” but it’s also called “extreme partisanship,” “cultural cognition,” et cetera. Whatever the label, the latest evidence coming out of social science is clear: humans value being good members of their groups much more than they value being right, so much so that as long as the group satisfies those needs, we will choose to be wrong if it keeps us in good standing with our peers. When I asked sociologist Brooke Harrington her thoughts on all this, she summed it up by saying, if there was an E =… ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2466))

- This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that’s the one you will pick. If you add any conflict over resources of any kind, humans will instinctively enter us-versus-them thinking, even if that’s not the overall most beneficial strategy. And this is where tribal psychology gets really weird. In times of great conflict, where groups are in close contact with each other, or communicating with each other a lot, individuals will work extra hard to identify themselves to each other as us and not them. In such an environment, anything can become a signal of loyalty, and how you signal will paint you as a good loyal member or a traitor.

- Psychologist Dan Kahan, an expert on tribal psychology, told me this effect extends beyond politics. Any opinion, he said, can become fused with group identity. He said the most instructive case study for him was the fact that Christian conservatives today still strongly oppose the HPV vaccine because years ago the makers sought early approval for girls before it was approved for boys, and sought to make it mandatory. Early approval meant debate in Congress. Mandatory meant debate in state legislatures. Both meant people with zero scientific knowledge raising questions about why this was a mandatory vaccine for girls instead of boys. “The story goes, somebody comes knocking on the door, and they say, ‘You know your daughter in the backyard over there on the swings? The twelve-year-old who is going to be having sex next year? She needs to get an STD shot or don’t bring her to school.’ ” The result, Kahan said, was a left-versus-right tribal skirmish over the suggestion that the vaccine would inevitably lead to preteen promiscuity.

- about that one,” said Kahan. It was quickly and easily approved, and today is accepted by 95 percent of parents, including Christian conservatives. The difference was that people first learned about the hepatitis B vaccine from their doctors. They first learned about the HPV vaccine by watching reports on MSNBC and Fox News. Those programs framed the message as an us-versus-them issue, which made it a tribal issue. People then looked to their groups for guidance about how to feel, and once they felt one way or the other, motivated reasoning provided their explanations and justifications for opposing it. In one of Kahan’s studies, he showed people who identified as strongly Republican or strongly Democrat a photo of an older man. He told them he was a highly credentialed scientist named Robert Linden, a member of the National Academy of Science and a professor of meteorology at MIT with a PhD from Harvard. He then asked the subjects to indicate if they agreed or disagreed that Dr. Linden was an expert on global warming.

- warming was not only real, but climate change was a threat to the survival of the human race. Kahan then asked subjects if they still agreed or disagreed that Linden was an expert. In the global-warming-is-not-real group, conservatives continued to say that he was an expert, but liberals flipped their ratings. In the global-warming-is-real group, it was liberals who continued to see Linden as an expert but conservatives who flipped. In each condition, for half the people, Linden instantly transformed into a crackpot. His credentials, of course, never changed. The research into tribal psychology is clear. If a scientific, fact-based issue is considered neutral—volcanoes or quasars or fruit bats—people don’t do this. They tend to trust what an expert has to say. But once tribal loyalties are introduced, the issue becomes debatable. Despite how it may seem, Kahan emphasized that this kind of motivated reasoning is rational. The average person will never be in a position where beliefs on gun control or climate change or the death penalty will affect their daily lives.

- Charlie’s group, the truthers, refused to accept the evidence before them. What we know depends on beliefs: knowledge we assume is true. It also depends on attitudes: our positive or negative evaluations of that which we believe. And these both influence, and are influenced by, our values: our estimations of what is most important, most worth our time to pursue. But it is impossible to know or evaluate everything. The world is too vast, too complex, and ever-changing. So a hefty portion of our beliefs and attitudes are based on received wisdom from trusted peers and authorities. Whether in a video, within a textbook, behind a news desk, or standing at a pulpit, for that which we can’t prove ourselves, it is in their expertise we place our faith. These reference groups are where we get our knowledge about Saturn’s moons and the nutritional value of granola, what happens after we die and how much money Argentina owes China.

We become the kind of people who feel a certain way, and who believe certain things. Questioning those beliefs will threaten our sense of self, and at the biological level we will respond with fear, anger, and all the other emotional trappings of fight-or-flight.

- belonging only narrowly overlaps with the pursuit of accuracy, because anything that questions dogma threatens excommunication. We don’t just use our previous experiences to maintain our balance on the tightrope between being dangerously wrong and dangerously ignorant, we use the people around us; when they refuse to change their minds, it’s a greater barrier to change than whatever stubbornness our dogmas demand. Trapped in a group hug of shared motivations, we may find ourselves unable to change our minds when the facts suggest we should. There’s no better example of this than what happens when a person wanders into a group of people who share their motivation to trade information about a conspiracy theory. Anni Sternisko, a psychologist who studies conspiratorial communities, told me that, broadly speaking, all conspiracy theorists start out by seeking out others who share their views by way of two “motivational allures.” Those who are happy with their current social identity “are drawn to the content of a… ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2557))

- Sternisko said to think of it like picking out a movie to watch. If you are a fan of Adam Driver, you don’t care what the movie is about. Horror, drama, historical fiction—as long as Adam Driver is in the movie, you’re interested. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for science fiction, you don’t much care who stars in it as long as there are spaceships and aliens. Both paths could lead you to watching Star Wars, and eventually to Star Wars conventions, and a new identity as a hardcore member of the fandom. The same is true of conspiracy theory communities, said Sternisko. It doesn’t matter which of these two motivations initially leads a person in. Once invested in ideas that seem far-fetched to their peers, people begin to feel the threat of ostracism, and the embrace of those who share your reality becomes increasingly inviting, until you eventually identify more with the conspiratorial community than any other. At some point, the motivation to belong supersedes all other motivations.

The beliefs, attitudes, and values we share with the group then become safer to question. If we change our minds about them, we then change our minds about us. So how did Charlie escape? I would learn it wasn’t the facts, not by themselves. He had become open to the facts because, like Megan, he had found others in communities more in line with his values than the one to which he was bound; and, like Megan, he had met a romantic partner there. When they couldn’t express their shared values among the truthers, those bindings began to corrode, and with them, his resistance to change.

- Charlie’s story reveals that it is rational to resist facts when one has no social safety net. When he admitted that he was wrong, when he changed his mind in a way that signaled he disagreed with the dogma of his truther tribe, they did what we most fear: they shunned him, then ostracized him. But as Megan’s, Zach’s, and Charlie’s stories reveal, when the conditions are just right, even people trapped inside tribal psychology can be persuaded to change their minds. Even the boys in the Robbers Cave experiment, where they more or less created Lord of the Flies at a summer camp, changed their minds. When the experimenters presented those two tribes with common goals, like fixing the engine of the bus that would take them home, they were able to rise above their tribal psychology and work together.

- Back in 2011, I wrote a book titled You Are Not So Smart, and then a follow-up titled You Are Now Less Dumb. Together they ran through the science of the day concerning human reasoning, decision-making, and judgment. The general thesis of those books was that we are unaware of how unaware we are; we are the unreliable narrators in the stories of our own lives. In psychology, this is called the introspection illusion. Decades of research had shown that though we often feel very confident that we know the antecedents of our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, along with the sources of our motivations and goals, we are rarely privy to such information. Instead, we ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2718))

- observe our own behavior and contemplate our own thoughts the way an observer would another person, and then we create rationalizations and justifications for what we think, feel, and believe. Guesses, basically. Sometimes right, often wrong. Yet we rarely admit to that fact, preferring instead to live within a fictional biography that continuously portrays us as reasonable, rational people carefully contemplating the evidence before us, soberly reaching conclusions that anyone else would reach if they were as smart as we believe ourselves to be. In the books, and later in lectures, I liked to demonstrate this with three different examples. In one, I give people a chance to play a game created by the psychologist Peter Wason. The premise is this: I am going to pick three numbers out of all the numbers in the universe using a secret rule, and your task is to figure the rule I’m using. Here we go. 2–4–6 Think you already have it figured out? Here are three more: 10–12–14 By now it should be clear.

By the third set, typically everyone’s hand is down. Next, I ask if anyone would like to prove they know what it is by picking out three more numbers using my rule. Imagine I’ve asked you to do it. What would you pick? Most people go with three even numbers like: 32–34–36 If you had chosen these three—or any three even numbers in order—I would say, “Yes! Those three numbers correspond to my rule.” And if we stopped here and moved on, you might live the rest of your life pretty sure you had confirmed your hunch was right.

- numbers in a row corresponds to that rule, when you guess that’s the answer you stop looking for more information. Once it seems like you’ve received confirmation that you are correct, you don’t go looking for disconfirmation just to make sure. And that’s the essence of confirmation bias, our most fundamental cognitive predisposition. When motivated to find a reason for a hunch, we tend to search for evidence to confirm it, and when we believe we’ve found that confirmation, we stop looking. My second example came from a study by Mark Snyder and Nancy Cantor in which a group of subjects read about a week in the life of a woman named Jane. The scientists made sure that throughout the story Jane sometimes seemed extroverted and at other times introverted. After two weeks, the subjects returned to the lab, this time divided into two groups. In one, the researchers said Jane was considering a job as a real-estate agent. They then asked the subjects if they thought she would be well suited to the role. Most of them said yes, remembering all the times that Jane seemed outgoing.

No, they said, she’s too introverted. She’d hate it. The subjects in the Jane study started with the same evidence, but when differently motivated by different questions, they generated different arguments for different conclusions. When those conclusions were challenged, they pointed to the evidence that had confirmed their hunches. Thanks to confirmation bias, just by reversing the order, and thus reversing the initial positions, a once unified group became divided on how it saw the truth. For years I had used these examples to demonstrate the power of motivated reasoning. Further still, and the research on this is clear, the more intelligent you are, and the more educated, the more data at your disposal, the better you become at rationalizing and justifying your existing beliefs and attitudes, regardless of their accuracy or harmfulness.

Since it was only construction paper, it never changed colors. People waited for minutes to watch it turn. They often rechecked dozens of times. Some even asked to take strips home. But when he told another group the paper would change if they did have the disease, they waited the twenty seconds, took one look, handed the paper back to the experimenters, and left the room. As psychologist Dan Gilbert once said of the study, when the bathroom scale gives us bad news, we reweigh ourselves a few times to make sure. When it gives us good news, we step off and go about our day. Thanks to confirmation bias, when motivated to find a reason for a hunch, we don’t always employ our reasoning in pursuit of the truth. When otherwise motivated, we reason toward conclusions that meet a need or ensure a desired outcome.

- eating behavior. Territories can’t be shared with other groups—not enough leaves to go around. They need to be defended, and so we developed tribal behavior on top of our territoriality. That gave our special mix of genes an advantage, first over all the other animals, and then over the other groups of our own kind, and then over our family versus all the others. Stronger together, we became leaf-munching, territorial, social animals bound by trust that was hard to earn and easy to lose. Defending against your own kind requires kinship, and that requires identification. We evolved the ability to tell our own group members from other members of our species through signals—smells and hoots and barks. That signaling had side benefits as well. When any member can signal danger to all the others, the whole group benefits. So the thinking goes that hominids like yourself first evolved the ability to read one another’s emotions, then to communicate with intent and, over time, the ability to communicate with a goal in mind. Imagine three proto-humans on a hill, each looking in a different direction. The power to pool each individual’s perspective into a shared worldview without turning to see what the others were seeing was an enormous evolutionary advantage. Scale it up, add abstractions, and you’ve got yourself the vital intellectual gumbo we call culture. Under the pressure to survive, with the availability of peer-to-peer communication, proto-humans developed an array of tools and capacities, including language, facial expressions, empathy, shame, embarrassment, mirror neurons, and emotional contagion. The human brain became incredibly adept at using and manipulating signals to get ideas out of one’s head and into another. As all these complex data got traded back and forth, a shared model of the environment, a communal worldview, came into focus. Without the influence of other groups to get in the way, each member’s worldview was broadly similar to that of other members trying to make sense of rocks and rivers and goats and clouds; depending on the unique problems any one group faced, in many ways the worldview of that… ([Location 2783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2783))

Genes are selfish that way. Even when the intentions of a peer were good, each brain could only add to the pool what it could observe. Confounding the process further, brains are prone to making errors and may misinterpret what they attempt to pass along. Communication, no matter how useful, was bound to be imperfect. Despite this imperfection, since no one person can see the little picture clearly, nor see the big picture by themself, receiving a constant flow of information from as many other people as possible would have been too valuable to give up.

In their book The Enigma of Reason, cognitive psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber compare this balance of trust with vigilance to a busy sidewalk. When a person leaves a subway station, climbs the stairs, and enters the flow of foot traffic, they can focus on their own space because they know that others are focusing on theirs. Even though each person is tending to their own path, the fact that every individual is doing the same means that each individual can move forward assured that bumping into a stranger is unlikely. In the busy sidewalk metaphor, problematic, untrustworthy people become much less of a problem because the entire crowd can go on autopilot with the assurance that if any one person notices someone intentionally trying to run into others or carelessly disrupting the flow, they will move out of the way,… ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2813))

If your friend tells you that rubbing poisonous berries on a bee sting will make the pain go away, it would be good to apply a measure of skepticism, to seek out more information, to see if others agreed. If that same friend misled you or others in the past, their reputation would precede them. According to Mercier and Sperber, the biological tools humans use to send and receive information would never have evolved to their modern level of complexity without such a system. We needed a way to guard against misinformation, deception, and the abandonment of our hard-earned order. With it, even bad information became useful, because the receiver now had the tools to analyze and filter it for errors or deceit. If there were no such cognitive tool, communication between brains would hold too much risk. We developed a processing hierarchy that is trustworthy of our peers by default but that remains constantly vigilant for bad information. Yet our dependence on that vigilance led to a second dilemma. Sometimes it produces false negatives. Some completely accurate and extremely useful new ideas, discoveries, and innovations seem too good to be true—or sometimes too challenging or socially costly. Berries that look poisonous but aren’t could be overlooked. A taboo new way to make fire could remain the innovation of a single individual.

She might have an ex who works there. It might have made her sick in the past. It’s far too much work to sit down and brainstorm all the potential reasons she might object and then prepare a perfect argument that would address each one. Mercier said it’s easier to just open with the weakest argument we have: “Let’s go to that Japanese restaurant near the park, because I like the food there.” If our friend objects, we can then ask them why. When we learn her specific justification, we can escalate from there. If she tells us she hates sushi, we can refine our argumentation by telling her the restaurant also serves Thai food and see what she says in return. “Rather than looking for flaws in our own arguments, it’s easier to let the other person… ([Location 2843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2843))

- what movie to watch, or it could be of monumental consequence, like whether to keep a loved one on life support or enter a world war. Deliberation through argumentation reveals all the varied points of view in a group. Generating increasingly better reasons for one decision or another, the group can, together, zero in on the most reasonable justification. Because we are biased and lazy, when we argue with ourselves, we usually win. We draw self-serving conclusions based on our unique experiences and motivations, and then we employ reasoning to create justifications and rationalizations for our own thoughts, feelings, behaviors, plans, and goals. To paraphrase Mercier, this is why, psychologically speaking, reasoning ain’t logic. Reasoning is often confused with reason, the philosophical concept of human intellect and rationality. Logic is an amazing tool, a formal language for trading and evaluating propositions, and humans possess an array of cognitive talents we can categorize as reason, but reason-ing is something else. In short, reasoning is coming up… ([Location 2853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2853))

The other was a big, expensive, obviously high-quality, realistic, chocolate cockroach. When researchers asked people to predict which they would enjoy the most as their reward, most people said they would rather have the heart. But when they finally came to the end of the study, most people chose the roach. Unsure which was the better option, they employed their reasoning, which is to say they began creating justifications for each conclusion—“I should get the heart” or “I should get the roach.” The list of reasons they could bring to mind for the roach that seemed justifiable to others—bigger, more expensive, better quality—simply outweighed those for the heart. They picked something they knew they would not enjoy because they couldn’t justify doing otherwise. In another experiment by Amos Tversky and Edward Shafir, an experimenter asked subjects to imagine they had flipped a coin, and then asked them to… ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2863))

- Research shows people are incredibly good at picking apart other people’s reasons. We are just terrible at picking apart our own in the same way. In a 2014 study that Mercier helped design, a team of Swiss cognitive scientists led by Emmanuel Trouche tricked people into evaluating their own justifications more thoughtfully by making it seem as if they came from the mind of someone else. To do this, subjects read a series of questions, reached a series of conclusions, and then wrote arguments defending those conclusions. For instance, subjects read about a grocery store that sold many kinds of fruits and vegetables. Some of its apples were not organic. The scientists then asked, what can you say for sure about whether this store carries organic fruits? The correct conclusion is that you can only say for sure that the store carries some fruits that are not organic. In the study, though, many people inferred that none of the fruit was organic, and then said there was really nothing conclusive you could say one way or the other. After subjects reached their conclusions, the scientists then asked them to write out their justifications. If at any point they found their own reasoning lacking, they could reach a different conclusion, but the vast majority of people didn’t do that. Right or wrong, most people stuck with their original… ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2881))

- was that they had actually hidden in those answers some switcheroos. For one of the questions, the supposed justifications from another person were actually the subject’s own. Just as Mercier and Sperber had predicted, when subjects thought the justifications weren’t theirs, 69 percent of people rejected their own bad arguments and then switched to the correct answer. When their poor arguments were presented back to them as those of other people, the flaws suddenly became obvious. “People have been thinking about reasoning in the wrong way,” Mercier told me. “They’ve been thinking about it as a tool for individual cognition. And if that was the function of reasoning, it would be terrible. It would be the least adapted mechanism that ever showed its face. It would be doing the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do.” When reasoning alone, it only looks for reasons for why you’re right, “and it doesn’t really care whether the reasons are good or not. It’s very superficial. It’s very shallow.” With no one to tell you that there are other points of view to consider, no one to poke holes in your theories, reveal the weakness in your reasoning, produce counterarguments, reveal potential harm, or threaten sanction for violating a norm, you will spin in an epistemic hamster wheel. In short, when you argue with yourself, you win. Mercier and Sperber call all of this “the interactionist model,” which posits that the function of reasoning is to argue your case in a group setting. In this model, reasoning is an innate behavior that grows more complex as we mature, like crawling before walking upright. We are social animals… ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2894))

- As part of a group that can communicate, every perspective has value, even if it is wrong; so it’s best that you produce arguments that don’t run counter to your point of view. And since the effort is best saved for group evaluation, you become free to make snap judgments and quick decisions based on good-enough justifications. If others produce counterarguments, you can then refine your thinking and update your priors. “If you think of it as something that serves individual purposes, it looks like a really flawed mechanism.

Math, logic, science, art—the people who see the correct path from moment to moment are able to guide the others and vice versa. With a shared goal, in an atmosphere of trust, arguing eventually leads to the truth. Basically, all culture is 12 Angry Men at scale. Cognitive psychologist Tom Stafford calls this the “truth wins scenario,” and in his book For Argument’s Sake, he details dozens of studies in which group reasoning arrives at the correct answer in situations where individual reasoning fails. In studies in which people work on puzzles from the Cognitive Reflection Test, a tool for measuring people’s tendency to favor intuitive reasoning over active processing, people almost always get the wrong answers when reasoning alone. In groups, however, they tend to settle on the correct answers in seconds. Here are… ([Location 2919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2919))

- If all of this is true, then why does social media feel like soul poison? Mercier and Stafford both told me that the main reason is that it is much more important to reason in the proper context than it is to be a good reasoner. Arguing online can seem like deliberation, but if people are insulated from essential group dynamics, from outside perspectives, then individuals will essentially argue with themselves. If we do debate, we tend to fall prey to what legal scholar Cass Sunstein calls the “law of group polarization,” which says that groups who form because of shared attitudes tend to become more adamant and polarized over time. This is because when we wish to see ourselves as centrists but learn that others in our group take a much more extreme position, we realize that to take the middle position, we must shift our attitude in the direction of the extreme. In response, people who wish to take extreme positions must shift further in that direction to distance themselves from the center. This comparison-to-others feedback loop causes the group as a whole to become more polarized ([Location 2943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2943))

- over time, and as consensus builds, individuals become less likely to contradict it. In the case of moral and political issues, we are often deferring to experts and elites. “Deferring to experts is rational,” Mercier and Sperber write. “If we didn’t, we would be clueless about a wide variety of important issues about which we have no personal experience and no competent reflection. Once we defer to some experts, it makes sense to put relatively little weight on challenging arguments from third parties.” Despite these psychological traps and rhetorical echo chambers, Mercier and Sperber say that deliberative democracy is not in peril. It’s only when we leave the context in which arguing evolved that problems emerge. They point not only to the abolition of slavery, the result of extensive legislative argumentation, but also to the research of political scientists like Robert Luskin and James Fishkin, who studied the town hall meetings of Catholics and Protestants following… ([Location 2951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=2951))

Sure, the internet makes it easier to form groups around our biased and lazy reasoning; but it also exposes us to the arguments of those outside of our groups.

- For Stafford, this means if we can create better online environments, ones designed to increase the odds of productive arguments instead of helping us avoid arguing altogether, we may look back on this period of epistemic chaos as a challenge we overcame with science. He’s optimistic about such a future and told me, “like germs, the misinformation was always there, and the truth has always been hard to come by. Cities created a crisis around sanitation . . . and we will have to generationally learn the information equivalent of washing our hands.” I wondered, if all of this is true, when an argument generates that “I might be wrong” feeling, what aspects make it different from the arguments we find less persuasive? As I mentioned in the introduction, Mercier and Sperber’s work reveals how thousands of years of information exchange led to our ability to both persuade and be persuaded, especially when we feel our groups are misguided, misled, or mistaken.

- The top brass of the United States Army thought what everyone thinks at first. Give people the facts, and they will change their minds. But when the military brought in psychologists to test the impact of the films, their research showed the same thing that later psychologists would discover when using fact-based approaches to change opinions. The films did a fantastic job of teaching facts—correcting the recruits’ misconceptions and filling in the gaps in their knowledge—but when it came to their opinions, the answers they gave after watching the films remained nearly identical to those they gave before. Most opinions barely changed a percentage point. Though the army officials behind the Morale Unit were crestfallen, the social scientists who told them so were overjoyed. Beliefs, they realized, were separate from attitudes. Today, psychology defines beliefs as propositions we consider to be true. The more confidence you feel, the more you intuit that a piece of information corresponds with the truth. The less confidence, the more you consider a piece of information to be a myth. Attitudes, however, are a spectrum of evaluations, feelings going from positive to negative that arise when we think about, well, anything really. We estimate the value or worth of anything we can categorize, and we do so based on the positive or negative emotions that arise when that attitude object is salient. Those emotions then cause us to feel attracted or repulsed by those attitude objects, and thus influence our motivations. Most importantly, attitudes are multivalent. We express them as likes or dislikes, approval or disapproval, or ambivalence when we feel both. Taken together, beliefs and attitudes form our values, the hierarchy of ideas, problems, and goals we consider most important.

Two psychology grad students, Richard Petty and John Cacioppo, developed what many consider the best model of how humans make sense of, and are persuaded by, messages that intend to change their minds. But they developed the elaboration likelihood model (or ELM) not so much to change the course of psychology but to make sense of their own textbooks so they could pass their college courses.

- Much of the research had been based on an idea put forward by a sociologist and political scientist named Harold Lasswell. He said that all communications between humans could be broken down to: “Who says what to whom in which channel and with what effect?” Who referred to the communicator. What referred to the message. To whom referred to the audience. In which channel referred to the medium or the context. With what effect referred to the impact the message had on the audience. That impact had been the focus of psychological research for decades, with the rest considered independent variables. Psychologists were sure that the impact depended on understanding the content of the message; it seemed mysterious that a message increasing ([Location 3045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3045))

- persuasion in one situation almost certainly reduced it in others, in the same way a tuxedo will improve your looks at a snazzy nightclub, but not so much at a baseball game. Petty and Cacioppo realized the reason it didn’t make sense was because there were two higher-level variables at play. If you grouped messages by how likely a person was to pause and reflect on its content, all the findings sorted neatly into two categories, one of two kinds of thinking. Both kinds of thinking could lead to attitude change, and different qualities of the message and its delivery affected which was more likely to become active from one context to the next. Petty and Cacioppo used the terms “high elaboration” and “low elaboration” to describe these two kinds of thinking. They consciously avoided the word learning, which was part of the process, but separate. Since the 1920s, psychologists had thought that if we wanted to change people’s attitudes about something like cigarettes, we needed to figure out how best to teach people how bad they were. If we wanted people to wear seatbelts, we needed to teach them about the dangers of not wearing them. Give people the facts, and they will change. This is why most early studies measured what sorts of messages were easier to learn. Petty and Cacioppo’s blackboard indicated that a person could learn every detail of a message and still not be persuaded, ([Location 3051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3051))

- or a person could not learn the message at all and be totally persuaded. So the first idea in the elaboration likelihood model is that persuasion isn’t only about learning the information. Elaboration is contextualizing the message after it gets inside your head, something more akin to how people arrive at different interpretations of inkblots in a Rorschach test. Petty explained with the example of laundry soap. If an advertisement says, “Use this laundry soap because it will make your clothes smell good,” then learning that information alone won’t be sufficient to persuade some people. Individuals vary in how they assimilate such concepts into their existing models. One person may hear that message and think, “If my clothes smell good, then people will hang out with me.” Since another person might think, “It would be embarrassing if I smelled like flowers all the time,” the same message that persuaded one person would discourage another. Petty and Cacioppo’s insight was that if elaboration leads to a positive evaluation of the reasoning behind an argument, persuasion will succeed. If it leads to neutral or negative evaluation, the… ([Location 3062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3062))

- carefully, and ability is the cognitive wherewithal to do so. Motivating factors that increase likelihood include not only relevance but incentives to reach accurate conclusions, a feeling of responsibility to make sense of the message’s claims, and a personality trait called “high need for cognition.” Ability factors include a lack of distraction, experience or expertise with the topic, and how clearly communicated or well-articulated the message is. Anything that enhances both motivation and ability will increase the likelihood of elaboration, and the nature of that elaboration will then lead to acceptance or rejection. When elaboration likelihood is high, people tend to take what Petty and Cacioppo called the “central route”; but as likelihood drops off, people tend to move onto what they called the “peripheral route.” Think of the central route as a busy street straight through the heart of Argument City. On the central route, we feel the need to go slow, pay attention, and navigate carefully. What are the speaker’s main points? Are they logical? Are they cohesive? Are they strong? Do they cite evidence? Is the… ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3073))

On the central route, you get to see Argument City for what it really is, the good and the bad, the grimy streets and charming shops, the unique characters and the mundane office workers. On the peripheral route, you only see Argument City in the abstract, the skyline and the billboards, the famous landmarks and the neon lights. Is the speaker attractive? Does this message contain lots of big words? Do they speak eloquently? Do they have a prestigious degree? Are they famous? Is there pizza at the end of this lecture? As likelihood increases or decreases, variables that mattered on the central route become meaningless on the peripheral, and vice versa. This, they realized, was why some variables worked in some situations and not in others. On the central route, the merits of the message matter. On the peripheral route, the merits are ignored and people focus on simple, emotional cues. In one experiment, Petty and Cacioppo told university students they wanted to hear how they felt about a policy that would now require… ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3083))

- others were less inclined. They further divided the motivated and unmotivated students into two groups each. One saw either nine or three strong arguments, and the other saw either nine or three weak arguments. The strong arguments included the fact that the most prestigious universities require such exams to ensure their degrees communicate excellence. Students from such universities were more likely to get hired at higher-paying jobs. The weak arguments said the comprehensive exams harkened back to the traditions of the ancient Greeks, and the fear it produced would probably encourage people to study more. Petty and Cacioppo found that the more motivated the students, the more they took the central route. On that route, they paid more attention, and so the stronger arguments were more persuasive. The more of them they saw, the better. But on the central route, the weak arguments were ineffective; students saw the flaws in the emotional, opinion-based messages and ripped them to pieces. In fact, if a motivated person listened to nine poor arguments, they were less likely to support the… ([Location 3094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3094))

- fewer. Instead of paying attention to the content of the arguments, they paid attention to their number. Uninterested in the reasoning behind them, they just thought: more arguments, better policy. In another experiment, Petty and Cacioppo had subjects watch ads for two different brands of disposable razors. They told one group they’d get to take home a box of them but had to pick one brand or the other to do so. The other group received no such offer. For some subjects, the ads were delivered using strong arguments—scientifically designed, ribbed handle to prevent slippage, comparison tests show it shaves three times closer than the competitors. For others, they featured weak arguments—floats in water, a memorable experience, comes in several colors. For some, those arguments were delivered by a famous tennis player, and for others by an unknown actor. They found, just as the ELM predicts, that the people who expected to take home some free razors felt more motivated, and the strong arguments persuaded them more than the weak ones. But for those who weren’t promised any razors and therefore weren’t motivated to make the best decision, the strength didn’t matter at all. The most persuasive element was whether a celebrity endorsed the product. Research has found that successful attitude change via the central route may take more effort, but it also creates more enduring attitudes. Messages that persuade via the peripheral route tend to do so quickly and easily, which is great for making a sale or getting people to go vote, but the changes they produce are weak. They fade with time and can be reverted with minimal effort. So which route should we encourage people to take? That depends. Vodka, for instance, is colorless, odorless, and mostly tasteless. There’s no great distinction between brands (until the next morning). With something like that, we would be correct to encourage people to take the peripheral route. It would be better for a vodka company to focus on interesting packaging, celebrity endorsements, and ad campaigns that play up the luxury, prestige, or playfulness of the brand. To make up for the fact that the peripheral route doesn’t lead to long-lasting change, they would need to… ([Location 3103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3103))

- In the late 1980s, Shelly Chaiken and Alice H. Eagly introduced the heuristic-systematic model (HSM). It posits that when lazily thinking about alternative ways of feeling about the world, we use heuristics or simple rules of thumb that mostly show we are right. When thinking effortfully, we systematically process information considering all the ways we might be wrong. The HSM’s major contribution to psychology was to show that people are motivated to hold correct attitudes; and by “correct,” the HSM means self-serving or group-serving. In other words, it’s about reputation management. When a person feels like their justifications aren’t yet strong enough to be considered reasonable by their peers, they seek more information until they cross the “confidence gap.” Like the ELM, the HSM agrees that we process messages differently depending on our ability and motivation to do so, but where it differs slightly is that it postulates heuristic processes (meaning rules of thumb and mental shortcuts) and systematic processes (meaning careful and deliberate) can happen simultaneously.

Once a student of Petty’s, he continues to research both the ELM and the HSM. “The HSM says, yes, people want to be correct. It’s just that they think they already are. Certainty gives an air of objectivity to the subjective. When a person says, ‘This is the best movie of 2019.’ They mean it. That feels like a fact to them.” Luttrell said that it might seem like we would want to put in the work required to hold the most accurate beliefs possible, to make sure the rustling in the leaves is the wind and not a tiger, “but it is costly to re-evaluate everything all the time. If my only goal in life was to be perfectly correct, then I would constantly subject all incoming information to scrutiny.” It takes fewer calories to assume if everyone around me says something is true, it is.

The most important factor in evaluating trustworthiness is something called source credibility, and the research suggests we evaluate it in three ways. We ask ourselves if the speaker is an expert. We look to see if the speaker is trying to trick us in some way. And we look to see if the speaker agrees with the groups with which we identify. But even when people discredit a message from an untrustworthy source, if the argument is compelling, it will linger in their minds. If we hear the same information presented in other formats or from other speakers, the association with the untrustworthy source weakens. As our reasons for discounting the ideas wash away, the persuasiveness of the message remains.

- If people are initially skeptical of a persuasive message, sharing counterarguments alongside the message works best. In studies of courtroom trials, if the defense brings up damaging evidence first, then the defense seems more credible to the jury. Be it a rap battle or a political debate, by presenting your opponent’s arguments before they do, you not only demonstrate confidence in your ideas by revealing you’ve considered the other side, you also demonstrate trustworthiness by revealing you respect the audience’s intelligence. Given that it is better to provide both sides of an argument, which side should come first? The research suggests that presenting the argument most in line with the audience’s current attitude is the most effective. That way, a person feels confident and positive about their own attitudes and will be far more tolerant of counter-attitudinal appeals. Saying “I know you don’t want to go to sleep, but you have to go to school in the morning” is far more effective than “You have to go to school in the morning, so you better go to sleep.” To Whom: A message… ([Location 3178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3178))

- lives increases relevancy. But the simplest trick is to frame messages as rhetorical questions. “Wouldn’t it be nice if marijuana was legal?” encourages people to produce explanations and justifications for their attitudes. “Do you think marijuana legalization should be legal?” merely primes people to express them as conclusions. In Which Channel: The message should fit the medium through which it is conveyed. A message that works welll in a book must be revised to work well in a film, and vice versa. A YouTube video based on an essay must use the language of YouTube, not the essay, to maximize its impact. No matter the message, face-to-face messaging is far and away the most effective channel. We are biologically hardwired to respond to the human face. Newborns show a preference for human faces and recognize them above all other patterns from the moment they arrive in the world. This is because an area of the brain along the temporal lobe functions primarily to do just that one thing. Facial recognition is a biological imperative, because… ([Location 3190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3190))

- mostly to determine intent. When paired with voice intonation and body language, and as long as things seem to be going smoothly, face-to-face communication causes the brain to produce oxytocin on both sides of the exchange. Take that same message and deliver it via any other channel, even Zoom, and the oxytocin will not flow as well. The more oxytocin is flowing, the less guarded we become. Not all media campaigns can go door-to-door, nor can they hold seminars and face-to-face meetings, but the research is clear that if you can produce content that encourages the people who hear your messages to interact with one another and have conversations among themselves… ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3203))

- He’d later clarify, as so often is the case, that the phrase “change your mind” can mean many things. What he meant was that he doesn’t set out in a conversation to change people’s conclusions about what is and is not true, or moral, or important. Regardless, that’s usually what happens if someone takes the time to go through all the steps with him. — I had learned about Street Epistemology after a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing in Victoria, British Columbia, emailed me. I had been tweeting about my interest in persuasion, detailing some of the people I had met while writing the early portions of the book. The teacher wrote me that a lot of what I was talking about seemed like things they had incorporated in their program from street epistemology. He shared a link to one of Anthony’s videos and wrote that I should check it out. A few weeks later, I was on the phone with Anthony, and the next month, in his living room, I asked Anthony to teach me the method.

- It’s also easy to ruin rapport once you’ve built it. Therapists have learned that it’s natural to want to tell a client in crisis what they should think or how they should behave—what therapists call the righting reflex—but it should always be avoided, because it puts that person on the defensive. Clients will produce reasons to reach for the bottle even if they would otherwise agree with your reasons to avoid it. They begin arguing for the reasons to drink, or whatever they came to therapy to tackle, and they resolve their ambivalence away from change.

- When the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, psychologist Ulric Neisser had his class of 106 people write down how they heard, where they were, what they were doing, and what they felt. Two and a half years later, he asked them these questions again, and only 10 percent got them all right. But the interesting thing is not that their memories were faulty; it’s that they refused to accept that their memories could be faulty. Even after looking at their own journals and seeing the truth, one student told Neisser, “That’s my handwriting, but that’s not what happened.” When neurologist Robert Burton read about that study, he became fascinated with the very idea of certainty itself. “What struck me was that there was no reason to get that psychologically invested. You can just say, ‘Oh, I guess I made a mistake.’ But he was dead certain that what he was looking at wasn’t right. The feeling of the new memory was so strongly correct that it made it impossible to see that he might be making an error. And I thought, ‘Well, you know, if that’s ([Location 3554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3554))

- not psychological, maybe it’s on a more basic cognitive neurologic basis.’ And that’s what got me prompted to think about whether the sense that he was certain was beyond his control, which led me to think about it as a feeling state that was a sensation as opposed to a thought.” He wrote a book on the topic titled On Being Certain in which he explored the neuroscience of certainty itself. Using the Challenger example, he explained that when challenged with evidence we are wrong, if the brain continues to produce the mental state of certainty, we have no choice but to believe we are correct, even when our own handwriting is the source of that challenge. Depending on its strength, that feeling of “knowing we are right” that we can’t help but feel when faced with the fact we might be wrong—factually, morally, or otherwise—will encourage us to argue with our own past selves as if trapped in a neurological prison of our own convictions. Burton said he looked all throughout the psychological and neurological literature but couldn’t find a term that satisfied him. So he created one: “the feeling of knowing.” It lumps together a lot of ideas: certainty and conviction and correctness and rightness. We know when we feel it, and we know when we don’t. Burton uses this example to illustrate the feeling of knowing; see if you make sense of it. ([Location 3562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3562))

- A newspaper is better than a magazine. A seashore is a better place than the street. At first it is better to run than to walk. You may have to try several times. It takes some skill, but it is easy to learn. Even young children can enjoy it. Once successful, complications are minimal. Birds seldom get too close. Rain, however, soaks in very fast. Too many people doing the same thing can also cause problems. One needs lots of room. If there are no complications it can be very peaceful. A rock will serve as an anchor. If things break loose from it, however, you will not get a second chance. When you read this, you can feel your lack of certainty about what is being described. But if I tell you that the text describes a kite, you feel a completely different emotion when you read it again, and you have no choice in the matter. It happens to you. We don’t decide or choose to be certain or uncertain; we just feel it. But Burton says that’s not a conclusion, it’s an emotion that feels like a conclusion. He told me the vast majority of what the brain… ([Location 3573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3573))

- thirst. “When there is high osmolarity in the body, we sense it, we experience thirst, and then, perhaps, consciously articulate it in language as ‘I am thirsty.’ ” Burton said the same thing happens when we feel certain or uncertain. “When you are thinking two plus two is four, and you feel this is correct, do you feel it is correct because you have some innate mathematics module, or do you feel it is correct because you’ve laid down a groove from experience and received wisdom, from childhood, from being taught that this is the correct answer? Either way, there is something in the brain delivering a sensation of certainty at the subliminal level, the way you experience thirst, that you can’t help but feel, even if you don’t articulate it.” Burton said to imagine you see a face in a crowd that shouldn’t be there. On vacation in Belize you see your grandfather, despite the fact that he is dead. “You will feel the probability that this person is, indeed, your grandfather at the bodily level, a visceral sense of certainty that could be articulated as a percentage.” You could say you were 10 percent… ([Location 3583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3583))

- “That whole feeling is really a brain calculation at a subliminal level. Then for a lot of evolutionary reasons, that comes into consciousness as a combination of both the calculation and the feeling, absent of any thought at all. It’s a sensation that feels like a conclusion. It is an enormous, marvelous trick of evolution.” As Burton explained, beliefs and doubts are better thought of as processes, not possessions. They aren’t like marbles in a jar, books on a shelf, or files in a computer. Belief and doubt are the result of neurons in associative networks delivering an emergent sensation of confidence or the lack thereof. When those networks weight that feeling in one direction or another, we sense a… ([Location 3594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3594))

- TO SUMMARIZE DEEP CANVASSING, HERE ARE THE STEPS AGAIN, FRAMED LIKE THE OTHERS: Establish rapport. Assure the other person you aren’t out to shame them, and then ask for consent to explore their reasoning. Ask how strongly they feel about an issue on a scale of one to ten.

- Ask a second time how strongly they feel. If the number moved, ask why. Once they’ve settled, ask, “Why does that number feel right to you?” Once they’ve offered their reasons, repeat them back in your own words. Ask if you’ve done a good job summarizing. Repeat until they are satisfied. Ask if there was a time in their life before they felt that way, and if so, what led to their current attitude? Listen, summarize, repeat. Briefly share your personal story of how you reached your position, but do not argue. Ask for their rating a final time, then wrap up and wish them well.

- Most of my stories were about persuasion techniques. I mentioned street epistemology in the lecture but didn’t go into detail. Afterward, one of the people I had spent the most time with around the campfire, startup entrepreneur Nathan Fischer, said he’d like to see the technique in action. I said, sure, let’s sit down and do it tonight at dinner. Word got around, and so when we sat down across from each other, a small crowd watched on, most of them Silicon Valley types, but also some activists and journalists. I told Nathan our topic could be anything, but for the best display of this technique it needed to be something that was sort of fundamental—something that guides your thinking in other domains. Did he have a belief he would like me to challenge? Nathan boldly presented his belief in God. I cautioned him that it was risky to put something like that on the line, but he was willing.

- When I told my friend Misha Glouberman, a communication expert, about my experience with Nathan, he told me that it sounded like I had stumbled onto one of the most important principles of conflict resolution: always start by asking yourself why you want to change the other person’s mind. Ask yourself, “Why is this important to you?” Whatever your answer, ask again, and again. Then share your answers with the other person. This is crucial, he said, because people tend to clash at the level of positions instead of interests. Our positions are what we say we want, and our interests are why we want them. Often, our positions are antagonistic, but our interests align. Misha said that on the surface, debate seems like a civil way to manage disagreements, because instead of attacking each other with clubs, we attack each other with words. But this is a dangerous concept, because the only way to win a debate is to avoid changing one’s own mind. Only the “loser” of a debate learns anything new, and no one wants to be a loser. The more civil approach, he said, is to avoid asking ourselves which one of us is right, and instead ask ourselves why we see things differently. This creates a collaboration, both sides working together to figure out where their differences come from. Transparency leads to trust, he said, and trust assures us that we are being heard, that our agency is not at risk, and that it is ok to show vulnerability. Once that kind of trust is established, or reestablished, disagreements become far more effective at opening both sides to considering challenging ideas. Misha added that in any conversation, we ache for the freedom to safely disagree, that way, if we discover differing perspectives, we may both benefit from the discovery. This is why in his conflict resolution workshops he encourages three pillars of open communication–transparency, curiosity, and compassion. I decided there was another step that should be added to persuasion techniques like the ELM and motivational interviewing and deep canvassing and street epistemology: a step zero. Ask yourself, Why do I want to do this? Why do you want to change a person’s mind? What are you doing here? Ask yourself, If I want to leverage the power of one hundred years of psychological research into persuasion in a way that is very effective, why?

- Through an accumulation of gradual improvements to our tools, both mental and physical, we have spread across the planet into regions ill-suited for our slowly evolving bodies, and where we have settled, we have survived and thrived. Along the way, what used to be the right way of doing things routinely became the wrong way. Social change gave us the ability to recognize that and rapidly adapt as individuals. With that adaptation, we gained culture and the ability to change our collective minds in a rapid, society-wide cascade when we realized our norms were harmful, misguided, dangerous, or incorrect. Changing our minds became our greatest strength as a species. ([Location 3833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3833))

- Over the next 150 years, norms surrounding marriage and child-rearing dramatically changed. Separated from homesteads, Westerners in the nineteenth century began to abandon the belief that large families were a moral imperative. Westerners in the twentieth century worried less about marriage as a reproductive enterprise and started to see it more as an incubator for love and happiness. Once marriage was about love, Newson said that ideas about what made for a suitable spouse underwent a sudden, rapid, culture-wide shift.

- in a husband. The most important trait? Women said they wanted “dependable character” in their partners, and men said they wanted “emotional stability” in theirs. When that same research was repeated in 1977, “mutual attraction and love” had risen to number one for both men and women: a major change in marriage norms that took about thirty-eight years. This led to another shift in attitudes and beliefs, and thus norms. Once attraction and love were the most important reasons to stay married, people began to see the loss of those feelings as a reasonable justification for divorce. In the latter half of the twentieth century, divorce rates for first marriages skyrocketed in the United States, but that rate tapered off and dropped by 2016, because people began to marry for love from the beginning instead of realizing they wished they had in the middle. Sometimes, when a norm changes rapidly, it breaks an institution before it remakes it. Once choosing to not have a big family was normal, and choosing to marry for love was normal, and choosing to divorce for lack of love was normal, the idea of choosing to not have children, have children without marrying, or just cohabitate and do neither all became normal as well, and at an even faster pace than the changes to the previous norms that paved the way. By that time, the idea that same-sex couples should be able to marry if they so choose seemed obviously true, and this set the stage for norms, attitudes, ([Location 3863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3863))
