## Highlights
- Ultimately, there are dozens of valuation models but only two valuation approaches: intrinsic and relative. In intrinsic valuation, we begin with a simple proposition: The intrinsic value of an asset is determined by the cash flows you expect that asset to ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=172))

- generate over its life and how uncertain you feel about these cash flows. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=174))

- While the focus in principle should be on intrinsic valuation, most assets are valued on a relative basis. In relative ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=177))

- valuation, assets are valued by looking at how the market prices similar assets. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=178))

- Intrinsic valuation provides a fuller picture of what drives the value of a business or stock, but there are times when relative valuation will yield a more realistic estimate of value. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=182))

- In general, there is no reason to choose one over the other, since nothing stops you from using both approaches on the same investment. In truth, you can improve your odds by investing in stocks that are undervalued not only on an intrinsic basis but also on a relative one.

- The inputs that you use in the valuation will reflect your optimistic or pessimistic bent; thus, you are more likely to use higher growth rates and see less risk in companies that you are predisposed to like. There is also post-valuation garnishing, where you ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=218))

- increase your estimated value by adding premiums for the good stuff (synergy, control, and management quality) or reduce your estimated value by netting out discounts for the bad stuff (illiquidity and risk). ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=220))

- When valuing an asset, use the simplest model that you can. If you can value an asset with three inputs, don’t use five. If you can value a company with three years of forecasts, forecasting 10 years of cash flows is asking for trouble.

- flows are adjusted to reflect these factors is called discounting, and the magnitude of these factors is reflected in the discount rate. The discount rate can be viewed as a composite of the expected real return (reflecting consumption preferences), expected inflation (to capture the purchasing power of the cash flow), and a premium for uncertainty associated with the cash flow.

- The three essential steps in relative valuation are: ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=742))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Find comparable assets that are priced by the market. 2. Scale the market prices to a common variable to generate standardized prices that are comparable across assets 3. Adjust for differences across assets when comparing their standardized values. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=743))

- A newer house with more updated amenities should be priced higher than a similar sized older house that needs renovation, and a higher growth company should trade at a higher price than a lower growth company in the same sector.

- Relative valuation can be done with less information and more quickly than intrinsic valuation and is more likely to reflect the market mood of the moment. Not surprisingly, most valuations that you see are relative. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SI4A4C&location=749))
