## Highlights
- Successful investors need four abilities. First, they must possess an interest in the process. It is no different from carpentry, gardening, or parenting. If money management is not enjoyable, then a lousy job inevitably results, and, unfortunately, most people enjoy finance about as much as they do root canal work. Second, investors need more than a bit of math horsepower, far beyond simple arithmetic and algebra, or even the ability to manipulate a spreadsheet. Mastering the basics of investment theory requires an understanding of the laws of probability and a working knowledge of statistics. Sadly, as one financial columnist explained to me more than a decade ago, fractions are a stretch for 90 percent of the population. Third, investors need a firm grasp of financial history, from the South Sea Bubble to the Great Depression. Alas, as we shall soon see, this is something that even professionals have real trouble with. Even if investors possess all three of these abilities, it will all be for naught if they do not have a fourth one: the emotional discipline to execute their planned strategy faithfully, come hell, high water, or the apparent end of capitalism as we know it. “Stay the course”: It sounds so easy when uttered at high tide. Unfortunately, when the water recedes, it is not. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=159))

- passes muster on each of the above counts. This suggests that as few as one person in ten thousand (10 percent to the fourth power) has the full skill set. Perhaps I am being overly pessimistic. After all, these four abilities may not be entirely independent: if someone is smart enough, it is also more likely he or she will be interested in finance and be driven to delve into financial history.

- As a result, this book is fraught with a great deal of cognitive dissonance. I love investing and derive no small pleasure writing about it for others. Certainly, in a world where everyone has become his or her own investment manager, whether he or she likes it or not, helping small investors to manage their nest eggs would seem to be a ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=191))

- Now, there is no greater truism in investing than this: The less you pay for an asset, the more money you are likely to make when you eventually sell it. A fall in price, under most circumstances, should lead to a higher expected return. Yet, the Gallup data quoted by Mr. Ip showed just the opposite: The average investor expects a higher return when buying at high prices than when buying at low ones.

- I emphasize three main principles: first, to not be too greedy; second, to diversify as widely as possible; and third, to always be wary of the investment industry. People do not seek employment in investment banks, brokerage houses, and mutual fund companies with the same motivations as those who choose to work in fire departments or elementary schools. Whether investors know it or not, they are engaged in an ongoing zero-sum, life-and-death struggle with piranhas, and if rigorous precautions are not taken, the financial services industry will strip investors of their wealth faster than they can say “Bernie Madoff.” ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=257))

- Over the centuries, with the gradual increase in wealth, capital became more abundant, and so its price—the rate of interest—fell. In the third millennium B.C., Sumerian borrowers paid 33 percent per year for loans of grain and 20 percent for loans of silver. A millennium later, the best Babylonian debtors borrowed silver at 10 percent. A millennium after that, the Greeks paid interest rates as low as 6 percent, and at the height of the Roman Empire, they fell as low as 4 percent.1 Just why have I spent the past few pages discussing this ancient history? After all, this is a book about modern-day investing. Because for every consumer of capital, there is, more or less, a provider of capital. That is where you, the investor—the provider of capital—come into the story. In the jargon of finance, the “cost of capital” to its consumers is exactly the same as the return to the investor, and as an investor, only by understanding the risks and rewards of the consumers of your capital can you truly understand the process.

- So far, I have been dealing with what is known in the modern era as “debt financing.” But throughout history, capital has also been supplied on another basis, which is through actual ownership shares, known today as “equity financing,” in which the owner of excess capital gives it to the businessman or merchant in exchange for a share of the assets and future profits of the venture.

- For these three reasons—the increased possibility of loss, the difficulty of estimating future profits, and the residual nature of equity ownership—a substantial return premium should be demanded by equity owners. This is the “equity risk premium” that my friend and I puzzled over that day at lunch. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=335))

- was refinanced in 1482. Once again, just what does all this medieval history have to do with today’s markets? Everything and more, for the history of the prestiti demonstrates, at a relatively early point in financial history, the close relationship between risk and return. Venetians who purchased prestiti at high prices in the secondary market during the calmest years earned the lowest returns. Contrariwise, those who bought at low prices when things looked the bleakest reaped the largest rewards. The brave soul who purchased prestiti in 1377 at a price of 19 percent of face value in the secondary market collected not only 26.3 percent interest (5 percent divided by 0.19), but also a large dollop of subsequent capital appreciation as well. Of course, the risk ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=400))

- In 2000, many finance professionals did indeed grasp the shrinking equity risk premium. Unfortunately, many of them, particularly my friend’s brethren in the hedge fund world, made a fatal mistake: Since risk premiums were low, they reasoned, the only way to earn higher returns was by borrowing large amounts of capital to multiply—“leverage,” in financial parlance—those paltry premiums. As so elegantly put by the dean of American financial writers, James Grant, in a slightly different context: Imagine a man at the top of a stepladder. He is up on his toes reaching for something. Call that something “yield.” Call the stepladder “leverage.” Now kick the ladder away. The man falls, pieces of debt crashing to the floor around him.5 ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=426))

- If you learn nothing else from this book, it should be that risk and return are inextricably intertwined. In almost every country where economists have studied securities returns, stocks have had higher returns than bonds.1 Further, if you want those high stock returns, you are going to have to pay for them by bearing risk; this is a polite way of saying that in the course of earning those higher returns, your portfolio is going to lose a truckload of money from time ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=445))

- Investment wisdom, however, begins with the realization that long-term returns are the only ones that matter. Investors who can earn an 8 percent annualized return will multiply their wealth tenfold over the course of 30 years, and if they have half a brain, they will care little that many days, or even years, along the way their portfolios will suffer ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=503))

- The historical record, however, does not help as much with the most important exercise in the investment process: estimating future returns. Investors who cannot approach the expected- return problem rationally and systematically are better off putting half of their money under the mattress, then lighting the rest on fire and throwing it out the window. The good news is that estimating future returns is not that difficult. In spite of this, many investors—even ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=514))

- How, then, can we reasonably assess future returns? First, let us admit the obvious: Unless we possess a crystal ball, we cannot do so with a great degree of accuracy. The best that we can do is to come up with what financial economists call an “expected return,” one of the most important concepts in finance.

- In order to understand this term, start at a roulette table in Monte Carlo, with 37 pockets (numbered 0 through 36; in America, there is a 38th double- zero pocket). The payoff on a winning dollar bet is 35 dollars, with a 1-in-37 chance of winning. On average, you will lose 5.3 cents of each dollar you betminus 1). This is the expected return of each roll, and also of the total amount you bet in any given period of time. Of course, on any given night, you may get lucky ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=554))

- and make money or have a string of bad spins and lose more than 5.3 percent. This is the realized return. The expected return is thus simply the best guess of what your realized return will be on an average night. Stocks and bonds work the same way as the roulette table, except that the expected payoff is almost always positive. If it were not positive, no one would invest. It is still roulette, but now the investor is the house. He will never know precisely what Lady Luck will dole out, but he can make a pretty good guess of the payout, particularly over future periods of at least two decades… ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=558))

(U.S. Treasury securities issued with a maturity of one year or less are called “bills”; from one to 10 years, “notes”; and over 10 years, “bonds.” Notes and bonds yield an interest coupon every six months. Bills do not—rather, they are issued at a discount and redeemed at par; the difference is their “yield.”) Amazingly, in early 2009 the yield of 10 -year bonds issued by the most solid American companies was about 7 percent.

Just how much less than 7 percent depends upon just how many of these companies fail. If more than 5 percent per year do, then investors would be better off owning the 10-year Treasury note. Most experts would estimate the long-term bankruptcy rate of such highly rated companies at no more than 1 percent per year, but in the present environment let’s be overly conservative and call it 2 percent.

What are the odds of one in 20 of the most solid American companies going bankrupt every year for a decade? In a worst - case scenario, this might happen over the next year or two, but a decade of such failures would be a cataclysm far worse than even the Great Depression. Further imagine that the loss is an astounding 4 percent per year, and we eventually wind up with a 3 percent return. Even though we earned a 1 percent excess return over Treasuries, we would not be overjoyed, since that small margin would not be enough to compensate us for suffering from the risk—the stomach acid—of owning these… ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=576))

- 20 percent higher than Treasuries. This daylight between the two, the junk-Treasury spread, was historically unprecedented. This meant that 20 percent of these companies would have had to go belly up every year in order to produce a lower return than Treasuries of similar maturity. After 10 years, this would leave just one in nine of them standing. What are the odds of a failure rate this high? Very low, but not zero. Once again, junk bonds must offer a return premium over Treasuries to induce investors to buy these very risky securities. If that required premium is 5 percent,… ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=586))

Obviously, if an investor owns a small number of bonds, an unlucky draw could mean the default of all inside of five years.) To recapitulate: a reasonable estimate of the failure rate for the highly rated companies might be in the range of about 2 percent per year, leaving a 5 percent expected corporate bond return. Assuming that the long-term inflation rate is about 3 percent, this leaves an inflation-adjusted return of about 2 percent. In late 2008, for the junk-rated companies, the risk premium (the… ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=591))

The higher-than-Treasury returns for high-grade and junk bonds described above are the rewards the investor would have reaped for bearing the risk that the economy and, along with it, the default rate could actually be much worse than expected. To repeat once more, the investor estimates the expected returns of bonds simply by starting with the interest coupon, then subtracting out the failure rate. The relationship between risk and return is the single most important concept in this book. Recall that if 10-year… ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=597))

- With stocks, the estimation of future expected returns is the same, except that we start with the dividend yield, then add the growth rate of those dividends.

- pays a $3 dividend, or 3 percent of the share price. This $3 yield is money in the investor’s pocket, to reinvest in the stock of this company or in any other financial asset, or to spend on groceries or BMWs. Now suppose that the company grows its business, and thus its dividend, by 4 percent next year, from $3.00 to $3.12 per share. Since the market values the share price according to the 3 percent dividend and that dividend has gone up by 4 percent, in an ideal world the share price also goes up by 4 percent, to $104. Thus, we reap a 7 percent return—the 3 percent dividend plus the 4 percent increase in share price. The same goes for the entire stock market.

- 2009, the U.S. market yielded a 3 percent dividend. How fast does that dividend grow? Financial historians happen to have very good long-term data on that question. Figure 2.1 plots the per-share dividends on the S&P 500 stock index since 1871. Notice how slowly they grew before about 1940, then rose more rapidly after that.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- slope before 1940 better represents the true growth rate. When the dividends in previous years are converted into 2008 dollars, a more accurate picture emerges, as shown in Figure 2.2: The inflation-adjusted dividends of the U.S. stock market increase at an agonizingly bumpy and slow 1.32 percent per year. This illustrates another important rule of finance: Always think in after-inflation, or “real” terms; this avoids having to correct later for the effect of long-term inflation. In the end, focusing on real returns streamlines thinking and helps investors tune out the noise they will hear about how inflation “corrodes wealth.” The U.S. economy grows, on average, about 3 percent ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=627))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- per year in real terms, and total corporate profits grow along with it at roughly the same 3 percent long-term real rate. Why do per-share dividends only grow at slightly more than a 1 percent rate, and not at the 3 percent rate of the overall economy? Because companies, like people, are born, live, and die, and new companies replace them. Investment bankers, bless their souls, sell the shares of these new companies at initial public offerings (IPOs), and these new shares dilute the existing pool by, on average, about 2 percent per year. So even though earnings grow by 3 percent per year, this 2 percent growth in the number of shares leaves only about 1 percent growth in per-share dividends. Yes, companies do buy back shares, but the 2 percent dilution takes these buybacks into consideration. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=633))

- Similarly, brokerage houses and mutual fund companies often tout the stocks of emerging-market nations, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the so-called BRIC countries) because of their rapid economic growth. But beware: Share dilution, and often outright theft because of lax security laws, vaporizes a lot of this growth by the time it reaches the per-share level. For example, China’s economy has been growing at a blistering 9 percent real rate per year for more than two decades. Yet between 1993 and 2008 investors actually lost 3.3 percent per year in Chinese stocks, even with dividends reinvested. You read that right: Over this 16-year period, even before expenses, the investor in Chinese stocks lost 41.5 percent of value.4 (The loss of 3.3 percent per year before inflation calculates out to a loss of 5.7 percent per year after inflation.)

- Among early American economists, Irving Fisher towers above all the rest. Educated at Yale, where one of his advisors was the great physicist Willard Gibbs, he is best known for his infamous 1929 pronouncement, “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” Which is too bad, because among his many accomplishments was the basic mathematical method for evaluating the value of any investment or possession—be it financial, physical, artistic, or even spiritual. His essential insight was that the market price is but a pale imitation of the real deal: the pleasure or income stream an asset delivers over time, discounted by the appropriate rate of interest for how far in the future each part of that income accrues.5 For an immediately consumed item such as a dinner, the answer is evident: You do not purchase that meal for $5, $25, or $125 unless it provides you with that amount of sustenance and enjoyment.

- is your own personal “restaurant-meal interest rate.” Or you could work the problem backward: pick 15 percent per year as the interest rate, and calculate that you will pay $6.18 for it now. The key point is that a pleasure enjoyed today is almost always worth more than one enjoyed in the future. Fisher elegantly calls this the “impatience” for the item in question; it is synonymous with the rate of interest. Rare cases of negative item-specific rates of interest do exist. Perhaps you suspect that in 10 years the nation is likely to fall prey to war or famine. In that situation, you might very well be willing to pay a premium today for a meal 10 years hence. Probably the most common example of this involves fugitives from justice or persecution who purchase easily transportable jewelry, which they will likely have to sell at a loss, to pay for their escape and refuge. Once storage costs and insurance are taken into account, holding gold or jewels becomes even less attractive. However, money rates of interest are never negative, since you can always get at least a zero yield by packing your dough into a mattress. People can have different impatience (or interest rates) for different items.… ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=679))

- To reiterate, the 4 percent expected return we have just calculated for stocks is a real return. This means that the value of the portfolio after taking inflation into account—its actual purchasing power—should, on average, double every 18 years.b At the present time, many foreign equity markets yield around 5 percent. Even if their real per-share earnings do not grow at all, their real expected returns should be quite agreeable going forward: the 5 percent dividend. Similarly, the shares of REITs corporations that own and manage shopping centers, apartment houses, and other commercial property, yielded about 10 percent in early 2009. U.S. law mandates that these companies distribute at least 90 percent of their profits as dividends to shareholders, which accounts for the very high dividend. After paying out almost all of their profits to shareholders, REITs have very little capital left to purchase more properties or improve the ones they have. The gods of finance face them with an unpleasant choice: Either borrow capital in the form of bonds and bank loans, or not grow. The first path may produce growth but it is also highly risky, since being heavily indebted to banks and bondholders can leave them vulnerable in the event of a credit crisis, which is precisely what has happened to many of them in 2007 and 2008. So, in early 2009, the best real REIT return… ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=719))

- Thus, at most you will receive a 3 percent real return (1 percent real price increase plus the 2 percent net “dividend”) on your home; if the current downturn in the housing prices perseveres, it could be much less. A good rule of thumb is to never, ever pay more than 15 years fair rental value for any residence.c This computes out to a 6.7 percent (1/15th) gross rental dividend, or 3.7 percent after taxes, insurance, and maintenance, which is about what you might expect from a mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds. (Imputed rent does have one real advantage over the return from stocks and bonds, which is that it is tax-free.)

- Are there other risk premiums to be earned by intelligent, brave, and disciplined investors? There appear to be at least two more: the “value” and “small” factors. For many decades, students of finance have suspected that the stocks of value (that is, unglamorous) companies and small companies appeared to have higher returns than the overall market. In June 1992, two academicians at the University of Chicago, Kenneth French and Eugene Fama, finally confirmed these suspicions.7 In a Journal of Finance article, they conclusively demonstrated that premiums for both small companies and value companies exist. Professor French regularly updates these data, tabulated in Table 2.4, where he has divided up the U.S. stock market into large and small, and further into “growth,” “mid,” and “value,” yielding six… ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=799))

- Why, then, should not the investor own only small value stocks, the corner of the Fama-French world with the highest returns? There are several reasons. First and foremost, small value stocks have the highest returns precisely because they live in the riskiest corner of the equity universe. After all, they consist of the smallest and diciest companies. Investors need to consider not only their financial portfolio, but also their “job portfolio”; that is, their human capital, or stream of employment income. To the extent that an investor might work for a small company or a value company, he or she does not want to own a lot of stock in such companies, since they will be subject to the same adverse factors as his or her employment in a downturn. Taking this concept to its logical extreme, one of the dumbest things any investor can do is to own stock in the company he or she investor works for, since he or she can lose both a job and portfolio simultaneously, as Enron employees found out to their chagrin in 2002. Finally, small and value stocks can lag the market for long periods of time—the latter for up to 10 years, and the former for up to 20 years. If small and value stocks always beat the market, there would be no risk, so there would be no risk premium; the reward for owning small and value stocks derives in great part from this risk of relative underperformance. It might be reasonable, then, to add 1 or 2 percent to the equity risk premiums for small and value stocks. Thus, U.S. small and value stocks have expected real returns of about 5 to 6 percent; for small value stocks, which have both risk factors, about 6 to 8 percent.

- Financial economists usually start with standard deviation. For example, below are the monthly and annualized standard deviations (SDs) of monthly returns of several asset classes over the past 20 years. The monthly SD is simply calculated straight from the 240 monthly returns in the period, and the annualized value is obtained by multiplying that number by the square root of 12.

The first objection raised by such numbers—usually by mathematically sophisticated but financially inexperienced observers—is that SD measures both positive and negative events, whereas investors concerned with risk do not care about events with positive SD. This is baldly untrue. Almost all investments with high positive hemi-variance also have high negative hemi-variance, and SD thus gives you a second chance to catch a risky asset class. A classic example of this is afforded by the returns reported by Long-Term Capital Management (LCTM). Even before their operations jumped the tracks in 1998, their returns showed a very high SD, a clear… ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=880))

But if God does exist, then the atheist roasts eternally in Hell.

In much the same way, rational investors today might reasonably believe that the economy will eventually recover and provide high stock returns going forward.

- Note that I have used two different terms to describe this new style of investing: “indexed” and “passively managed.” These are not quite the same. The former means that a fund buys all of the stocks in an index, such as the S&P 500, whose composition is determined by a committee within Standard & Poor’s Inc. Once each year, this committee replaces several of the 500 companies in the index; so too must any S&P 500 index fund. Another index, the Russell 2000, consists of the 1,001th to 3,000th largest companies ranked by total value of outstanding shares. From the index fund perspective, this is a messy and somewhat expensive process, since funds following the S&P 500 must all scramble at the same time to sell the stocks exiting the index and buy the ones entering it. This mad rush incurs the kinds of transactional costs that plagued the unfortunate Mr. Miller. The Russell 2000 index has an even more severe problem, since there is no mystery about the selection process, and speculators can easily predict which companies are going to be added and dropped on the changeover date. Just before this, these speculators will buy up the added companies and sell the deleted ones, bidding up and down their prices, respectively. This “front-running” dearly costs index funds tied to the Russell 2000. By contrast, a “passively managed” fund essentially creates its own private index, specifically designed to keep turnover to a bare minimum. DFA uses this approach exclusively, then takes it one step further by purchasing stocks meeting its selection criteria that typically involve total market capitalization and the book value of the company’s assets. After DFA has defined the list of stocks it can ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=1098))

In other words, DFA does not have to own all of the stocks fitting its criteria, only those that can be bought without incurring significant transactional costs. Other fund companies solve the “indexing problem” by using less-popular indexes; Vanguard, after a royalties dispute with S&P, switched most of its index funds over to the Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes (MSCI) system, which relatively few other index funds use. Fund companies can also employ a “total market” index that has almost no turnover.

The typical large-cap fund distributes 5 to 10 percent of its value this way in an average year, and these distributions are currently taxed at 15 percent at the federal level, in addition to applicable state taxes. So investors should add in another 1 percent or so of performance tax drag on any equities held outside of a retirement account.

- truth. Among the industry’s many feeble rationalizations, eagerly swallowed by gullible investors, are the following: • Indexing did terribly last year. It is occasionally true: Enough statistical noise suffuses the financial markets that in any one year, the bets made by some active managers will pay well enough to overcome the 2.2 percent of total expenses of the average large cap fund. Further, in those years when the S&P 500 is the worst-performing asset class, an S&P 500 index fund will not do well relative to its active peers that are free to own stocks in better-performing classes. For example, in 1977, 1978, and 1979, data from Morningstar Inc. showed that the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund beat only 15 percent, 25 percent, and 28 percent of domestic stock funds, respectively. Yet, over the long haul, index funds outstrip their peers. Over the past 15 years ending December 2008, the Vanguard Index 500 Fund beat 73 percent of active managers in its class, while its Total Stock Market Fund bested 68 percent. • Indexing works fine for large U.S. stocks, but the markets in small and foreign stocks are less efficient.

Perhaps you are concerned that over some 10- and 15-year periods, up to one-third of funds appeared to have beaten their respective indexes and index funds. Do not be. First, the above data understate the index advantage.

While most investors would pick choice A, Ellis points out that the long-term investor should clearly prefer choice B. In order to understand why, let’s take another look at the Gordon Equation for U.S. stocks in 2009.

Even more interesting, after losing a round, the emotionally impaired group invested with about the same 84 percent frequency as after a winning round, but the percentage of bets placed by the other two groups fell to 41 and 37 percent, respectively. In other words, not only did the two control groups bet less frequently than the emotionally impaired group, but they also were even less likely to bet after a losing round. The authors concluded that damage to the brain’s emotional circuitry, by blunting negative response to losing money, enabled emotionally impaired subjects faced with typical investment-type decisions to “make more advantageous decisions than normal subjects.”6 Well, not so fast. It is certainly true that the emotionally impaired group did not change their betting behavior after a losing round, a far more rational response than that of the other two groups, which when stung by a losing round tended not to bet on the next one.

This is a fair representation of the investment process. What is interesting is that the experimenters automatically made the assumption that it was rational to go for the $5 risk premium in the face of a 13 percent chance of coming out with less than the assured $20 of the risk-free, no-bet strategy. In truth, whether this risk/reward tradeoff is indeed rational all depends on how risk-averse the investor or the experimental subject is.

Far more common are the sales of individual corporate and municipal bonds that carry enormous profit margins. Typically, these are “principal transactions,” in which the brokerage firm buys and sells the bonds out of its own inventory. The broker usually tells the client that “there was no commission,” as if he or she has just been given a Christmas gift. What the broker has not told the client is that the firm had very likely just bought the bond from another of its customers for several percent less than the price it sold it to him or her.

- The question remaining is: Why isn’t the public as well protected from malfeasance in the brokerage industry as it is in, for example, medicine, dentistry, accounting, and law? The reason is that all four of these professions are highly regulated, and their practitioners deviate from standard procedure only at great peril to their livelihood. If a physician fails to recognize and treat with powerful antibiotics more than one or two cases of obvious bacterial pneumonia, his license will get yanked with gusto. Ditto for the accountant or attorney who regularly falls below the standard of practice. The same is not true for brokers. The depressing fact of the matter is that federal and state governments do not regulate brokers in the same way they do other professionals. For example, the law does not consider brokers to be fiduciaries, as are practitioners of other learned professions. This arcane term refers to a professional’s duty to put a client’s interests first. Accountants, lawyers, bankers, and doctors all have fiduciary responsibility to clients and patients, as do investment advisors. Somehow, the brokerage industry dodged this bullet.

For example, if, in addition to Social Security and pensions, you spend $50,000 per year in living expenses, that means you will need $2.5 million to be perfectly safe, and $1.67 million to be fairly secure.

If you survive to a ripe old age, you will benefit from the capital of those who did not. The best annuity deal available, paradoxically, comes to you courtesy of Uncle Sam: deferring Social Security until age 70. Waiting until 70 increases by almost one-third the monthly payment you would get starting at age 66. Conversely, starting at 62 reduces the payment you would have gotten at 66 by over a quarter.

Over periods of a year or less, prices do tend to “trend” a little bit: If a given asset class had better-than-average performance last month, there is a slightly better than average chance it also will next month; the same is true of less-than-average performance as well.   Rebalance your portfolio approximately once every few years; more than once per year is probably too often.

In sheltered accounts, the optimal strategy would seem to be to let the losses and gains run for two to three years, then rebalance. So an effective rebalancing interval would seem to be “every few years.” Do not underestimate the difficulty of adhering to this process, which from time to time takes industrial-grade discipline, particularly when making purchases in the face of potential economic catastrophe.

More than a decade ago I noticed that asset classes with particularly high volatility, such as precious metals equity, earned significantly higher internal rates of return (IRR, which is the same as dollar-weighted return) when rebalanced back to policy than the underlying asset-class, or fund, returns. I eventually derived a series of equations that accurately predicted this gap. Those who are interested are encouraged to consult the work that mathematician David Wilkinson and I have done in this regard.

- these equations are exactly the same as Markowitz’s: returns, SDs, and correlations. In particular, the bonus is increased by high asset class volatility, low correlation, and equality of returns among asset classes. With high volatility, the investor is buying lower and selling higher. Low correlation means that one asset is zigging more often when the other is zagging, so the investor is rebalancing more often.

- But what really determines whether rebalancing increases returns or not is the similarity of returns. Consider another rebalancing pair, the S&P 500 and Japanese stocks for the decade between 1990 and 1999. During this period, the former returned 18.21 percent ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=2559))

- per year, while the latter actually lost 0.85 percent per year. Had an investor started with a 50/50 portfolio on January 1, 1990 and never rebalanced it, it would have earned an annualized return of 12.07 percent as U.S. stocks soared into the stratosphere while Japanese stocks deteriorated almost year after year. Had an investor rebalanced this portfolio annually, it would have earned only 9.14 percent, as the investor threw away good U.S. stocks after bad Japanese ones, year after year. As this example shows, rebalancing can lose as well as gain return. Is there any reason to believe that, on average, rebalancing will help more than hurt? Not if we believe that market movements are random. After all, we rebalance with the hope that an asset with past ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002U3CBY8&location=2561))
