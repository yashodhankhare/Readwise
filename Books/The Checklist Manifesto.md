## Highlights
- In the 1970s, the philosophers Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre published a short essay on the nature of human fallibility that I read during my surgical training and haven’t stopped pondering since. The ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=108))

- question they sought to answer was why we fail at what we set out to do in the world. One reason, they observed, is “necessary fallibility”—some things we want to do are simply beyond our capacity. We are not omniscient or all-powerful. Even enhanced by technology, our physical and mental powers are limited. Much of the world and universe is—and will remain—outside our understanding and control. There are substantial realms, however, in which control is within our reach. We can build skyscrapers, predict ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=109))

- snowstorms, save people from heart attacks and stab wounds. In such realms, Gorovitz and MacIntyre point out, we have just two reasons that we may nonetheless fail. The first is ignorance—we may err because science has given us only a partial understanding of ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=113))

- the world and how it works. There are skyscrapers we do not yet know how to build, snowstorms we cannot predict, heart attacks we still haven’t learned how to stop. The second type of failure the philosophers call ineptitude—because in these instances the knowledge ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=115))

This is the skyscraper that is built wrong and collapses, the snowstorm whose signs the meteorologist just plain missed, the stab wound from a weapon the doctors forgot to ask about.

- problem is not uniquely American; I have seen it everywhere—in Europe, in Asia, in rich countries and poor. Moreover, I have found to my surprise that the challenge is not limited to medicine. Know-how and sophistication have increased remarkably across almost all our realms of endeavor, and as a result so has our struggle to deliver on them. You see it in the frequent mistakes authorities make when hurricanes or tornadoes or other disasters hit. You see it in the 36 percent increase between 2004 and ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=151))

- don’t get their treatment on time? What do you mean that two-thirds of death penalty cases are overturned because of errors? It is not for nothing that the philosophers gave these failures so unmerciful a name—ineptitude. Those on the receiving end use other words, like negligence or even heartlessness.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- most highly trained, highly skilled, and hardworking people in our society. And, with it, they have indeed accomplished extraordinary things. Nonetheless, that know-how is often unmanageable. Avoidable failures are common and persistent, not to mention demoralizing and frustrating, across many fields—from medicine to finance, business to government. And the reason is increasingly evident: the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=179))

That means we need a different strategy for overcoming failure, one that builds on experience and takes advantage of the knowledge people have but somehow also makes up for our inevitable human inadequacies. And there is ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=182))

It is a checklist. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=184))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Medicine has become the art of managing extreme complexity—and a test of whether such complexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=238))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Medicine, with its dazzling successes but also frequent failures, therefore poses a significant challenge: What do you do when expertise is not enough? What do you do ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=396))

- when even the superspecialists fail? We’ve begun to see an answer, but it has come from an unexpected source—one that has nothing to do with medicine at all. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=397))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Yet it is far from obvious that something as simple as a checklist could be of substantial help. We may admit that errors and oversights occur—even devastating ones. But we believe our jobs are too complicated to reduce to a checklist. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=431))
- What, for instance, are the vital signs that every hospital records if not a kind of checklist? Comprised of four physiological data points—body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate—they give health professionals a basic picture of how sick a person is. Missing one of these measures can be dangerous, we’ve learned. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=436))
- In a complex environment, experts are up against two main difficulties. The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=444))
- when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=445))
- Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=453))
- In 2001, though, a critical care specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=466))
- Peter Pronovost decided to give a doctor checklist a try. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=467))
- Four generations after the first aviation checklists went into use, a lesson is emerging: checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against failure in many more tasks than we realized. They provide a kind of cognitive net. They catch mental flaws inherent in all of us—flaws of memory and attention and thoroughness. And because they do, they raise wide, unexpected possibilities. But they presumably have limits, as well. So a key step is to identify which kinds of situations checklists can help with and which ones they can’t. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=591))
- There are good checklists and bad, Boorman explained. Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1509))
- They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people’s brains off rather than turn them on. Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything—a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps—the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical. ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1510))
- When you’re making a checklist, Boorman explained, you have a number of key decisions. You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used (unless the moment is obvious, like when a warning light goes on or an engine fails). You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist. With a DO-CONFIRM checklist, he said, team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1545))
- supposed to be done was done. With a READ-DO checklist, on the other hand, people carry out the tasks as they check them off—it’s more like a recipe. So for any new checklist created from scratch, you have to pick the type that makes the most sense for the situation. The checklist cannot be lengthy. A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items, which is the limit of working memory. Boorman didn’t think one had to be religious on this point. “It all depends on the context,” he said. “In some situations you have only twenty seconds. In others, you may have several minutes.” But after about sixty to ninety seconds at a given pause point, the checklist often becomes a distraction ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1548))
- from other things. People start “shortcutting.” Steps get missed. So you want to keep the list short by focusing on what he called “the killer items”—the steps that are most dangerous to skip and sometimes overlooked nonetheless. (Data establishing which steps are most critical and how frequently people miss them are highly coveted in aviation, though not always available.) The wording should be simple and exact, Boorman went on, and use the familiar language of the profession. Even the look of the checklist matters. Ideally, it should fit on one page. It should be free of clutter and unnecessary colors. It should use both uppercase and lowercase text for ease of reading. (He went so far as to recommend using a sans serif type like Helvetica.) ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1554))
- But Boorman was adamant about one further point: no matter how careful we might be, no matter how much thought we might put in, a checklist has to be tested in the real world, which is inevitably more complicated than expected. First drafts always fall apart, he said, and one needs to study how, make changes, and keep testing until the checklist works consistently. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1561))
- There were, however, all kinds of steps that the checklist had not specified—notifying the radio control tower that we had an emergency, for example, briefing the flight attendants, determining the safest nearby airport to land and have the cargo door inspected. I hadn’t done any of these yet. But Boorman had. The omissions were intentional, he explained. Although these are critical steps, experience had shown that professional pilots virtually never fail to perform them when necessary. So ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1615))
- they didn’t need to be on the checklist—and in fact, he argued, shouldn’t be there. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1618))
- How this happened—it involved a checklist, of course—is instructive. But first think about what happens in most lines of professional work when a major failure occurs. To begin with, we rarely investigate our failures. Not in medicine, not in teaching, not in the legal profession, not in the financial world, not in virtually any other kind of work where the mistakes do not turn up on cable news. A single type of error can affect thousands, but because it usually touches only one person at a time, we tend not to search as hard for explanations. Sometimes, though, failures are ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1676))
- investigated. We learn better ways of doing things. And then what happens? Well, the findings might turn up in a course or a seminar, or they might make it into a professional journal or a textbook. In ideal circumstances, we issue some inch-thick set of guidelines or a declaration of standards. But getting the word out is far from assured, and incorporating the changes often takes years. One study in medicine, for example, examined the aftermath of nine different major treatment discoveries such as the finding that the pneumococcus vaccine protects not only children but also adults from respiratory infections, one of our most common killers. On average, the study reported, it took doctors seventeen years to adopt the new treatments for at least half of American patients. What experts like Dan Boorman have ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1680))
- recognized is that the reason for the delay is not usually laziness or unwillingness. The reason is more often that the necessary knowledge has not been translated into a simple, usable, and systematic form. If the only thing people did in aviation was issue dense, pages-long bulletins for every new finding that might affect the safe operation of airplanes—well, it would be like subjecting pilots to the same deluge of almost 700,000 medical journal articles per year that clinicians must contend with. The information would be unmanageable. But instead, when the crash investigators issued their bulletin—as dense and detailed as anything we find in medicine—Boorman and… ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1686))
- They sharpened, trimmed, and puzzled over pause points—how are pilots to know, for instance, whether an engine is failing because of icing instead of something else? Then his group tested the checklist with pilots in the simulator and found problems and fixed them and tested again. It took about two weeks for the Boeing team to complete the testing and refinement, and then they had their checklist. They sent it to every owner of a Boeing 777 in the world. Some airlines used the checklist as it was, but many, if not most, went on to make their own adjustments. Just as schools or hospitals tend to do things slightly differently, so do airlines, and they are encouraged to modify the… ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1692))
- be used.) Within about a month of the recommendations becoming available, pilots had the new checklist in their hands—or in their cockpit computers. And they used it. How do we know? Because on November 26, 2008, the disaster almost happened again. This time it was a Delta Air Lines flight from Shanghai to Atlanta with 247 people aboard. The Boeing 777 was at thirty-nine thousand feet over Great Falls, Montana, when it experienced “an uncommanded rollback” of the right No. 2 engine—the engine, in other words, failed. Investigation later showed that ice had blocked the fuel lines—the icing theory was correct—and Boeing instituted a mechanical change… ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1698))
- The pilot and copilot knew what to do, though. They got out their checklist and followed the lessons it offered. Because they did, the engine recovered, and 247 people were saved. It went so smoothly, the passengers didn’t even notice.… ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1704))
- And it is true well beyond medicine. The opportunity is evident in many fields—and so also is the resistance. Finance offers one example. Recently, I spoke to Mohnish Pabrai, managing partner in Pabrai Investment Funds in Irvine, California. He is one of three investors I’ve recently met who have taken a page from medicine and aviation to incorporate formal checklists into their work. All three are huge investors: Pabrai runs a $500 million portfolio; Guy Spier is head of Aquamarine Capital Management in Zurich, Switzerland, a $70 million fund. The third did not want to be identified by name or to reveal the size of the fund where he is a director, but it is one of the biggest in the world and worth billions. The three consider themselves “value investors”—investors who buy shares in underrecognized, undervalued companies. They don’t time the market. They don’t buy ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2032))
- according to some computer algorithm. They do intensive research, look for good deals, and invest for the long run. They aim to buy Coca-Cola before everyone realizes it’s going to be Coca-Cola. Pabrai described what this involves. Over the last fifteen years, he’s made a new investment or two per quarter, and he’s found it requires in-depth investigation of ten or more prospects for each one he finally buys stock in. The ideas can bubble up from anywhere—a billboard advertisement, a newspaper article about real estate in Brazil, a mining journal he decides to pick up for some random reason. He reads broadly and looks widely. He has his eyes open for the glint of a diamond in the dirt, of a business about to boom. He hits upon hundreds of possibilities but most drop away after cursory examination. ([Location 2039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2039))
- Every week or so, though, he spots one that starts his pulse racing. It seems surefire. He can’t believe no one else has caught onto it yet. He begins to think it could make him tens of millions of dollars if he plays it right, no, this time maybe hundreds of millions. “You go into greed mode,” he said. Guy Spier called it “cocaine brain.” Neuroscientists have found that the prospect of making money stimulates the same primitive reward circuits in the brain that cocaine does. And that, Pabrai said, is when serious investors like himself try to become systematic. They focus on dispassionate analysis, on avoiding both irrational exuberance and panic. They pore over the company’s financial reports, investigate its liabilities and risks, examine its management team’s track record, weigh its competitors, consider the future of the market it is in—trying to gauge both the magnitude of ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2045))
- opportunity and the margin of safety. The patron saint of value investors is Warren Buffett, among the most successful financiers in history and one of the two richest men in the world, even after the losses he suffered in the crash of 2008. Pabrai has studied every deal Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, have made—good or bad—and read every book he could find about them. He even pledged $650,000 at a charity auction to have lunch with Buffett. “Warren,” Pabrai said—and after a $650,000 lunch, I guess first names are in order—“Warren uses a ‘mental checklist’ process” when looking at potential investments. So that’s more or less what Pabrai did from his fund’s inception. He was disciplined. He made sure to take his time when studying a company. The process could require weeks. And he did very well following ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2051))
- this method—but not always, he found. He also made mistakes, some of them disastrous. These were not mistakes merely in the sense that he lost money on his bets or missed making money on investments he’d rejected. That’s bound to happen. Risk is unavoidable in Pabrai’s line of work. No, these were mistakes in the sense that he had miscalculated the risks involved, made errors of analysis. For example, looking back, he noticed that he had repeatedly erred in determining how “leveraged” companies were—how much cash was really theirs, how much was borrowed, and how risky those debts were. The information was available; he just hadn’t looked for it carefully enough. In large part, he believes, the mistakes happened because he wasn’t able to damp down the cocaine brain. Pabrai is a forty-five-year-old former engineer. He comes from ([Location 2058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2058))
- India, where he clawed his way up its fiercely competitive educational system. Then he secured admission to Clemson University, in South Carolina, to study engineering. From there he climbed the ranks of technology companies in Chicago and California. Before going into investment, he built a successful informational technology company of his own. All this is to say he knows a thing or two about being dispassionate and avoiding the lure of instant gratification. Yet no matter how objective he tried to be about a potentially exciting investment, he said, he found his brain working against him, latching onto evidence that confirmed his initial… ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2064))
- opposite happens. You go into “fear mode,” he said. You see people around you losing their bespoke shirts, and you overestimate the dangers. He also found he made mistakes in handling complexity. A good decision requires looking at so many different features of companies in so many ways that, even without the cocaine brain, he was missing obvious patterns. His mental checklist wasn’t good enough. “I am not Warren,” he said. “I don’t have a 300 IQ.” He needed an approach that could work for someone with an ordinary IQ. So he devised a written checklist. Apparently, Buffett himself could have used one. Pabrai noticed that even he made certain repeated… ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2070))
- as well as his own. It soon contained dozens of different mistakes, he said. Then, to help him guard against them, he devised a matching list of checks—about seventy in all. One, for example, came from a Berkshire Hathaway mistake he’d studied involving the company’s purchase in early 2000 of Cort Furniture, a Virginia-based rental furniture business. Over the previous ten years, Cort’s business and profits had climbed impressively. Charles Munger, Buffett’s longtime investment partner, believed Cort was riding a fundamental shift in the American economy. The business environment had become more and more volatile and companies therefore needed to grow and shrink more rapidly than ever… ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2077))
- Everything else about the company was measuring up—it had solid financials, great management, and so on. So Munger bought. But buying was an error. He had missed the fact that the three previous years of earnings had been driven entirely by the dot-com boom of the late nineties. Cort was leasing furniture to hundreds of start-up companies that suddenly stopped paying their bills and evaporated when the boom collapsed. “Munger and Buffett saw the dot-com bubble a mile away,” Pabrai said. “These guys were completely clear.” But they missed how dependent Cort was on it. Munger later called his purchase “a macroeconomic mistake.” “Cort’s earning power basically… ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2083))
- confirm that you’ve asked yourself whether the revenues might be overstated or understated due to boom or bust conditions. Like him, the anonymous investor I spoke to—I’ll call him Cook—made a checklist. But he was even more methodical: he enumerated the errors known to occur at any point in the investment process—during the research phase, during decision making, during execution of the decision, and even in the period after making an investment when one should be monitoring for problems. He then designed detailed checklists to avoid the errors, complete with clearly identified pause points at which he and his investment team would run through the items. He has… ([Location 2090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2090))
- confirm that they have gone over the prospect’s key financial statements for the previous ten years, including checking for specific items in each statement and possible patterns across the statements. “It’s easy to hide in a statement. It’s hard to hide between statements,” Cook said. One check, for example, requires the members of the team to verify that they’ve read the footnotes on the cash flow statements. Another has them confirm they’ve reviewed the statement of key management risks. A third asks them to make sure they’ve looked to see whether cash flow and costs match the reported revenue growth. “This is basic basic basic,” he said. “Just… ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2096))
- statements.” He told me about one investment he looked at that seemed a huge winner. The cocaine brain was screaming. It turned out, however, that the company’s senior officers, who’d been selling prospective investors on how great their business was, had quietly sold every share they owned. The company was about to tank and buyers jumping aboard had no idea. But Cook had put a check on his three-day list that ensured his team had reviewed the fine print of the company’s mandatory stock disclosures, and he discovered the secret. Forty-nine times out of fifty, he said, there’s nothing to be found. “But then there is.” The checklist doesn’t tell him what to do, he explained. It… ([Location 2103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2103))
- he’s systematic about decision making, that he’s talked to everyone he should. With a good checklist in hand, he was convinced he and his partners could make decisions as well as human beings are able. And as a result, he was also convinced they could reliably beat the market. I asked him whether he wasn’t fooling himself. “Maybe,” he said. But he put it in surgical terms for me. “When surgeons make sure to wash their hands or to talk to everyone on the team”—he’d seen the surgery checklist—“they improve their outcomes with no increase in skill. That’s what we are doing when we use the checklist.” Cook would not… ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2110))

Others say his fund has done far better than that, outperforming its peers. How much of any success can be directly credited to the checklist is not clear—after all, he’s used it just two years so far. What Cook says is certain, however, was that in a period of enormous volatility the checklist gave his team at least one additional and unexpected edge over others: efficiency. When he first introduced the checklist, he assumed it would slow his team down, increasing the time and work required for their… ([Location 2116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2116))
- time. But to his surprise, he found they were able to evaluate many more investments in far less time overall. Before the checklist, Cook said, it sometimes took weeks and multiple meetings to sort out how seriously they should consider a candidate investment—whether they should drop it or pursue a more in-depth investigation. The process was open-ended and haphazard, and when people put a month into researching an investment, they tended to get, well, invested. After the checklist, though, he and his team found that they could consistently sort out by the three-day check which prospects really deserved further consideration and which ones didn’t. “The… ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2122))
- an investment analyst. But “I didn’t need him anymore,” he said. Pabrai had been working with a checklist for about a year. His fund was up more than 100 percent since then. This could not possibly be attributed to just the checklist. With the checklist in place, however, he observed that he could move through investment decisions far faster and more methodically. As the markets plunged through late 2008 and stockholders dumped shares in panic, there were numerous deals to be had. And in a single quarter he was able to investigate more than a hundred companies and add ten to his fund’s portfolios. Without the checklist, Pabrai said, he could not have gotten through a… ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2129))
- What makes these investors’ experiences striking to me is not merely their evidence that checklists might work as well in finance as they do in medicine. It’s that here, too, they have found takers slow to come. In the money business, everyone looks for an edge. If someone is doing well, people pounce like starved hyenas to find out how. Almost every idea for making even slightly more money—investing in Internet companies, buying tranches of sliced-up mortgages, whatever—gets sucked up by the giant maw almost instantly. Every idea, that is, except one: checklists. I asked Cook how much interest others have had in what he has been doing these past two years.… ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2135))

- painstaking. They’re not much fun. But I don’t think the issue here is mere laziness. There’s something deeper, more visceral going on when people walk away not only from saving lives but from making money. It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us—those we aspire to be—handle situations of high stakes and complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have protocols and checklists. Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating. ([Location 2180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2180))
- The fear people have about the idea of adherence to protocol is rigidity. They imagine mindless automatons, heads down in a checklist, incapable of looking out their windshield and coping with the real world in front of them. But what you find, when a checklist is well made, is exactly the opposite. The checklist gets the dumb stuff out of the way, the routines your brain shouldn’t have to ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2235))
- occupy itself with (Are the elevator controls set? Did the patient get her antibiotics on time? Did the managers sell all their shares? Is everyone on the same page here?), and lets it rise above to focus on the hard stuff (Where should we land?). Here are the details of one of the sharpest checklists I’ve seen, a checklist for engine failure during flight in a single-engine Cessna airplane—the US Airways situation, only with a solo pilot. It is slimmed down to six key steps not to miss for restarting the engine, steps like making sure the fuel shutoff valve is in the OPEN position and putting the backup fuel pump switch ON. But step one on the list is the most fascinating. It is simply: FLY THE AIRPLANE. Because pilots sometimes become so desperate trying to restart their engine, so crushed by the cognitive overload of thinking through what could have gone wrong, they ([Location 2238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2238))

- of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. The codes are sometimes stated, sometimes just understood. But they all have at least three common elements. First is an expectation of selflessness: that we who accept responsibility for others—whether we are doctors, lawyers, teachers, public authorities, soldiers, or pilots—will place the needs and concerns of those who depend on us above our own. Second is an expectation of skill: that we will aim for excellence in our knowledge and expertise. Third is an expectation of trustworthiness: that we will be responsible in our personal behavior toward our charges. Aviators, however, add a fourth expectation, discipline: discipline in following prudent procedure and in functioning with others. This is a concept almost entirely outside the lexicon ([Location 2307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2307))
- of most professions, including my own. In medicine, we hold up “autonomy” as a professional lodestar, a principle that stands in direct opposition to discipline. But in a world in which success now requires large enterprises, teams of clinicians, high-risk technologies, and knowledge that outstrips any one person’s abilities, individual autonomy hardly seems the ideal we should aim for. It has the ring more of protectionism than of excellence. The closest our professional codes come to articulating the goal is an occasional plea for “collegiality.” What is needed, however, isn’t just that people working together be nice to each other. It is discipline. Discipline is hard—harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures. We can’t even keep from ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2314))

- One essential characteristic of modern life is that we all depend on systems—on assemblages of people or technologies or both—and among our most profound difficulties is making them work. In medicine, for instance, if I want my patients to receive the best care possible, not only must I do a good job but a whole collection of diverse components have to somehow mesh together effectively. Health care is like a car that way, points out Donald Berwick, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Boston and one of our deepest thinkers about systems in medicine. In both cases, having great components is not enough. We’re obsessed in medicine with having ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2333))
- great components—the best drugs, the best devices, the best specialists—but pay little attention to how to make them fit together well. Berwick notes how wrongheaded this approach is. “Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence,” he says. He gives the example of a famous thought experiment of trying to build the world’s greatest car by assembling the world’s greatest car parts. We connect the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, the body of a Volvo. “What we get, of course, is nothing close to a great car; we get a pile of very expensive junk.

- The same can be said in numerous other fields. We don’t study routine failures in teaching, in law, in government programs, in the financial industry, or elsewhere. We don’t look for the patterns of our recurrent mistakes or devise and refine potential solutions for them. But we could, and that is the ultimate point. We are all plagued by failures—by missed subtleties, overlooked knowledge, and outright errors. For the most part, we have imagined that little can be done beyond working harder and harder to catch the problems and clean up ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2347))
- after them. We are not in the habit of thinking the way the army pilots did as they looked upon their shiny new Model 299 bomber—a machine so complex no one was sure human beings could fly it. They too could have decided just to “try harder” or to dismiss a crash as the failings of a “weak” pilot. Instead they chose to accept their fallibilities. They recognized the simplicity and power of using a checklist. And so can we. Indeed, against the complexity of the world, we must. There is no other choice. When we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination. We know the patterns. We see the costs. It’s time to try something else. Try a checklist. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2351))
