- There may be nothing across the entire spectrum of human endeavor that makes so many smart people feel so stupid as investing does. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=50))

- I’ve been a financial journalist since 1987, and nothing I’ve ever learned about investing has excited me more than the spectacular findings emerging from the study of “neuroeconomics.” Thanks to this newborn field—a hybrid of neuroscience, economics, and psychology—we can begin to understand what drives investing behavior not only on the theoretical or practical level, but as a basic ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=55))
- biological function. These flashes of fundamental insight will enable you to see as never before what makes you tick as an investor. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=58))
- The newest findings in neuroeconomics suggest that much of what we’ve been told about investing is wrong. In theory, the more we learn about our investments, and the harder we work at understanding them, the more money we will make. Economists have long insisted that investors know what they want, understand the tradeoff between risk and reward, and use information logically to pursue their goals. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=62))
- In practice, however, those assumptions often turn out to be dead wrong. Which side of this table sounds more like you? ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=65))
- One of the themes of this book is that our investing brains often drive us to do things that make no logical sense—but make perfect emotional sense. That does not make us irrational. It makes us human. Our brains were originally designed to get more of whatever would improve our odds of survival and to avoid whatever would worsen the odds. Emotional circuits deep in our brains make us instinctively crave whatever feels likely to be ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=78))
- rewarding—and shun whatever seems liable to be risky. To counteract these impulses from cells that originally developed tens of millions of years ago, your brain has only a thin veneer of relatively modern, analytical circuits that are often no match for the blunt emotional power of the most ancient parts of your mind. That’s why knowing the right answer, and doing the right thing, are very different. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=81))
- In the 1950s, a young researcher at the RAND Corporation was pondering how much of his retirement fund to allocate to stocks and how much to bonds. An expert in linear programming, he knew that “I should have computed the historical co-variances of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier. Instead, I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it—or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities.” The researcher’s name was Harry M. Markowitz. Several years earlier, he had written an article called “Portfolio ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=91))
- Selection” for the Journal of Finance showing exactly how to calculate the tradeoff between risk and return. In 1990, Markowitz shared the Nobel Prize in economics, largely for the mathematical breakthrough that he had been incapable of applying to his own portfolio. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=95))
- Your investing brain does not just add and multiply and estimate and evaluate. When you win, lose, or risk money, you stir up some of the most profound emotions a human being can ever feel. “Financial decision-making is not necessarily about money,” says psychologist Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University. “It’s also about intangible motives like avoiding regret or achieving pride.” Investing requires you to make decisions using data from the past and hunches in the present about risks and rewards you will harvest in the future—filling you with feelings like hope, greed, cockiness, surprise, fear, panic, regret, and happiness. That’s why I’ve organized this book around the succession of emotions that most people pass through on the psychological roller coaster of investing. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=111))
- And it’s not as if emotion is the enemy and reason is the ally of good financial decisions. People who have suffered head injuries that prevent them from engaging the emotional circuitry in their brains can be terrible investors. Pure rationality with no feelings can be as bad for your portfolio as sheer emotion unchecked by reason. Neuroeconomics shows that you will get the best results when you harness your emotions, not when you strangle them. This book will help you strike the right balance between emotion and reason. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=120))
- Most of all, this book should help you understand your investing self better than you ever have before. You may think you already know what kind of investor you are, but you are probably wrong. “If you don’t know who you are,” quipped the investment writer “Adam Smith” in his classic book The Money Game, then Wall Street “is an expensive place to find out.” (The people who bought Internet stocks in 1999 because they thought they had a high tolerance for risk—and then lost 95% over the next three years—know just how expensive it can be.) Over the years, I’ve grown convinced that there are only three kinds of investors: those who think they are geniuses, those who think they are idiots, and those who aren’t sure. As a general rule, the ones who aren’t sure are the… ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=124))
- everyone else. If you think you’re a financial idiot, you’re probably smarter than you realize—and you need to train your brain so you can understand how to triumph as an investor. Knowing more about who you are as an investor can make you a fortune—or save you one. That’s why it’s so… ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=130))

- unconsciously, and uncontrollably expects a third repetition; once people conclude that an investment’s returns are “predictable,” their brains respond with alarm if that apparent pattern is broken; financial losses are processed in the same areas of the brain that respond to mortal danger; anticipating a gain, and actually receiving it, are expressed in entirely different ways in the brain, helping to explain why “… ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=138))

- Again and again as I researched this book, I was struck by the overwhelming evidence that most of us do not understand our own behavior. There have been many books whose central message is “almost everything you ever thought you knew about investing is wrong.” There have been very few that seek to make you a better investor by showing that everything you ever thought you knew about yourself is wrong. In the end, this book is about more than the inner workings of the investing brain. It is also about what it means to be human—with all our miraculous powers as well as embarrassing frailties… ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=153))
- Other investors rely on their gut feelings even more literally than Dr. Harris or Celtics fans.

- The first thing these judgments had in common is that they all were driven by intuition. The people who bought these stocks did not analyze the underlying business; instead, they went on a feeling, a sensation, a hunch. The second thing these judgments had in common is that they all were wrong. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=182))

- In his book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell claims that “decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.” Gladwell is a superb writer, but when it comes to investing, his argument is downright dangerous. Intuition can yield wondrously fast and accurate judgments, but ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=191))

- In a game governed by rules like these, if all you do is “blink,” your investing results will stink. Intuition has a legitimate role to play in investing—but it should be a subordinate, not a dominant, role. Fortunately, you can make your intuitions work better for you, and you do not have to invest by intuition alone. The best financial decisions draw on the dual strengths of your investing brain:… ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=201))
- The Man with Two Brains Quick: If John F. Kennedy had not been assassinated, how old would he be today? Now, decide whether you’d like to reconsider your answer. If… ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=206))
- first guess was that JFK would be 76 or 77 years old. After you gave it a second thought, you probably added about ten years to that estimate. (The precise answer: John F. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, so do the math.) It’s not just amateurs whose first answer is wrong. In 2004, I sprang this little quiz on one of the world’s leading experts on decision-making. His first guess was that Kennedy would be 75; when I gave him a few moments to think about it, he changed his answer to 86. Why do we get this problem wrong at first—and then correct it so easily? When you first confront the question, your intuition instantly summons up a powerful visual memory of Kennedy as a vigorous, youthful leader. You then adjust the age of… ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=208))
- Kennedy’s boyish face is so vividly anchored in your memory that it overwhelms the other data you should consider, like how many years have passed since his death. Psychologists call this process “anchoring and adjustment,” and it gets us through most of daily life remarkably well. Once you were prompted to reconsider, the analytical part of your brain probably recognized and fixed your intuitive error somewhat like this: “Let’s see, I guess Kennedy was in his mid-40s when he was shot, and that was around 1963, so he’d probably be around 90 if he were alive today.” But your intuition does not always give your rational side the chance to reconsider. In the early 1970s, psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem asked… ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=214))
- the number they had just spun. The spins of the wheel made a big difference, even though such obviously random (and totally irrelevant) numbers should have had no influence on people. On average, people who spun a 10 guessed that only 25% of U.N. members were African nations, while people who spun a 65 guessed that 45% were African. You can test your own tendency to anchor with this simple exercise. Take the last three digits of your telephone number, then add 400. (For example, if your phone number ends with the digits 237, adding 400 to it gives you 637.) Now answer these two questions: Was Attila the Hun defeated in Europe before or after that year? And what’s your best guess of the exact year Attila the Hun was defeated? Even… ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=221))
- The correct answer, by the way, is 451 A.D. As soon as your intuition seizes on a number—any number—it becomes stuck, as if it had been coated in glue. That’s why real estate agents will usually show you the most expensive house on the market first, so the others will seem cheap by comparison—and why mutual fund companies nearly always launch new funds at $10.00 per share, enticing new investors with a “cheap” price at the beginning. In… ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=229))
- it works so… ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=233))
- Here’s another thought experiment that shows the tug of war between intuition and analytical thinking: A candy bar and a piece of gum together cost $1.10. The candy bar costs $1.00 more than the piece of gum. Quick: How much does the gum cost? Now take thirty seconds or so to decide whether you would like to change your answer. Almost everyone, at first blush, says that the gum costs 10 cents. Most people will never notice that answer is wrong unless they’re explicitly asked to second-guess themselves. After thinking about it for a while, you probably realized you made a mistake: If the gum costs 10 cents, and the candy bar costs $1.00 more than… ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=234))
- gum costs 5 cents and the candy costs $1.05. You can correctly solve a problem like this if—but only if—the analytical part of your brain becomes aware that your intuition may have made a mistake. Using terms suggested by Matthew Lieberman, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, I call these two aspects of your investing brain the reflexive (or intuitive) system and the reflective (or analytical) system. Most financial decisions are a tug of war between these two ways of thinking. To see how tough it can be for analysis to trump intuition, look at Figure 2.1. Even after you prove that your perceptions are playing a trick on you, it’s hard to conquer the… ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=240))
- In the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, the upper horizontal line looks shorter than the lower one. They are, in fact, the same length—which you can easily verify by measuring them with a ruler. But your intuition is so powerful that it will continue to tell you the bottom line is longer even after your analysis has proved otherwise. Nevertheless, it’s far from true that your reflexive brain is powerful but dumb and your reflective brain is weak but smart. In fact, each system is good at some things and… ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=248))
- These parts of your brain can activate an alarm in less than a tenth of a second. The reflexive system (which some researchers call System 1) gets “first crack at making most judgments and decisions,” says Matthew Lieberman of UCLA. We count on our intuition to make initial sense of the world around us—and we tap into our analytical system only when intuition can’t figure something out. As Kahneman says, “We run mostly on System 1 software.” ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=268))
- Reuven Dukas, a behavioral ecologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, has shown that having to pay attention to more than one stimulus at once dramatically decreases the amount of food that animals like birds and fish can identify and capture. The human animal is no different: While “multitasking” is a fact of life, so is the falloff in awareness we can devote to each new task. Shifting your attention from one thing to the next causes what Dukas calls “a period of reduced efficiency.” When you redirect your attention, your brain is like a bicyclist who stops pedaling for a moment and must then get back up to full speed. As Dukas says, we are designed to “focus attention on the stimuli most likely to be of importance.” After all, our brains can’t possibly keep up with everything that’s happening in our environment. When you are at rest, your ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=276))
- brain—which accounts for roughly 2% of the typical person’s body weight—consumes 20% of the oxygen you take in and the calories you burn. Because your brain operates at such a high “fixed cost,” you need to ignore most of what is happening around you. The vast majority of it isn’t meaningful, and if you had to pay separate, equal, and continual attention to everything, information overload would fry your brain in short order. “Thinking wears you out,” says Lieberman of UCLA. “So the reflective system tends not to want to do anything unless it has to.” ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=282))
- Therefore, our intuition acts as the first filter of experience, an instantaneous screen that enables us to conserve our vital mental energy for the things that are most likely to matter. Because of its phenomenal skill in recognizing similarities, the reflexive system sounds an instant alarm when it detects a difference.

- You may think you’ve made a “conscious decision,” but more often than not you have been driven by the same basic impulses that drove our ancestors to avoid risks and pursue rewards. As neuroscientist Arne Öhman puts it, evolution has designed our emotions “to make us want to do what our ancestors had to do.” ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=295))

- At the University of Iowa, students were briefly shown numbers that they had to memorize. Then they were offered the choice of either a fruit salad or a chocolate cake. When the number the students memorized was seven digits long, 63% of them chose the cake. When the number they were asked to remember had just two digits, however, 59% opted for the fruit salad. Our reflective brains know that the fruit salad is better for our health, but our reflexive brains crave that gooey, fattening chocolate cake. If the reflective brain is busy figuring something else out—like trying to remember a ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=333))
- seven-digit number—then impulse can easily prevail. On the other hand, if we’re not thinking too hard about something else (with only a minor distraction like memorizing two digits), then the reflective system can overrule the emotional impulse of the reflexive side. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=337))
- In the financial markets, people who rely blindly on their reflective systems often end up losing the forest for the trees—and their shirts as well. Although doctors get a bad rap as investors, in my experience engineers are worse. That may be because they are trained to calculate and measure every possible variable. I’ve met engineers who spend two or three hours a day analyzing stocks. They are often convinced that they’ve discovered a unique statistical secret that will enable them to beat the market. Because they have squelched their intuition, their analysis fails to alert them to the most obvious fact of all: There’s always something to measure on Wall Street, which spews out a torrent of statistics on everything under the sun. Unfortunately, at least 100 million other investors can view the same data, taking ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=356))

- When a problem is hard to ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=367))
- solve, the reflective system may “hand back” the challenge and let the reflexive brain take over. In an experiment by Robin Hogarth and the late Hillel Einhorn of the University of Chicago, people were told that an expert claimed that the market always went up after he predicted that it would rise. They were told they could verify the expert’s claim by choosing to observe any or all of the following evidence: what the market did after he predicted that it would rise what the market did after he predicted that it would fall what he predicted before the market rose what he predicted before the market fell ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=367))
- To answer Hogarth and Einhorn’s question correctly, you need only to understand that the most reliable way of determining whether ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=378))
- something is true is to try proving that it is false. That’s the cornerstone of the scientific method, the critical mind-set that overturned old orthodox “truths” like the world is flat and the earth is the center of the universe. But that kind of critical thinking is anathema to your intuition, which is most comfortable when dealing with the concrete reality of “what is.” To handle a conceptual abstraction like “what is not,” you need your reflective system to kick in with the hard mental effort of comparing alternatives and evaluating evidence. That requires asking tough questions like “under what conditions would this no longer be true or fail to work?” And the human mind, which functions as what psychologists Susan Fiske of Princeton and Shelley Taylor of UCLA have called a “cognitive miser,” tends to shy away from that kind of effort. If the reflective system can’t readily find a solution, the reflexive brain will resume control, using sensory and emotional cues as shortcuts. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=379))

- jellybeans made up 10% of the total in the small bowl but no more than 9% of the total in the big one. (See Figure 2.2 for a schematic view of the experiment.)

- Which Bowl Would You Pick From? In this experiment, researchers instructed people to try picking a colored jellybean from either of two bowls. In the one on the left, 10% of the jellybeans were colored; in the one on the right, only 9% were. But people still preferred to pick from the bowl that they “knew” had lower odds of success, because they “felt” it offered more ways to win.

- Which bowl did people pick from? Someone using the reflective system to think analytically would always choose from the small bowl, since it offered a constant 10% chance of success, while the odds of getting a red jellybean out of the big bowl could never go above 9%. Nevertheless, just under two-thirds of people preferred to pick from the big bowl when it contained 9% red jellybeans. Even when it held only 5% red jellybeans, nearly one-quarter of the participants in the experiment chose to pick from the big bowl—regardless of what their reflective system was telling them about logic and probability. “I picked the [bowl] with the more red… ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=401))

- In this fundamental investing fraction, the numerator fluctuates constantly, and often widely, while the denominator varies much more gradually over time. Let’s say, for instance, that you have a total net worth of $200,000 and that yesterday the market value of your stocks did not change at all. If your stocks gain $1,000 today, then the numerator of your fraction instantly shoots from zero to $1,000. The denominator, however, nudges slightly upward from $200,000 to $201,000. The leap from zero to $1,000 is exciting and vivid, while the movement from $200,000 to $201,000 is hardly noticeable at all. But it’s the denominator that matters; that’s where the real money is. After all, the sum total of your wealth is a much more important number than… ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=414))
- In the late 1980s, psychologist Paul Andreassen ran a series of remarkable studies in which he set up an artificial stock market in his laboratories at Columbia and Harvard. He showed the level of stock prices to one group of investors; another group could view only the change in stock prices. Depending on how much the stocks fluctuated, investors who focused on price levels earned between five and ten times higher profits than those who paid attention to price changes. That’s because the investors who fixated on price changes traded too much, trying… ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=420))

- When the financial markets are quietly muddling along, it’s easier for reflective judgment to prevail over reflexive intuitions. But when bull markets are pumping out sensationally high returns—or when bear markets are generating demoralizing losses—the reflexive system gets the upper hand and it becomes urgently important to think twice. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=473))
- ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. One way to think twice is to have a procedure for making sure you ask the ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=476))
- right questions. As Daniel Kahneman says, “People who are confronted with a difficult question sometimes answer an easier one instead.” That’s because the reflexive system hates uncertainty, and will quickly reframe problems into terms it can understand and answer with ease. Faced, for example, with a difficult problem to solve—“Will this stock keep going up?”—many investors consult a chart of recent price performance. If the trend line slopes upward, then they immediately answer “Yes,” without realizing that their reflexive system has tricked them into answering an entirely different question. All the chart really shows is the answer to a much easier problem: “Has this stock been going up?” People in this kind of situation “are not confused about the question they are trying to answer,” says Kahneman. “They simply fail to notice that they are answering a different one.” Asking a follow-up query—for example, ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=477))
- “How do I know?” or “What is the evidence?” or “Do I need more information than this?”—can force you to notice that your reflexive system was answering the wrong question. Christopher Hsee, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, has another suggestion: “If this happened to someone else, and they asked for your advice, what would you tell them to do? I oftentimes try to make decisions that way, by putting myself in someone else’s shoes.” Hsee’s tip is particularly helpful because once you imagine giving advice to someone else, you can also imagine that person pressing you: “Are you sure? How do you know?” ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=484))
- DON’T JUST PROVE; TRY TO DISPROVE. As we’ve seen, the reflexive brain believes that the best way to prove an assertion is to keep looking for more proof that it is true. But the only way to be more certain it’s true is to search harder for proof that it is false. Money managers often ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=489))
- say things like, “We add value by selling any stock that drops 15% from our purchase price.” As proof, they show the performance of the stocks they kept. Instead, you should ask to see the subsequent returns of the stocks that got sold; that’s the only way to tell whether the firm really should have sold them. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=492))
- CONQUER YOUR SENSES WITH COMMON SENSE. In general, sights and sounds engage your reflexive system, while words and numbers activate your reflective system. That’s why brokerage ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=498))
- firms and insurance companies produce advertisements showing golden people strolling along a golden beach with their golden retriever; that image sets off powerful feelings of comfort and security in your reflexive system. That’s also why mutual fund companies display the performance of their portfolios in the form of “mountain charts,” those graphics that show an initial investment growing over time until it has heaped up into a vivid, Himalayan peak of wealth. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=499))
- Like frogs, people are inherently excited by motion. Investors are much more inclined to expect the stock market to keep rising when its activity is described with an action verb like “climbing” or “leaping” than when it is summed up in neutral terms like “posting a gain.” Figures of speech that evoke rapid movement fire up our minds to expect that the market must be “trying to do something.” ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=508))
- ONLY FOOLS INVEST WITHOUT RULES. When the great investment analyst Benjamin Graham was asked what it takes to be a successful investor, he replied: “People don’t need extraordinary insight or intelligence. What they need most is the character to adopt simple rules and stick to them.” I’ve set out ten basic investment rules in Appendix 1. The first letters of these ten commandments form the words THINK TWICE. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=516))
- COUNT TO TEN. When your emotions are running high, take a time-out before you make a hasty decision you might regret later. Psychologists Kent Berridge of the University of Michigan and Piotr Winkielman of the University of California, San Diego, have shown that we can be swept away by emotion without any awareness whatsoever of what’s going on inside us. Berridge and Winkielman call this ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=524))

- So unless you guard against investing under the influence of your own momentary mood swings, you may never achieve financial stability. When Norbert Schwarz warns, “Never make an important decision before you’ve slept on it,” he is not repeating a cliché. He is stating fundamental wisdom freshly confirmed by the latest scientific research. You will almost always make a better investing ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=545))
- decision if you sleep on it rather than acting on your first impulse. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=547))
- Another option, says Matthew Lieberman, is to get a “second opinion from someone who isn’t invested in your point of view.” Try running your investment ideas past someone who knows you well but is accustomed to disagreeing with you. While your spouse might sound ideal for this purpose, the best person is someone who would be a good business—rather than romantic—partner for you. It’s worth noting that many of America’s most innovative and successful companies are led by duos who check and counterbalance each other’s ideas: Berkshire Hathaway has Warren Buffett and Charles Munger; Yahoo! has David Filo and Jerry Yang; Google has Larry Page and Sergey Brin. If you have someone who is both trustworthy and tough on you, make a habit of testing your investing ideas out on him or her before you do anything else. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=548))
- A final approach is to try “embodying” your thoughts. “You do your thinking in a body,” explains Schwarz, “and your bodily responses interact with your neural activity.” Odd as it sounds, pushing away from a hard surface with your forearm can be a helpful step in thinking more reflectively and less emotionally. By shoving back against your computer or your desk, for example, you can literally distance yourself from the emotional aspects of the decision. Next, use this stiff-arming motion as a reminder. As you “push back,” remember to “think twice” by referring to the ten investing commandments in Appendix 1. You could even use a Palm Pilot or BlackBerry to send yourself automatic prompts—“Did I push back and think twice?”—before you make any moves in the market. All these mental tricks provide what Santa Clara University finance professor Meir Statman calls “a cold shower” that can help ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=554))

- WHEN THE MARKET “BLINKS,” BLINK BACK. If a stock crashes on bad news, it might be permanently damaged—or just suffering from a temporary overreaction. By doing your homework on an investment ahead of time, you can be ready to pounce. If you’re a serious stock investor, you should always be braced to buy the stock of companies you understand if they suddenly become bargains. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=561))
- Doing your homework ahead of time enables you to take advantage of the “blink” thinking of fair-weather investors who panic at the first sign of trouble. Warren Buffett read the annual report of Anheuser-Busch every year for twenty-five years, familiarizing himself with the company while he patiently waited for the stock to become cheap enough for him to want to own it. Finally, in early 2005, the stock dropped—and Buffett, who now knew the business intimately, snapped up a major stake in Anheuser-Busch.

It’s not uncommon for a stock’s price to change as often as a thousand times in a single trading day, but in the world of real commerce, the value of a business hardly changes at all on any given day. Business value changes over time, not all the time. Stocks are like weather, altering almost continuously and without warning; businesses are like climate, changing much more gradually and predictably. In the short run, it’s the weather that gets our notice and appears to determine the environment, but in the long run it’s the climate that really counts.

- Therefore, once you become interested in a company, it’s a good idea to let two weeks go by without ever checking its share price. At the end of that period, now that you no longer know exactly where the shares are trading, do your own evaluation—ignoring stock price and focusing exclusively on business value. Start with questions like these: Do I understand this company’s products or services? If the stock did not trade publicly, would I still want to own this kind of business?

- TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT MATTERS. The account statements you receive from your brokerage or mutual fund company are often designed to set your reflexive system jangling: They emphasize the short-term price changes of each investment, not the level of your total wealth.

- high and sell low. “The most natural way to think about a decision,” warns Daniel Kahneman, “is not always the best way to make the decision.” If your financial adviser or fund company can’t overhaul your financial statements, do it yourself: Set up a spreadsheet in Excel or similar software. At the end of each calendar quarter, enter the value of each of your investments; use small, plain type. Use Excel’s “autosum” function to calculate the grand total of all your holdings. Highlight that total in big, boldface type. (If you can’t use Excel, a lined piece of paper will do fine; be sure to record the sum total in larger, bolder numbers.)

- Anticipating a financial gain puts the reflexive part of your investing brain on red alert, focusing your attention keenly on the task at hand. After you buy a stock, for example, you fixate on the possibility that it will keep going up. That thrill is limited only by your imagination. But the outcome itself—let’s say the stock does go up after you buy it—is less exciting, especially when you expected it all along. By the time you pocket the money, the thrill of greed has faded into something that resembles a neurological yawn—even though you got the gains you wanted. Making money feels good, all right; it just doesn’t feel as good as expecting to make money. In a cruel irony that has enormous implications for financial behavior, your investing brain comes equipped with ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=642))

- Lately, psychologists have been exploring what happens when the anticipation circuitry is damaged. In a laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, rats are placed into chambers where they can press either of two levers with their paws. With a push on one lever, the rats receive a reward of a single sugar pellet immediately; a nudge on the other lever yields a yummier prize of four sugar pellets, but only after a delay of between 10 and 60 seconds. Rats with fully intact brains are highly impatient, but they will still choose the larger, later rewards up to half the time. However, rats with damage to the nucleus accumbens in their brain suffer from a novel form of ADD—not attention deficit disorder, but anticipation deficit disorder. Without a properly functioning ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=743))
- nucleus accumbens, these rats become almost completely incapable of delaying gratification, and they choose the earlier but smaller prize more than 80% of the time. The lost ability to anticipate future reward forces these rats into what psychologist Rudolf Cardinal of Cambridge calls “impulsive choice.” As he puts it, the anticipation circuits may enable normal rats to “focus their cognitive resources” on what lies just over the horizon. But for rats without a functioning nucleus accumbens, the here and now is all that matters; the future is never. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=748))
- So the seeking system in our own brains functions partly as a blessing and partly as a curse. Our anticipation circuitry forces us to pay close attention to the possibility of coming rewards, but it also leads us to expect that the future will feel better than it actually does once it arrives. That’s ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=752))

- One of Wall Street’s oldest proverbs is “Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.” The theory behind this cliché is that stocks go up as whispers spread among the “smart money” that something big is about to happen. Then, as soon as the general public learns the good news, the sophisticates sell out at the top and the stock goes down the toilet. There’s something to this, but it probably has more to do with the anticipation circuits in everyone’s brain than it does with the supposedly superior brainpower of a few big investors. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=757))
- The likeliest explanation is simply that the fires of anticipation are so easily quenched by the cold water of reality. Once the good news that investors have awaited for so long is out, the thrill is gone. The resulting emotional vacuum almost instantly fills up with a painful awareness that the future will not be nearly as exciting as the past. (As Yogi Berra famously said, “The future ain’t what it used to be.”) Getting exactly what they wished for leaves investors with nothing to look forward to, so they get out and the stock crashes.

- In other words, once we become aware that rewards may be in the offing, our attention is riveted not only by a gain or the signal that a gain may be coming—but even by a hint that the signal may be coming! Hiroyuki Nakahara of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Wako, Japan, calls this early-warning flare “the anticipation of anticipation of reward.” It’s as if Pavlov’s dogs salivated not when the bell rang, but as soon as they saw Pavlov start walking toward the bell.

- Anticipation has another unusual neural ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=828))
- wrinkle. Brian Knutson has found that while your reflexive brain is highly responsive to variations in the amount of reward at stake, it is much less sensitive to changes in the probability of receiving a reward. In effect, your investing brain is better at asking “How big is it?” than “How likely is it?” Thus, the bigger the potential gain, the greedier you will feel—regardless of how poor the odds of earning that gain might be. If the jackpot in a lottery were $100 million and the posted odds of winning fell from 1-in-10-million to 1-in-100-million, would you be ten times less likely to buy a ticket? If you’re like most people, you probably would shrug, “A long shot’s a long shot,” and be just as happy buying a ticket as before. That’s because, as economist George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University explains, the “mental image” of $10 million sets off a burst of anticipation in the reflexive regions of your brain.

But your brain isn’t designed to form mental imagery of a probability. The pleasure you anticipate feeling if you win the money would change enormously if we multiplied or divided the amount of the jackpot by 10 or 100 or 1000, but your reaction to similar changes in probability would trigger very little emotion.” Because anticipation is processed reflexively while probability is processed reflectively, the… ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=835))

Sometimes the “good” wheel would come up, sometimes the wheel with the middling payouts, and sometimes the “bad” one, all in random order. In this experiment, your brain doesn’t look at the potential gains in isolation, but compares them to the other possible outcomes. The good wheel could get you $10—but with no risk of loss. Meanwhile, the middling wheel could earn you just $2.50 at most—but that potential gain carries the risk of losing $1.50. Thus, even though the middling wheel offers a smaller upside, it engages your investing brain with equal intensity, since it’s coupled with a risk of loss.

Calm yourself down—if you don’t have kids to distract you, take a walk around the block or go to the gym—and reconsider when the heat of the moment has passed and your anticipation circuits have cooled off.

A life-size clay model of a sheep’s liver, it served as a training tool for a specialized Babylonian ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=948))
- priest known as a baru, who made predictions about the future by studying the guts of a freshly slaughtered sheep. The model is a catalog of the blemishes, colors, and differences in size or shape that a real sheep’s liver might display. The baru and his followers believed that each of these variables could help foretell what was about to happen, so the clay model is painstakingly subdivided into sixty-three areas, each marked with cuneiform writing and other symbols describing its predictive powers.

- What makes this artifact so astounding is that it is as contemporary as today’s coverage of the financial news. More than 3,700 years after this clay model was first baked in Mesopotamia, the liver-reading Babylonian barus are still with us—except now they are called market strategists, financial analysts, and investment experts. The latest unemployment report is “a clear sign” that interest rates will rise. This month’s news about inflation means it’s “a sure thing” that the stock market will go down. This new product or that new boss is “a good omen” for a company’s stock. Just like an ancient baru massaging the meanings out of a bloody liver, today’s market forecasters sometimes get the future right—if only by luck alone.

Learn the hints of coming rainfall, the clues of antelope just over the horizon, the signs of fresh water nearby. Understand who is trustworthy, figure out how to collaborate with them, learn how to outsmart those who are not. Those are the kinds of tasks our brains evolved to perform. “The main difference between us and apes,” explains anthropologist Todd Preuss of Emory University, “seems to be less a matter of adding new areas [in the brain], and more a matter of enlarging existing areas and modifying their internal machinery to do new and different things. The ‘what if’ questions, the ‘what will ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1100))

But no other species can match our phenomenal ability to forecast and extrapolate, to observe correlations, to infer cause from effect. Our own advanced species, Homo sapiens sapiens, is less than 200,000 years old. And the human brain has barely grown since then; in 1997, paleoanthropologists discovered a 154,000-year-old Homo sapiens skull in Ethiopia. The brain it once held would have been about 1,450 cubic centimeters in volume. That is at least three times the volume of a gorilla or chimpanzee brain—but no smaller than the brain of the average person living today.

In that landscape, extrapolation—figuring out the next link that would complete a simple pattern of repeating visual cues—became a vital adaptation for survival.

- Schultz specializes in studying dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps animals, including humans, figure out how to take actions that will result in rewards at the right time. Dopamine signals originate deep in the underbelly of the brain, where your cerebral machinery connects to your spinal cord. Of the brain’s roughly 100 billion neurons, well under one-thousandth of one percent produce dopamine. But this minuscule neural minority wields enormous power over your investing decisions. “Dopamine spreads its fingers all over the brain,” as neuroscientist Antoine Bechara of the University of Southern California describes it. When the dopamine neurons light up, they don’t focus their signals as if they were flashlights ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1137))
- aiming at isolated targets; instead, these neural connections shoot forth their bursts like fireworks, sending vast sprays of energy throughout the parts of the brain that turn motivations into decisions and decisions into actions. It can take as little as a twentieth of a second for these electrochemical pulses to blast their way up from the base of your brain to your decision centers. In the popular mind, dopamine is a pleasure drug that gives you a natural high, an internal Dr. Feelgood flooding your brain with a soft euphoria whenever you get something you want. There’s more to it than that. Besides estimating the value of an expected reward, you also need to propel yourself into the actions that will capture it. “If you know that a reward might happen,” says psychologist Kent Berridge of the University of ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1142))

That may help explain why drug addicts crave an ever-larger “fix” to get the same kick—and why investors have such a hankering for fast-rising stocks with “positive momentum” or “accelerating earnings growth.” To sustain the same level of neural activity, they require a bigger hit each time. An unexpected gain fires up the brain. By studying the brains of monkeys earning “income” like sips of juice or morsels of fruit, Schultz confirmed that when a reward comes as a surprise, the dopamine neurons fire longer and stronger than… ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1154))

- At Harvard Medical School, neuroscientist Hans Breiter has compared activity in the brains of cocaine addicts who are expecting to get a fix and people who are expecting to make a profitable financial gamble. The similarity isn’t just striking; it’s chilling. Lay an MRI brain scan of a cocaine addict next to one of somebody who thinks he’s about to make money, and ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1184))
- the patterns of neurons firing in the two images are “virtually right on top of each other,” says Breiter. “You can’t get a better bull’s-eye hit than those two.” (See Figure 4.1.) “If there’s an addictive process around chemicals and currency can be used to buy chemicals,” asks Breiter, “is it possible that the same process applies to money? It’s a very, very good question that has not been answered, but there’s a developing mass of anecdotal data that suggests that perhaps it is.” In other words, once you score big on a few investments in a row, you may be the functional equivalent of an addict—except the substance you’re hooked on isn’t alcohol or cocaine, it’s money. What is the underlying force that drives the prediction addiction in our brains? The dopamine researchers led by ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1187))
- Montague and Schultz have made a discovery that may remind you of Pavlov’s dogs. Once you’ve learned what kind of cue can signal a reward, your dopamine neurons no longer fire up in response to the gain itself; instead, they will be triggered by the appearance of the cue. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1192))
- And if the reward is big enough, dopamine appears to carry a kind of long-lasting “memory” for the cue. After rats have learned that a specific sound predicts the impending delivery of a reward, neurons in their nucleus accumbens will fire the next time the rats hear the cue, even if four weeks have gone by since they last heard it or earned the reward. (Four weeks to a rat is 80 to 100 weeks in “people years.”) It’s impossible to overstate the importance of these discoveries. After you learn a pattern or set of circumstances that made ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1194))
- you money, the release of dopamine in your brain will be triggered by that stimulus—not by actually earning the money itself. Anyone using a stock-picking “system” like technical analysis has fallen prey to this problem. As soon as a stock seems to conform to a pattern that has made money before, an “I-got-it” effect kicks in, making investors feel sure they know what’s coming next—regardless of whether there’s any objective reason to believe that they do. This effect ramps up with repetition. The more experience you have, the more likely it becomes that the rush you get from making money will be shifted back from the moment you actually earn it to the instant when you think you can first see it coming.

- “You’re probably 99.9% unaware of dopamine release,” says Montague, “but you’re probably 99.9% driven by the information it conveys to other parts of your brain.

If you had to wait around for things to consciously feel good, then you would never behave right and you would die.” Fueled by dopamine signals flooding up from the base of the brain, the nucleus accumbens specializes ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1230))

As Glimcher puts it: “When Fred is sitting in his living room watching the Ameritrade ticker and deciding whether to buy or sell, when someone is using the recent history of what’s happened to a stock to decide what to do next—that’s exactly what’s happening.” This is the first biological explanation of what psychologists have called “recency,” or the human tendency to estimate probabilities not on the basis of long-term experience but rather on a handful of the latest outcomes. As Glimcher’s findings show, whatever has happened most recently will largely determine what you think is most likely to happen next—even if, in reality, there’s no logical reason to assume that the recent past will have any impact on the future. (Only when a reward was extraordinarily large, as we saw in “Twain’s Gains” in Chapter Three, will the distant past carry much weight.)

Terrance Odean, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley, has studied more than 3 million stock trades by over 75,000 American households. “The average person,” says Odean, “buys more aggressively in response to recent price rises, but not just to yesterday’s big boom. What makes people buy is a combination of very recent rises and any longer-term ‘trend’ of rising prices that they might perceive.” (Odean pronounces the word “trend” with weary irony because he knows that most of what seem to be patterns in stock prices are just random variations.) A survey of forecasts by hundreds of individual investors found that their expectations of stock returns over the next six months were more than twice as dependent on what the stock market did last week than on what it did over the previous few months.

The first step is to realize how much you are governed by intuition and automatic behavior. While the reflective regions like the prefrontal cortex are also vital to the process, you make predictions about future rewards largely with the more emotional, reflexive parts of your brain. “We like to think that we’re ‘thinking’ when we estimate probabilities,” says Eric Johnson, a psychology professor at Columbia Business School, “but a surprisingly large portion of the process appears to occur automatically, below the level of consciousness.” That’s why it’s so vital to put sound… ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1329))

An ideal way to handcuff yourself is “dollar-cost averaging,” a strategy offered by many mutual funds, which enables you to invest a fixed amount every month with a safe, automatic electronic transfer from your bank account. That way, you can’t stay out of the market on a hunch it’s going down, or fling all your money at the market on a guess that prices are about to soar. Buying a little bit every month keeps you from acting on the whims of your reflexive brain, and it commits you to building wealth over the long run.

One of the best ways to improve your predictions is by training your brain to ask, “What’s the base rate?” The base rate is a technical term for the outcome you would logically expect to see in a very large sample of long-run results. But anything unusual or vivid can distract us from thinking about base rates. Psychologist Howard Rachlin explains the base-rate problem this way: Imagine that you are on a beach, guessing the profession of the people you see.

If your favorite baseball team is a perennial loser that suddenly dominates a five-game series against the team with the best record, you’ll probably expect a continued comeback—but, based on long-term averages, the worst team in baseball will win a five-game series against the best roughly 15% of the time by luck alone.

If a financial advisor or website is hawking a hedge fund, mutual fund, or other investment vehicle that “seeks to beat the market,” ask this simple question: Over the long run, what percentage of money managers outperform the market average? The answer: Over ten-year periods, only about one in three money managers will beat the market.

One of the oldest tricks in Wall Street’s book is to produce a graph of stock prices and then overlay a second graph on top of it. Then the person wielding them points out the uncanny way one graph predicts the other.

But there are thousands of stocks, dozens of market indexes, and an almost unlimited number of time periods to choose from, so there’s nothing remarkable at all about a historical chart on which one line of data appears to predict another.

Then people will bet on heads, as if the passage of time somehow makes them feel that the chance of getting heads again has reverted to its true ratio of 50?50.

They were then asked to estimate their rate of return. Roughly a tenth reported that their portfolio had gone up by 12% or less, around a third claimed to have earned between 13% and 20%, another third or so said they had gained between 21% and 28%, and a quarter thought they had made at least 29%.

But when the research team checked the portfolios of the people who claimed to have beaten the market, it turned out that 88% had exaggerated their returns.

When you watch financial TV, visit market websites, or read the financial press, you will be told that “down here in the trenches,” investing is a contest, a fight, a duel, a battle, a war, a struggle for survival in a hostile wilderness.

- Why do we feel so safe at home? The frontier between the familiar and the alien, between ourselves and the rest of the world, is incredibly narrow and near. The saliva in your mouth, for example, is so much a part of you that you take it for granted. This beneficial fluid aids digestion, relieves thirst, and helps keep your mouth clean. But what if someone asked you to spit into a clean cup, count to five, and then drink your saliva back up? Suddenly—now that it was “out there,” instead of inside your body—even a tiny sip of your own saliva would seem disgusting. A few moments and a few inches outside your mouth is all that it takes to turn an integral part of you into something alien and revolting. That’s how little time and distance there is between the comfort zone of the familiar and the ([Location 1664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1664))

If our early ancestors had not learned to steer clear of the germs, predators, and other dangers lurking outside their own bodies and beyond their immediate home ground, they would not have survived. Too much curiosity could kill the cave dweller. Over the course of countless generations, a preference for the familiar and a wariness toward the unknown were ingrained into the human instinct for survival. Familiarity became synonymous with safety. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1670))
- The Eerie Power of Mere Exposure Almost forty years ago, a psychologist named Robert Zajonc (pronounced “zye-ontz”) began a series of extraordinary experiments. Zajonc started by having Americans listen to words like afworbu, kadirga, and dilikli. Then he asked the listeners to guess whether each word meant something good or bad in Turkish. The ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1674))
- more often a word was repeated, the more likely a listener was to feel that it stood for something positive. (In fact, most of these words were nonsense syllables with no meaning in either Turkish or English.) Next Zajonc displayed Chinese ideographs to people who had no familiarity with the Asian alphabet—and found that whether they thought each ideograph represented something good or bad depended merely on how often they had been exposed to it. Zajonc dubbed his discovery the “mere-exposure effect.” ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1677))
- Being in the presence of familiar things (even when we are unaware of them) simply makes us feel better. “The repetition of an experience is intrinsically pleasurable,” says Zajonc. “It augments your mood, and that pleasure spills over anything which is in the vicinity.” Aesop had it wrong when he said “familiarity breeds contempt.” In truth, familiarity breeds contentment. You might think that your likes and dislikes ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1694))
- are conscious choices, that your preferences are based on inferences you make from studying the evidence. Instead, Zajonc’s findings show, our preferences come out of our experiences—regardless of whether they ever were conscious. Whatever we experience most often, we are most likely to end up liking.

- But Zajonc points out that sentences cannot be understood subliminally. And while repeated exposure to the word sex certainly could improve your mood, it’s unlikely to make you lust after salty crackers. The popular concept of subliminal seduction is nonsense. The mere-exposure effect, on the other hand, is real. Just as the gravitational fields of the moon invisibly drive the tides, you cannot sense mere exposure governing your behavior—but it does. “Evolutionary theory suggests that you should pay the strongest attention to something which is novel or unknown to you,” says Zajonc. “And if you keep encountering that novel stimulus over and over again and it does not bite you, then you are safe in the presence of this object. That makes your attitude toward it more positive, although you are probably not aware of that fact.” ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1706))
- Another study found that people who say they like Coke better than Pepsi cannot reliably tell which one they prefer in a blind taste test—and that the brains of Coke fans and Pepsi fans light up in essentially the same way if they drink either brand without knowing which one it is. When people see a labeled Pepsi can before they sip, the memory centers in the hippocampus region and the emotional circuitry in the reflexive brain are only mildly activated. But when people get a glimpse of that flaming red logo on a Coke can, their memory centers and emotional circuitry kick into high gear. You might think you like Coke better for the taste, when in fact you like it better mainly because it’s more familiar. Likewise, investors plunk money into brand-name stocks—precisely because the brand name makes them feel good.

- Once you understand the mere-exposure effect, it’s easy to see why 401(k) investors consistently put too much money into the stock of the company they work for. Every day, employees are bombarded by their company’s name and logo and products and services: on ID passes, computer screens, pens and pencils, memo pads, coffee mugs, key chains, baseball caps; in the parking lot, the cafeteria, the reception desk, the mailroom, the bathroom. Just as a person standing outside in a thunderstorm could not possibly count the number of raindrops that hit him, you could never consciously track all the different ways you are exposed to your company during a typical day. But they all can activate your place cells, saturating you with a sense of familiarity toward the firm you work at.

- In a recent survey, 55% of employees at roughly 100 different companies insisted that “owning my employer’s stock does not affect my attitudes and feelings.” Yet 4 in 10 felt that their employer’s stock had “about the same level of risk” as a diversified fund—even though the shares of these companies had, on average, lost nearly twice as much money as the overall market over the previous five years! The best way to explain this blindness is that the constant reinforcement of the mere-exposure effect turns company stock into a “feel-good” investment. As employees become saturated with exposures to images of their company, owning its stock generates a subconscious pleasure that crowds out the question of whether the stock is actually worth owning.

- The mere-exposure effect underlies other kinds of investment mind games, too. Professional financial analysts following the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rated “more familiar” stocks as much less risky than “less familiar” ones—even though the pros should know that the stocks you think you know a lot about can lose at least as much money as the ones you’ve never heard of. In the stock market, the shares that are most popular and familiar to investors change hands more often, and that, in turn, attracts still more attention to these stocks as they turn up in the day’s list of “most active shares.” Because of all that extra exposure, the stocks with the highest trading volume have higher returns in the short run—but, in the long term, they tend to underperform by two ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1764))

- Mere exposure helps explain why so many investors are comfortable “buying what they know,” investing in the stocks of companies whose products or services they use. Robert Zajonc, the psychologist, lives in Palo Alto, often drives past Google’s headquarters in nearby Mountain View, and is a shareholder in the company. “I think I probably bought the stock,” he admits a little sheepishly, “because Google is based right here and I use it a lot.” In other words, the man who discovered the mere-exposure effect realized only after the fact that his own portfolio may have been shaped by it. It’s easy to see why any investor would love Google stock after clicking on the website countless times every day; each additional exposure to Google’s services makes its users more familiar with it and more inclined to like it. The warm glow people get from the website casts a kind of halo over the stock price. Unfortunately, history shows that good companies do not always make good investments. Whether a stock is a bargain depends not only on how great the company’s potential is, but also on how many other people already know about that great potential. If you’ve become familiar with the high quality and growing popularity of a company’s products or services, then plenty of other folks probably already are, too. And once hordes of people like a company, it becomes what finance professor David Hirshleifer calls a “… ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=1770))
- Juanita Edwards is a bright, well-educated corporate designer who goes on vacation late every summer. On her last day at work, she takes her 401(k) money out of stocks and bonds and moves it all into cash. Two weeks later, when she returns to the office, she moves the whole thing back. “That way I know I’m in charge while I’m on vacation,” she says, “and I can relax instead of worrying that I might lose money.” Juanita suffers from what’s known as the illusion of control. Like a bowler who thinks he can roll a strike by waving toward the middle of the lane after he lets the ball go, Juanita thinks she can control the outcome with her actions. But, while she’s away on vacation, the market could just as well go up as down—meaning that Juanita is at least as likely to miss a gain as she is to avoid a loss. She’s not really in control; she has simply created the self-delusion that she is.

But the stock didn’t go up because the website recommended it.

Testing her theories on workers at two companies, Langer gave them each the chance to buy a lottery ticket for $1.

Before the winning ticket was drawn, people were asked if they would sell their ticket.

Thanks to the “I’m in charge here” feeling, we believe our own decisions are inherently better than the choices other people make for us.

What drives that sensation of “I’m on a roll”? First of all, a streak of gains makes you feel that you are “playing with the house money.” That’s the term gamblers use when they mentally divide their bucks into different buckets: the cash they started out with (which remains their “own money”) and any winnings they’ve made on top of that (“the house money”). Let’s say you put $1,000 into a stock that triples; now that it is priced at $3,000, you’ve got $2,000 of “house money.” So long as any of that $2,000 gain is left, you may shrug off any losses as a reduction of the house money—rather than a depletion of your own.

- I Knew It All Along In the waning days of the Soviet empire, when history textbooks were constantly being rewritten to cover one disgrace or another, dissidents in Eastern Europe used to joke that the past was as difficult to predict as the future. That’s true in the stock market, too. In 2002, more than 800 investors responded to a survey about the bull market of 1999–2000. Looking back, nearly half of these investors now said that the rise in technology and telecommunications stocks had “definitely” been a “bubble.” Almost a third more believed that it had “probably” been a “bubble.” So had they all sat prudently on the sidelines throughout that market mania? Not at all: During the very time when they now insisted that stocks had been overvalued, every single one of these people had eagerly invested in one of the most insanely priced telecommunications stocks in the U.S. market.

- Carnegie Mellon University, cowrote the original study. “When you hear something,” he explains, “you immediately incorporate it into what you already know. That seems like a more efficient and sensible thing to do than trying to put new information into some kind of intellectual limbo, waiting until it proves itself before you can use it. But it’s not particularly helpful if you want to go back and figure out what was the extent of your knowledge and what is your ability to predict things.” “Hindsight bias makes surprises vanish,” says psychologist Daniel Kahneman. “People distort and misremember what they formerly believed. Our sense of how uncertain the world really is never fully develops, because after something happens, we greatly increase our judgments of how likely it was to happen.” Hindsight bias is another cruel trick your inner con man plays on you. By making you believe that the past was more predictable than it really was, hindsight bias fools you into thinking that the future is more predictable than it can ever be. That keeps you from feeling like an idiot as you look back—but it can make you act like an idiot as you go forward. How does hindsight bias play out when you invest? Like this: In the fall of 2001, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, you tell yourself, “Nothing will ever be the same again. The U.S. isn’t safe anymore. Who knows what they’ll do next? Even if stocks are cheap, nobody will have the guts to invest.” Then the market goes on to gain 15% by the end of 2003, and what do you say? “I knew stocks were cheap after September 11th!” And suddenly it seems you’re more omniscient than Alan Greenspan. Or like this: Google sells its stock to the public for the first time in August 2004. You say to yourself, “Hmmm, great website…maybe I should try to buy the stock?

Along the way, however, your short streaks of luck will give you an unwarranted sense of confidence. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=2079))

- Experiments with monkeys have shown that when the odds of earning a reward are around 50/50, neurons deep in their brains emit a surge of dopamine that steadily escalates for nearly two seconds. Rewards that are highly certain trigger a much shorter, flatter response. The extra excitement that an “even gamble” generates in the dopamine system may be nature’s way of getting us off the fence.

- But you don’t want to downsize your confidence to nothing. An investor who has no confidence will never invest at all, since investing requires taking a stand on at least some of the uncertainties that the future always holds. So your goal is to be as sure as possible that you don’t think you know more than you really do. How much you know is less important than how clearly you understand where the borders of your ignorance begin.

- ”I DON’T KNOW, AND I DON’T CARE.” There’s no shame in saying “I don’t know.” To succeed as an investor, you don’t have to outsmart Wall Street at its own guessing game. You don’t need to know what eBay’s earnings will be to the nearest penny, whether energy and gold stocks will keep going up, what next month’s unemployment report will say, or which way interest rates or inflation are headed. A total stock market index fund (TSM) is a basket that holds a piece of virtually every stock worth owning, at rock-bottom cost. If you buy and hold two TSM funds—one for U.S. and one for international stocks—then you no longer need to have an opinion about which stocks or industries or sectors will do well or poorly. This way, you can win the prediction game by simply refusing to play it. A TSM fund enables you to say seven magic words: “I don’t know, and I don’t care.” Will the next great growth sector turn out to be Internet companies—or coal mines?

- CREATE A “TOO HARD” PILE. Many people think Warren Buffett became the world’s most successful investor by knowing more than anyone else. But Buffett himself believes that the key to his success has been knowing what he doesn’t know. “We have a ton of doubt on all kinds of things,” says Buffett, “and we just forget about those.” Buffett adds, “The essential principle is what [Buffett’s business partner] Charlie [Munger] calls the ‘too hard’ pile, where we put things we don’t know how to evaluate. We get to that pile with about 99% of the ideas that come our way.” So your investing workspace should have a small “In” box with a handful of ideas to consider, a little “Out” box holding another few ideas you’ve already approved or rejected—and an enormous “Too Hard” pile for everything else. (If you’re really serious about investing, tape the words “TOO HARD” to the side of a wastebasket and toss your pile in there. If you do everything on your computer, create a… ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=2132))
- MEASURE TWICE, CUT ONCE. If you’ve ever watched a master carpenter at work, you’ve noticed how little scrap or waste wood he creates—because he measures very carefully before he cuts. So, after you take a first cut at your estimates of what a stock is worth, crop them again. Behavioral finance writer Gary Belsky and psychologist Thomas Gilovich suggest using an automatic “overconfidence discount” of 25%. Apply it to both the high and low end of the range, making the upside smaller and the downside bigger. If, for instance, you think a stock is worth between $40 and $60, then crop each number by 25%, yielding a new range of value between $30 and $45. This conservative cropping will help keep you from being carried away by your own overconfidence. WRITE IT DOWN, RIGHT AWAY. Psychologist Baruch Fischhoff, who has studied overconfidence for more than thirty years, suggests using an investing diary. “Keep a record of what was on your mind when you made predictions,” he says, “and try to make those predictions as explicit as possible.” Think in probabilities, and include a price range and date; for example, “I think there’s a 70% chance that this stock will be at $20 to $24 within a year from now.” (Don’t forget to apply the 25% overconfidence discount to your price range.) Finally, spell out your investing theory by filling in the blank in the following sentence: “I think this investment will go up because—————————————————.” It’s important to document your reasons for investing before you buy. Memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus has shown that your recall of how you felt earlier can be easily “contaminated” by what happens later. If you make your diary entry after the fact, your memory of your original motivation may be affected by any later changes in the price (“I bought it at $14 because I knew it would instantly go to $15”). Tuck your diary entries away for a year. Then go back and see how accurate your predictions were, whether you tended to underestimate or overestimate, and how good your theories were. You’re not looking to see whether or not your investments went up; you already know that. Instead, you’re looking to see whether they went up for the reasons you expected. That will help you learn whether you were right, or just lucky. And that, in turn, will help keep your inner con man in check.

Nicknamed “The Mistake Wall,” the area displays stock certificates from sixteen companies—so far. “One just got hung up, and one’s at the framer’s,” says Davis wryly. “When we started it I didn’t expect it to become quite the mural it’s turned into.” One company, Waste Management, is represented on the Mistake Wall twice, because Davis not only bought it for the wrong reasons but… ([Location 2187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=2187))

Having the Waste Management certificate on the Mistake Wall kept Davis from selling Tyco International at “the point of maximum pessimism.” (Tyco went on to triple in price.)

- mistakes and keeping them in plain sight will help you avoid repeating them. DON’T JUST “BUY WHAT YOU KNOW.” Peter Lynch, the legendary manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, famously counseled investors to “buy what you know.” You can put “the power of common knowledge” to work for you, wrote Lynch, by investing in companies whose goods and services you consume yourself. Lynch, for example, bought shares in Taco Bell because he liked the burritos, Volvo because he drove one, Dunkin’ Donuts because he enjoyed the coffee, and Hanes because his wife liked its L’eggs pantyhose. What investors often forget, however, is that Lynch didn’t invest in Dunkin’ Donuts just because he likes jelly-squirting globs of fried dough. He also spent hours analyzing its financial statements and studying everything imaginable about the company and its business.

In 1992, she fell fifty feet down a rock face in Colorado, escaping catastrophic injury only because her rope pulled taut and broke her fall at the exact moment she hit the ground. And that’s not all that makes Bensman seem like a natural risk-taker. Gambling is in her blood. Her grandfather was the manager of a casino in Las Vegas; her mother grew up rubbing elbows with mobster Bugsy Siegel. Yet Bensman shuns investment risk, keeping most of her money in what she calls “boring” mutual funds and blue-chip stocks. Does it seem odd that someone who loves clinging to cliffsides and grew up surrounded by gamblers doesn’t like taking financial risk? “I’m pretty conservative, I guess,” shrugs Bensman.

- recalls then-president Andy Grove, I looked out the window at the Ferris wheel of the Great America amusement park revolving in the distance when I turned back to [CEO Gordon Moore], and I asked, “If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?” Gordon answered without hesitation, “He would get us out of memories.” I stared at him, numb, then said, “Why shouldn’t you and I walk out the door, come back, and do it ourselves?” By stepping outside themselves, Grove and Moore got the insight to see which risk was right—and the courage to take it. Intel moved out of memory chips and into microprocessors, a bold and brilliant leap that powered its growth for years to come.

- WHEN THE PRICE DROPS, RISK GOES WITH IT. Long ago, the financial analyst Benjamin Graham pointed out that most people measure what a stock is worth by looking at its price, while they judge what a business is worth by calculating its value. That leads to huge differences in how people think: “The main reason investors struggle with how to react to bad news,” says Oakmark Fund manager Bill Nygren, “is that they really haven’t figured out why they own the stocks they own. If you buy a stock primarily because it has been going up, and then it falls on bad ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEPIGE&location=2636))
- news, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that your gut instinct is to sell.” This emotional mix-up arises because once a business sells shares to the public, nearly everyone focuses on the fast-moving price of the stock and forgets about the much more stable value of the business. Thus, when the stock price drops, it seems like bad news. As BusinessWeek put it during the heart of a bear market long ago, “For investors…low stock prices remain a disincentive to buy.” But if the value of the business is solid, a declining stock price should be an incentive to buy, because it enables you to get more shares for less.

- Buying a stock without first calculating the value of the underlying business is as irresponsible as buying a house without ever setting foot inside. And you should never sell a stock without first asking whether a falling share price has made it a better investment than ever.
