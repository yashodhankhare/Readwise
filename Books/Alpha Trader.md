## Highlights
- Why will Alpha Trader help you become a better trader? Not because it tells you WHAT to think as a successful trader. Not because it gives you instructions on trading this or trading that. No, no, no. It’s because Alpha Trader teaches you HOW to think as a successful trader. And that’s what makes all the difference. It’s the only thing that makes a difference, in every game that we humans play. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=74))

- I think that Alpha Trader and Brent Donnelly are to the game of markets what My System and Aron Nimzowitsch are to the game of chess. Truly revolutionary. Truly useful. Books and authors that will change forever HOW you think about playing their games with mastery. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=88))

- Because Alpha Trader won’t only make you a better trader. It won’t only help you make more money from trading. It will make you a better player of games. Back in 1988, Iain M. Banks wrote a book titled The Player of Games, part of a wonderful series of science fiction novels that describe The Culture, a super-advanced galactic civilization. In this book, The Culture sends a representative to negotiate with a less advanced civilization where everyone’s social and political status is determined by how well they play a very complicated game. The Culture’s representative enters the global tournament himself, and despite only a few years to study a game that all of the inhabitants of this civilization spend their lives playing, he manages (spoiler alert!) to win the game. How? Because anyone can master the rules, even the intricacies of the rules, of any game. There’s nothing special in that. There’s no edge. What IS special, however, and where there IS edge comes in the very personal and very human understanding of position, informational flow, variance, risk-taking and strategic dynamics that shape ALL games. And … not to burst anyone’s bubble, but that less advanced civilization where everyone’s social and political status is determined by how well they play a very complicated game? That’s us. That’s Earth. That’s the modern human civilization. That’s the very complicated game of markets and politics and social interactions that we all play, all the time, in ways both large and small. It’s the single-most important determinant for success in our financialized and casino-fied and gamified world, regardless of where you sit or what you do in that world: are you an effective player of games? I think that Alpha Trader can help anyone – trader or not – become a more effective player of games. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=95))

- That story of the 2010 Flash Crash, just like this book, is all about the razor thin line that separates success and failure in trading. Alpha Trader is written to help you understand markets but also, more importantly, to help you better understand yourself as a trader. It is about great decisions and dumb mistakes. It is about how to be rational and why smart people do stupid things. All the time. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=203))

- Trading involves a deeply personal journey of struggle, continuous adaptation, and self-improvement. The journey never ends because whenever you think you’ve almost mastered the game, the game changes. No book can fully describe the individual path that each trader will follow, so take what resonates for you and reject what does not. I am not all-knowing. This book documents the thinking of one person. What works for me is not guaranteed to work for you. As Bruce Lee said: Research your own experience. Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless… … and add what is essentially your own. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=241))

- Good traders are introspective and self-aware In trading, the enemy is not bad luck. It’s not other traders, or the market. The enemy is not the algos or the central banks or the goldbugs or sales or your manager or the HODLers or Dave Portnoy or QE. When it comes to trading, enemy number one is you. Know the enemy and know yourself. SUN TZU I like that Sun Tzu quote for Chapter One of a book about trading because it has a cool circularity. In trading, the enemy and the self are one. You will not succeed in trading without self-awareness and discipline. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=275))

- The biggest challenge in trading is not choosing what asset class to trade, or when to buy and sell, or what percentage of your capital to risk on each trade. The biggest challenge in trading is to manage your self. You are a bundle of emotions, memories, history, knowledge, and bias. You can be smart and do stupid things. You can make a hard job impossible by making irrational and compulsive decisions. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=281))

- Now let’s look at the ideal trader. Keep in mind, this ideal trader does not exist. This is an abstraction to help you see where you are vs. the ideal. Also keep in mind that I am not the holder of absolute truth on this topic. I have decades of experience and I have done extensive research on this topic but it is possible for reasonable people to disagree about the importance of many of these personality traits as they pertain to trading success. The research is not conclusive; in fact, it’s often contradictory. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=306))

- Many people think of trading as a zero-sum game and that makes them feel optimistic. Since almost everyone believes themselves to be better than average in almost all pursuits, the thought is that if something is a zero-sum game, all you have to do is be better than the next guy to win. Wrong. Trading is a negative sum game. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=380))

- When I was day trading equities, most traders were gross positive and net negative in most periods. They could take money out of the market, but not enough to cover their brokerage, bid/offer spread and other slippage. Transaction costs and slippage are a significant drag for traders at every level. Therefore, you need a significant edge to not only make money, but also to make enough money to exceed execution, technology, and operational costs. Further, grinding out tiny profits still isn’t enough. There is so much risk and uncertainty involved in trading that for it to make any sense, you need to significantly exceed the income you could make in a lower risk profession. The bar for success in trading is high. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=382))

- Cory Mitchell of day trading firm Vantage Point Trading wrote a nice blog post on this topic1. He defined success as “producing consistent profits for multiple years” and after studying a meaningful sample size he estimated the observed success rate at Vantage Point was between 3.5% and 4.5%.

- This quote captures a few of the shortcomings of IQ, in simple language: Just to clear the air, let’s note first that whatever an intelligence test measures it is not quite the same thing as we usually mean by intelligence. It neglects such important things as leadership and creative imagination. It takes no account of social judgement or musical or artistic or other aptitudes, to say nothing of such personality matters as diligence and emotional balance.

- The Big Five Most studies of personality and its impact on life outcomes use the Big Five Personality Traits7. These are the five personality traits that dominate the literature on personality. The five traits use common language descriptors to classify people on five key domains. These five domains incorporate nearly all aspects of human personality, and extensive research shows that these five factors explain the majority of human character. The model is sometimes known as OCEAN because the five traits are: Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious) Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless) ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=489))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Each Big Five trait runs on a continuum. The five traits capture most or all aspects of human personality, and there are many facets or more specific traits that fall under each heading. Some of these traits are more relevant to us than others. For example, I want to highlight grit and self-control as critical facets under the heading of conscientiousness, because those are important in trading. Grit captures characteristics like perseverance, resilience, ambition, and the pursuit of long-term goals. Multiple studies show that grit is highly correlated with conscientiousness9 so it falls under that heading, but I think it is specifically important to trading and thus worth mentioning separately. Same story with self-control, which has a lower correlation with conscientiousness than grit, but still falls in the same bucket10. We will discuss these more later. Most research shows that the Big Five traits are fairly stable over a person’s lifetime. There is just one trait that changes significantly over the lifetime of an average person: conscientiousness. There is a steady and meaningful rise in conscientiousness as we age. Figure 3.4, made with data provided by Christopher Soto, paints the picture11. Remember though, this is an average. Averages camouflage the substantial variance within a sample. Conscientiousness evolves differently in specific individuals over time. Some people will massively increase their conscientiousness as they grow. Some will flatline their entire life or even become less conscientious.

- Some examples of how luck influences success: More than 50% of the difference in income between any human being on earth is determined by where they were born18. As Warren Buffett put it: “Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born in the United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has given us.” WARREN BUFFETT’S 2014 Shareholder Letter People born in June and July are significantly less likely to become CEOs due to the relative age effect19. Schools group children together by age, regardless of their birth month, and the cutoff for most schools is July 31. Therefore, children born in June and July are disadvantaged through life because they are younger than their classmates born in other months and are perceived to be less mature, less intelligent, and lower potential than their peers.

- How about this completely insane true story from the early days of FedEx20: By mid-July our funds were so meager that on Friday we were down to about $5,000 in the checking account, while we needed $24,000 for the jet fuel payment… When I arrived back in Memphis on Monday morning, much to my surprise, the bank balance stood at nearly $32,000. I asked Fred where the funds had come from, and he responded, “The meeting with the General Dynamics board was a bust and I knew we needed money for Monday, so I took a plane to Las Vegas and won $27,000 (playing blackjack).” I said, “You mean you took our last $5,000 —how could you do that?” He shrugged his shoulders and said, “What difference does it make? Without the funds for the fuel companies, we couldn’t have flown anyway.” People born earlier in the year outperform those born later in the year in almost every sport where this has been studied. The foreground bars in Figure 3.6 show month of birth distribution for elite youth soccer players in Europe, with overall month of birth data for the entire population as the background bars. Many simulations and studies show that luck plays an enormous role in success, especially in cases of extreme success. While moderate success can often be explained ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=585))

- mostly by skill, effort and talent, extreme success usually also requires significant good luck. While you cannot control luck, remember that effort and skill determine the slope of your life’s path, even if luck determines the starting point and variance around that path.

- disappears and the true nature of a phenomenon is revealed. A coin might come up heads 10 times in a row but it’s not going to come up heads 500,000 times in a row. A bad trader might make money 3 days in a row but she is unlikely to be profitable in any given year. A weak poker player might beat a professional in a one-hour session but he will go bust in a marathon cash game. This discussion is important because luck plays a major role in trading. It operates through multiple channels like short-term variance and path dependence. In the Flash Crash story at the start of this book, there were multiple instances where the trader got lucky and if you re-ran that Flash Crash USD- JPY scenario a million times, there would be plenty of instances where the trader came out deep in the red. What seems like luck in life is often just careful observation and the ability to capitalize on opportunity. Richard Wiseman, who has spent years researching luck, set up a variety of interesting experiments to show that luck is not really luck. In one experiment, he placed a $20-dollar bill on the ground in the path of students and found that those that self-identified as lucky were much more likely to notice and pick up the $20 bill than the others. In another study, Wiseman gave volunteers a newspaper and told them to count the number of photos inside. On the second page, in large font, there was a box that said: “Stop counting—there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” Another box halfway through the paper read: “Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this and win $250.” Those who identified as lucky took just seconds to return their answer while those who… ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=603))

- With the knowledge that these facets of conscientiousness are major predictors of life success, think about how you can improve in one or more of these areas. This will help you not just as a trader, but as a human being. This is especially true if you are young, because conscientiousness is the trait that can most easily be boosted over time. My conscientiousness score is OK but not great. I am in the 60th percentile. That said, I have put a lot of work into trying to be more organized, reliable, and persistent. Over the years, I slowly learned that personality traits are not fixed, they can be molded and improved. I probably scored closer to 35 on conscientiousness when I was in my 20s. My self-control has never been great, and it is still not amazing. I accept this and try to work around it. Here are a few ways you can boost your conscientiousness: 1. Don’t say things like: “I’m just like that” or “I’m really disorganized” or “That’s just who I am” when it comes to conscientiousness. Being organized or on time or… ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=632))

- your organizational skills and your metacognition. I learned a ton of immediately applicable information from that book, including how to keep my inbox empty. It also taught me how we have a finite supply of willpower each day and thus willpower often runs low, especially at night. And the book taught me the importance of Zeigarnik Loops22. 3. Acknowledge your willpower is not perfect and create systems to protect yourself from this weakness. Create friction in places where you engage in activities you should not. An example of friction is when people turn off their phone while at dinner to avoid checking it. By making it a hassle, you are less likely to perform the habitual or addictive behavior. On the other hand, reduce friction to reinforce desirable habits. For example, if you want to get in shape, don’t make yourself decide whether to work out or not each day. Work out every day. And go to bed in your workout gear so you have one less step to take in the morning before working out. When… ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=642))

- Set specific and realistic short-term action goals. Instead of saying: “Man, I need to get in shape.” Say: “This month, I’m going to eat zero potato chips and work out 15 times.” 5. Break long-term or difficult tasks into smaller chunks and focus on doing one chunk at a time. Writing a book is daunting. Writing a few pages is not. If you focus on writing a few pages each day, a few months later you magically have the rough draft of a book. Same thing in trading. Try not to focus on your YTD P&L too much. Come in each day and do your best. Each year is only around 250 trading days. Take them one at a time and do your very best each day. Let the YTD P&L take care of itself. 6. Make lists. Do not expect yourself to remember everything, even if you have an excellent memory. Outsource your memory to a notes app or a piece of paper. 7. Be on time. Even if you don’t care about punctuality, many people do. It is rude to show up late for meetings, events, or dinner. It is sloppy and unprofessional to submit work after a deadline. Even if it doesn’t bother you when others are late, forget about your own preferences. Your values around this topic are not the most important thing. Understand that punctuality is part of becoming a more considerate, thoughtful, and conscientious person. It is not OK to say “that’s just who I am.” 8. Adopt a continuous improvement mindset. You don’t need to make huge changes all the time. Instead, be on the constant lookout for tiny improvements you can make that don’t require Herculean effort. I try to do this with my daily newsletter, AM/FX. I will look at my charts and see if there is a way to display them a bit more clearly. I will think of new features that might appeal to different readers. I will ask my readers what they like and don’t like and try to keep evolving the product through subtle improvements. 9.

For example, highly intelligent people suffer more from confirmation bias than less intelligent people. This is why experts often underperform laymen in tasks where one would expect the expert to outperform.

- System 1 vs. System 2 thinking The two systems concept was developed by Daniel Kahneman and is a major topic in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow”. System 1 (thinking fast) executes quickly without much thought. It is your lizard brain. It tends to be biased because it relies on speed, shortcuts, and heuristics. Speed sacrifices accuracy. System 2 (thinking slow) requires conscious effort and thought and is less biased. System 2 is more rational than System 1. Rational thinkers use System 2 more than System 1; they substitute methodical assessment for gut feel. If they use System 1, they follow up and double-check with System 2 afterwards before acting. System 1 is the crazy kid inside you. System 2 is the adult in the room. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=763))

- Numeracy Rational thinkers understand numbers. Rational thinkers understand probability. Irrational thinkers overestimate the chance of low probability events and underestimate the likelihood of high probability events. Irrational thinkers are often fooled by randomness and do not understand the human bias toward seeing patterns where none exist (apophenia). Rational thinkers are not influenced by how a problem is framed. If someone tells you there is a 1% chance you will die if you go skydiving, or they tell you there is a 99% chance you will live, you should feel the same about skydiving. In reality, the framing of the information matters and people are more likely to avoid the 1% chance of death and give the thumbs up to the 99% chance of living.

- Logic Rational thinkers act logically and consistently. Rational thinking shows consistent preferences. If you like A better than B and B better than C, you should like A better than C. There are many real-world examples where people don’t follow this logic. Experiments show that many people do not have consistent preferences and will say they like (for example) bacon more than Skittles and Skittles more than Doritos but will then say they like Doritos more than bacon. This is not rational. Biased, irrational thinkers overweight short-term gains and overreact to recent or intense stimuli. When trading news, be aware of recency bias and don’t overweight some random news item just because it’s yelling at you in RED ALL CAPS on Bloomberg. Rational thinkers seek to understand alternative hypotheses, not just their own hypothesis. They accept evidence that contradicts their view. Irrational thinkers overweight confirming evidence and ignore contradictory evidence. Rational thinkers are not overconfident. They understand why it is funny that 80% of drivers think they are above average.

- Testing for rationality The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) measures rationality using just three questions. It is a fairly new test, invented in 2005 by Shane Frederick. Here is one of the three questions27 (the other two questions appear later in this book): QUESTION: If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? _____ minutes Did you answer 100 minutes? The correct answer is five minutes. Each machine makes one widget every five minutes. Therefore 100 machines can make 100 widgets in five minutes. Those who answer quickly use a shortcut to jump to the answer of 100 minutes. Those that use System 2 (slow down!) calculate the correct answer: Five minutes. There are other, more in-depth rational thinking questionnaires. The CRT is valid and reliable but the three questions in the CRT have become somewhat well-known and if you already know about what is essentially a trick question, you are unlikely to answer it incorrectly the second time. The best explanation for many of the deviations between efficient markets and reality come from the irrational behavior of the human beings interacting in markets. Therefore, one might reasonably assume a connection between rationality and trading. Now, let’s look at highlights from some of the most interesting research on success in trading. Research Paper 1 “What Makes a Good Trader? On the Role of Quant Skills, Behavioral Biases and Intuition on Trader Performance” (2015) BRICE CORGNET, MARK DESANTIS, AND DAVID PORTER This paper studied individual trader performance in an experimental setting. It then compared performance to participants’ measures of financial literacy, cognitive skill, behavioral bias, and theory of mind. They conclude that behavioral bias (particularly overconfidence and the failure to understand random sampling) explains trader earnings while standard cognitive and theory of mind skills are of marginal importance.

- If you are trading headlines, events, and quick reaction time trades, you can overcome the heuristic / fast thinking problem by trading in two steps. Step 1: When you see a headline or something that makes you want to act… Go ahead and act. Go to market and get set on your position. Step 2: Once you have the position on, take a step back and analyze your actions using System 2. Is this logical? Or is this a dumb idea? You need to have the force of mind to take a trade off right away, usually at a small loss, if your System 2 analysis says that your System 1 idea was wrong. This is hard because we tend to have trouble selling at a small loss and we tend to overvalue assets (or positions) we already own. Note that if you enter trades using System 1 (reacting quickly to headlines, for example) then subsequently evaluate them more fully using System 2, you need to overcome both the endowment effect and anchoring bias in order to get out of bad trades quickly. If your System 2 analysis says “this is a bad trade”, don’t wait for the price to get back to break even. Cut the position and move on. Good short-term trading involves taking many small losses. The endowment effect (a.k.a., divestiture aversion) says that when… ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=817))

This is the failure to understand random sampling. Randomly generated data creates all sorts of patterns. Human beings are hard-wired to see patterns. We see faces in sockets, animals in the clouds, patterns in randomly-generated ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=834))

- generated stock charts, and Jesus Christ on toast28. Humans see patterns even where there is often only randomness. This is why I tend to view technical analysis29 with great skepticism—technical analysis pushes us toward pattern-seeking behavior when we should instead be fighting our bias to see patterns everywhere. Our studies show that people who are immune to commonly-known behavioral biases perform the best in experimental asset markets. This is the conclusion of many studies. RQ is more important than IQ30. You are either part of the unbiased, efficient markets or you are creating exploitable inefficiency with your biased, irrational actions. Research Paper 2 “Mental Capabilities, Trading Styles, and Asset Market Bubbles: Theory and Experiment” (2016) ANDREAS HEFTI, STEVE HEINKE AND FRÉDÉRIC SCHNEIDER These researchers first did a series of experiments to evaluate participants on two dimensions, analyzing and mentalizing31. Then, they ran a typical asset market / trading experiment to see how different individuals would behave and perform. The core idea is that different actors behave differently in the market and if we split individuals into groups we might see a pattern emerge in terms of trading success. Analytical skill was measured as successful performance in mathematics, logic, and probability while mentalizing was defined as the ability to understand the mental states of others and predict their behavior. The traders were broken into four quadrants: ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=838))

- Research Paper 3 “Good Thinking or Gut Feeling? Cognitive Reflection and Intuition in Traders, Bankers and Financial Non-Experts” (2015) VOLKER THOMA, ELLIOTT WHITE, ASHA PANIGRAHI, VANESSA STROWGER, AND IRINA ANDERSON This paper looks directly at CRT vs. intuition and comes to an unambiguous conclusion. Traders score higher on the CRT and favor the avoidance of mental shortcuts compared to non-traders. They rely more on System 2 than non-traders. Furthermore, the study found that traders do not rely on intuition any more than non-traders. To quote the study’s conclusion: While traders are apparently no different in their use of ‘intuition’ or ‘gut feeling’ to other people, the majority of them are markedly improved in their propensity to engage in reflective thinking and less susceptible to ‘cognitive impulsivity’. The study also says that some would argue that high CRT scores… ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=858))

- “Trader Personality and Trader Performance: A Framework and Financial Market Experiment” (2008) ARJEN VAN WITTELOOSTUIJN AND KATRIN MUEHLFELD This paper involves an asset market trading experiment where results are compared to six personality traits: Locus of control, maximizing tendency, regret disposition, self-monitoring, sensation seeking and type A/type B behavior. The primary conclusion of the paper is that those who trade less and those who work limit orders (i.e., act like market makers, not price takers) outperform those who trade more frequently and cross more spreads using market orders. The findings are consistent with many other papers and investigations which show that overtrading leads to worse performance33. The main driver of the underperformance from trading too much is transaction costs, but even in experiments where there are no transaction costs, the subjects that trade most perform worst. Good traders wait for outsized opportunities, they don’t trade frenetically, reacting to every bit of flickering price action. I say this as someone who must fight not to react to every bit of flickering price action. While high CRT was a consistent variable in predicting the earnings of traders in many studies34, the results of experiments and research on softer skills like Theory of Mind are mixed. For every research paper that found a positive connection between mentalizing or Theory of Mind and trader earnings, there was one that suggested the opposite35. My conclusion is that it is absolutely clear from the research that rational thinking is the number one trait of a successful trader. High intelligence, numeracy and financial literacy are also important. Trading with gut feel, intuition and similar soft skills is less important, and sometimes counterproductive. Yes, gut and intuition can be the subconscious processing of reams of information, an amalgamation of disparate data and knowledge. It is common for people to know something without knowing how they know it. Then again, gut and intuition are often just the way fear, bias and other bad influences make… ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=870))

- Independent thinker Important: An independent thinker is not someone who is contrarian all the time, disagrees with everyone, or loves playing devil’s advocate. That is not independent thinking; that is reflexive opposition. That is not good! Independent thinking means that you analyze information using your own framework and come to logical conclusions. You develop your own beliefs, incorporating as much information as possible. “Information” can include the curated beliefs of others. Sometimes your conclusions agree with the crowd and you hop on the trend. Sometimes you are on the other side of consensus, so you take a contrarian view.

- part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that point in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result. This sounds a lot like Bayesian updating, right? Start with a prior and update it as you get more information. It also sounds a lot like my discussion earlier of how to trade headlines with a “Ready, Shoot, Aim” approach. You react, using your System 1 or gut instinct, then you quickly analyze your action and look for confirming or (most critically) contradictory evidence. You look not just at your chosen hypothesis, but other competing ones.

Send an e-mail to a few traders you respect with your thesis laid out in one or two paragraphs. If you are an introvert, don’t feel like you have to remain an introvert forever. Push yourself to make new connections. I was a shy kid and pretty insecure in high school. I never liked meeting new people and I would consider myself an introvert by nature. I changed over time, though, as I saw the benefits of reaching out to people and making new connections and moving out of my comfort zone. When you send your thesis out into the wild, the responses will inform you, not just by their content, but also by their tone.

- The book Psychology of Intelligence Analysis by Richards J. Heuer, Jr. is the best elucidation of good thinking I have read. The author worked for the CIA for 45 years in various roles including operations, counterintelligence, and intelligence analysis. The book explains how human bias impedes clear thinking. Much of it applies directly to trading. The book is out of print but fortunately it is freely available on the CIA’s website. Of particular relevance is “Part Two: Tools for Thinking”, especially “Chapter 8: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses”. If you want access to the full buffet of information, I suggest you read the whole book: it’s less than 200 pages and it is not boring! If you want the quick meal, at least read Chapter 8. For now, here’s an appetizer… My synopsis of Heuer’s summary of Chapter 841. STEP-BY-STEP OUTLINE OF ANALYSIS OF COMPETING HYPOTHESES 1. Identify the possible hypotheses to be considered. Use a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities. 2. Make a list of significant evidence and arguments for and against each hypothesis. 3. Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and evidence down the side. Analyze the “diagnosticity” of the evidence and arguments— that is, identify which items are most helpful in judging the relative likelihood of the hypotheses. 4. Refine the matrix. Reconsider the hypotheses and delete evidence and arguments that have no diagnostic value. 5. Draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Proceed by trying to disprove the hypotheses rather than prove them. 6. Analyze how sensitive your conclusion is to a few critical items of evidence. Consider the consequences for your analysis if that evidence were wrong, misleading, or subject to a different interpretation. 7. Report conclusions. Discuss the relative likelihood of all the hypotheses, not just the most likely one. 8. Identify milestones for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course than expected.

- Be thoughtful and look at alternative hypotheses with an open mind. Lay out the arguments against your view and see how you feel about them. Do they make sense? Are they easily refuted? Be aware that when you are in a position, you are not objective. You are under the influence of bias when you are in a trade. You own something (the trade and the view that led to it) and people don’t like giving up what they own. Therefore, if you are feeling uncomfortable about a position, the best bet is to take it off. Then, once you’re flat, you can analyze with an open, unbiased mind. As I state in my first book42: Rule #7 of FX Trading: Flat is the strongest position. When in doubt: Get out. It is easier to honestly evaluate competing hypotheses when you are flat, open-minded, and flexible. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=1131))

- There is a particular level of P&L where I know I tend to get sloppy so I use conditional formatting in my P&L spreadsheet to create an alert. The month-to-date cell turns orange as the “I’m doing too well” level gets close and then the cell turns red once the overearning threshold is crossed. For me, trading well seems to lead to more good trading up until a point and then eventually I hit a point of overconfidence/sloppy trading which sometimes leads to a big drawdown. This phenomenon is also called “Winner’s Tilt”. Tilt is usually a condition associated with traders or poker players that are losing or on a run of bad luck. They go on “tilt” which means they start chasing with bad cards in bad situations because their minds are flooded or they are seeing red. In contrast, Winner’s Tilt is another way of describing the house money effect: temporary madness brought on by a series of winning trades or winning days.

- A good trading process usually involves some sort of written trade plan. It is not always practical to completely write up a trade before you put it on, given that short-term trading often requires quick thinking and rapid execution. That said, once you have the trade on, you usually have plenty of time to write it up afterwards. By doing so, you justify the trade, you game plan it and you may find out that the trade was a dumb idea before you get stopped out. Have the flexibility to get right back out of a trade if you realize as you write it up that the idea is weak.

Once you have a position on, let it breathe. Price action is mostly meaningless. Staring at the screen ups the amount of stimulus you receive each day and may lead to excess action.

- Set a maximum number of trades per period. This needs to be logical and based on your trading history. Answer this question: When I am trading well, how many trades do I execute per day or per week? Then set a maximum that you feel is close to optimal. A lower number forces you to be more selective (and tight/aggressive). On the other hand, your returns will suffer if you set the limit too low. Market conditions should be the primary determinant of when and how much you trade, but a maximum trades figure anchors you around the appropriate level of activity.

- While Kahneman and Tversky tend to be the names we most associate with behavioral bias, confirmation bias was discovered by British psychologist Peter Wason. His experiment was simple. He gave subjects the series: 2-4-6, then told them it satisfied his Pattern Rule. He then told subjects they could construct other sets of three numbers to test their assumptions about the Pattern Rule. Each time the subject showed the experimenter their three numbers, the experimenter would tell them whether or not it satisfied the Pattern Rule until the subject was confident they figured out the rule. Subjects would test either a series like 8-10-12 (satisfies rule) and 22-24-26 (satisfies rule) or 3-6-9 (satisfies rule) and 5-10-15 (satisfies rule) or 4-8-12 (satisfies rule) and 10-20-30 (satisfies rule) until eventually most would answer that the Pattern Rule is either: Count up by 2’s Count up by a multiple Some formula like add the first two numbers to get the third number. But whatever answer people came to, they tended to get an idea and then test it over and over until they were certain it was right. What they did not do, generally, was try deliberately-wrong sequences to see if those might work. The actual Pattern Rule was “any three numbers that increase in value”. Anyone that tested 1-2-3, for example, would have instantly ruled out all three patterns listed above. But subjects were always busy testing patterns that fit their rule without ever thinking to test those that did not. Instead of looking for more and more evidence that their hypothesis was correct, they should have tried sequences that did not fit their hypothesis, in an attempt to invalidate it.

- To succeed in trading, you can’t just be smart. You also have to be rational. You have probably spent most of your life getting smarter. Now it’s time to train yourself to be more rational. To quote from an article titled “Why Intelligent People do Foolish Things”84: The absence of knowledge in areas important to rational thought creates a mindware gap. These important areas are not adequately assessed by typical intelligence tests. Mindware necessary for rational thinking is often missing from the formal education curriculum. It is not unusual for individuals to graduate from college with minimal knowledge in areas that are crucial for the development of rational thinking. Everyone, including you, suffers from confirmation bias. ([Location 3150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3150))

- In markets, there is another reason why price reverts to the mean. Extremely low or high prices change the supply and demand profile for the asset. If oil goes to $100, new rigs come on board and increase supply and this pushes the price lower. If oil goes to $20, people buy more fuel-guzzling trucks because gas is cheaper. This increase in demand for gasoline pushes oil prices back up. If the price of corn triples, companies will substitute other commodities that are cheaper. And so on. Watch for changes in supply and demand in your market after large price changes. Are medium or long-term sellers or buyers entering the market to take advantage of high or low prices? This change in participant behavior can mark the beginning of the end of a trend. The number one input into almost every forecast is the current level and trend of the asset. There are notable exceptions, such as the fact that everyone has been (mostly) calling for higher US yields despite a 40-year trend lower, but generally you will see that when something is going up, it is forecast to go up more and when something is going down, forecasters expect it to keep going down. Extrapolation bias is a form of recency bias. Humans tend to overweight more recent information in most analysis simply because that information is more available (i.e., top of mind). Events from years ago are harder to remember and incorporate. This is why you see analysts put out bullish predictions for oil when it’s trading at $100 and bearish predictions for oil when it’s trading at $25.

- The more asymmetric (lotto-like) the payout, the more likely traders, investors, gamblers (and regular folk) will overbet the longshot. There are three main reasons for the existence of favorite / longshot bias: 1. The marginal utility of a large win is often higher than the marginal utility of a small win, even if the odds of the small win are near 100%. With a fixed amount of capital at risk, small payoffs don’t really “move the needle” financially or psychologically. Say you are a hedge fund manager who wants to generate a 10% return this year. You are offered two trades, both risking 5 bps if wrong: Trade 1 has an 80% chance of making 5 basis points (expected value = +3 bps) and Trade 2 has a 5% chance of making 80 basis points (expected value = -0.75 bps). Even though Trade 1 is clearly more attractive mathematically, many traders (whether they will admit it or not) are more attracted to Trade 2 because it moves the needle for their YTD P&L while the first one does not, unless they place a huge bet. 2. Betting on favorites is not as fun as betting on longshots. Bettors and investors looking for excitement or stimulation prefer longshots. 3. Human beings tend to overestimate the likelihood of lower-probability events and underestimate those with higher probability (see Figure 7.7). Keep this in mind when assessing odds. If you think something is a 5% shot, you are probably too high. If you think something is an 85% shot, you are probably too low. In contrast, humans are good at evaluating probabilities in the middle of the spectrum (the 25% to 60% zone). ([Location 3246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3246))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Figure 7.7 shows a stylized curve of how research shows humans typically estimate probability (solid black line), versus how probability looks in real life (dotted line). Since estimating probability is a critical skill in trading, you must understand: It is more difficult to estimate high and low probabilities than those near the middle. In trading, the longshot bias effect shows up in language like “levered bets”, “outstanding risk/reward”, and the ever-popular “asymmetric payout profile”. Looking for asymmetric payouts makes sense in aggregate: if you are always betting $1.00 to win $0.50 in a game where the odds are not known beforehand (only estimated), it is hard to achieve persistent success. On the other hand, this preference for longshots can sometimes lead to bad trades with good optics (like those 5% one-touches that are always so hard to resist). The longshot mentality is bolstered by financial media features that shower adulation on tail risk managers in the rare moments their highly-levered insurance bets pay off. There are no stories written about the tail risk fund that bleeds for four straight years while the VIX is pinned at 12! The takeaway here is: be aware of favorite/longshot bias. Don’t get sucked in by bad trades with good optics. ([Location 3259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3259))

- When you fill your car with gas, do you sometimes have the urge to round it off to the nearest dollar, even though you are paying with a credit card? Do you get a tiny thrill watching a car’s odometer roll over from 99,999 to 100,000? For many amateur marathon runners, a finishing time of 3:59:58 is a great success while 4:00:02 is a disappointment. These are examples of round number bias. Human beings tend to pay attention to round numbers and treat them as special or more important than other numbers. OK, sure Brent… Who cares? You should.

- This is my simple four-step method for accepting or rejecting patterns: 1. Identify a pattern or relationship. 2. Generate a hypothesis. The best patterns have some sort of underlying logic. If gold goes down every day from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., maybe that is the window when gold producers sell? If you can logically explain why a pattern works, it is much more likely to be non-random and persistent. 3. Analyze the data. 4. Accept or dismiss the pattern. Anyone who took a science class as a kid should recognize this as a shortform version of the scientific method. Most patterns you analyze will be worthless. You will dismiss them and move on. On the other hand, the few patterns you find that are non-random can be incredibly valuable to your future trading.

- Turnaround Tuesday During periods of market fear, there is a common intraweek pattern that stock markets often follow. This sequence is shown in Figure 7.12.

- The most reliable part of this pattern is “Turnaround Tuesday”. This is the tendency for stocks to rip higher on Tuesday if they sold off the Friday and Monday before. It is a simple human pattern that occurs because when the news appears bad, traders get nervous into the weekend and sell some of their holdings on Friday. Then, they read all kinds of negative media reports about the big scary thing and that scares them into selling more on Monday. Investor selling pulls in momentum traders who go short on Monday. This adds to the selling pressure. Then, Tuesday comes and there is nobody left to sell. Then the shorts get squeezed and that triggers Turnaround Tuesday.

- In contrast, if you study all days after a 5% one-day drop, the average return the next day is just +0.9%. Not terrible, but nothing amazing. Second, to give you more evidence supporting Turnaround Tuesday, Figure 7.14 shows SPX performance for Tuesday vs. all other days in 2008. Note that 2008 was one of the worst bear markets in history so Turnaround Tuesday was a thing almost all year. If you traded in 2008, you probably find this chart pretty mind-blowing.

- As a beginning trader, you will no doubt hear yourself thinking “This trade feels wrong. As soon as I get to break even, I’m out.” Two problems here: Problem One: “This trade feels wrong” is not rational analysis. Unpack why it feels wrong. Is there something inherently wrong with the price action, or is the stock just not moving and you’re bored? Those are two completely different things. Often your instincts are just your impatience and emotions trying to sabotage a perfectly good trade. Problem Two: “As soon as I get to break even, I’m out” is not logical. Do you think the market cares where you got in? As if there is something magical about your entry point? If you have determined, via logic, that the trade is not worth holding onto, get out. If you have not determined you should get out of the trade, maintain your existing parameters. Every trade you put on should have a stop loss and a take profit. After that, you need a solid reason to cut the trade. Otherwise, stick to your original plan. Don’t keep recalibrating based on every emotion you feel. Emotions are fine but overreacting to them is not. Just remember: Your entry point is meaningless. ([Location 3479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3479))

- Quite often, herding is caused by career risk. It often feels riskier for a trader to go against the herd than it is for him to just follow along. Doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing is hard! It goes directly against human nature. Most people react strongly to incentives and so instead of solving for: “How can I make my investors the most money?” they solve for: “What will give me the best chance of keeping my job?” Even if they are not doing this consciously, there is a good chance their subconscious is busy doing it for them.

- How to detect and combat herding: 1. Embrace independent thinking. Humans are built to conform: fight this instinct and make confident, independent judgments while staying humble at the same time. This is not easy! 2. Get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. Humans are social animals that find comfort from doing what others do, and success in trading requires you to go against that instinct somewhat regularly, so successful traders are going to feel uncomfortable a fair amount of the time. Get used to feeling uncomfortable. 3. Study and quantify sentiment. Sentiment data is widely available and comes in all shapes and sizes. We’ll talk sentiment in Chapter 10. Whatever asset you trade, investigate the best ways to collect and analyze sentiment data. While it’s great to listen to the market noise and try to come up with your own view on sentiment, data usually beats anecdote. This is especially true in our current world where people on Twitter are constantly calling for the end of the world and bitcoin to one million. Data is much more useful than randomly-collected snippets. ([Location 3598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3598))

- 4. Use overbought and oversold indicators. My experience with over-bought and oversold indicators is that your threshold for putting on trades should be as extreme as possible. I like signals that come up a few times per year, such as Jake Bernstein’s Daily Sentiment Index below 10 or above 90. The reason is that sentiment is not extreme most of the time. Sentiment that is rather bullish or kinda bearish means nothing. The market will spend most of its time in the space where sentiment has no predictive value. In fact, sentiment is a “go with” most of the time. The only time it’s contrarian is at the mega-extremes. But if you can identify these mega-extremes, you can hit some huge winners. 5. Always be on high alert for turns in sentiment. If you ever notice bullish sentiment at the low or bearish sentiment at the high: pay attention. Generally, sentiment almost always follows price. If something is going up, people will be bullish. If the price is falling, most people will be bearish. There are exceptions (many are always bearish the stock market, even when it’s at the highs) but in general, that’s how sentiment works. Very rarely, though, you will see the opposite and those moments are meaningful. A prime example is the US dollar in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a liquidity crisis and ([Location 3608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3608))

- there was a mad scramble for dollars. The Great Dollar Shortage drove EURUSD from 1.1300 to 1.0800 in very short order (stronger dollar, weaker euro). Then, the Fed went all-in, announcing a massive QE and dollar liquidity program. Due to ongoing pressures in emerging markets and equities, though, the USD remained in demand. At that time, you could see a subtle but important change in sentiment happening. The market, which had been raging bullish USD, started to think about the future impact of all this new USD liquidity and sentiment slowly turned from bullish USD to modestly bearish USD. But the USD was still at the ding dong highs! This is a rare but extremely high EV setup. If you notice a subtle shift away from a popular narrative, but the price hasn’t moved yet, get ready to go the other way. Often price will lag sentiment. A market that is bullish on the lows or bearish on the highs is getting ready to turn. 6. Stay objective.

- those who constantly stick to the same view tend to be locked in and plagued by confirmation bias. One of the best financial-market-guru business models is to pick a view (hopefully a popular one) and pound the table on it year after year. You attract a following of like-minded people and you deliver the echo chamber that they need to reinforce their views. And they will pay you for it. This is not analysis or forecasting, it’s marketing. Be aware when you receive information from people like this; they will never change their view and as such their view is probably not worth much. Good analysts will change their view (at least once every few years!) Good marketers will stick to one view and beat it until they have paid off the summer house in East Hampton. Don’t go on Twitter and see 400 bearish stock market posts and conclude that the market is short. It might be; it might not be. Collecting anecdotal information can be extremely useful but you need to know the bias of the source. Data is always better than anecdotes so look for objective sources of sentiment and positioning data and focus more on those than what you consume via traditional or new media.

- Identifying something as a bubble just frames the volatility to expect (high) and lets you know you should use your imagination when setting upside and eventual downside targets. It also tells you that the endgame is a high-speed collapse of 75% to 90% off the ultimate high. It does not mean you just go short and collect the free money. In fact, it’s often easier to make money long a bubble, not short. So what do we do? Identify bubble assets that you own and find a moving average or other technical signal that will tell you when to get out. Bitcoin had already rallied from $300 to $3,000 when people called it a bubble. Then it went from $3,000 to $20,000. Missing the last leg of a bubble can be costly. Shorting the last leg of a bubble can be deadly. In the 2017 bitcoin rally, the 100-day moving average defined the trend the whole way up. Fit a moving average to the current price trend of whatever bubble assets you own and liquidate on a daily close below. Remember that it’s OK to be long during a bubble. It’s also OK to be short! I worked at a day trading firm 1999/2001 and the people that went bust in that period mostly fell into two categories: 1. People that believed religiously in the future of the internet and the unlimited upside of the internet stocks and lost all their money trading from the long side.

But they couldn’t hang on long enough and both had to liquidate and find “real” jobs in mid-2001. The people that did well in 1999/2001 were the most flexible and open-minded. We never got married to a side. We didn’t think the bull market was dumb and we didn’t think the internet was a world changing miracle.

There is an endless series of buys and sells going through the market and the overwhelming majority of those buys and sells have no particular edge or informational advantage. It could be a guy selling to pay for his divorce. It could be an asset manager reducing risk before she goes on vacation.

- Journalists are often storytellers, not traders or financial professionals. They are always trying to make up stories to explain moves that are often driven by non-macro factors like flow and positioning. There are many excellent finance journalists but there is also the obligation for the financial media to tell a story based on fundamentals and macro when often that is not the driver of a market move. You will never see a headline like “USDCAD rallies as macro portfolio manager stops out of huge short because he’s going on vacation.” If this is the reason USDCAD rallies, journalists will fabricate some sort of narrative that seems to fit in hindsight. That’s their job! Overall, you should be extremely skeptical of most articles in the financial press. They are not intentionally false, but they are biased almost exclusively to trying to fit a macroeconomic explanation even when short-term moves in markets are often explained by other factors.

- One way permabears justify imminently lower equity prices is by referencing the bond market. If yields are going up, that’s bad for earnings, bad for margins, bad for borrowers, bad for severely indebted sovereigns, etc. If yields go down, it’s “What do bonds know!?” or “The rates market don’t lie!” The relationship between stocks and bonds is fluid and for most of my lifetime, stocks have been going up and bonds have been going up. This is not to say it will go on forever, only to say that stock market bears need better reasons than “yields are going up” or “yields are going down”. In times of plentiful liquidity, it is perfectly logical for both stocks and bonds to go up, up and away. ([Location 3748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=3748))

- Bears sound smarter than bulls Research shows conclusively that humans perceive people who present negative or pessimistic opinions as more intelligent than those who express positive or optimistic opinions. Bearish analysts are viewed as “cutting through the noise” while bulls are often viewed as naïve fanboys banging pompoms together on CNBC. Strangely though, the path of human progress is an undeniable upward trend. As Deirdre McCloskey put it: … pessimism sells. For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell, and become huffy and scornful when some idiotic optimist intrudes on their pleasure. Yet pessimism has consistently been a poor guide to the modern economic world93. Similarly, stocks mostly go up, most of the time. Morgan Housel put it like this94: In investing, a bull sounds like a reckless cheerleader, while a bear sounds like a sharp mind who has dug past the headlines – despite the record of the S&P 500 rising 18,000-fold over the last century. Yet many of the best-known Wall Street pundits are persistently pessimistic and many of them have been around for decades. Think of all the famous bears in finance.

These are all incredibly smart guys who do amazing analysis that mostly points to an imminent large-scale bear market. And yet the evidence shows these forecasts are almost always wrong. Why do we keep reading their stuff? Because it sounds really smart! The forecasting business has very little accountability and is mostly about marketing and sounding smart, not accuracy. These permabears are famous and they are highly paid. How is this possible when stocks have spent most of their time in a bull market since 1980? If you always call for a bear market, and then one happens, were you right? Answer: it doesn’t matter. Pessimism sells, even if it’s the wrong view most of the time. When you read a “crash is imminent!” piece ask yourself: is the author preying on my inherent negativity or is she actually providing useful and actionable analysis supported by a verifiable track record?

- There are, however, many examples of persistent, non-random seasonality and price patterns. The Halloween Effect, more commonly known as “Sell in May and Go Away” has been in existence for more than 300 years and has worked out-of-sample for decades after it was discovered. It is almost impossible to dismiss this effect as an artifact of randomness. It is far too persistent. If a pattern is persistent, then we try to explain it. In the case of “Sell in May and Go Away”, the explanation could be a pattern of human optimism where we start the year optimistic, eventually overshoot, pull back from that bit of irrational exuberance, then rally into year end. Similarly, there are micro patterns of seasonality and repetition that make sense and repeat for a reason. The first day of the month is a day when a big lump of automatic contributions go into US employee 401k retirement plans. A good proportion of these contributions end up in index funds and as such the first day of the month tends to be a bullish day for stocks. Same goes for the start of the year.

- The paper “The hot hand belief and the gambler’s fallacy in investment decisions under risk”96 is an excellent summary of two ways in which investors fail to understand that most events are independent. Here is the abstract: We conduct experiments to analyze investment behavior in decisions under risk. Subjects can bet on the outcomes of a series of coin tosses themselves, rely on randomized ‘experts’, or choose a risk-free alternative. We observe that subjects who rely on the randomized experts pick those who were successful in the past, showing behavior consistent with the hot hand belief. Obviously the term ‘expert’ suffices to attract some subjects. For those who decided on their own, we find behavior consistent with the gambler’s fallacy, as the frequency of betting on heads (tails) decreases after streaks of heads (tails).

You need to have your own views and thoughts but Alpha traders are also inside the mind of the market and know what matters most to the market as a whole. This concept is best captured by Keynes’ beauty contest analogy from The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). Keynes asks us to imagine a newspaper which holds a contest where readers are rewarded for choosing which contestant will be chosen by the most other readers. The task is not to choose the most beautiful woman, but instead to choose the woman others will think is most beautiful. Sometimes that’s the same woman, but not always!

- If you have never read any technical analysis books or websites, my suggestion is that you either take 10 or 15 hours to read a bunch of technical analysis websites and watch YouTube videos about techs… Or read two or three good books on technical analysis (e.g., John Murphy’s or Steve Nison’s book120). Another great resource is the 6-part Market Profile Study Guide from the CME. You can Google it and find the PDF free online. Market Profile is a bit esoteric but I find it logical and easy to understand. Your intention while reading about technical analysis is to find 2 to 5 simple indicators or patterns that you like. Use these as your primary risk management and market screening tools. Then, you can add a few more over time. You don’t need 74 different technical indicators when you use techs to manage risk and improve execution tactics. Running 14 spreadsheets screening for every technical indicator ever invented is a waste of time. Keep it simple. Make sure you allocate enough time to strategy (coming up with trade ideas) and tactics (entry point, stop loss, etc.) Many traders find it is more fun to come up with trade ideas and do not allocate enough resources to the tactics of extracting as much money as possible from the ideas.

- SENTIMENT AND POSITIONING The market cycle is always a complex dance featuring narrative and sentiment. Sometimes the news drives the price but quite often, the price drives the news. In other words, sometimes a strong trend takes on a life of its own and unfolds faster than the story on the ground, which follows behind.

- Options markets often contain important positioning information. For example, when stocks rise and VIX rises at the same time, you know that something unusual is going on because the correlation is almost always inverted between those two. Stocks up / VIX up is a sign that the market is so bullish it is adding to upside with calls, instead of hedging the downside with puts. You can also look at the put/call ratio for a read on equity sentiment. ([Location 5257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=5257))

- therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was. Weapons change, but strategy remains strategy, on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield. I think the clearest summing up of the whole thing was expressed by Thomas F. Woodlock when he declared: “The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past. In other words, this time is not different. A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself. Learning the rules is easy. Following them is hard. Self-awareness is key. One of the most helpful things that anybody can learn is to give up trying to catch the last eighth— or the first. These two are the most expensive eighths in the world. It feels SO GOOD when you sell the ding dong highs or buy the ding dong lows but it’s not something that can be done on a regular basis. Don’t bother trying. It takes a man a long time to learn all the lessons of all his mistakes. They say there are two sides to everything. But there is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. It took me longer to get that general principle fixed firmly in my mind. I also was better equipped than the average customer of Harding Brothers in that I was utterly free from speculative prejudices. The bear side doesn’t appeal any more than the bull side, or vice versa. My one steadfast prejudice is against being wrong. In other words: be nimble. Good traders are flexible and are not biased toward a particular direction in any market. I often ask people who work for some of the legends of trading, “What qualities make that trader so successful?” Just about every time, the answer includes something like: “He is happy to change his mind very quickly” or “He can be max short one day and max long the next”. Bad traders are perma-something. Good traders are intellectually flexible. Strong opinions, weakly held. Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock ([Location 5966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=5966))

Still some of the great financiers talked hopefully at least to newspaper reporters and the ensuing rallies in the stock market gave the lie to the calamity howlers. Was I fundamentally wrong in being bearish or merely temporarily wrong in having begun to sell short too soon? This quote rang particularly true in 2007 when the market sniffed out a financial calamity very early on but many traders were too early to the trade and got shoulder-tapped before they could capitalize. For every legend of The Big Short winners, there were two or three bears who committed too big, too early and lost as they were forced to stop out near the highs. You only hear the stories of those who survive. I did precisely the wrong thing. The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it. The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out.

- The run-up trade is a phenomenon where prices move in a logical and predictable direction in the days leading up to a major event. These run-up trades are often easier to predict and monetize than the events that follow. The idea behind the run-up trade is to identify an upcoming market event and then estimate what traders will do before the event. If AAPL earnings are coming up this week, which way are traders likely to play it? If non-farm payrolls are a few days from now, what might the market do in the days leading up to the release? The run-up trade is usually a function of three things: 1. Positioning: Medium-term traders, investors and systematic strategies tend to reduce risk into major events. They do this because volatility tends to be higher and more difficult to predict through events. If they are sizing their bets using forecast volatility (which most do, because that makes sense), they need to reduce their exposure as high-vol events near. If everyone is long, expect prices to fall in the run-up to the day of the event. 2. What is the obvious trade? Quite often, the obvious trade works! Plus, traders feel stupid missing obvious macro catalysts so they will tend to position for them in advance then take them off quickly if they do not materialize. If the US economy has been hot, the Fed is thinking about hiking rates, and most indicators point to strong job growth… Expect bonds to sell off in the days leading up to the jobs report as traders get set for a blockbuster figure. 3. What is the lotto ticket trade? If a biotech company is announcing Phase 1 results on Friday morning and it looks like a good result could cause the stock to triple while a bad result will cause it to drop 20%… Expect the stock to rally into the news, even if the probability of a positive outcome does not justify the trade from an expected value point of view. Asymmetrical bets will always attract speculators, even if they are bad trades with good optics. So the run-up trade ahead of an event will often be driven by speculators putting on lotto tickets beforehand. Sometimes, all three factors above will apply: that’s a top-quality run-up trade. When you catch a run-up trade, you will be tempted to keep it through the event because you have a nice cushion by that point. Resist that temptation! It is often easier to forecast the madness of crowds going into an event than it is to forecast the outcome of the event itself. Furthermore, the very fact that you caught the run-up trade means the security has moved a fair bit already into the event and thus it is probably getting crowded in that direction and offers asymmetric risk/reward (in a bad way).

- Everybody’s bearish and nobody’s short Sticking with the topic of events, there is a subtler way that upcoming events can influence markets. Often, when a major risk event is coming up, risk managers and traders lean on the conservative side until it is out of the way (due to gap risk and concerns about extreme volatility). They reduce their risk as the event nears, regardless of their view. Once the event passes (regardless of the result), risk appetite returns to normal and a move that probably should have happened before the event happens afterwards. Speculators put on the trade they wanted to have before, because now that the event (and associated gap risk) is out of the way, it’s safe to do so. This is one of my favorite setups. When there is a strong consensus view but no positioning to match the view, you often see highly impulsive moves. Once the event passes, the consensus move is free to unfold at high speed. Often the event itself contains no new information, it is simply the passing of the event (and thus the elimination of gap risk) that allows the move that should have happened earlier to happen now. This setup is powerful and has a high expected value, so watch for it. ([Location 6136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=6136))

The more you read and study your market, the more you will learn about, identify and backtest these types of patterns. Here are a few examples: Stocks trade poorly from September 16 to October 9 then rip higher into year end This seasonal is well-known and persistent. The worst week of the year for stocks has been the week after options expire in September (the week after the 3rd Friday of September). September 21-25 is the 5-day window in which you had the least chance of making money long US stocks from 1990 to 2020. Figure 12.2 shows the chart.

- Month-end dollar effect On the morning of the last trading day of the month, European pension funds execute massive rebalancing trades. Any month that saw significant moves higher in US equities will see large USD selling by pension funds as 4 p.m. approaches while any month where US equities tumbled will see large USD buying. This pattern has existed since at least 2005. It does not work every time (nothing works every time) but it is about as reliable as patterns get. This hedging goes the opposite direction of stocks and only matters when US equities have moved meaningfully during the month. Here is why it happens: imagine a foreign holder of US stocks who owns a billion USD of S&Ps and is short one billion USD to hedge the position. If stocks rally 10%, he now has 1.1 billion of stocks and 1.0 billion of USD hedges. So he needs to sell 0.1 billion ($100 million) USD to rebalance his hedges. These asset managers are benchmarked to 4 p.m. London on the last day of the month so activity peaks at that time as managers attempt to match the benchmark rate. The huge volumes going through on the last day of the month create some large and often illogical moves and these dislocations can create significant patterns and opportunities for astute traders.

- Highs and lows are more likely on round numbers than on other numbers I explained this in the section on Round Number Bias. If you are looking for an optimal entry point and there is a major round number nearby, that’s helpful. Bankrupt stocks usually rally on the open When stocks re-open after being halted for a bankruptcy announcement, that is often the ideal time for shorts to take profit. This is because once a stock trades sub-$1.00 after beginning bankruptcy proceedings, it can take months or even years before the stock is zeroed out. It is not worth it for speculators to stay short all that time where the is so little juice left in the trade. This is kind of a ridiculous trade given you are buying the shares of a bankrupt company but it doesn’t always have to make sense. Often, buying the shares of a bankrupt company when the stock reopens after the halt for the bankruptcy announcement can be highly profitable as a short-term (1 day to 1 week) trade. The patterns I have described are just the tip of the iceberg. As you gain expertise in your market and watch markets in general over the years, you will discover more and more patterns. Remember that if you can explain a pattern, and why it should continue to repeat, there is a much higher likelihood that pattern will be useful for trading. Random patterns that you observe or discover by data mining are quite often simply the inevitable result of the fact that random data is chock full of mostly meaningless patterns. Find patterns and do your best to explain them. Then make a rational determination of whether they might repeat in the future.

- The final step in the process is a critical one: consider alternate hypotheses. We discussed this in depth in Chapter 5 and I mentioned Richards Heuer of the CIA and his eight-step process. I said it then, and I will say it again here: you should read Heuer’s book. It’s free on the CIA website and is an excellent training manual for good thinking that will benefit you not just in trading, but in any area of life that benefits from rational thought. At this stage of the trade idea process, you need to think about the other side. If your trade idea is bearish corn futures, think about what the bulls are saying. Find research notes that are bullish corn and go through their arguments. Can you debunk them? Sometimes I read counterarguments to my view and think: “That’s pretty unconvincing” and so I remain confident in my view. Sometimes I read the counterarguments and think: “Oh crap, I totally missed that.” ([Location 6360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=6360))

- Remember that your brain is programmed to find supporting evidence that confirms your existing hypothesis. You need to work hard to fight against that programming and honestly pursue alternative stories that might make sense. A useful tool when attempting to embrace alternative hypotheses is to picture how the trade could go against you. What would that look like? What specific factors or events might derail your idea and stop you out? This helps you think about your idea from different angles (and hopefully with greater objectivity) and also gets you thinking about possible reassessment triggers. If I’m wrong… What’s it gonna look like? This is sometimes called a “pre-mortem”, as discussed in Chapter 7. Bounce your trade idea off people you respect and see what comes back. Don’t blindly defer to them or hope they agree with you. It doesn’t really matter if they agree or disagree. What matters is any new information or evidence that they offer up. If a ton of people disagree with your idea, but you remain confident about it, that can be powerful because now you know you are not part of the consensus. You have rigorously tested your idea and it is resilient to scrutiny. When someone smart gives me a good reason to doubt my idea and I can’t really refute their argument… I am happy to toss my trade idea in the trash and wait for a better one to come along. Don’t hold on to your ideas too tightly. This goes back to the idea of “strong opinions, weakly held” which I discussed earlier. You need to come up with strong trade ideas backed by significant research and multiple streams of analysis, but then have an open mind, admit error and change course if need be, as new information comes in.

- Fast markets are temporary, but changes in volatility can be more permanent. Do you know how to size your risk correctly to reflect current levels of volatility? Does your methodology respond systematically to changes in volatility? It should. For example, higher volatility means you should be trading smaller positions. Lower volatility means larger positions. Bad traders always put on the same position size. Many traders are not very good at adjusting their position size and risk management strategies in response to volatility. If S&P futures are moving 1% per day, should you have the same position size or stop loss parameters as if they are moving 3% per day? Clearly the answer is no. Actively adjust your trading as volatility changes. The easiest way to volatility-adjust (or vol-adjust, as most professionals say) is to use a spreadsheet that determines position size and stop loss parameters based on a volatility input. This does not have to be complicated. ([Location 6881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=6881))

If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that! You need to work twice as hard as everyone else if you want to get ahead. Understand the market regime and fit your trading strategy to that regime. Don’t embrace a trading style and hope the market complies with it. “Trading style” should describe your time-horizon, risk management approach and preferred analysis methodology, it should not describe the specific strategies you prefer.

- In this chapter, I offer some final thoughts on how proactive goal setting, selfawareness, and attitude shape our trading experience and impact trading success. Before we dive in, let’s start with a Chinese fable. There was once a farmer in ancient China who owned a horse. “You are so lucky!” his neighbors told him, “to have a horse to pull the cart for you.” “Maybe,” the farmer replied. One day the farmer forgot to latch the gate and his horse bolted. “Oh no! This is terrible news!” his neighbors cried. “Such terrible misfortune!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied. A few days later the horse returned, bringing with it six wild horses. “How fantastic! You are so lucky,” his neighbors told him. “Now you are rich!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

- The next week, the farmer’s son was breaking in one of the wild horses when he fell off and broke his leg. “Oh no!” the neighbors cried, “such bad luck!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied. The next day soldiers came and took away all the young men to fight in the war. The farmer’s son was left behind due to his injury. “You are so lucky!” his neighbors cried. “Maybe,” the farmer replied. I like this story because it is a great reminder that we never know how the movie is going to end. Your life is a big, long story and everything that happens along the way is driven by six heaping spoonfuls of variance. Don’t get too triggered by any specific short-term outcome.

- The weird thing about dreams though, is that once you achieve them, there is a hole where that dream once was. So for many, including me, achieving a dream can produce a fleeting sense of elation followed by a deeper existential disorientation as the thing that was pushing you forward all those years no longer has any power. A feeling of: now what? ([Location 7166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095MF9JRW&location=7166))

- The first rule of trading is: Don’t blow up. To succeed in trading, you must be rational, and you need to put in the work. It’s OK to be wrong. Variance is part of trading. Deal with it.

- Four lessons learned: Markets don’t stay inefficient forever. The NASDAQ was wildly inefficient from 1998 to 2002. If you find an inefficiency, make hay while the sun shines and then stash away as many nuts as you can for winter. Winter is always around the corner. If you are overconfident, the market will swiftly and harshly beat that overconfidence out of you. Trading can be incredibly fun. Indexes don’t tell the full story.
