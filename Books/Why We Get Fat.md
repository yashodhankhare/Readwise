## Highlights
- I will argue in this book that the fault lies entirely with the medical orthodoxy—both the belief that excess fat is caused by consuming excess calories, ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=208))

- and the advice that stems from it. I’m going to argue that this calories-in/calories-out paradigm of adiposity is nonsensical: that we don’t get fat because we eat too much and move too little, and that we can’t solve the problem or prevent it by consciously doing the opposite. This is the original sin, so to speak, and we’re never going to solve our own weight problems, let alone the societal problems of obesity and diabetes and the diseases that accompany them, until we understand this and correct it. I don’t mean to imply, though, that there is a magic recipe to losing weight, or at least not one that doesn’t include sacrifice. The question is, what has to be sacrificed? The first part of this book will present the evidence against the calories-in/calories-out hypothesis. It will discuss many of the observations, the facts of life, that this concept fails to explain, why we came to believe it anyway, and what mistakes were made as a result. The second part of this book will present the way of thinking about obesity and excess fat that European medical researchers came to accept just prior to the Second World War. They argued, as I will, that it is absurd to think about obesity as caused by overeating, because anything that makes people grow—whether in height or in weight, in muscle or in fat—will make them overeat. Children, for example, don’t grow taller because they eat voraciously and consume more calories than they expend. They eat so much—overeat—because they’re growing. They need to take in more calories than they expend. The reason children grow is that they’re secreting hormones that make them do so—in this case, growth hormone. And there is every reason to believe that the growth of our fat tissue leading to overweight and obesity is also driven and controlled by hormones. So, rather than define obesity as a disorder of energy balance or eating too much, as the experts have for the past half-century, these European medical researchers started from the idea that obesity is fundamentally a disorder of excess fat accumulation. This is what a philosopher would call “first principles.” It’s so obviously true that it seems almost meaningless to say it. But once we do, then the natural question to ask ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=209))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is, what regulates fat accumulation? Because whatever hormones or enzymes work to increase our fat accumulation naturally—just as growth hormone makes children grow—are going to be the very likely suspects on which to focus to determine why some of us get fat and others don’t. Regrettably, the European medical-research community barely survived the Second World War, and these physicians and their ideas about obesity weren’t around in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when this question of what regulates fat accumulation was answered. As it turns out, two… ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=226))

- we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells. “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat,” is how George… ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=232))

In other words, the science itself makes clear that hormones, enzymes, and growth factors regulate our fat tissue, just as they do everything else in the human body, and that we do not get fat because we overeat; we get fat because the carbohydrates in our diet make us fat. The science tells us that obesity is ultimately the result of a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one—specifically, the stimulation of insulin… ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=237))

- As it turns out, half a dozen trading posts had opened on the Pima reservation after 1850. From these, as the anthropologist Henry Dobyns has noted, the Pima bought “sugar, coffee and canned goods to replace traditional foodstuffs lost ever since whites had settled in their territory.” Moreover, the great bulk of the government rations distributed to the reservations was white flour, as well as a significant amount of sugar, at least significant for the Pima of a century ago. These were quite likely the critical ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=396))

- factors, as I will be arguing throughout this book. If the Pima were the sole example of a population that was both very poor and beset by obesity, we could write them off as an exception to the rule—the single eyewitness whose testimony disagrees with copious others. But there were, as I said, numerous such populations, numerous witnesses to the presence of high levels of obesity in extremely poor populations. The Pima were the flag bearers in a parade of witnesses whose testimony never gets heard and who demonstrate that it’s possible to become fat when you’re poor, hardworking, and even underfed. Let’s examine what they have to say, and then we’ll move on. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=400))

- This combination of obesity and malnutrition or undernutrition (not enough calories) existing in the same populations is something that authorities today talk about as though it were a new phenomenon, but it’s not. Here we have malnutrition or undernutrition coexisting with obesity in the same population eighty years ago. It’s an important observation, and we’ll see it again before we’re done.

- In the early 1970s, nutritionists and research-minded physicians would discuss the observations of high levels of obesity in these poor populations, and they would occasionally do so with an open mind as to the cause. They were curious (as we should be) and hesitant to insist they knew the answer (as we should be). This was a time when obesity was still considered a problem of “malnutrition” rather than “overnutrition,” as it is today. A 1971 survey in Czechoslovakia, for instance, revealed that nearly 10 percent of the men were obese and a third of the women. When these data were reported in conference proceedings a few years later, the researcher who did so began with this statement: “Even a brief visit to Czechoslovakia would reveal that obesity is extremely common and that, as in other industrial countries, it is probably the most widespread form of malnutrition.” Referring to obesity as a “form of malnutrition” comes with no moral judgments attached, no belief system, no veiled insinuations of gluttony ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=494))

- Caballero then describes the difficulty that he believed this phenomenon presents: “The coexistence of underweight and overweight poses a challenge to public health programs, since the aims of programs to reduce undernutrition are obviously in conflict with those for obesity prevention.” Put simply, if we want to prevent obesity, we have to get people to eat less, but if we want to prevent undernutrition, we have ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=518))

- to make more food available. What do we do? The italics in the Caballero quote are mine, not his. The coexistence of thin, stunted children, exhibiting the typical signs of chronic undernutrition, with mothers who are themselves overweight doesn’t pose a challenge to public-health programs, as Caballero suggested; it poses a challenge to our beliefs—our paradigm. If we believe that these mothers were overweight because they ate too much, and we know the children are thin and stunted because they’re not getting enough food, then we’re assuming that the mothers were consuming superfluous calories that they could have given to their children to allow them to thrive.

- other words, the mothers are willing to starve their children so that they themselves can overeat. This goes against everything we know about maternal behavior. So what’s it going to be? Do we throw out everything we believe about maternal behavior so we can keep our beliefs about obesity and overeating intact? Or do we question our beliefs about the cause of obesity and let our beliefs about the sacrifices mothers will make for their children remain intact? Again, the coexistence of underweight and overweight in the same populations and even in the same families doesn’t pose a challenge to public-health programs; it poses a challenge to our beliefs ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=526))

- So, even if you lose most of your excess fat on one of these diets, you’re then stuck with the what-happens-now problem. If you lose weight eating only six hundred calories a day, or even twelve hundred, should it come as a surprise that you get fat again when you return to eating two thousand calories a day or more? This is why the experts say a diet has to be something we can follow for life—a lifestyle program. But how is it possible to semi-starve ourselves or fast for more than a short time? As Bistrian said when I interviewed him a few years ago, echoing Bruch half a century earlier, undereating isn’t a treatment or ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=625))

- cure for obesity; it’s a way of temporarily reducing the most obvious symptom. And if undereating isn’t a treatment or a cure, this certainly suggests that overeating is not a cause. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=629))

- Now let’s think about this for a moment. The instructions that we’re constantly being given to lose weight—eat less (decrease the calories we take in) and exercise more (increase the calories we expend)—are the very same things we’ll do if our purpose is to make ourselves hungry, to build up an appetite, to eat more. Now the existence of an obesity epidemic coincident with half a century of advice to eat less and exercise more begins to look less paradoxical.* We’ve seen the problems with eating less to produce weight loss. Now let’s examine the flip side of ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=646))

- the calories-in/calories-out equation. What happens when we increase our energy expenditure by upping our level of physical activity? It’s now commonly believed that sedentary behavior is as much a cause of our weight problems as how much we eat. And because the likelihood that we’ll get heart disease, diabetes, and cancer increases the fatter we become, the supposedly sedentary nature of our lives is now considered a causal factor in these diseases as well. Regular exercise is now seen as an essential means of prevention for all the chronic ailments of our day (except, of course, those of joints and muscles that are caused by excessive exercise).

- Considering the ubiquity of the message, the hold it has on our lives, and the elegant simplicity of the notion—burn calories, lose weight, prevent disease—wouldn’t it be nice if it were true? As a culture, we certainly believe it is. Faith in the health benefit of physical activity is now so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that it’s often considered the one fact in the controversial science of health and lifestyle that must never be questioned. There are indeed excellent reasons to exercise regularly. We can increase our endurance and fitness by doing so; we may live longer, perhaps, as the experts suggest, by reducing our risk of heart disease or diabetes. (Although this has yet to be rigorously ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=656))

- tested.) We may simply feel better about ourselves, and it’s quite clear that many of us who do exercise regularly, as I do, become exceedingly fond of the activity. But the question I want to explore here is not whether exercise is fun or good for us (whatever that ultimately means) or a necessary adjunct of a healthy lifestyle, as the authorities are constantly telling us, but whether it will help us maintain our weight if we’re lean, or lose weight if we’re not. The answer appears to be no. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=661))

- But the reason these other authorities advocate more exercise is not to help us lose fat, which they tacitly acknowledge cannot be done by exercising alone; rather, it’s to help us avoid getting fatter. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=701))

- The ubiquitous faith in the belief that the more calories we expend, the less we’ll weigh is based ultimately on one observation and one assumption. The observation is that people who are lean tend to be more physically active than those of us who aren’t. This is undisputed. Marathon runners as a rule are not overweight or obese; the front-runners in marathons often look emaciated. But this observation tells us nothing about whether runners would be fatter if they didn’t run or if the pursuit of distance running as a full-time hobby will turn a fat man ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=733))

- or woman into a lean marathoner. We base our belief in the fat-burning properties of exercise on the assumption that we can increase our energy expenditure (calories-out) without being compelled to increase our energy intake (calories-in). Burn 150 extra calories every day in exercise and keep it up for a month, as New York Times reporter Gina Kolata calculated in her 2004 book, Ultimate Fitness, and you could lose a pound “if you do not change your diet.” The key question, though, is whether this is a reasonable possibility. Is it true that we can increase our expenditure of calories, burn an extra 150 calories a day, say, or go from being sedentary ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=737))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- to active or from active to very active, without changing our diet—without eating more—and without maybe decreasing the amount of energy we expend in the hours between our bouts of exercise? The simple answer, again, is no. I’ve already introduced the concept that explains why, one that used to seem perfectly obvious but has now been relegated to the dustbin of exercise and nutrition history. This is the idea that if we increase our physical activity we will “work up an appetite.” If you go for a walk or rake some leaves, take a long hike, play two sets of tennis or eighteen holes of golf, you work up an appetite. You get hungry or hungrier. Increase the energy you expend and the evidence ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=742))

- Other experts took to arguing that we could lose weight by weightlifting or resistance training rather than the kind of aerobic activity, like running, that was aimed purely at increasing our expenditure of calories. The idea here was that we could build muscle and lose fat, and so we’d be fitter even if our weight remained constant, because of the trade-off. Then the extra muscle would contribute to maintaining the fat loss, because it would burn off more calories—muscle being more metabolically active than fat. To make this argument, though, these experts ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=853))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- invariably ignored the actual numbers, because they, too, are unimpressive. If we replace five pounds of fat with five pounds of muscle, which is a significant achievement for most adults, we will increase our energy expenditure by two dozen calories a day. Once again, we’re talking about the caloric equivalent of a quarter-slice of bread, with no guarantee that we won’t be two-dozen-calories-a-day hungrier because of this. And once again we’re back to the notion that it might be easier just to skip both the bread and the weightlifting.

- We typically talk about body fat as though either we have it to excess or we don’t, a yes-or-no proposition. But this is an oversimplification of a far more complex phenomenon. Where on our bodies we get fat, and even when it happens, are important questions as well. The experts acknowledge this implicitly when they tell us that abdominal obesity (excessive belly fat) goes along with an increased risk for heart disease, but being fat on ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=974))

- the hips or butt does not. That two people overate and so consumed more calories than they expended, though, tells us nothing about why their fat distribution might be so different and, with it, their risk of dying a premature death. Why do some of us have double chins and others don’t? How about fat ankles? Love handles? Why do some women have voluptuous accumulations of fat in their breasts and others little? How about big butts? The African women who have the prominent gluteal fat deposits known as “steatopygia,” considered a sign of beauty in these populations, probably did not develop them by eating too much or exercising too little.

- It’s been known since the 1930s that obesity has a large genetic component. If your parents are fat, it’s far more likely you will be fat than someone whose parents are lean. Another way to say this is that body types run in families. Similarities in body types between parents and children and between siblings, as Hilde Bruch said, are often “as striking as facial resemblance.” This certainly isn’t always the case, just as parents and children don’t always look alike. But it’s common enough that we all know families in which fathers and sons, mothers and daughters have, in effect, the same bodies. With identical twins, it’s not just the faces that look alike; the bodies do as well. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=993))

The very notion that we get fat because we consume more calories than we expend would not exist without the misapplied belief that the laws of thermodynamics make it true. When the experts write that “obesity is a disorder of energy balance”—a declaration that can be found in one form or another in much of the technical writing on the subject—it is shorthand for saying that the laws of thermodynamics dictate this to be true. And yet they don’t. Obesity is not a disorder of energy balance or calories-in/calories-out or ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1090))

- overeating, and thermodynamics has nothing to do with it. If we can’t understand this, we’ll keep falling back into the conventional thinking about why we get fat, and that’s precisely the trap, the century-old quagmire, that we’re trying to avoid. There are three laws of thermodynamics, but the one that the experts believe is determining why we get fat is the first one. This is also known as the law of energy conservation: all it says is that energy is neither created nor destroyed but can only change from one form to another.

Because all mass—our fat tissue, our muscles, our bones, our organs, a planet or star, Oprah Winfrey—is composed of energy, another way to say this is that we can’t make something out of nothing or nothing out of something. Oprah, for instance, can’t become more massive—fatter and heavier—without taking in more energy than she expends, because Oprah fatter and heavier contains more energy than Oprah leaner and lighter.* She has to consume more energy than she expends to accommodate her… ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1101))

It says nothing about cause and effect. It doesn’t tell us why anything happens; it only tells us what has to happen if that thing does happen.

And, in fact, saying that a room gets crowded because more people are entering than leaving it is redundant—saying the same thing in two different ways—and so meaningless.

Back then, the NIH experts were a little more forthcoming, and so a little more scientific, about the factors that might cause obesity: “Obesity is a complex, multifactorial chronic disease that develops from an interaction of genotype and the environment,” they explained. “Our understanding of how and why obesity develops is incomplete, but involves the integration of social, behavioral, cultural, physiological, metabolic and genetic factors.” So maybe the answers to be found are in this integration of factors—starting with the physiological, metabolic, and genetic ones and letting them lead us to the environmental triggers.

- Before leaving thermodynamics behind, let’s clear up one more misguided extrapolation of these laws to the world of diet and weight. The very notion that expending more energy than we take in—eating less and exercising more—can cure us of our weight problem, make us permanently leaner and lighter, is based on yet another assumption about the laws of thermodynamics that happens to be incorrect.

- The assumption is that the energy we consume and the energy we expend have little influence on each other, that we can consciously change one and it will have no consequence on the other, and vice versa. The thinking is that we can choose to eat less, or semi-starve ourselves (reduce calories-in), and this will have no effect on how much energy we subsequently expend (calories-out) or, for that matter, how hungry we become. We’ll feel just as full of pep if we eat twenty-five hundred calories a day as if we consume half that amount.

- appetite) or on how much energy we expend when we’re not exercising. Intuitively we know this isn’t true, and the research in both animals and humans, going back a century, confirms it. People who semi-starve themselves, or who are semi-starved during wars, famines, or scientific experiments, are not only hungry all the time (not to mention cranky and depressed) but lethargic, and they expend less energy. Their body temperatures drop; they tend to be cold all the time. And increasing physical activity does increase hunger; exercise does work up an appetite; lumberjacks do eat more than tailors. Physical activity also makes us tired; it wears us out. We expend less energy when the activity is over. In short, the energy we consume and the energy we expend are dependent on each other. Mathematicians would say they are dependent variables, not independent variables, as they have typically been treated. Change one, and the other changes to compensate. To a great extent, if not entirely, the energy we expend from day to day and week to week will determine how much we consume,… ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1160))

- simple mechanical device. In 2007, Jeffrey Flier, dean of Harvard Medical School and his wife and colleague in obesity research, Terry Maratos-Flier, published an article in Scientific American called “What Fuels Fat.” In it, they described the intimate link between appetite and energy expenditure, making clear that they are not simply variables that an individual can consciously decide to… ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1169))

- What the Fliers accomplished in just two sentences is to explain why a hundred years of intuitively obvious dietary advice—eat less—doesn’t work in animals. If we restrict the amount of food an animal can eat (we can’t just tell it to eat less, we have to give it no choice), not only does it get hungry, but it actually expends less energy. Its metabolic rate slows down. Its cells burn less energy (because they have less energy to… ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1177))

- humans. I don’t know why the Fliers said “an animal” instead of “a person,” since the same effects seen in animal studies have been demonstrated repeatedly in humans. One likely answer is that the Fliers (or the magazine’s editors) didn’t want the implication to be quite so obvious: that the diet advice that our doctors and public-health authorities are invariably giving us is misconceived; that eating less and/or exercising more is not a viable treatment for obesity or overweight and shouldn’t be considered as… ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1181))

- There has to be a reason, of course, why anyone would eat more calories than he or she expends, particularly since the penalty for doing so is to suffer the physical and emotional cruelties of obesity. There must be a defect involved somewhere; the question is where. The logic of calories-in/calories-out allows only one acceptable answer to this question. The defect cannot lie in the body—perhaps, as the endocrinologist Edwin Astwood suggested half a century ago, in the “dozens of enzymes” and the “variety of hormones” that control how our bodies “turn ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1196))

- what is eaten into fat”—because this would imply that something other than overeating was fundamentally responsible for making us fat. And that’s not allowed. So the problem must lie in the brain. And, more precisely, in behavior, which makes it an issue of character. Both eating too much and exercising too little, after all, are behaviors, not physiological states, a fact that’s even more obvious if we use the biblical terminology—gluttony and sloth.

- Once overeating is established as the fundamental cause of obesity, blaming behavior—and thus a lack of character and willpower—is the only acceptable explanation. It’s the only one that doesn’t lend itself to further meaningful research and so, perhaps, the identification of a defect more fundamental still that would explain why people would willingly overeat if they had any choice—that is, why they really got fat.

- This left unanswered, as I said, the obvious questions: Why do people who get fat overeat? Why don’t these people control their urges? Why don’t they eat in moderation and exercise as lean people do? Well, the choices were no different in Newburgh’s era from those we’re left with today: fat people are unwilling to make the effort, they lack the willpower, or they’re simply unaware of what ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1223))

- What they chose to believe is what Newburgh insisted was true, that the obese and overweight belong in one of two categories: those trained since childhood by their parents to take in more food than needed (which was Newburgh’s explanation for the observation, clear then as it is now, that a predisposition to obesity runs in families), and those in whom “the combination of weak will and a pleasure seeking outlook upon life” is to blame. And this has been the prevailing attitude ever since, though it is inexcusably simplistic and wrong.

- is that the experts now couch the concept in ways that don’t immediately appear to have such demeaning implications. If we refer to obesity as an eating disorder, for example, as has been common since the 1960s, we’re not actually saying that the obese can’t eat like the lean because they lack the willpower—we’re only saying that they don’t eat like the lean. Maybe those who get fat are just too susceptible to external food cues, which was one common explanation in the 1970s, and not susceptible enough to internal cues, which tell them when they’ve eaten enough but not too much. This doesn’t say explicitly that they lack willpower; it suggests instead that something ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WUYOQ6&location=1236))

- about the brains of obese people makes it harder for them than for lean people to resist the smell of a cinnamon bun or the sight of a McDonald’s. Or they’re more likely to order a larger portion or keep eating it, whereas a lean person either wouldn’t order it to begin with or wouldn’t feel compelled to finish it.* By the 1970s, an entire field of what’s technically (and tellingly) called “behavioral medicine” had emerged to treat obese individuals with behavioral therapies, all subtle or not so subtle ways of inducing the obese to behave like the lean, that is, to eat in moderation.† None of these therapies has ever been shown to work; many are still with us today even so.

- is a typical behavioral treatment. Not eating anywhere other than in the kitchen or at the dining-room table is another one. Today it’s still the case that many, if not most, of the leading authorities on obesity are psychologists and psychiatrists, people whose expertise is meant to be in the ways of the mind, not of the body. Imagine how many more dead diabetics we’d have if victims of that disease were treated by psychologists instead of physicians. And yet diabetes and obesity are so closely linked—most type 2 diabetics are obese, and many obese people become diabetic—that some authorities have taken to calling the two disorders “diabesity,” as though they’re two sides of the same pathological coin, which they assuredly are.

- So long as we believe that people get fat because they overeat, because they take in more calories than they expend, we’re putting the ultimate blame on a mental state, a weakness of character, and we’re leaving human biology out of the equation entirely. Sontag had it right: it’s a mistake to think this way about any disease. And it’s been disastrous when it comes to the question of why we get fat. How should we be approaching the problem? How do we have to think about it to make progress? Those are the questions I’ll begin to answer in the next chapter.
