- - Capital returns
- - Marathon Asset Management LLP1 will shortly celebrate its 30th birthday. Over three decades, our investment philosophy has evolved, but two simple ideas about how capitalism works have always been paramount. The first notion is that high returns tend to attract capital, just as low returns repel it. The resulting ebb and flow of capital affects the competitive environment of industries in often predictable ways – what we like to call the capital cycle. Our job has been to analyze the dynamics of this cycle: to see when it is working and when it is broken, and how we can profit from it on behalf of our clients. The second guiding idea is that management skill in allocating capital is vital over the long-term. Picking managers who allocate capital in sensible ways is crucial to successful stock selection. The best managers understand the capital cycle as it operates in their industries and don’t lose their heads in the good times. We found that the kind of opportunities created by capital cycle analysis often have long gestation periods, as the timing of the pay-off was highly uncertain. As a result, we discovered that our approach has worked best when we invested in a relatively large number of stocks, holding onto them for long periods of time. This rather goes against the grain of our industry where the preference has been to hold concentrated portfolios, confirming a fund manager’s conviction in his or her ideas, albeit for shorter and shorter periods of time.
 
- Both analysts and investors are given to
 
- extrapolating current trends. In a cyclical world, they think linearly.
 
- The capital cycle turns down as excess capacity becomes apparent and past demand forecasts are shown to have been overly optimistic. As profits collapse, management teams are changed, capital expenditure is slashed, and the industry starts to consolidate. The reduction in investment and contraction in industry supply paves the way for a recovery of profits. For an investor who understands the capital cycle this is the moment when a beaten down stock becomes potentially interesting. However, brokerage analysts and many investors operating with short time horizons generally fail to spot the turn in the cycle but obsess instead about near-term uncertainty.
 
- Marathon’s earlier book, Capital Account, described the mistaken demand forecasts and overinvestment which accompanied the TMT bubble of the late 1990s. During the tech boom, many telecoms companies operated on the mistaken assumption that Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days. This forecast was used to justify enormous capital spending by the likes of WorldCom, Global Crossing and a host of long-forgotten “alternative carriers” (as the minor telecoms players were then known). After the bubble burst, the misallocation of capital was revealed and, for several years afterwards, telecoms networks were plagued with massive excess capacity (known as “dark fibre,” as much of the networks’ expensively laid fibre optic cable remained unlit.) Following the dotcom bust, a number of capital cycles appeared across a variety of industries. The global shipping industry provides a classic example.3 Between 2001 and 2007, daily rates for “Panamax” class ships rose tenfold as China’s rapidly increasing share of global trade boosted shipping demand. New orders in the shipbuilding industry are strongly correlated with daily spot rates. The supply response was inevitable if not immediate – it takes up to three years for a new ship order to be delivered. Between 2004 and 2009, however, the global dry bulk fleet doubled from 75 to 150m deadweight tonnes.4 The effect of this new supply combined with the global slowdown resulted in a 90 per cent fall in Panamax daily rates, which wiped out all the gains from earlier in the decade. An investor who bought into shipping in the summer of 2007, before the onset of the global financial crisis, would have lost two-thirds of his money. Shares in global shipping companies, such as Denmark’s Maersk Group, were down a similar amount. New ships, which had been ordered during the boom years, continued to be delivered long after the downturn. At the time of writing, the shipping industry is still suffering from poor capacity utilization and low rates.
 
- THE COMMODITY SUPERCYCLE
 
- Thus, the great commodity supercycle bears the hallmarks of a classic capital cycle: high prices boosting profitability, followed by rising investment and the arrival of new entrants, encouraged by overly optimistic demand forecasts; and the cycle turning once supply has increased and demand has disappointed.
 
- More recently, however, a number of papers have appeared, observing an inverse relationship between capital expenditure and investment returns.
 
- Modern finance theory is based on the notion that while markets are efficient, certain “factors” – namely, size, value and momentum – have historically beaten the benchmark index. Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and his colleague Ken French have suggested adding two more factors to their model: profits and investment.16 With regards to the capital cycle, Fama and French observe that companies which have invested less have delivered higher returns. This finding has been termed the “asset-growth anomaly.” A paper in the Journal of Finance reports that corporate events associated with asset expansion – such as mergers & acquisitions, equity issuance and new loans – tend to be followed by low returns.17 Conversely, events associated with asset contraction – including spin-offs, share repurchases, debt prepayments and dividend initiations – are followed by positive excess returns. The negative impact on shareholder returns from expanding corporate assets was found to persist for up to five years.
 
- This leads to a key insight of the capital cycle investment approach: when analyzing the prospects of both value and growth stocks, it is necessary to take into account asset growth, at both the company and the sectoral level. One researcher goes so far as to claim that the value effect disappears after controlling for capital investment.19
 
- A business which sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return upon its capital; this large return attracts competition; and generally speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely. Conversely in the case of a business selling at a large discount because of abnormally low earnings. The absence of new competition, the withdrawal of old competition from the field, and other natural economic forces, should tend eventually to improve the situation and restore a normal rate of profit on the investment.
 
- All this suggests that asset allocators should consider market valuation in tandem with the capital cycle. Normally, the two run together. The US stock market in recent years, however, has proved something of a conundrum. Since 2010, US stocks have looked expensive when viewed from a valuation perspective (e.g., the cyclically-adjusted price-earning ratio) largely due to the fact that profits have been above average. Yet US corporate investment has been lacklustre since the global financial crisis. With the key driver of mean reversion missing, profits have remained elevated for longer than expected, and the US stock market has delivered robust returns.22 China provides an example at the opposite end of the spectrum: stock prices have often appeared cheap from a valuation perspective, but investment and asset growth have been elevated resulting in poor corporate profitability.
 
- The market inefficiency observed by capital cycle analysis can be explained in terms of the conventional findings of behavioural finance – namely, some combination of overconfidence, base-rate neglect, cognitive dissonance, narrow-framing and extrapolation appear to account for the fact that companies with high levels of investment tend to underperform. These behavioural factors are reinforced by agency-related problems. Skewed incentives encourage both investors and corporate managers to adopt short-term perspectives which are inimical to capital cycle analysis. Rational investors are unable to impose their views on the market as the capital cycle poses a number of “limits to arbitrage.”
 
- As Yogi Berra says, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” As we shall see, this is especially the case when it comes to predicting future levels of demand.
 
- It should also be noted that capital cycles vary in length, and nobody knows in advance when they will turn.
 
- FUNDAMENTALS OF CAPITAL CYCLE ANALYSIS Marathon’s approach is to look for investment opportunities among both value and growth stocks, as conventionally defined.32 They come about because the market frequently mistakes the pace at which profitability reverts to the mean. For a “value” stock, the bet is that profits will rebound more quickly than is expected and for a “growth stock,” that profits will remain elevated for longer than market expectations.
 
- Capital cycle analysis, however, focuses on supply rather than demand. Supply prospects are far less uncertain than demand, and thus easier to forecast.
 
- From the investment perspective, the key point is that returns are driven by changes on the supply side. A firm’s profitability comes under threat when the competitive conditions are deteriorating. The negative phase of the capital cycle is characterized by industry fragmentation and increasing supply. The aim of capital cycle analysis is to spot these developments in advance of the market. New entrants noisily trumpet their arrival in an industry. A rash of IPOs concentrated in a hot sector is a red flag; secondary share issuances another, as are increases in debt. Conversely, a focus on competitive conditions should alert investors to opportunities where supply conditions are benign and companies are able to maintain profitability for longer than the market expects. An understanding of competitive conditions and supply side dynamics also helps investors avoid value traps (such as US housing stocks in 2005–06).
 
- Marathon is fond of repeating two comments of Warren Buffett. The first being to the effect that most chief executives have risen to the top of their companies because they “have excelled in an area such as marketing, production, engineering – or sometimes, institutional politics.” Yet they may not have the capital allocation skills required of managers. Such skills are essential, according to the Sage of Omaha, since, “after ten years on the job, a CEO whose company retains earnings equal to 10 per cent of net worth will have been responsible for the deployment of more than 60 per cent of all capital at work in the business.” Capital cycle analysis involves keeping a sharp eye on managers to assess their ability
 
- to allocate capital. Marathon spends a lot of time meeting and questioning managers to this effect (see 3.8 “A meeting of minds”). GENERALISTS MAKE BETTER CAPITAL CYCLE ANALYSTS Industry specialists are prone to taking the “inside view.” Having got lost in a thicket of detail, industry specialists end up not seeing the wood for the trees. They may, for instance, spend too much time comparing the performance and prospects of companies within their sector and fail to recognize, as a result, the risks that the industry as a whole is running. Marathon prefers to employ generalists who are less likely to suffer from “reference group neglect” and better able to employ an understanding of capital cycle dynamics across industries. ADOPT A LONG-TERM APPROACH Capital cycle analysis, like value investing, requires patience. It takes a long time for an industry’s capital cycle to play out. The Nasdaq started bubbling in 1995. Yet it wasn’t until the spring of 2000 that the dotcom bubble finally burst. New supply comes with varying lags in different industries. As we have seen, it can take nearly a decade for a new mine to start producing. Marathon warned of the dangers of rising mining investment back in May 2006 (see 1.3 “This time’s no different” – yet after rebounding in the wake of the financial crisis, the commodity supercycle didn’t turn down for another five years. Marathon’s long-term investment discipline, with its very low portfolio turnover, is well suited to applying the capital cycle approach. CAPITAL CYCLE BREAKDOWNS Capital cycle analysis requires patience, a certain doggedness (willingness to be wrong for a long period) and a contrarian mindset. Once the cycle has turned and overcapacity in an industry has been exposed, the progression of events appears inevitable. That’s hindsight bias. At the time, the outcome never seems so certain. Besides, on occasion the normal operation of the capital cycle breaks down. Over the last two decades, the Internet has destroyed many long-established business models – in advertising (Yellow Pages), media (newspapers), retailing (bookshops), and entertainment (music industry and video rental). Investors who underestimated the disruptive impact of new technology have lost money.35 The capital cycle also ceases to function properly when policymakers protect industries (see 5.4 “Broken banks” and 5.5 “Twilight zone”) and under conditions of state capitalism, as found in modern China (see Chapter 6, “China Syndrome”). THE TENETS OF CAPITAL CYCLE ANALYSIS The essence of capital cycle analysis can thus be reduced to the following key tenets: •Most investors devote more time to thinking about demand than supply. Yet demand is more difficult to forecast than supply. •Changes in supply drive industry profitability. Stock prices often fail to anticipate shifts in the supply side. •The value/growth dichotomy is false. Companies in industries with a supportive supply side can justify high valuations. •Management’s…
 
- •When policymakers interfere with the capital cycle, the market-clearing process may be arrested. New technologies can also disrupt the normal operation of the capital cycle. •Generalists are better able to adopt the “outside view” necessary for capital cycle analysis. •…
 
- An understanding of the capital cycle helps to identify and avoid speculative bubbles. All too often, high returns attract capital, breeding excessive competition and overinvestment. In recent years, for instance, there has been an epic burst of capital spending in the field of resource extraction. Four of the articles presented below highlight the dangers posed to shareholders over the last decade by ever rising levels of investment in the mining and the oil and gas sectors.
 
- Instability within an industry can create the conditions for improved future returns
 
- For contrarian investors, a history of poor returns in an industry can represent a potential opportunity, since cooperative behaviour is more likely to break out if companies are responding to the imperative of balance sheet repair. Just as Hyman Minsky, the US economist and author of Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, observed that financial stability is destabilizing since it leads to all kinds of excessive behaviour, so instability can, from a capital cycle standpoint, create conditions of stability.
 
- A basic industry with few players, rational management, barriers to entry, a lack of exit barriers and non-complex rules of engagement is the perfect setting for companies to engage in cooperative behaviour. It is relatively easy to identify those industries where these conditions exist currently (just look at existing returns on capital), and it is for this reason that the really juicy investment returns are to be found in industries which are evolving to this state. The joy from a capital cycle perspective is that most investors are, for a variety of behavioural reasons, taken by surprise.
 
- The cod fishing industry provided a marvellous example of the capital cycle in action until governments intervened
 
- However, the new equipment was expensive; certainly, “men of no capital” were barred from entering the industry, and those that remained borrowed heavily to stay competitive. Each individual’s financial incentive was to catch more fish to repay debts, and over-fishing became commonplace. As the price of fish declined, fishermen became caught in a “prisoner’s dilemma” and opted to land more fish. “Cod wars” broke out over rights to fish, and the industry went into crisis. The first government to intervene in the cod wars was Iceland, which asserted sovereignty over its coastal waters to a distance of one mile, then four miles, then 50 miles and, in 1973, 200 miles. The effect was to nationalize the waters for the purpose of supporting the local industry and force foreign vessels elsewhere. The governments of Canada, the US and the EU had little choice but to follow suit, and soon the North Atlantic had been carved up into four exclusive zones, with fish quotas set to restore depleted stocks. When viewed from the perspective of the capital cycle, the intervention has been a disaster. Ordinarily capital would leave the industry, productive capacity would shrink, and prices rise toward an economic
 
- rate of return. Instead, government support financed, of course, by taxes has kept industry capacity high and the price of fish low. Worse still, the quota system is administratively complex, hard to enforce, and is often flouted. The Canadian government, which is reported to have invested three dollars in the industry for every dollar the fisheries earn, has set the high water mark for bureaucratic inefficiency.
 
- Over approximately 150 years, the cod fishing and processing industry has evolved from one where excess profits were earned at the ports, then the market, then the food processors, to one where it is the consumers of fish that are the industry’s chief beneficiaries. The primary driver of the process has been the decline in the cost of technology, which has removed the excess profits earned at the pinch-points in the industrial process. It is for this reason that Marathon research focuses on not just the magnitude of a company’s profitability (the size of the pinch-point – what is the capacity of Boston’s port?) but also its sustainability (why dock at Boston at all?). The longer one owns shares, the more important sustainability becomes, and so we focus on companies that control their own pinch-point. Is Nike’s $1bn media budget high enough? Is Ethan Allen’s advertising spending sufficient? Is Invensys’ research and development…
 
- The same capital cycle process that hollowed out the profits from the cod industry can been seen throughout the economy: it has taken around 70 years from the introduction of the Bessemer Process to reach commoditization in the integrated steel mill industry, mainly through competition from asset-light mini mills. Department stores have been commoditized in 30 years by big box retailing. In semiconductors, excess profits are wrung out in less than two years. The question for investors today is how long will the same process take in media distribution, telecommunication, or…
 
- A recent brokerage report claimed that rising extraction costs – costs are said to have risen by around 30 per cent over the past two years – would ensure ever rising commodity prices, as the miners
 
- would continue to be able to charge ever higher prices. Such is the circular logic of bull markets. The rise in commodity prices has naturally attracted interest on Wall Street. Commodities, asset allocation experts claim, should be considered a vital part of every investment portfolio. Hedge funds are now commodities experts. Banks are planning to double the size of their commodities trading staff, and there are breathless reports of seven-figure, sign-on bonuses for commodities traders (who were probably unemployable a few years ago). Several investment banks have developed specialist commodity indices, which no doubt they use to sell derivative products to clients. At Marathon, we are bombarded with invitations to attend exotic conferences on specialist areas of commodities (which stand alongside invites to conferences on wind power, solar power and carbon emissions). The increasing popularity of commodity-related funds suggests that that well known trend-follower, the retail investor, is getting in on the act. A simple analysis of the economics suggests that the rapid rise in price in a number of commodities is unsustainable. Take copper, for example. The current cost of production is roughly $0.80–0.90 per pound, with the marginal cost of production somewhat above that, say $1.20 per pound. Yet the current price is $3.60 per pound, three times the cost of production (five years ago, copper traded for as little as 60 cents).
 
- It is hard not to see speculation at work, as hedge funds and other non-industrial buyers push up prices, hoping to get out before the price turns. Commodity bulls attribute high prices to supply shortages, and argue that higher prices are needed as an incentive to invest in production. All the same, one can be sure that additional supply will be forthcoming at some point.3 Indeed, mining companies have certainly responded to the pricing situation in the way that one would expect: initially they were sceptical of the price rises, but later they started investing heavily to bring on new supply. Mining exploration costs doubled between 2003 and 2005. Much of this additional spending is a consequence of having to absorb higher production costs, but not all of it. Indeed, some mining companies believe that there is enough supply coming on stream in copper for there to be a sizeable market surplus in a couple of years’ time. Supply bottlenecks do not last forever. Demand is the other part of the equation. Chinese demand is indeed growing very strongly, but it is very tricky to know just how far into the future this can be extrapolated. What we can…
 
- based economy in the future. Attempts to slow down the Chinese juggernaut could have the same impact on demand but rather more quickly. It also seems reasonable to expect that a prolonged period of elevated commodity prices will have a negative impact on demand, just as high oil prices in the 1970s forced improved oil efficiency on industry. This already appears to be happening in Germany, where demand for copper pipes is said to have halved from…
 
- As the capital cycle plays out in commodities, it is perhaps worth highlighting the outcome of another recent minor bubble: namely, that of the container shipping industry. Here, too, a couple of years back we were promised a “supercycle,” as earlier underinvestment led to a shortage of new ships, and strong Chinese growth was producing annual double-digit increases in shipping demand. Indeed, we even spotted the odd specialist container shipping conference invite. Spurred on by these “once-in-a-generation” conditions, shipping companies indulged in an M&A boom in mid-2005. Shipyards working flat out were fully booked out for years to come. Predictably, this frenzy marked the peak of the…

- A cursory analysis of the capital cycle for the commodity industry – in particular the huge expansion of commodity capital expenditure in recent years, and the precarious nature of Chinese demand for raw materials – suggests that…
 
- The bad news is that commodity industry is showing signs of a classic capital cycle peak – higher returns on invested capital are attracting more capital and higher share prices,…
 
- Thus, ever rising amounts of capital are coming into the sector at a time when commodity prices are well above marginal costs of production, even for the high cost producers. When this supercycle eventually turns, there is potentially a long way for commodity prices to fall before they reach replacement cost. This could pose a problem for benchmark-hugging investors, since the metals and mining sector – up more than three times from its 1999 low – is currently close to its all-time high as a share of the FTSE World Index.5
 
- Many commentators enthuse about a “new paradigm” for commodities associated with China’s rise. Almost all of the demand growth for commodities is due to China’s insatiable appetite for raw materials. The Middle Kingdom now consumes around half the global production of iron ore, nickel, copper and zinc. The commodity bulls, however, seem to be overlooking some troubling signs. The most obvious of these is the inexorable rise of Chinese fixed asset investment to around 50 per cent of GDP – even in Japan, with its penchant for building roads to nowhere, investment peaked at only 30 per cent of GDP. It is not surprising that much of this capital is being wasted. The Chinese industrial sector’s return on net operating assets is low and continues to trend downwards. Low profitability doesn’t stop Chinese SOEs from investing, however. In the power industry, for instance, capital expenditure is running at over 100 per cent of operating cash flow (cement and steel capex relative to EBITDA is running at only marginally lower levels). To make matters worse, all the above mentioned sectors are also over-indebted. Optimists are hoping that Beijing will encourage industrial consolidation and reduce capacity. But even if this does occur, a lower pace of investment growth in these industries won’t be good news for overall commodity demand.
 
- Investors are ignoring signs of an over-heated Chinese economy and are enamoured of a commodity sector that has attracted, and continues to attract, large amounts of capital and where supply is inexorably increasing. To our minds, all this is clear evidence that the current chapter in the commodity story appears much closer to its conclusion, than the beginning.
 
- Consolidation has improved the pricing power of the global brewing industry “Most people hate the taste of beer to begin with. It is, however, a prejudice that many have been able to overcome.” Sir Winston Churchill
 
- This encouraging process is continuing with, for example, the largest players in the UK market all having announced price rises of 4 per cent already in 2010. In emerging markets, pricing growth has been easier to achieve, in part due to the greater fragmentation of the retail channel and generally higher levels of inflation which have made it possible to hide price increases. Here, as well as volume growth, the story is one of increased “premiumization” – persuading consumers to trade up as they become wealthier. In Europe, premium lager accounts for nearly 25 per cent of the market (and 15 per cent in the US), but this figure is well below 5 per cent in most emerging market countries. A consolidated market is not a prerequisite for premiumization, but having high volumes in a market makes it more economic for a brewer to offer a wider range of products at different price points. On the supply side, there is an encouraging capital cycle angle as the consolidation process has seen a reduction in brewery capacity, particularly in Europe where the fragmented regional nature of the market meant that there had been persistent overcapacity to be exploited by retailers. Several markets have experienced quite meaningful capacity reduction. In the UK, for example, 10 per cent of brewing capacity was taken out of the market following Heineken’s acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle. Markets such as Ireland,
 
- Taking all these things together – the emphasis on pricing, the focus on cost reduction and balance sheet efficiency – an improvement in both margins and return on capital was to be expected. As for valuation, the average free cash flow yields of 6–7 per cent imply growth rates of around GDP or a little less, which suggests that the stock market is underestimating the potential long-run benefit to be derived from market consolidation and improved discipline. In the light of an improving capital cycle among…
 
- In the energy markets, as elsewhere, “there is no cure for high…
 
- Following a relatively good stock market performance over the past 12 months for the energy sector (which is dominated by major oil companies), and with the oil price approaching its all-time high (Chart 1.6), it makes sense to review our significant underweighting of the energy sector. Various theories have been put forward to justify high oil prices and an increased asset allocation to commodities, chief among which is the idea of “peak oil.” Bullish forecasts suggest that increasing energy demand from emerging markets, together with declining oil reserves and rising production costs, will propel the price of crude oil to $200 a barrel or more. While a high oil price, however, is perceived to be beneficial for oil company profits in the short run, there are trends developing which will severely undermine both the oil price and energy shares during the coming years.
 
- It is said that “there is no cure for high prices like high prices.” Thus, while the price of crude appears to be suspended at an elevated level, the very persistence of the oil price above $100 per barrel is encouraging developments which pose an increasing risk to energy investors. There has been a surge in natural gas supply in North America, where new technology and better drilling techniques have helped to boost the production and lower the cost of natural gas from conventional resources, as well as from shale gas. US shale gas reserves are estimated to be huge. Extraction techniques continue to improve and we are still at the very early stages of the fracking revolution, so potential reserves from shale gas are probably still underestimated, as was the case in the early days of the oil industry. These extra and cheaper sources of energy have brought down natural gas prices in the US and opened up a huge price differential between crude oil and gas. In the US, at least, these developments have resulted in a dramatic shift towards natural gas, away from oil and coal, as a primary source of energy. Those who argue that the surge in gas supply will only impact North America are ignoring the fact that not only is the US still the largest consumer of crude oil (and is currently a net importer) but also that significant investment is being undertaken to be able to export this cheap gas. We are seeing gas import plants in the United States being reengineered to enable exports and new gas export facilities planned. In addition, to capitalize on the lowest US natural gas prices in a decade, industries are starting to shift production to the US and are even moving physical assets. In the case of Methanex, the world’s largest methanol maker, there are plans to dismantle an idled Chilean factory and ship it to Louisiana to be reassembled. The high oil price is fuelling other significant changes in the energy markets. The transport industry is becoming much more fuel efficient (airlines are ordering new fuel efficient aircraft/engines, and new fuel efficient ships are being ordered despite low cargo rates and a glut of older vessels). And there’s the increasing use of non-oil fuel for transport. Just look around. In Thailand, natural gas is already outselling petrol because of new technology used by taxis, tractors, buses and now some cars; in the US and in the UK (where there are tax incentives for “green” vehicles), there’s increasing evidence of not just hybrid vehicles but now fully electric cars (from economy models such as the Smart to the sporty Tesla), and facilities are being built to recharge these vehicles on the move; businesses are developing natural gas powered trucks (manufactured by Navistar and Clean Energy Fuels Corp) and hydrogen cell cars (by Acal). In short, there is no shortage of investment directed towards reducing the use of expensive crude oil. Meanwhile, oil producing countries within OPEC have become somewhat complacent about…
 
- 1.7   MAJOR CONCERNS (MARCH 2014) Energy companies are suffering from the delayed consequences of their capital spending boom Is now the time to increase exposure to the oil majors? Stocks of the largest five global oil companies, which in aggregate account for over 40 per cent of the MSCI World Oil and Gas Index, are trading at significant discounts to the MSCI World price-earnings ratio and provide, on average, close to double the dividend yield. These valuations may look…
 
- Over the period 2003 to 2012, as the Brent oil price increased by 16 per cent a year, the net income of the oil majors grew by only 8 per cent a year. Total growth in their earnings per share (EPS), including the effect of share buybacks, was 10 per cent – lagging the S&P, which compounded earnings at 12 per cent over this same period. A surge in the Brent crude price between 2003 and 2007 (increasing at 33 per cent a year) resulted in the aggregate return on equity for the oil majors rising to 27 per cent. As capital cycle theory would suggest, this led to a dramatic rise in capital expenditure, which increased from 1.2 times depreciation and amortization between 2003 and 2007 to 1.7 times between 2007 and 2012. Despite this rise in capex, net income has actually fallen slightly in aggregate, which explains the marked drop in returns on equity for the large energy companies – from 27 per cent in 2007 to 17 per cent in 2012, at a time when the oil price increased by nearly 20 per cent. Why has the higher oil price and rising capex not produced faster earnings growth? The main issue is that the majors have had a real fight just to stand still. The yield of an oil and gas field steadily falls over its lifetime, in the order of 5 per cent annually, so a material amount of capital expenditure is required just to offset the decline rate. Lately, the quality of oil exploration projects coming on stream has not matched that of the legacy assets. Newer fields are both harder to access technically, as well as being in riskier jurisdictions. An ever greater amount of capital has been required to deliver the same level of production, resulting in the inevitable decline in return on invested capital. This explains why net production growth has been so depressed over recent years – in aggregate, the oil majors’ production has declined by approximately 2 per cent a year over the last five years. Of course, given the long-term nature of oil projects – the average time lag to reach full productive capacity is around six years – the impact of recent capex spending may yet be seen over the next five years, with an attendant rise in earnings. However, an analysis of company guidance and analyst expectations for the next four years (2014–17) does not support this contention. The ratio of capex-to-depreciation is expected to remain high, at 1.6 times, with a forecast cash…

- Marathon looks to invest in two phases of an industry’s capital cycle. From what is misleadingly labelled the “growth” universe, we search for businesses whose high returns are believed to be more sustainable than most investors expect. Here, the good company manages to resist becoming a mediocre one. From the low return, or “value” universe, our aim is to find companies whose improvement potential is generally underestimated. In both cases, the rate at which a company reverts to mediocrity (or “fade rate”) is often miscalculated by…
 
- Chart 1.7 illustrates the “fade rate” of corporate returns, an idea developed by Holt Value Associates (now part of Credit Suisse). Holt’s concept of the stock market-implied fade rate chimed well with our focus on competitive conditions within industries and the flow of capital into (and out of) high (and low) return industries. Using this framework, two purchase candidates are identifiable. Purchase Candidate A is a company capable of sustaining high returns beyond the market’s expectation (the upper dotted line) – that is, the company remains above…
 
- Marathon’s experience suggests that the stock market is often poor at pricing superior fade characteristics. For Purchase Candidate A, mispricing stems from a number of sources. One is the underestimation of the durability of barriers to entry. Another is the underappreciation of the scale and scope of the…
 
- The conditions leading to Purchase Candidate B often stem from the market misjudging the beneficial effects of reduced competition as weaker firms disappear, either through consolidation or bankruptcy. Alternately, an unruly oligopoly may tire of excess competition and enjoy an outbreak of peaceful coexistence. The turn in the capital cycle often occurs during periods of maximum pessimism, as the weakest competitor throws in the towel at a point of extreme stress. When the pain of losses coincides with a depressed share price, investors can find wonderful opportunities, particularly if they are willing to take a multiyear view and put up with short-term volatility. Management skill at dealing with problems may also be overlooked. This is especially true when a new leader is recruited externally, maximizing the possibility of change.
 
- The capital cycle partly explains why corporate profitability lags GDP growth
 
- Investors who assume corporate earnings will increase in line with the economy should look at the historical data.
 
- The first issue is that new share issuance exceeded stock buybacks over time, diluting the equity holder. For example, in a 2003 paper, Bernstein and Arnott estimated net share issuance to have been in the order of 2 per cent a year in the US market.13 One explanation for this phenomenon is the procyclical behaviour of management, specifically the tendency to buy back stock when confidence is high and valuations heady, only then to be forced to issue equity when circumstances are less favourable and share prices lower. The recent experience of the banking sector is a particularly savage example of management’s buy high and sell low tendency. Mergers and acquisitions show the same pro-cyclicality, with activity typically reaching a crescendo in the later stages of bull markets. Deals struck at high valuations lead to shareholder value destruction. Finally, management issuance of share options to employees has also been a drag on shareholder returns. Today a “burn rate” of 1 per cent is not uncommon – and it was even higher prior to the mandatory expensing of options through the profit and loss account.
 
- The concept of the capital cycle provides a broader explanation as to why corporate profitability lags GDP. The primary driver of healthy corporate profitability is a favourable supply side – not high rates of demand growth. Hence, it is possible for there to be rapid growth in an industry which brings little or no benefit to investors. In fact, strong growth in demand is often the direct cause of value destruction as it encourages a flood of capital into the industry, eroding returns.
 
- Investors should not expect earnings to grow in line with economy. Rather, they should look out for those rare examples of management who are prudent in their use of capital. The starting point for company analysis is not the outlook for end demand but rather the supply side. Our goal is to find investments in depressed industries at positive inflection points in the capital cycle and in sectors with benign and stable supply side fundamentals.
 
- Capital cycle analysis, as it originally evolved at Marathon, looked to invest in companies from sectors where capital was being withdrawn and to avoid companies in industries where assets were increasing rapidly. The insight being that both profits and valuations should generally rise after capital has exited an industry and decline after capital has poured in. In other words, capital cycle analysis was all about the drivers of mean reversion. Yet the same mode of analysis can be used to identify companies which, for one reason or another, are able to repel competition. Companies with such strong competitive advantages, possessing what Warren Buffett calls a wide “moat,” are able to maintain profits, often for longer than the market expects. Mean reversion is suspended. From a capital cycle perspective, it can be observed that a lack of competition prevents the supply side from shifting in response to high profitability. Acquiring stocks in companies which defy mean reversion has been a particularly fruitful investment strategy for Marathon over the last decade. Somewhat confusingly, this style of investment is known generally as “growth” investing in fund management industry parlance, as distinct from “value” investing. Having acquired the “value” investor label from industry consultants before and during the dotcom bubble, Marathon was wary of being accused of style drift as it invested increasingly in stocks with higher valuations and better growth prospects. As the essays below point out, the “value/growth dichotomy” is false – at least, to a true value investor, whose aim is not to buy stocks which are “cheap” on accounting measures (P/E, price-to-book, etc.) and to avoid those which are expensive on the same basis, but rather to look for investments trading at low prices relative to the investor’s estimate of their intrinsic value.
 
- Labelling fund managers as “value” or “growth” investors risks distorting the investment process Marathon has often been pigeon-holed as a value manager, a description that we resist because it oversimplifies and misrepresents our investment approach. The traditional definition of a value manager is one who invests solely in companies with low valuations as measured by price-to-book, PE, price-to-sales or price-to-cash flow. The value approach is associated with Benjamin Graham, who sought unloved stocks with low stock price multiples which could deliver more than was generally expected – what was termed “cigar-butt” investing in the sense that the object had been discarded as worthless but nevertheless could provide one last puff. A growth manager is one who invests at the other end of the spectrum in companies with high stock price multiples. Companies in the Marathon portfolio have tended to have below average multiples, but this is not because we have been engaged in seeking “cigar-butts.” In fact, the stocks in our European portfolios have relatively strong earnings growth. Part of the reason for this apparent contradiction is that we have found that smaller companies with above average growth prospects are often cheap. While smaller companies have, in the recent past, tended to have low valuations, large-cap stocks have attracted unjustifiably high valuations. The growth of very large fund managers is largely to blame. In Europe, the MSCI Europe Index consists of 540 stocks of which only 88 have a market capitalization above $10bn. Liquidity reasons (that is, the amount of time it takes to trade in and out of a stock) preclude fund managers with vast assets under management from investing in stocks with market valuations below this threshold. The trouble is that the largest cap stocks are concentrated in certain sectors and underrepresented in others. Since three-quarters of industrial stocks have a market cap of less than $10bn, industrials are essentially “screened out” by the large-cap managers. By contrast, 85 per cent of the healthcare stocks have market caps above $10bn. As a result, pharma stocks attract disproportionate attention from institutional investors. The issue with style labelling is somewhat deeper, however. Similar to the recent obsessions with tracking error, indexation and understanding the “new economy,” it risks grossly distorting the investment process and requires/encourages managers to use inappropriate tools and measurement systems to construct portfolios. Many great investors will interpret value according to their perceptions of value. The renowned “value” investor Bill Miller of Legg Mason has championed Amazon.com and AOL, while Warren Buffett, that great disciple of Ben Graham, has preferred growth franchises such as Coke and Disney. The latter, however, believes (or at least did believe) that these high-quality businesses were cheap (i.e., good value relative to the present value of their expected future…
 
- Long-term investing works because there is less competition for really valuable bits of information
 
- There are many ways to describe investment approaches, indeed a consulting industry has emerged whose primary function is to do just that. However, there is one attribute that separates investors better than most, in our opinion, and that is portfolio turnover.
 
- While the case for long-term investment has tended to centre around simple mathematical advantages such as reduced (frictional) costs and fewer decisions leading (hopefully) to fewer mistakes, the real advantage to this approach, in our opinion, comes from asking more valuable questions.
 
- Information with a long shelf life is far more valuable than advance knowledge of next quarter’s earnings. We seek insights consistent with our holding period. These principally relate to capital allocation, which can be gleaned from examining the company’s advertising, marketing, research and development spending, capital expenditures, debt levels, share repurchase/issuance, mergers and acquisitions and so forth.
 
- Even today, Colgate presentations do not mention the company’s advertising spend, which remains in excess of market share in all countries except Mexico, where market share is around 90 per cent. And this is despite 20 years of the firm demonstrating that line extensions and advertising support are powerful competitive weapons. “Most people don’t think it is important,” confessed the firm’s investor relations spokeswoman. Even though we don’t own the shares, Marathon is the only fund manager to have sought and gained a meeting with Colgate’s director of advertising and marketing.4 In the two decades since its first line extension, Colgate’s share price has risen 25 fold, handsomely beating the market. This shows how important it is for long-term investors to understand a firm’s marketing strategy. Yet, given the annual 100 per cent turnover in Colgate shares, very few of the firm’s shareholders have benefited fully from its success. And since Colgate’s investment returns didn’t outperform the S&P 500 in any meaningful way for a full ten years after the introduction of its first line extension, investors with short time horizons wouldn’t have cared about such matters. Why did so few Colgate investors stay the course? There are a range of psychological forces stacked up against the long-term investor. In particular, there is strong social pressure from peers, colleagues and clients to boost near-term performance. Even if one has developed the analytical skills to spot the winner, the psychological disposition necessary to own shares for prolonged periods is not easily come by. J.K. Galbraith observed that: “nothing is so admirable in politics as a short-term memory.” Why should politics have a monopoly on sloppy thinking? Which makes us think that long-term investing works not because it is more difficult, but because there is less competition out there for the really valuable bits of information.
 
- Conflicts of interest in the business world sometimes play to an investor’s advantage In a recent lecture given at the University of California, Charles T. Munger described a test he had performed at a number of US business schools.5 This test involved the Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman asking the MBA students the following question: “You have studied supply and demand curves. You have learned that when you raise the price, ordinarily the volume you can sell goes down, and when you reduce the price, the volume you can sell goes up. Is that right? That’s what you’ve learned?” The business school students all nod in agreement. Munger then goes on: “Now tell me several instances when, if you want the physical volume to go up, the correct answer is to increase the price?” Some students come up with the luxury good paradox, whereby higher prices indicate superior quality which, in turn, leads to greater sales. Very few students identify Munger’s answer, namely that when the customer is not involved directly in the purchasing decision, then higher prices can be used to bribe the purchaser’s agent and can result in both higher profit margins and sales volumes. From an economist’s perspective, the customer experiences an agency problem. Agency creates the potential for supernormal profits for both agents and producers. Investors who understand the process can profit, too. It’s worth examining how the agency issue – hitherto something discussed mainly in relation to the dysfunctionality of the investment management industry – relates to a number of companies we own or may purchase at some stage in the future (price permitting, that is). Normal relations between provider, intermediary and consumer are distorted when the consumer lacks understanding and relies on a supposedly independent intermediary. In many cases the relationship between the intermediary and the product provider has developed to the point where these parties form a tacit alliance to exploit consumer ignorance.
 
- An unholy alliance between producers and distributors exploiting customer ignorance is also prevalent in the healthcare sector.
 
- Two of them are even former highfliers from the dotcom bubble, Amazon.com and Priceline.com. Given that these firms have little in the way of current profitability, why do we own them? For a start, these companies are building sustainable competitive advantages. Their strategy is to use the low cost and scalability of Internet technology to provide savings for their customers. They recognize the importance of securing a dominant position in their respective markets by operating their businesses with low margins, in the short-term, so as to maximize their earnings potential in the long-term. Amazon.com is the best known and most established of the businesses, having expanded well beyond its origins as an online discount book retailer. A lot of scepticism surrounds the stock, partly because of its high profile at the time of the Internet bubble, and more recently because of the volatile progression of the company’s margins. The variation in the margin stems from Amazon’s desire to continue to expand its offer, and the fact that a number of the new services – including Amazon Web Services, which provides computing services for clients, and “Fulfilment by Amazon,” which enables other retailers to use Amazon’s expertise in processing inventory and orders – have required large up-front investments and will take some time to develop into profitable businesses. This investment, most of which is written off as an expense in the accounts, has made margins rather volatile over recent years (as can be seen below). While Wall Street fretted about the collapse in margins, without thinking of the longer-term benefits of the investment, the stock declined from $60 to $40. Now there are signs that Amazon’s margins are recovering, while sales are growing at 35 per cent year-on-year. The stock has almost doubled since the start of 2007. Amazon gives frustratingly little long-term guidance about the potential profitability of its new initiatives, but hints at an ambition for margins in the high single digits once these businesses have reached maturity. The company’s track record gives us confidence that they can achieve this, and at the current valuation of 2.3 times current sales, the shares are far from overvalued.7
 
- The basic corporate model of low margins in order to maximize long-term absolute profit is a well-trodden path, with Wal-Mart the most notable exponent. It is not surprising that some companies will have the good sense to apply this old model to the new medium of the Internet. This strategy dramatically reduces business risks (via reduced competition) while simultaneously raising long-term rewards (via likely growth). Internet technology will help these firms secure competitive advantage, and investors should benefit in the long run.
 
- Our portfolios have shifted towards higher quality companies with sustainable barriers to entry
 
- We are on the lookout for factors which might lead to improved returns on equity, in particular: (1) the emergence of oligopolies in industries hitherto characterized by low returns and excessive competition; (2) the evolution of business models with high and rising barriers to entry; and (3) management behaviour which encourages these trends.
 
- Another class of business whose weight in our portfolios has expanded in recent years has been subscription-based service companies with annuity-like revenue streams. Excluding telecom companies, which also have a high degree of subscription-based revenue, these companies now account for around 12 per cent of the European portfolio and have a forecast RoE of 42 per cent. The common theme here is a longer-term commitment made by the customer, together with an element of inertia when it comes to renewals. These factors, in combination with the scale economies which often arise in the provision of subscription services, make for significant barriers to entry and high and sustainable returns. This is particularly true where the cost of the service is only a small proportion of the customer’s total spending, as is the case for a number of our portfolio companies, including Rightmove, Capita and a handful of information providers. Rightmove, the UK property listings website, enjoys a winner-takes-all network benefit from being the most popular website for property searchers. The company charges estate agents a subscription price per office which is well below the cost of less effective print advertising. When we met the company in March 2011, 65 per cent of subscriptions for the year had already been received, and a further 20 per cent were to be received in May. Price increases this year are in the order of 16 per cent.
 
- Niche semiconductor businesses have escaped the ravages of the industry’s capital cycle Driven by Moore’s law, the semiconductor sector has achieved sustained and dramatic performance increases over the last 30 years, greatly benefiting productivity and the overall economy. Unfortunately, investors have not done so well. Since inception in 1994, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has underperformed the Nasdaq by around 200 percentage points, and exhibited greater volatility. The reason for this poor performance is no secret. No part of the technology world has been more prone to cyclical booms and busts than the semiconductor industry. In good times, prices pick up, companies increase capacity, and new entrants appear, generally from different parts of Asia (Japan in the 1970s, Korea in 1980s, Taiwan in the mid-1990s, and China more recently). Excess capital entering at cyclical peaks has led to relatively poor aggregate industry returns. While the history of the semiconductor business provides a classic example of the capital cycle, there are companies operating in niches of the industry which have delivered excellent long-term returns for shareholders. Two of them are recent additions in our US portfolio: Analog Devices, based in Norwood, Massachusetts, and Linear Technology, headquartered in Milpitas, California.
 
- How have these companies generated such high returns and to what extent are these returns sustainable? The answer lies in an understanding of the supply side of this industry – the specifics of the production process, market structure, competitive dynamics and pricing power, which together constitute the essence of capital cycle analysis. Consider first the mechanics of the analog semiconductor business. As the real world is far more complex and heterogeneous than the digital one, the product design required to capture it has to be more complex and heterogeneous. This means that product differentiation of analog semiconductors is higher and company-specific intellectual property (whether physical or human capital) more important. The human capital component is especially hard to replicate because engineering talent deepens with experience. The design process is much more trial and error than in other technology disciplines, and less reliant on computer modelling and simulation. To become an expert in analog semiconductor design takes many years – the tenure of the average engineer at Analog Devices is 20 years. This forms an important barrier to entry. In addition, each analog company’s process technologies are quite distinct (digital utilizes a more generic process). Thus, it is difficult for an engineer to be poached by another analog company without his productivity being significantly impaired. The supply of new engineers tends to be constrained for the analog sector – new science graduates are much more likely to pursue the digital semiconductor route. This is largely because the learning curve is less steep in digital, and experience on the job less valued. As a result, research capacity in the world of analog semis has been, and will likely to continue to be, constrained. These factors – a differentiated product and company-specific “sticky” intellectual capital – reduce market contestability. These strategic advantages are compounded by the fact that analog has a more diverse end market than digital, with a much wider range of products, numbering in the thousands, and smaller average volume size. Such market characteristics make it difficult for a new entrant to compete effectively. Thus pricing power tends to be robust and market positions relatively stable over long periods. While the overall market is relatively fragmented – the five firm concentration ratio is around 50 per cent – it is more consolidated in the various market sub-segments. Analog Devices, for instance, has over a 40 per cent share in data converters. Pricing power is further aided by the fact that an analog semiconductor chip typically plays a very important role in a product (for example, the airbag crash sensor) but represents a very small proportion of the cost of materials. The average selling price for Linear Technology’s products is under $2. As a result, competition tends to be less on price and more on product quality. In addition, once a chip has been…
 
- We are also confident that management will allocate future surplus cash flow for the benefit of equity investors. Historically, most of the growth of these businesses has been organic, with excess cash returned to shareholders. This is a significant achievement for companies in the technology sector, an area where the temptation to do strategic deals has been strong, often to the detriment of shareholders. We expect the long-serving management teams of both companies to continue to allocate capital prudently. Both Analog Devices and Linear Technology currently offer free cash flow yields of 5 per cent. With long-term growth in free cash flow likely to be similar to historical levels, our total annual return expectation is in the low double digits.9
 
- A Chinese Internet firm’s market dominance justifies its…
 
- It should never be forgotten that, in its most basic form, investing is always and everywhere about price and value. Price is what you pay, says the Sage of Omaha, and value is what you get. By this definition, every serious investor must be a value investor. This is not to say that investors should restrict themselves to buying companies with low valuation multiples. The business of investment is ultimately about buying stocks at a discount to intrinsic value. So how do you calculate value? Well, in theory the value received is derived from future cash flows discounted back to today at the appropriate discount rate. The trouble is that we are rather poor at making predictions, especially about the future. But that doesn’t put us off. We suffer from what Nassim Taleb calls the “epistemic arrogance” – in plain English, we think we are better at making predictions than we really are.10 The result is that we have a misplaced sense of confidence in our forecasts. Investors like modelling because it appears scientific (the more spreadsheet tabs, the greater the effect). Investment models, however, encourage anchoring. Most models are calibrated to produce a current value for a company within a…
 
- One common response to the difficulty of forecasting is to turn to simple value proxies, such as the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, and free cash flow yield. Many “value” investors advocate buying a basket of stocks which are cheap by these measures. There’s nothing inherently dumb about this approach. Each of the measures is a very useful indicator of potential value, but there’s a danger of oversimplification. Traditional valuation measures say nothing about the specific context of an investment – for instance, a company’s business model, its industry structure, and management’s ability to allocate capital – which determines future cash flows. Quantitative valuation measures also tend to encourage a narrow categorization of investment styles. Take for example the S&P US Style Indices. Value stocks are defined by their ratios of price-to-book, price-to-earnings, and price-to-sales. The growth index, on the other hand, is defined by the three-year change in earnings per share, three-year sales…
 
- labels – “growth” or “value” – tend not to suit our capital cycle…
 
- Capital cycle analysis helps to identify investments with high and sustainable returns
 
- Pricing power has arguably been the most enduring determinant of high returns for these investments. It has come from two main sources. The first is a concentrated market structure, closely associated with effective management of capacity through the demand cycle which encourages a rational approach to pricing. The second is “intrinsic” pricing power within the product or service itself. Intrinsic pricing power is created when price is not the most important factor in a customer’s purchase decision. Most often, this property is generated by the existence of an intangible asset. There are several classes of intangible assets, examples of which can be found among Marathon’s holdings. An obvious one is consumer brands. In the toothpaste category, private label penetration is only 2 per cent, supporting Colgate’s excellent economics.11 An intangible asset can also derive from a long-term customer relationship, as in case of the agency business models (Legrand, Assa Abloy or Geberit), where the customer relies on intermediaries (electricians, architects and plumbers respectively). The agent’s interest is safety, quality, reliability, availability, and perhaps his own ability to earn a commission. Under such circumstances, price is a pass-through to the end customer, for whom product costs represent a small part of the total bill.12 Sometimes a product is so embedded in a customer’s workflow that the risk of changing outweighs any potential cost savings – for instance, in subscription-based services like computer systems (Oracle) or payroll processing (ADP, Paychex). Networks where the customer benefits from a company’s scale, as in the security business (Secom), industrial gases (Praxair, Air Liquide), car auctions (USS) or testing centres (Intertek) are another example. Finally, technological leadership (Intel, Linear Technology) can be another important intangible asset – although this is perhaps one of the less durable sources of pricing power, unless combined with others. The very best economics appear when some of the above characteristics combine in a situation in which the cost of the product or service is low relative to its importance: for example, the analog semiconductor chip which activates the car airbag, yet costs little more than a dollar. The presence of intangible assets acts as a powerful barrier to entry. They are by nature durable, difficult to replicate and tending to economies of scale. Importantly, these barriers often strengthen over time, as high returns on capital throw off abundant free cash flow which is in turn reinvested in the business. For example, over the last five years, P&G has spent over $40bn in advertising, while Intel has invested roughly the same amount on R&D. This repels new entrants, short-circuiting the destructive side of the capital cycle – whereby excess profits normally attract competitors, which over time erodes profitability. Thus, the presence of intangible assets creates a virtuous cycle, allowing…
 
- Companies which provide indispensable services to their customers often prove to be excellent investments
 
- The typical growth stock starts out with high returns, rising turnover, and glorious prospects, only to stumble in later years. The trouble is that profitable and growing businesses tend to attract lots of competition, especially when they operate in exciting areas, such as technology. Investors who buy growth at high starting valuations generally end up disappointed. There is, however, a certain class of company which we have found is well worth paying a premium for. Our preferred growth stocks undertake apparently unglamorous activities that are essential to their customers – so essential, in fact, that customers pay little attention to what they’re being charged. When Marathon encounters such companies, the common refrain of managers is that their products (or services) constitute only a small part of the customers’ total cost and yet are of vital importance to them. It may be that a particular component is “mission critical” for an industrial process or a company’s workflow. For instance,…
 
- Having a high perceived value for customers often combines with some other advantages, which limits competition, ensuring high and sustained returns. These may be economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution, regulatory barriers and high switching costs. Companies talk about “value based,” or “technical” selling, which often involves having highly qualified sales staff “embedded” in the R&D departments of their customers. Sometimes this means that the…
 
- While the high profitability of the companies under discussion may be below the radar of their customers, it has not escaped the attention of investors. In the past, when we encountered such wonderful businesses we were prone to assume that high valuations meant they were fairly priced, or even overpriced, in the stock market. A few years later, however, when we reengage with the same firms, we often find that their share prices have shot up. When we first met with Spirax-Sarco in 2005, for instance, it was valued at 17.5 times earnings and the shares were trading around £8. We demurred. Five years later, at our next meeting, the stock was trading above £18. Again, we concluded that it was fully valued. Since then, the share price has almost doubled again. The lesson seems to be that a full price is often justified for high quality, “under-the-radar” businesses.15
 
- Like many other investors, Marathon never tires of quoting Warren Buffett. One particular comment of the Sage of Omaha has become something of a mantra at the firm: namely, Buffett’s observation that “after ten years on the job, a CEO whose company retains earnings equal to 10 per cent of the net worth will have been responsible for the deployment of more than 60 per cent of all capital at work in the business.” What this means is that investors should pay particular attention to the capital allocation skills of management. As Marathon’s investment holding periods became more extended, in contrast to the fund management industry as a whole, the notion that a manager’s skill in capital allocation is decisive to the investment outcome has been reinforced. The study of management, via face-to-face meetings and general observation, has become one of the main elements of the daily job at Marathon.
 
- 1.Too close to management
 
- By occasionally giving privileged information to particular analysts, the recipient may have felt (consciously or not) that he or she owed management a favour – what is known as “reciprocation tendency.” And when things started to go wrong, the weird and wonderful effects of Stockholm syndrome – whereby the hostage becomes the mouthpiece for his captor – may have taken hold.
 
- 2.Too much information
 
- Having more information doesn’t necessarily improve decision-making. We know from studies of horse racing that when handicappers receive more information about the horses and riders, they become proportionately more confident even though they are no more likely to pick the winner.
 
- Our racecourse punters apparently become more confident of their opinion after having placed their bet. The danger is that the analyst reaches a conclusion based on a single line of thought and then sticks with this view, come what may.
 
- 3.Living in a cocoon
 
- Specialist analysts operate in a cocoon, in which they are overexposed to company management and peer analysts and underexposed to what is going on in the rest of the world. Herding instincts may tend to reinforce similar opinions among peer
 
- analysts. Their thinking starts to reflect what Daniel Kahneman calls the “insider view.”
 
- 4.Poor incentives
 
- Management has a huge influence over the capital allocation of a business. Decisions taken by senior executives are likely to be influenced by their incentives. Yet specialist research rarely addresses the key issue of incentives.
 
- 5.An even worse performance metric
 
- Once analysts set the market’s EPS expectations for the next quarter and management beats the expected numbers, the share price can be expected to rise. We have previously discussed the futility of this game, vulnerable as it is to “Goodhart’s Law” (namely, that once a data point is widely used as a measuring stick, it ceases to be reliable).
 
- A great mystery of the corporate world is the tendency of management to buy high and sell low
 
- While boards acting on behalf of shareholders have generally mistimed their equity purchases and sales, insiders have done rather better when trading for their own account. In the case of the aforementioned Veolia, the CEO sold most of his exposure (€4m worth) near the top. While insiders were net sellers of equities in the run-up to the financial crisis, an examination of director dealings over this tumultuous period shows that directors then became net buyers rather too early and remained so throughout the period of the market decline until the end of Q1 2009, from which point they became heavy net sellers, just as the market was beginning to recover. This may have been because they had been forced to defer sales during the market turmoil, and also because they were responding to widespread concerns about a double dip.
 
- Looking back over recent years, our overwhelming impression is that the most companies mistimed the cycle and misjudged the crisis. As a result, poor capital allocation decisions were made over that period. The lure of cheap debt and apparently rosy growth prospects enticed many managements into thinking that not only were their own shares cheap, but that the equity of other companies also offered good value, particularly given the extremely low cost of capital at the time. This herd-like behaviour was exacerbated by the private equity bubble. The inevitable appearance of corporate excess at a high point in the cycle represents a significant drag on returns for investors in public equities.
 
- The best managers understand their industry’s capital cycle and invest in a countercyclical manner
 
- The problem is they often lack the right skills. As Warren Buffett has pointed out: The heads of many companies are not skilled in capital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such as marketing, production, engineering – or sometimes, institutional politics.
 
- Financial companies are probably the most challenging of all for CEOs to manage, as they require many more capital allocation decisions compared with, say, running a large food retailer or consumer products company.
 
- The Sampo case study combines many of the key elements that we look for in management; namely, it has a chief executive who both understands and is able to drive the industry’s capital cycle (the Nordic P&C consolidation story), allocates capital in a countercyclical manner (selling equities prior to the GFC), is incentivized properly (large equity stake) and takes a dispassionate approach to selling assets when someone is prepared to overpay (Finnish bank divestment). The pity is that there are so few examples of Sampo-esque management elsewhere in Europe.6
 
- The superior long-term performance of Nordic stocks reflects the quality of management
 
- While personal taxation and disdain for conspicuous consumption are high in egalitarian Scandinavia, corporate taxation is relatively low by international standards. In Denmark, nearly half of the full-time workforce pays the top marginal tax rate of 63 per cent, while business profits are taxed at just 25 per cent. Corporation tax rates in the other Scandinavian countries range from 26 to 28 per cent. That contrasts with an effective rate of corporation tax of 43 per cent for a company based in that bastion of capitalism, New York City.
 
- Long-term insider ownership is the best of all imperfect solutions to the principal-agent problem
 
- What is the optimal incentive scheme, then? The answer is it depends on the circumstances. Remuneration structures based on earnings per share (EPS) growth and total shareholder return (TSR) performance measures are increasingly commonplace. Yet they suffer from the problem identified long ago by the management guru, Peter Drucker, who observed that the search for the right performance measure is “not only likely to be as unproductive as the quest for the philosopher’s stone; it is certain to do harm and to misdirect.” This is particularly the case when pay is linked to EPS – a particular bête noire for Marathon over many years. The earnings per share measure is prone to manipulation by unscrupulous executives; it takes no account of risk and encourages value destroying acquisitions and buybacks, especially when interest rates are low. It also encourages the quarterly EPS guessing game beloved by the sell-side. At times, it seems that meeting the EPS target has become the main strategic purpose of the company. This is regrettable. Corporate strategy should be about how best to allocate resources. If a turnaround requires a three-year investment phase, management may not pursue the optimal business plan if their compensation is linked to interim EPS results. While these inter-temporal issues can be partly resolved by phasing in performance rewards over a period of years, investor myopia and management’s own interest tend to lead to an exclusive focus on the calendar year EPS, which bears no relation to long-term value creation. Linking compensation to total shareholder return (TSR), the most common share price-based measure, is better than EPS, as it forces management to think about what drives shares prices over the medium term. Such schemes suffer from point-to-point measurement, which can be distorted if the stock price at either the start or end date is inflated by takeover speculation or by general overvaluation in the stock market. Then, there are questions over what time frame to measure the returns; also, whether the benchmark should be absolute or relative – both have their merits, neither is perfect. In the case of relative schemes, should the benchmark be provided by a peer group or by the broader market index? Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, has become a very wealthy man thanks to his ability to outperform a small group of marketing service companies. Unfortunately, this wealth creation has not been shared with the company’s owners due to the under-performance of this sector over many years. For this reason, we normally prefer corporate incentives schemes to be benchmarked against the stock market index, in line with our own performance fees. Company managers might feel aggrieved that they have no control on performance relative to a broad index, which may be driven by moves in some heavily-weighted sector, such as mining or pharmaceuticals in the FTSE 100. Some companies have come to us seeking to switch from a…
 
- Given that each measure has pros and cons, it is not surprising that remuneration consultants seek a compromise, bundling together a mixture of measures in the incentive scheme. But so-called “balanced” approaches, such as those which mix an EPS target with a return on capital overlay and a TSR override, are likely to confuse both management and investors and, even worse, can encourage sophisticated gaming strategies.
 
- Insider ownership has always seemed to us as the most direct way to deal with the principal-agent problem, which arises with the separation of corporate management from ownership. Our portfolios have tended to be skewed towards companies where successful entrepreneurs run their companies and retain sizeable shareholdings. Pleasingly, a number of companies have followed the example set by Reckitt Benckiser, where executives are required to build up significant shareholdings. Along similar lines, HSBC has recently revamped its incentives so that generous deferred share awards, which vest after five years, have to be held until retirement. Long-term share ownership is probably the best way of concentrating the minds of management on…

- The evils which arise at joint-stock companies where management and ownership are separated are not of recent vintage. In the year of the American Revolution, Adam Smith observed what we now call principal-agent problem: The directors of such companies ... being the managers rather of other people’s money rather than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which [they would] watch over their own ... Negligence and profusion…
 
- One potential solution to this problem is to invest in companies which remain under family control. Unfortunately,…
 
- The problem for investors is to determine between the good and bad family stewards. Readers of a scientific bent may be aware of the Anna Karenina principle,9 in which a deficiency in just one of a number of factors dooms an endeavour to failure. What follows is a list of common family deficiencies, any one of which is liable to undermine a company’s success: 1.Lack of family unity Family schisms and internal squabbling can do lasting damage to the interests of both family and non-family shareholders.
 
- 2.Loss of business acumen The “Buddenbrooks’ effect,” named after Thomas Mann’s novel of that name, describes how family businesses
 
- 3.Self-dealing Companies controlled by families which pay scant regard to principles of corporate governance have tended to trade on lower earnings multiples than their peer group. Actual theft is rare, but it is not uncommon to see corporate dealing between the family and the listed entity which appear to favour the former.
 
- 4.Poor succession planning Family-controlled companies must prepare to hand over the reins to the next generation. When the success of the company is not tied to the family, but to the social and political connections of the founder, minorities should brace themselves for occasional whiplash. This has been a particular feature of Asian family-owned companies whose fortunes have been built on the monopolies and concessions derived from political connections, and where a lack of succession planning by octogenarian founders has led to stock price weakness.
 
- 5.Politics of rent-seekin
 
- While companies which rely on extracting rents can do very well, it’s naïve to assume those rents will continue once the founder has departed. What is good for the family (and non-family shareholders) may not be so advantageous for the country.
 
- # 3.7   THE WIT AND WISDOM OF JOHANN RUPERT (JUNE 2013)  ^146ace
- The departing boss of Richemont is a true corporate star
 
- Marathon looks to invest with corporate managers who know how to allocate capital effectively. This requires certain character traits in the individual, such as suspicion of investments fads (and investment bankers), and a willingness to swim against the tide. One of our more successful decisions has been to invest alongside Johann Rupert, until recently the executive chairman and CEO of Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods group in which his family owns a controlling interest. As Mr. Rupert prepares to move on, we decided to look back over our meeting notes to remind us of the qualities which attracted us to this truly outstanding manager. ^capital-allocation
 
- We have collected below a number of throwaway comments from Mr Rupert, who speaks with a distinctive South African accent, which illustrate to our mind why he has been such a successful steward of other people’s money. On management: “The danger sign is always when a manager does not understand the business that he or she is in.” [On relations with a dominant supplier] “Don’t play cat and mouse games if you’re the mouse.” “I think if you want to be successful you need a very healthy dose of paranoia that every day there’s somebody out there who wants to eat your breakfast, and if you’re not alert they will do.” “Don’t postpone until tomorrow what you can delegate today.” “I learned many years ago – that from the day you’re born until you ride the hearse, things are never so bad that they can’t get worse.” “The real question is do companies redeploy free cash flow accretively, or do they waste it?”

- On short-termism: “I raised a glass of champagne when Al Dunlap fell on his chainsaw.” “So anybody who’s going to ask, so what do you think the next year looks like, why don’t you just not ask the question because we’re not going to answer any. And it’s not because we’re coy or funny. We don’t know.” “I’m not going to tell you what I think our third quarter XYZ is going to be.” On M&A and buybacks: “Ultimately, if any asset is wrongly priced, it is abused.” “If you pay an excessive multiple, deals will never make it.” “No, no, no, no. I didn’t lose a lot of money when I tried to sell the business. I lost the money when I bought the bloody thing. That’s when you park your money, it’s not when you try to find a bigger idiot than you to take it off your hands.” [On successfully exiting pay TV] “Never confuse luck with genius.” “Our job here is to create goodwill and not to pay other people for goodwill.” “[There are] three stages of [an] acquisition, which [are] euphoria and then disillusionment. And the next thing is looking for somebody to blame for buying the place.”

And as soon as you start stepping in all this stuff then you wonder why you ever crossed the fence.” “You can discount us ever using equity for acquisitions. Equity is always the most expensive way to pay.” [On share-financed takeovers during the TMT bubble] “Like a child selling his dog for $1m, only he gets paid with two severed cat’s paws.” “If you talk up your share price, when the price comes down, the folks come looking for you.” “We don’t talk about a load of rubbish that I also had a hand in buying.” “If you look at share buybacks, and at the prices at which companies bought their shares back, they inevitably bought the shares back at very close to the top of the market because that’s when they had a lot…
 
- “When you really need firepower, the banks are not there and the funds are gone.” On corporate governance: “So if you want a perfect governance score, get somebody you don’t know, whom you’ve never met, who knows nothing about your business because he’s never been involved, employ him and give him a nice bonus for sitting on a committee. Then you get all the boxes ticked [by the proxy voting services]. And guess what happens? After five years, chaos. There’s a direct, inverse correlation between the best corporate governance box-ticking and medium-term performance.” On the luxury business: “The only way we know how to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage is to grow the brand equity ... . because that brand equity creates demand and will result in pricing power.” “I’m just a normal business person who thinks that the luxury business is a great business to be in…

- One can learn a lot from meeting with managers, providing the…
 
- The prime purpose of our company meetings is to assess the skill of managers at investing money on behalf of their shareholders. Meeting management is not a scientific process. Rather, it involves making judgements about individuals, an activity which is prone to error (witness the rate of divorce). We go into meetings looking for answers to questions such as: does the CEO think in a long-term strategic way about the business? Understand how the capital cycle operates in their industry? Seem intelligent, energetic and passionate about the business? And interact with colleagues and others in an encouraging way? Appear trustworthy and honest? Act in a shareholder-friendly way even down to the smallest detail?
 
- During his tenure at General Electric, Jack Welch required managers of GE’s divisions to prepare a few simple slides describing their operating environment in terms of: what does your global competitive environment look like? In the last three years, what have your competitors done to alter the competitive landscape? In the same period, what have you done to them? How might they attack you in the future? What are your plans to leapfrog them?
 
- When a management team compliments a competitor, this can be like gold dust to investors. Learning that DMGT, the UK media company, found it hard to compete with Rightmove, the property listings website, contributed to our decision to invest in the company.13
 
- Marathon’s focus on management forces us to think about corporate culture
 
- Corporate culture is constituted by a set of shared assumptions and values that guide the actions of employees, and encourage workers to act collectively towards a specific goal. Cultures both reflect the values, and are a prime responsibility, of management. Yet strong cultures can persist long after the careers of those who put them in place. Still, sceptics might ask, why should investors bother with something so ineffable, so intangible? Well, the evidence suggests that culture pays. Perhaps the best-known study of the subject is Corporate Culture and Performance by John Kotter and James Heskett. This work examines the relationship between corporate culture and company performance in over 200 firms during the 1980s. The authors asked employees their opinions of attitudes to customers and shareholders at competitor firms. Shares in companies exhibiting strong and positive cultures outperformed rivals by more than 800 per cent during the study period. Other studies which measure corporate culture according to how employees regard their own workplace have found a similar link between esprit de corps and stock market returns.
 
- The point is that a strong corporate culture constitutes an intangible asset, potentially as valuable as a high-profile brand or network of customer relationships. As Warren Buffett says of Berkshire Hathaway’s family of businesses:
 
- If we are delighting customers, eliminating unnecessary costs and improving our products and services, we gain strength ... . On a daily basis, the effects are imperceptible; cumulatively, though, their consequences are enormous. When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable actions, we describe the phenomenon as “widening the moat.”
 
- If a beneficial culture is a valuable intangible asset, and a corrosive one an existential threat, it becomes important to ask: how can an outside investor tell the difference? As with so much of investment, the process is one of piecing together incomplete and obscure pieces of evidence, gathered over time through meetings and research. Some quantitative measures can be helpful: staff loyalty and inside share ownership are liable to be higher at firms in which employees believe in what they are doing. Corporate incentive schemes say a lot about the firm’s culture. Is management being greedy? What performance metrics are valued – growth for its own sake or customer satisfaction? What do employees think? Opinions can be unearthed through websites such as glassdoor.com (a sort of TripAdvisor for companies). We are constantly looking out for signs of management extravagance and vanity. Danger signs include expensive executive travel (a corporate jet is liable to elicit groans), too numerous pictures of the CEO in the annual report, and dandyish attire. There are numerous examples of successful cultures among our portfolio companies: the empowerment of branch managers that promotes responsible banking at Sweden’s Svenska Handelsbanken, for instance. Reckitt Benckiser, another holding, fosters an entrepreneurial spirit among its senior managers. Yet even if a strong culture is instilled in a company, it can take many years for its full effects to play out. That may be beyond Wall Street’s limited investment horizon. Long-term investors, however, would be wise to take heed.
 
- The looming financial crisis also can be understood from a capital cycle perspective. During the boom years, the banks were rapidly growing their assets (loans) and competition was increasing – as evidenced by the appearance of a shadow banking system and the decline in bank lending spreads. This outward shift in the supply side for the finance industry impacted eventually on the industry’s profitability. Viewed in this way, there is nothing particularly special about the banking sector. Capital cycle analysis could also applied usefully to the housing markets in the pre-crisis world. High and rising house prices in some countries elicited an enormous supply response, notably in Spain and Ireland. Those economies which experienced the most extreme capital cycle – in terms of increased stocks of credit and housing – later suffered from the most severe hangovers.
 
- In his book Behavioural Investing, James Montier devotes an entire chapter to the topic entitled “Why Waste Your Time Listening to Company Management?” Montier argues that meetings can overload fund managers with information and are likely to confirm pre-conceptions, especially overly optimistic ones. Fund managers may also become too impressed with authority figures. Admittedly, there’s a danger that the naïve will be gulled into dreadful mistakes. On the other hand, exposure to a truly terrible manager can help investors steer clear of the rocks. Marathon’s own experience of avoiding some of the worst banking disasters of the credit bubble suggests that meetings can have considerable value. We keep notes of our meetings. Below are some pre-crisis observations of a banking accident waiting to happen.
 
- Securitization has flooded certain sectors with too much cheap capital
 
- Marathon’s investment methodology is based on the tendency for returns on capital for any particular company, or industry, to trend towards a normal level over time. Depending on how quickly this evolution takes place, relative to the market’s expectations, an investment opportunity may arise. For this process to work, however, poor and failing businesses must be deprived of cheap funding. Yet the securitization process now supplies capital at an abnormally low cost to inherently risky activities, delaying the normalisation of profits and storing up losses for the future. This has capital cycle implications. Shareholder returns in industries funded with easy money from securitizations are likely to oscillate around the low marginal cost of funding.
 
- airline often retains the junior tranches. These become an asset on its balance sheet. Any discount associated with the low credit rating of these layers is more than offset by the discount on the purchase of the aircraft, thereby creating an immediate profit and cash inflow on delivery of the aircraft. Such are the wonders of modern financial alchemy. Under good, even normal, business conditions, the airline makes lease payments to the securitization vehicle. But in a recession or a bankruptcy filing, when payments are suspended, the owners of the senior strata are able to seize the collateral. The junior participants in the securitization have no rights, and any such assets on the airline’s balance sheet must be written down to zero, further increasing the airline’s losses. By this clever piece of financial engineering, the airline gets shiny new planes for an extremely low cost of funds – recently as low as 6 per cent – while equity shareholders carry nearly all of the business risk. That an industry which has rarely earned an acceptable return on capital should have access to such cheap capital is quite astonishing. Similar feats of financial engineering, facilitated by securitization, are apparent in a backwater of the US mortgage market.
 
- The buyout boom has entered a bubble phase
 
- Several indicators of speculative activity suggest a market peak has been reached “I’m forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air, They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, Then like my dreams they fade and die, Fortune’s always hiding, I’ve looked everywhere, I’m forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air.” Chant of West Ham football supporters
 
- The securitized debt markets are responsible for the private equity mania
 
- First, credit spreads have compressed. This is a global rather than European phenomenon, which a senior Moody’s analyst at a recent conference ascribed to the “savings glut” coming out of Asia and the Middle East. Too much money has been chasing too few “quality” financial assets. In the European credit markets, there has also been a decline in the proportion of buyout finance provided by commercial banks. The banks’ share of leveraged loans has declined from over 90 per cent at the start of the decade to less than 60 per cent today. In place of banks, a growing share of the European buyout debt market has been taken by the securitized credit vehicles – namely, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) – and by hedge funds. This development in the credit markets occurred in the US many years
 
- earlier. In Europe, the recent trend has been more exaggerated in the riskier tranches of acquisition finance where traditional bank lenders have largely disappeared over the past 18 months.
 
- Gone are the days when European banks hung onto loans because they prized the associated corporate relationships, not to mention the net interest income. There are a number of implications to these developments. First, there is the moral hazard aspect. As banks hold on to less of the debt that they originate, they are bound to have less concern about longer-term credit quality. A recent survey by the UK’s Financial Services Authority found that, on average, banks distribute 81 per cent of their exposure to their largest buyout transactions within 120 days of finalizing the deal. Anecdotal evidence suggests to us that this originate-then-distribute model is leading to a decline in the quality of lending.
 
- For the banks engaging in this pass-the-parcel game, there is always the risk of being caught at the
 
- point when the credit market turns. Furthermore, it may be that the banks have not been as clever as they claim in getting rid of potentially toxic credit risks. Once offloaded, the securitized debt may end up back at the same bank’s proprietary trading desk. A recent FSA survey of banks found that only 50 per cent of respondents were able to provide an indication of where they believed the debt had been distributed to. Andy Hornby, chief executive of HBOS, has said that the matter of where leveraged lending risk ends up is one of the biggest issues currently facing UK banks.9
 
- For private equity players, the attitude of making hay while the sun shines seems wholly appropriate, although a scenario of rising defaults is unlikely to leave them unscathed. From the standpoint of an investor in listed equities, however, it appears sensible to maintain a cautious stance towards the European financial sector. Bank assets continue to reach new highs despite the widespread adoption of originate-then-distribute banking practices. Passing on risk, however, may prove easier than passing on blame.

- – dynamite and the safety match. Sweden even managed to detonate its own banking system in the early 1990s. One large European financial institution, however, which didn’t blow up during the Global Financial Crisis is Svenska Handelsbanken, Sweden’s largest bank and a long-term Marathon holding. Over the years we have gotten to know the bank quite well. Our meetings with management have often provided timely insights into the folly of their European banking competitors. A recently published book about the bank, entitled A Blueprint for Better Banking, by Niels Kroner, describes the history and culture of the bank and, as the title suggests, argues that many of the recent problems of the financial system could have been avoided if other banks were run in the “Handelsbanken way.” Handelsbanken is a very conservatively run, branch-based retail bank which was the only major Swedish bank not to break in the Nordic banking crisis of the early 1990s. This time around, Handelsbanken has pulled through yet again, avoiding the need to raise fresh capital or receive government support. That puts it on a short list of only three major European banks.

- Second deadly sin: Supporting asset-liability mismatches by clients
 
- Third deadly sin: Lending to “Can’t Pay, Won’t Pay” types
 
- Here one immediately thinks of banks lending to subprime borrowers and private equity firms. Handelsbanken’s approach is rather to “lend to people with money.” Theirs is a niche lending approach rather than a mass market one. In company research meetings over the years, Handelsbanken told us that the banking industry had become obsessed with earning a few extra basis points of spread each quarter, while losing sight of credit risk, namely the chance that borrowers might never be in a position to repay the principal.
 
- Fourth deadly sin: Reaching for growth in unfamiliar areas
 
- Fifth deadly sin: Engaging in off-balance sheet lending
 
- Sixth deadly sin: Getting sucked into virtuous/vicious cycle dynamics
 
- Seventh deadly sin: Relying on the rearview mirror
 
- There are many other ways in which Handelsbanken is different from its peers. In its dialogue with investors, bank representatives refuse to engage in the game of trying to estimate this year’s profit number. They have no other choice, since divisional budgets were abolished in 1972. If managers have budget targets, so the thinking goes, it becomes more difficult to
 
- stay out of the market when pricing is unfavourable. Management incentives are also unusual. The bank funds an employee profit-sharing scheme called the Oktogonen Foundation, which receives allocations when the group’s return on equity exceeds the weighted average of a group of other Nordic and British banks. If this criterion is satisfied, and it usually is, except at the peak of the cycle, one-third of the extra profits can be allocated to Oktogonen subject to a limit of 15 per cent of the dividend to shareholders. If the Handelsbanken lowers the dividend paid out to its shareholders, no allocation is made to the profit-sharing foundation. The foundation channels a large part of its resources into Handelsbanken stock and currently holds 11 per cent of the bank’s equity. All employees receive an equal part of the allocated amount (without the traditional skew towards the upper echelons), and the scheme includes all staff in the Nordic countries and, since 2004, in Great Britain. Disbursements are only made once a member of staff has reached the age of 60. Employees who have been working for Handelsbanken since 1973 have around $600,000 – which turns out to be roughly half the value of a Nobel prize – due to them at retirement, regardless of whether they have worked as the CEO or as a security guard. The system undoubtedly contributes to the bank’s tribal culture and aligns employee interests with shareholders.
 
- Ultimately, Handelsbanken is a wonderful example of a bank with a strong culture and management team that allocates capital in an intelligent way, with the right incentives and a long-term approach. All of these qualities appeal to Marathon’s investment philosophy. The valuation remains attractive, trading at 1.4 times book value, a P/E of 14 times and a dividend yield of 3 per cent. If only more banks were built this way.15
 
- Capital cycle analysis is strongly influenced by J.A. Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction, namely that competition and innovation produce a constantly evolving economy and spur improvements in productivity. From this perspective, an economic recession serves a useful function as – to use a rather hackneyed image – the forest fire burns away the dead wood and weaker trees, allowing healthy young plants to grow and prosper. The decline in equity prices following the global financial crisis presented a variety of investment opportunities. Some of the best appeared in industries where capital was rapidly withdrawn after the bust and consolidation took place. The experience of Ireland’s banking sector described below is a good example of the capital cycle moving into a benign phase. It has not been all good news, unfortunately. Several of the pieces in this chapter comment on how European policymakers have prevented various industries – in particular the employment-heavy auto sector and the politically sensitive Continental banking sector – from consolidating. As a result, the operation of the capital cycle has been arrested. This is bad news for investors as the problems of excess capacity and weak profitability have not been addressed. It also augurs ill for the eurozone economy, which appears doomed to low productivity and weak economic growth. These problems have been exacerbated by the post-crisis policy of ultra-low interest rates which, by lowering funding costs, have allowed weak businesses – the corporate zombies – to continue limping along.
 
- Markets are now restrained by fear and conservatism. Tight liquidity is producing great pricing anomalies. Although the macroeconomic outlook is bleak, this is clearly discounted in equity prices and there would have to be a significant shock to jolt markets further. There have not been such compelling valuations for equities in a generation. From such a low base, it is difficult to believe that investors will not make good returns over any reasonable investment time frame.
 
- The situation at Irish Continental Group (ICG) is similar from a capital cycle perspective. This firm operates as Irish Ferries between Holyhead–Dublin and Pembroke–Rosslare, the shortest sea routes between Ireland and
 
- the UK. The crossing is quick enough for the operator to be able to offer a daytime return service for passengers and a nighttime one for freight to maximize the utilisation of the ships. The only other competitor on these routes is the privately owned Stena Line, as capacity constraints at the harbours mean that there is no room for a third operator. Despite the disadvantages of long-sea routes, the expansion in Irish trade over the last couple of decades encouraged additional capacity on the freight side, in particular, with the likes of P&O and the Danish conglomerate AP Moeller/Maersk (what is it about the Danes and Ireland?) among those adding long-sea capacity in freight. Following the downturn in the Irish economy, freight volumes dropped 4 per cent in 2008 and a further 14 per cent in 2009. Capacity on these longer routes which use more fuel and attract less premium freight has shrunk in response to losses. The downturn has also affected ICG, with freight roughly halving from a peak of 55 per cent of ferry revenues in 2007. Still, the company’s outsourced crewing arrangements give it a lower cost base, and volumes may be boosted as some of the loss-making ferry capacity is taken out and Ireland’s export-led economy begins to grow again. On the passenger side, where 60 per cent of the car traffic comes from UK passengers visiting
 
- Ireland, ICG saw only a small reduction in volumes last year, offset by higher yields. They should benefit from Ireland’s newfound competitiveness as a tourist destination (there is plenty of oversupply in the hotel market), as well as from a reduction in airline capacity: both Ryanair and Aer Lingus have scaled back capacity growth plans. ICG’s current fleet does not need renewing for another five to ten years, so any pick-up in activity should flow straight through to cash flow. In the meantime, ICG’s valuation looks extremely attractive, given its free cash flow yield of 10 per cent, while the chief executive’s 16 per cent stake in the business aligns the interests of management with shareholders. Roll on Ireland.3
 
- European banks are trading at a discount to tangible book, making them considerably cheaper than their US counterparts. Yet from a capital cycle perspective, the investment case for European banks is not clear-cut.
 
- One of the lessons from (bitter) experience of investing in banks in the US and UK is that when something as fundamental as the ultimate share count remains uncertain, the investment outcome is unpredictable.
 
- In essence, the capital cycle is not working in the banking sector in Europe, because the creative destruction that is required is politically unacceptable. Under the cover that the banks face liquidity problems and not a solvency crisis, eurozone governments are propping up their banks and are likely to continue doing so for years to come. For investors in banks with stronger balance sheets, returns are likely to be restrained by weak lending growth and excessive competition. Schizophrenic policymakers, who on the one hand exhort banks to lend more and on the other hand restrict lending capacity via onerous capital and liquidity requirements, make matters even worse. The threat of abrupt deleveraging in Europe has been replaced by the prospect of many years of slow and painful adjustment.
 
- From a capital cycle perspective, the above situations only become attractive when stock market valuations fall to a fraction of replacement cost and a path opens up for dealing with the excess capacity.
 
- While the first condition is close to being met in many European sectors, the prospects for the second appears dim. In previous downturns, capacity adjustment has come as a result of interest rates rising to choke off inflation, leading to widespread bankruptcies and industry consolidation. In the early 1990s, for example, our portfolios benefited from UK investments which survived the shake-out and prospered in the subsequent recovery, among them homebuilders (Taylor Woodrow), conglomerates (Trafalgar House) and advertisers (WPP). With interest rates low and set to remain so, and banks prepared to prop up weak businesses for fear of crystallising losses, monetary policy looks very unlikely to precipitate a major reallocation of resources. Indeed, it appears designed to head-off such a denouement. Under such circumstances, supply side restructuring via industry consolidation also looks like
 
- a long-shot, especially as many European industries are already quite consolidated and face anti-trust barriers.
 
- The credit boom created excess capacity in a wide array of global industries. If the capital cycle had been operating smoothly, the subsequent collapse in share prices and demand ought to have led to consolidation and capital withdrawal. This has not always been the case, despite notable exceptions in certain industries (e.g., US homebuilders). Errors of capital cycle analysis can lead to mistaken share purchases. Still, they help us adapt and evolve our investment discipline. With hindsight, our capital cycle approach has failed at times when we have underestimated the impact on industries of political and legal interference, disruptive technologies and globalisation. To this list of external factors, one can add the self-inflicted wounds of mismanagement. The most common problem is the failure of capital to exit industries with unacceptably poor returns. In the latest cycle, the forces of creative destruction have been moderated by aggressive monetary easing and low interest rates. This has allowed weak firms to continue in business, servicing what are likely to prove unsustainable debt levels. This situation contrasts with the end of previous economic cycles when interest rates have risen to stave off inflationary pressures leading to mass bankruptcy. The effect has been exacerbated in a number of territories (notably Europe) by forbearance on the part of banks whose appetite for further write-downs is already constrained in an environment of rising regulatory capital requirements. Matters tend to get worse when politicians enter the picture. Jobs in manufacturing, unlike financial services, hold a particular allure for the political classes in many developed economies. Lack of growth and overcapacity in mature industries would ordinarily require restructuring and consolidation, particularly as off-shoring is more prevalent in more basic, labour-intensive industries. Nostalgia for a past golden age of “honest” jobs and the politicians’ hunger for votes fuel protectionist instincts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Europe, where nationalistic urges are irresistible.
 
- New technologies often interfere with the smooth operation of the capital cycle. The Internet has wreaked havoc on many industries, including music, regional newspapers, book retailing and travel agencies. Marathon has suffered in a number of cases where the benefits of supply side consolidation in distressed sectors was insufficient to offset a secular decline in demand.5 Fortunately, the capital cycle approach is well attuned to identifying superior Internet business models which can sustain high returns of capital.6 An understanding of the power of network and scale effects that protect companies from the chill winds of competition has led to successful investments in a number of Internet businesses including Amazon, Priceline and Rightmove. (Although, to date Amazon has proven better at destroying profits in other businesses than in generating any for itself.)
 
- In recent years, capital cycle analysis has been more useful at picking stocks in companies which can maintain high returns than in finding opportunities among bombed-out industries recovering (or not) after a supply side restructuring. For the former, the investment case rests on whether competing capital can enter the sector and boost supply, eventually driving down industry returns. What we have seen in a number of cases is that dominant businesses often become more powerful when they have well managed, proprietary assets. Examples here include Nestlé, Unilever, and McDonald’s. It has helped that the durable cash flows generated by such businesses have the bond-like characteristics investors crave in the current environment of low interest rates. In short, the great strength of the capital cycle approach lies in its adaptability. The basic insight doesn’t change. Namely, both high and low returns are likely to revert to the mean as valuation influences corporate behaviour and brings about shifts in the supply side. In Marathon’s early years, our discipline was focused on finding stocks where the supply conditions were changing. More recently, the emphasis has shifted to identifying sectors and companies where the forces of competition are blunted and the process of mean reversion is drawn out.
 
- As 2013 draws to a close, the MSCI World Index is up over 20 per cent year-to-date and 130 per cent since March 2009. One oft-cited contributing factor to the equity market’s strength is the unprecedented monetary loosening undertaken since the financial crisis struck. When it comes to quantitative easing, the markets are being moved by two sets of beliefs. Firstly, there’s the view that monetary policy is going to stimulate the economy, which should help corporate profits. Secondly, low interest rates make equities look relatively more attractive than cash and fixed income. The trouble is that there is not much empirical nor theoretical support for either of these views.
 
- While seemingly supportive of the economy in the short-term, artificially low interest rates distort incentives and hence outcomes in the economy. So-called “zombie” firms are
 
- allowed to live on, while a low cost of funding means lower hurdle rates for new investment. Over time, if capital is not flowing freely to its most productive use, aggregate returns on capital and economic growth will decline.
 
- If the argument that quantitative easing benefits the economy is without much foundation, what about the notion that lower interest rates support higher equity valuations? In a world where debt yields little, equities at first glance appear relatively more attractive. In finance theory, a lower risk-free rate implies a lower cost of capital (unless the equity risk premium rises to offset this). And a lower cost of capital means a higher market P/E is justified. But it’s naïve to forget the reason why interest rates are so low in the first place, namely a weak economy, high leverage and the memory of a near catastrophic financial collapse in the rearview mirror. These factors might be expected to increase investors’ cost of equity assumptions warranting a lower P/E multiple.7 Overall, the continuation of extraordinary monetary policies should be a negative signal for equity holders. It implies that the real economy remains challenged and unable to withstand normal monetary conditions. This, in turn, suggests it is unlikely that the economy will be able to grow fast enough to reduce aggregate leverage to a more sustainable level. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of the public sector raises the risk of another debt crisis – this time a sovereign one – at some future stage. Finally, the longer interest rates remain suppressed, the greater the risk of distorted economic outcomes as falling hurdle rates for investment impact on aggregate returns on capital. The danger is clear – we face a lost decade of growth, this time in the Western world.
 
- Mr. Piketty can rest easy. In an age when risk-free assets yield little or nothing, the determination of the wealthy to earn somewhat more will, in due course, do more to restore equality than his proposed taxes. A free market solution to a political problem – who says capitalism is failing?
 
- Given the importance Marathon attaches to rational capital allocation and the need for supply-side discipline, it is not surprising that very few investments have been made in mainland Chinese equities over the years. Many of these firms are state-controlled. As a result, the efficiency of capital allocation and the interest of outside shareholders (particularly foreigners) tends to be subordinate to the state’s policy objectives. From both a top-down and bottom-up perspective, China can be understood by applying capital cycle analysis. At the macro level, the People’s Republic has pushed investment (as a share of GDP) to a higher level than ever seen before, even among former Asian high-flyers, such as South Korea and Japan. The result of rising inputs has predictably been a fall in factor productivity. This longstanding problem has been exacerbated by Beijing’s decision, taken in the heat of the Global Financial Crisis, to keep the economy growing by taking fixed asset investment to an even higher level. China also suffers from the ill effects of low interest rates which have resulted in the misallocation of capital, in particular among asset intensive industries. The result has been excess capacity and low returns in a number of different sectors ranging from steel manufacturing to shipbuilding. China’s combination of cheap capital, excess investment and the failure of capital to exit low return industries has rendered the Middle Kingdom something of a no-go area for capital cycle investors, such as Marathon. The same confluence of factors helps explain why shareholder returns in China have been so disappointing despite strong economic growth (although at the time of writing, the Chinese market is in a bubble, with the result that historic returns are temporarily elevated). To make matters worse, many of the Chinese companies which come to the market have dubious accounts and concocted operating histories. A number of questionable Chinese IPOs are examined critically in this chapter. Caveat investor! To justify its underweight position, Marathon has occasionally reported on some of the more curious practices of Chinese capitalism. A selection of these essays appears here.
 
- The part played by the foreign investment community in facilitating these scandalous Chinese IPOs is regrettable. Until our industry starts paying more attention to the protection of our clients’ capital, the emergence of one billion consumers is unlikely to deliver a positive investment return.
 
- Even the ugliest of assets purchased at the right price can make for a great investment.
 
- In the textbook example of a capital cycle, new capital is attracted into sectors with outsized profits. Eventually, this influx of capital causes capacity to overshoot, which hurts industry profitability and shareholder returns. This process is most marked in commodity businesses, whose products are undifferentiated. The opportunity to make really good investments tends to occur only after a turn in the cycle; that is, when capital begins to exit. Given that credit is a commodity, capital cycle analysis is as relevant for banks as it is for any other commodity business. There are, however, some differences. Because credit has no physical constraints, its increase is limited only by the amount of equity a bank can accumulate and the amount of leverage it
 
- can assume. This makes it easier for management to get carried away in the upward phase of the cycle. When the banking cycle turns, there needs to be a catch-up charge for the unrecognised sins of the past – that is, a spike in credit costs. Capacity also needs to exit through deleveraging; this comes in the form of shrinking balance sheets and mergers.
 
- Marathon’s capital cycle approach leads to a natural wariness of investment bankers. After all, Wall Street is in the business of supplying capital to hot areas of the stock market and generating fees from dubious financial engineering. Both these activities have always struck us as inimical to the interests of long-term shareholders. From the perspective of a bemused buy-side onlooker, it was clear to us that the typical Wall Street banker during the early years of the new millennium had little interest in protecting the interests of clients. Rather, the game of banking had become all about fee generation, regardless of the consequences. A whole chapter in Marathon’s previous publication, Capital Account (2005), was devoted to investment bank antics.1 Writing to clients back in September 2000, Marathon predicted that “the next round of excesses will be worse than the last. When large investment banks cannot be penalised for their greed and mistakes – because they are too large and too well connected to fail – it is only a matter of time before they challenge the system itself.” Unfortunately, these dark forebodings were realized eight years later when Lehman Brothers collapsed. In order to keep our clients abreast of the dangers posed by investment bankers, we decided to write every year, as Christmas approached, a satirical piece based on a fictional investment bank, Greedspin, and its lead banker, Stanley Churn. This practice began in December 2002 with a piece about the botched merger of an imaginary technology company with an “old economy” business, General Chocolate, which was published in Capital Account. The following pieces chart the career progression of the irrepressible Churn since that date.
 
- A satirical take on promotional corporate management
 
- First your team questioned the very idea that we should grow. This is very demotivating for my team, as you can imagine. That growth is good in itself should be self-evident. Your analysts, however, appeared to be suggesting that we shrink our operations back to a profitable core and, by buying back shares, maximize the return on capital employed.
 
- Shrinking the business, as Marathon suggests, would represent a failure of management imagination. Our bankers at Greedspin, who currently have a host of acquisition ideas, have never suggested downsizing. Growth is also essential if we are to achieve our career goals. Bigger companies are able to reward top talent and we need to get onto a level playing field. Buying back shares would reduce liquidity and make the investor’s job more difficult. Surely you can see that. We are very proud of the fact that 10 per cent of General Chocolate’s stock is now traded each month.
 
- Yet still we think we can increase this level by improving the news flow. We are currently considering offering a new “instant guidance” service for shareholders that will be automatically triggered with every percentage point movement in the cocoa price.
 
- The fund management industry still doesn’t “geddit.” The new leverage paradigm has passed most of these guys by and they’re still using ridiculous cost of capital metrics and debt structures left over from the past. Don’t they understand what little you need to do to enhance earnings per share? Just add debt! And the buy-side fools so confuse value and price, that when we say “20 per cent premium,” they scream “deal!” Their pockets are ripe for picking!
 
- Today the outlook appears bleak not just for Greedspin but for the very future of capitalism. However, if anything on Wall Street is certain – if history has taught us anything – it’s that challenges mean new fee opportunities.
