- Yet for all the explosive brushes with danger I survived in the bush, the greatest threat came not from any animal, natural disaster, or mechanical mishap, but from other human beings. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=127))

- Uncle John was eighteen years old when his father died; my dad was fifteen. The two boys were told by their mother’s financial advisers to sell the land that my great-grandfather had been “so damn romantic over” and “knuckle down” to university degrees and conventional lives in the city. Why not sell mining equipment, the family business? They tried; then they squirmed; then they threw down their toys and refused.

- well as their love of their father and of the wild, they decided they would hold on to the land. They had nothing but the idea of a home and a dream out in that wild landscape, and a determination to build them both one brick at a time. We call my gran “the mother of Londolozi,” because when her teenage boys pled their case to her, she never hesitated: “If you want to keep it, just keep it.” It’s difficult to convey the vastness of this undertaking. The land was situated in a wilderness roughly the size of ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=509))

- Switzerland. The previous tenants had fenced out the wildlife and drained the wetlands. Dave and John were just kids; how on earth could they hold on to the land and support their newly widowed mother? A neighbor had started a game camp, so they just figured they’d go into the safari business too, leading groups who wanted to hunt or do wildlife photography. They had no real plan. They simply pulled the name Londolozi, which means “protector of all living things,” out of a Zulu dictionary and set to work. It’s at this point in the story that I always stop my father. “But weren’t you worried?” I can’t imagine being that young and shouldering so much responsibility.

- Young upstarts that they were, Dad and Uncle John realized—not so much in a political as in a practical way—that the best way to make Londolozi work was to have the Shangaans working beside them, and to hell with apartheid, the law of the land instituted in 1948 that segregated blacks and whites. Under apartheid, black people were denied the vote. They were issued identity cards according to the color of their skin; sometimes family members were separated. Interracial marriages were outlawed. Most horrifically, blacks were forcibly removed to resettlement areas, including the infamous township of Soweto, which became the direst of slums. Uncle John was born in 1950, Dad in 1954. They grew up in an all-white suburb in Johannesburg where ignorance was standard operating practice. Black people did all the hard labor and cleaned your shoes; this was the norm, and as children they simply accepted it. White people all over South Africa were complicit in the crime of segregation through their silence and acceptance. Yet out in the bush, the law of the land didn’t exist. When Dad and Uncle John hunted a wounded lion in thick bush with Winnis, all playing fields were leveled. If the hunter doesn’t shoot or the tracker doesn’t track or one of the party tries to run away instead of defending the group, someone can get his throat ripped out. When men face danger together, they lose the frivolous definitions of the world and simply become people who must work in harmony in order to survive. In the bush, the two brothers’ view and experience of race simply didn’t align with South African law. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=527))

- Dad and Uncle John realized the next step in their mission to restore the land and protect its inhabitants. They decided to focus first on a species even scarcer than leopards. “The biggest endangered species in Londolozi was the cheetah,” Dad told me. “We decided we needed to save the world by raising money to save it.” The logo of the Endangered Wildlife Trust at the time—a cheetah with the tagline “The cheetah … racing to extinction”—had made a huge impression on him. Dad and Uncle John formed the Londolozi Game Trust. They’d read that cheetahs were going to be shot in Namibia, so they decided to raise the funds to rescue three. They managed to attract enough attention that by the time they brought the cheetahs to Londolozi, the press was waiting ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=571))

- to cover the hoopla. Dad and Uncle John were ecstatic, convinced that the publicity would bring attention to the plight of the animals and help build their safari business. With great fanfare, they raised the gates on the cheetahs’ cages. The cheetahs shot out and bolted the area, never to be seen again. The Great Cheetah Rescue was a huge bust. Why had they fled? Why had the sable antelopes likewise disappeared, while wildebeests, waterbucks, and elephants were also declining at Londolozi? Dad and Uncle John went searching for information, and one person’s name kept cropping up again and again: that… ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=576))

- had gotten himself enrolled in university after he drew a picture of a butterfly with such profound detail and brilliance that the leading professor of natural sciences there allowed him into the course without a diploma. He became one of the original game rangers and conservationists who worked with Dr. Ian Player, the famous South African conservationist, to restore the rhino populations in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve. A genius naturalist, Tinley got dropped into the greatest wildernesses in Africa by various conservation groups and worked almost exclusively by himself for months at a time, mapping the ecology and biodiversity of these areas. He’d been instrumental in fighting the South African government when officials had wanted to put a fence through the Damaraland and Etosha reserves in northern Namibia. Later he went to what is now Gorongosa National Park, in central Mozambique, and spent months mapping its waterways. It was there that he developed his profound understanding of the importance of preserving the moisture content of the soil in a reserve, information he would later bring to the restoration of the land at Londolozi. In the late 1970s, when civil war broke out in Mozambique, the Renamo rebel group… ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=582))

- of specialization. “Don’t listen to that radical,” Dad and Uncle John were told. “He’s way out of the mainstream.” Naturally, they sought him out. When they eventually got Tinley to Londolozi and walked out onto the land with him, he was able to show them how animals and the land were intricately interconnected. Drawing on his knowledge of the water courses and soil types, he could explain why a certain tree grew in a certain area. He was an artist of the landscape. Tinley scoffed at the cheetah project, however: “The trouble with you guys is, all you want is to get your picture on the social… ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=592))

- Dad and Uncle John rose to their full heights and said, “No, we’re not!” Tinley harrumphed and walked them around Londolozi and said, “Look at the scrubland. Why do you think you’ve got that here?” “Because that’s how it is,” Dad said. Tinley frowned. “Follow me.” He walked them to the lowest point of the land, where all the water would flow down to because the grass cover on the slopes was gone; cattle had overgrazed the grass and trampled it. Without grass, rain hit bare soil and ran off. Only deep-rooted shrubs could survive in that arid soil, so the animals that used to… ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=598))

- many you bring in, they’ll simply bugger off,” Tinley told them. “You’ve got to partner with the land.” They needed to clear the scrub and stick some of the uprooted bushes into the knickpoints, blocking them like a plug stoppers a bathtub drain, to hold some of the water back. Once they fixed the water, the grass would grow back naturally. “Make nature your partner; follow her master plan. If you fix the land, the animals will come,” Tinley promised them. Tinley changed Dad and Uncle John’s lives, widened their vision. They slowly began to restore the wetlands that had existed before the cattle farms… ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=604))

- that unless local people see benefit from the wildlife, they have no reason to protect it. A lot of people attacked Dad and Uncle John’s vigorous approach to repairing land as too heavy-handed because they used a bulldozer to clear thick scrub, but years later they have been proved right. And when Nelson Mandela visited Londolozi, he endorsed the brothers’ vision of harmony between people of all races, animals, and the land. Something amazing happened: the animals started to flow back onto the restored land, just as Tinley had promised. They began to lose their fear.

When Dad told me the cheetah story, we were standing in a beautiful clearing where the land falls away for miles down to the river. All across the plain, impalas and wildebeests freckled the land. “This used to be a thick mat of thorn,” Dad said. “If we saw a bird out here, it would be exciting.

- Dad taught me Winnis’s method for dealing with the heat. You started out in the morning with a full canteen of water, but you never glugged it. You took only the tiniest of sips, enough to moisten your mouth, throughout the day, so that you’d have an almost-full canteen of water by the time the sun went down. You drank most of your water at night, away from the day’s heat. “Only townies need to drink all their water,” Dad told me. We were bush people. Bush people tramped around on sore feet with no water.

- Hunting had its place, and we learned that. And then one day it no longer did. As the two brothers worked the land in the early days of building Londolozi, they started to feel it responding. Dad and Uncle John saw more game, and their mind-set shifted toward conservation rather than hunting. They would occasionally see leopards, which would flee immediately. Then, at the end of a day spent clearing a thick snaggle of bush that encroached on the land, Dad saw a leopard calmly walking in the road. It looked at him but didn’t bolt. “It felt like that leopard was almost carrying a message to me that I was on the right track,” Dad told me. “My reward for all that work that day was the chance to see her for a few minutes.” Uncle John, meanwhile, met a different female leopard and slowly began developing a relationship with her while filming her. He, too, lost his desire to hunt. Once Dad and Uncle John started to see the benefits of partnering with nature, they could no longer separate the well-being of the animals from their own well-being; they were bound together. They felt what everyone would feel given the time and the chance: that we are ultimately no different from the other creatures. Our survival and welfare depend on theirs, economically as well as spiritually. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=701))

- Londolozi was running well by the time I came along. I often wonder how my father must have felt staring down the barrel of so much responsibility at age fifteen. There must have been days when he would sit out in the bush by himself, Londolozi’s reservation ledger glaring up at him, its pages as empty as the hollow in his stomach.

- the moments when he felt at his lowest, through the silence of that blue African sky would come the bateleur eagle, its stumpy tail pivoting unsteadily behind its squat body and black-and-white wings, its red beak jutting beneath a ruffled black hood, totally at ease with its own instability, elegant in it. In that bird, my father felt his father’s guiding presence watching over him. The bateleur eagle became the first emblem of Londolozi. With a name derived from the French word for “acrobat,” these birds pump their short wings like walkers steadying themselves on a tightrope. Dad taught my sister, Bron, and me to treat the bateleur eagle as sacred, to honor it and to let it guide us. This is the magic of my father: he’s practical to his core, yet with a deeper vision ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=721))

- and wisdom. He imparted to me and Bron at a young age an almost mystical sense of the animals as our ancestors and family. What I learned from my father and uncle is that you don’t always have a clear road to your goal; in fact, you hardly ever do. But that’s no reason not to start. Have the confidence that you’ll hack it out along the way. That confidence allowed their mission to evolve from hunting to creating and helping others build a spiritual connection to the land.

- “No, Bonna, but just listen,” Uncle John said. “You’re growing up in Africa. Can’t just be mono-focused. You’ve got to look at the whole situation. When stuff goes wrong, you don’t cry about it; you pull yourself up and keep going.” Uncle John never missed an opportunity to give us a true bush education. His methods could be harsh, and Mom had been very upset with him as Bron had sobbed, “Jonno robbed us!” but to be fair, his training worked. Uncle John tried to prepare us for the harsh realities of African life. The Sand River at Londolozi has always been sacred to my family. Long before in-ground pools by manicured gardens made their appearance, the river was ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1106))

- where Uncle John would lead me and Bronwyn on hot summer days. Hours could go by seemingly in minutes as we swam and played games of dropping twigs and branches into the current and running downstream to see whose won the race. Sometimes Uncle John would let us “shoot the rapids.” We’d release ourselves into the wild current, and after a tumble downstream, he would capture us in his burly arms. Once my uncle missed me at the collection point at the end of the rapid and I washed downriver, choking and sputtering. When he finally pulled me out, I was shaking with fright. I got a brusque reprimand instead of the hoped-for comfort. Shaking me gently to be sure I was listening, Uncle John warned me, “In the bush you never panic.

When Bron and I played in the sand pit outside the kitchen, we had to be under constant surveillance in case a snake tried to slither into the area. When one of us cried, my father would fix us with a withering stare and say, “Stop it—you’ll attract the lions in.” My mother would politely pour tea in the ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1131))

We’re basically an unflappable family, although when a deadly mamba dropped onto my sister’s cot, Mom immediately promoted Simon from gardener to full-time guardian. While other kids were getting yelled at or lectured by their parents for losing the TV remote or not putting away their video games, what stopped me and Bron in our tracks was my parents’ low but insistent “danger voice,” which meant we had to snap to attention without question. Dad’s cardinal law was: Get information before you act. Whenever I saw a dangerous animal, every fiber of me ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1135))

He would drop down onto one knee behind me so that his mouth was close to my ear. “Slowly, Boydie, assess,” Dad would tell me. “Look at him. Does he notice you? Is he interested in you? Aggressive? Figure that out first.” I would study the potential predator. “Okay, now that you have information, start to chart your retreat.” ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1141))

- push it in Africa for only so long.” Our upbringing has given us a lifelong habit of being on the lookout for where things might go wrong. Even now we’ll be at a pool party amid the merry tinkling of ice in glasses and the chatter of guests mingling, laughing, drinking—and we’ll be prepping for the inevitable disaster, thinking, “Right. If this one gets too pissed and falls into the pool, we can do this, then this, then that.” This is the nature of growing up in the safari business. There is such a thing as being too self-sufficient. It’s hard to be lighthearted and in the moment when you’re always making contingency plans. Bron and I bathed in that culture of coping and getting on with it. By our standards, we weren’t in danger. We were Africans.

He’d taken to strapping on swimming goggles to protect himself, a bizarre look that failed to endear him to our visitors. “I can’t take another game drive,” Uncle John moaned. “Eh, this is bullshit. I’m burnt out. If I see another guest, I’m gonna kill him. How do we get fewer visitors?” Dad pondered this. “If you want fewer people, double the price.” “Okay, let’s double the price. As of tomorrow, we’re doubling it.” John immediately called the reservationist. “Liz, if you get any more inquiries, tell them it’s ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1272))

He has dedicated his entire life to conservation efforts, especially by documenting animals in the wild, long before Steve Irwin made being close to dangerous animals cool. And when I say “dedicated his entire life,” I mean it literally. When Uncle John—also known as ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1292))

When he befriended some Masai in Kenya’s Masai Mara, it grew into a seventeen-year relationship, and the documentaries he shot there—Savage Instinct, Troubled Water, and The Super Predators—have won international attention for the plight of nearly extinct animals.

When he decided he wanted to make a movie about raising two leopard cubs, Little Boy and Little Girl, he ended up starring in it himself, with Brooke Shields. I can’t say that Running Wild was the perfect showcase for Uncle John’s dramatic skills, but it did feature some amazing footage of baby leopards, not to mention a splendid scene of John throwing himself into the Mara River and trying in vain to rescue the male cub from the jaws of a crocodile, all the time wailing, “Come back, my beautiful boy, come back!” ([Location 1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=1416))

Originally, not wanting to cash in on their relationship, she sent her request through his foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund. Weeks dragged by as her message got bogged down in bureaucracy. Finally, my mother decided to throw caution to the wind. She phoned the security desk at the Union Buildings and cheerfully talked someone into giving her Madiba’s home number. Such was life in the new democracy.

- The Masai are passionate about two things: their cows and their children, in that order. The greatest honor they can bestow on you is to offer you a drink of cow’s blood and milk. A cow is pulled out of the herd and held down as it bellows for the safety of its companions. Then a warrior expertly shoots an arrow into its neck. A plume of perfect lipstick-red blood shoots into the air and is captured in a gourd. The cow quickly stops bleeding and is returned to the herd. Meanwhile, milk is added to the gourd, turning the concoction into a beautifully viscous teeth-staining red syrup. This is then handed to you with a loving smile. You drink it while making a big show of receiving the honor: lots of holding the gourd high up in the air, smacking your lips, and saying, “Mmmmmm” and “What an honor!,” all the time trying not to vomit up your spleen.

She was gutted to discover that the duck-billed peculiarity was perhaps fifteen inches long. “It’s like a swimming rat with a duck’s face glued on,” she said, sulking.

Then it starts to look like magic. After I saw the leopard in the fire, when my soul realized, despite all the grief and trauma, that it wanted to heal, it became like an animal that instinctually knew how to find its way out of the wilderness. It began to conjure imagery of better times as tracks to a healed place. It began to pace, looking for a fresh scent on the breeze. There was the slightest glimmer of intentionality; I cared about finding my way home. I did what my animal brethren did in that situation: I began an inner and outer pacing.

But a hippo had followed the rhino and crossed the path, and suddenly I was following the hippo’s pie-plate prints instead, just similar enough to lead me off course. “Go back to where you started,” Elmon told me. “Go back to where the track is freshest.” So, where was my track the freshest?

For months I paced, suspended in a place of complete uncertainty, trying to find the next track. I had no idea of what I was meant to be doing, but that was all right for now. Then Martha called. “Come to Arizona,” she said. “There’s ([Location 3740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=3740))

- most innovative tiger conservation project in the world. Instead it’s my one-man crusade.” It was dark in the room except for the candlelight, and Uncle John seemed cast in shadow and in light. “Living with tigers, teaching them to hunt, walking with big cats has been the greatest experience of my life after my children,” he said. “I would take ten more court cases if it meant being able to help these cats.” After all these years, he remains a role model. I envy his resilience. As I left, he said a strange thing to me out of the blue: “Buddy, remember, if anything ever happens to me, I want you and Bron to help look after my kids.” Was this man with nine lives finally feeling his own mortality?

- day, month after month, and the last few years had been hard. When I visited, perhaps he saw an opportunity to lay down some kind of plan for the future. This was his way of telling me that he saw me now as an equal, that he loved me and trusted me. A few weeks later I got an email from him: Buddy— If I die, please bury me down at Plaque Rock. At my burial, please make sure there is lots of singing and dancing. People must feel free to express themselves. Songs and poetry. Stories. Look after your Dad. Tread lightly on the earth.

- about survival and triumph: malaria, a brush with paralysis from the helicopter crash, the wear and tear of the court case. Perhaps my uncle felt his life of adventure was catching up with him. Part of my growing up was seeing the people I loved, once so vital and invincible, now with more life behind them than ahead of them. The nature of adulthood is realizing that you’re not immortal. At the end of my twenties, I already understood that I didn’t have infinite time. It seemed it had taken Uncle John deep into his sixties to get there. “Look after your Dad.” This was how he said he loved his brother. In taking a moment to think about his death, my uncle had expressed a lot about who he is in life. From an original pair of tigers, JV ([Location 3938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R14&location=3938))

- has overseen the birth of several litters. Those tigers have all learned to hunt and are living wild in the large fenced-off area. To see a tiger strolling across the grassland changes everything. People from all over the world make pilgrimages to the middle of nowhere to visit Uncle John’s tiger project, and they’re always blown away by the sight of these exceptional cats. But what they don’t see when they drive off in the late afternoon light is a man completely solitary for hundreds of miles in every direction, playing Bob Dylan songs on his guitar, alone with his commitment to his cause and the stillness of the Karoo night.

- I’ve learned that nothing is worth doing if it cannot be done from a place of deep peace. If we want to restore the planet, we must first restore ourselves. I believe that you find your way to your right life, your mission, the same way you find an animal. First, quiet your heart and be still. Then find the fresh track and be willing to follow it. You don’t need to see the whole picture; you only need to see where to take the next step. Life isn’t about staying on track; it’s about constantly rediscovering the track.
