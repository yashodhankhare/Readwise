- “As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=94))

- his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.” ~HARRINGTON EMERSON   This quote basically alludes to the age-old idiom that if you give a man a fish, he can feed his family for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he can feed his family for a lifetime. In this case, it’s more like if you can teach someone to understand why a certain technique is applicable is a certain situation, you can teach them to understand how best to respond to their horse in all situations.

- The first twelve chapters of this book are the original twelve tried and true principles that I quantified year after year, that cover all the techniques that all good horseman use. The thirteenth chapter, however, is a principle that is not commonly used, but is a personal belief of mine. It is the principle of Relationship Before Horsemanship. Horsemanship in this case refers to the techniques that good horsemen and trainers use to create willing partners of horses. When you work with horses on a deeper level, almost a spiritual or soul level, you find that techniques alone leave you feeling a little like a master manipulator. I have found that creating connection first, true connection through attunement, by communicating your awareness of the smallest things, take you and your horse on a journey that will change who you are as a person, ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=100))

- to the benefit of not only your horse, but all sentient beings you encounter. This thirteenth Chapter may be last in the sequence of this book, but it is the most important. It makes everything else easier.  This book is not a how-to manual, it may list some methods in the context of illustrating a principle, but that is just to give you a better understanding of that principle. It is meant to be read, pondered, experimented with on your horse, only to have to come back later and read it again, and this time come to your own deeper understanding of the principle. “The moment you feel you have arrived, you’re starting the journey again.” ~ JAY SHETTY ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=106))

- This chapter will help you understand how your emotions, thoughts, and internal energy states affect your horse. I encourage you to do some self-reflection. Much of what we want to change about our horses (and often other people) is just a reflection of our own struggles.

- The first Principle of Training is the Work with the Horse You Have Today principle. To avoid the dreaded horsemanship heartache, we must be able to accept things as they are without judgment or expectation. When working with the horse in front of you, as opposed to the horse you had at the barn an hour ago, or at the show last week, or even the horse you will have next month, you must be able to leave your expectations at the barn door. None of the other principles mentioned in this book will work if you’re not working with the horse you have today.

- A bid for connection is any attempt from one partner to another for attention, affirmation, affection, or any other positive connection. The Gottmans say there are three ways a bid for connection can be received, two of which are relationship breakers. The two that are detrimental to the relationship are called turning away and turning against. The one that creates better relationships is called turning towards. Now let's insert these into a horse nipping. If you think when a horse nips that he is trying to bite you, you might respond by punishing him, which would be turning against him. You may respond by shrinking back from him, which would be turning away from him. But if you view the nipping as a bid for connection, as a way of checking in to see if you are present, and engage safely with their muzzle, then that is turning towards. If we remove the ‘biting’ label and investigate why the horse is nipping, we can address the problem as it really is, rather than what we have told ourselves it is. Once we strip back the judgments and expectations surrounding us, we can work towards fixing the root of the issue. If we engage with a nippy horse with our hands in a way that fulfils their need for connection, while also protecting ourselves against dangerous behavior, we can solve the issue rather than perpetuate it.

- The domestication of horses began only 6,000 years ago in the steppes of modern-day Ukraine and West Kazakhstan. While we have successfully bred modern horses to tolerate us, they still hold millions of years of evolutionary intelligence inside of them. A simple understanding of these deep-rooted adaptations and behaviors will allow us to use them to our benefit in the training process. In the wild, from the time they are born until the time they die, horses are rarely out of the eyesight of another horse. Their very survival relies on the senses of the other members in the herd, forming a community radar, so to speak. If you’ve ever seen a horse laying down sleeping in a pasture, there is almost always another horse standing up nearby. The one lying down implicitly trusts the judgment of the one standing up to warn them if any threat is perceived.

- The ability to sense the intentions of other animals is fundamental to understanding how we can better interact with horses. From the distance of multiple football fields, these zebras were able to discern my non-threatening intention and easily return to homeostasis, which is essentially the stable equilibrium animals return to after physical distress, such as running away from predators. In this case, once the zebras recognized there was no threat, their body easily shifted back to a relaxed state.

- Zebras, horses, and most other four-legged land herbivores can sleep standing up, but it’s more of a light doze. Horses need to lie down to be able to have REM sleep (REM is the lightest stage of sleep for humans, but horses' sleep cycles are unique). While I’m unsure how much REM zebras need, horses need 30-40 minutes of it every 24 hours. To clarify, the zebras standing around weren’t on high alert, as the ones laying down would not be able to rest very well with that sort of tension in the air, but they were not unaware either. They weren’t grazing while the others were sleeping, they weren’t nuzzling each other, nor were they daydreaming about the green grass over the mountain. They were simply in an ever-present state of awareness, neither concerned with what might happen nor dwelling on what has happened. This mental state is almost unimaginable for us humans, who live most of our lives planning for the future or replaying the past. The ability to be in a constant state of awareness and be able to read the energy of the other herd members, is part of their evolutionary security system. When the herd’s energy changes, the sleeping zebra would immediately become aware of it and rouse themselves from their slumber before they became a juicy zebra snack. No matter what horse you work with today, they will operate within their evolutionarily adapted behaviors. The nature of the horse is not something we can hope to change within our lifetime. The herd community radar is one of the most fundamentally important concepts in all the connection-based training. Luckily for us, we don’t have to dress up like horses to be accepted into their herd and create these trusting connections. All we must be able to do is consistently communicate to our horses that they can trust our judgment, in case danger were to ever present itself. Whenever we are around our horses we must never forget about their evolutionary past and how it affects their decision-making process.

- The most spiritual of the ancient Hindu practices is called karma yoga. In essence, karma yoga is about focusing on a task, with no thought for the outcome of that task. It’s about being present, and only being focused on and concerned with what is happening in ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=213))

- the now, with no attachment to the fruits of your actions or decisions. It is said that karma yoga is a path to reaching spiritual liberation through work. Ray Hunt repeatedly used the phrase “They know when you know, and they know when you don’t.” I used to think that was just a corny saying that meant a horse knows when you don’t know what you are doing. Kind of like how you can tell a greenhorn, a novice horse person, from a mile away. This was a big misunderstanding of mine. It doesn’t say what you know, it says when you know. I failed to understand that saying until I was reading an article by someone who had worked with Ray a lot. In the article, the author said that you need to be aware of your horse at all times. You need to know what their feet are doing, what their eyes are doing, what their ears are doing, what their tail is doing, how they are breathing, and what their muzzle is doing, because “They know when you know, and they know when you don’t.” They know when you are present with your mind at the moment: when you’re not thinking about your kids, your job, or what’s for dinner. This lack of attention is one of the biggest causes of problems I see people committing, and it is quite honestly one of the most easily preventable.

- This may sound mildly crazy, but what I’m saying here is that horses can essentially read your mind. They know if you are fully aware of what’s happening around you or if your mind is elsewhere. When we are around our horses, we’re either acting as a part of the herd, part of their security system, or we are not. If we are in the moment, aware of our surroundings, our body, and the way our horse is feeling, they can become relaxed in our presence, knowing that if anything were to happen, we would be paying enough attention to be able to relay any important information through a change in our energy.

- While it may have seemed odd at first, the whole idea that horses can read our minds doesn’t mean they can hear the little voice inside our heads; it simply means they are aware of whether we are present. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=249))

- The human prefrontal cortex is one of the most advanced systems in the universe. The development of human language and society has slowly allowed for humans to switch from reactive, instinctually driven animals into calculating, responsive demigods who can predict weather patterns and create economic systems. Modern humans no longer need to rely as heavily on external body language as we now have the ability to speak, using over seven thousand invented languages, and can message people on Facebook who may be physically thousands of miles away. Horses are unable to effectively communicate how they feel verbally, and they fortunately haven’t figured out how to use Facebook yet. They can’t ask the lion if it’s just going for a walk to the watering hole or if it’s planning on having them for dinner tonight. Horses still rely on the external body language of other animals to determine what is going on, and they are very good at it. One of the major disconnects I see between people and their horses is the fact that people forget horses can sense the feelings we are holding onto inside of ourselves, and how that gets displayed externally (tight shoulders, strong gaze, etc.) If we want a truly deep connection with our horse, we must work on who we are internally.

- When you give a horse your undivided attention, they begin to feel comforted and safe in your presence. I really learned how cognizant horses are of our awareness a few years ago at a three-day clinic in Texas. One of the participants, Hannah, had a nine-year-old mustang named Cody. After being with Hannah for six years, Cody was generally well-behaved, except for the odd problem of randomly bolting. It wasn’t that he always bolted: it was random and seemed to have no trigger. Solving the issue of bolting horses is usually about discovering the fear or phobia that causes them to bolt, then slowly expanding their comfort around that particular trigger in what psychologists would call exposure therapy or successive approximation. Successive approximation works by slowly introducing the smallest part of the trigger that you can recreate, and progressively increase the intensity of the trigger until the horse is comfortable. If you don’t know what the trigger is, however, the problem is very hard to solve. Sometimes the cases are more to do with an underlying level of anxiety or tension that can easily turn into a bolt. These erratic cases involve a more ground-up approach to remove the worry in the early stages of the training process.

- The ability for horses to push off with both hind feet has been one of their greatest survival tactics for thousands of years. Their muscular rumps provide immediate access to enormous power. However, for horses to effectively use this power, their back feet need to be parallel. If a horse steps their hind feet together or behind when disengaging it is a serious indicator that there is a level of tension or stress, they are holding onto the nuclear option of bolting, bucking, jumping, kicking, etc. When a horse disengages and steps their inside leg up and across their outside leg it is an indication that they are comfortable enough to ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=301))

- Cody was the eye-opening moment where I realized the importance of our awareness and how it allows horses to feel safe around us. Once I realized that Cody wasn’t ready for what I was trying to do, I had to get rid of my expectations. I had to remove myself from the situation and figure out what Cody needed in the moment. I was working with the horse I had that day. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=358))

- Horses are acutely aware of both our internal and external energy states. Internally our intention, patience and mood set the tone for how our horses interpret what's going on in our minds. Externally our body posture, facial expressions, and tone of voice convey all the information our horses need. Often, our horse problems are reflections of problems going on with ourselves. In his controversial book, The Sense of Being Stared At, English author and renowned biologist Rupert Sheldrake explores the intricacies of the mind and discovers that mammals have perceptive abilities which are stronger than many of us could ever imagine. One review of the book on Amazon proclaimed a rather apt summary:   “Sheldrake's genius is taking commonly reported tales of human and animal abilities that challenge accepted scientific wisdom and developing simple ways of testing those claims under scientifically valid conditions. As with any series of experiments, especially those investigating controversial topics, they gradually evolve into ever-more sophisticated designs to eliminate possible flaws.” In one part of the book, Sheldrake talks about undercover police doing surveillance on people and how they suggest you don’t look directly at the person you are trying to follow. The primal prey-predator relationship is so bound in our ancestral DNA that the intentional gaze of another human can be sensed, often subconsciously, by the body.

- Holding what I now believe to be true, I believe it’s more your intention when carrying the gun rather than the gun itself. He only ever carried the gun when he had the intention of shooting a crow with it. While this may sound like hocus pocus to some of us, I have witnessed several interactions with horses and other animals that give credence to this thought. None of these have been more eye-opening than a simple trick I witnessed at a Joe Wolter clinic. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=442))

- Revered riding instructor and inventor of Centered Riding, Sally Swift, calls this technique the “soft eyes.” Using your soft eyes means using your peripheral vision along with your own focused vision. When you do this correctly all the muscles in your face and neck release, sometimes triggering a release down through the rest of the body as well. When Joe could get the clinic participants not to stare directly at the cow they wanted, but instead to just be aware of the whole herd with soft eyes, the cattle didn’t scatter. It really made me reconsider just how much impact we can have on animals just by where and how we gaze upon them.

- This goes to show how much our intention and focus affect our horses and being aware of this can save us from having issues that we blame on the horse. Living in the Past, Living in the Future For the most part of our daily lives, we humans are either thinking of things that need to get done or stuck worrying about something that happened in the past. It’s important to lay out this concept before we dive into how it relates to our horses. I’m sorry to break it to you, but there is no such thing as the past, and the future does not exist. The only thing we can control and experience is the present moment. We can dwell on the past or worry about the future, but that only happens inside of our heads; it doesn’t materialize in the external world, despite the anxiety we display because of our internal struggles. “If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the moment.” ~LAO TZU There are two ways in which you can not Work with The Horse You Have Today. The first is when you are living in the past, operating on what your horse used to do or did five minutes ago. It may even be that you are holding onto what you used to do, or what you did five minutes ago. Holding on to the past acts as a roadblock toward future growth and change. Horses don’t hold grudges and they don’t dwell on past experiences. Sure, they might remember to avoid the watering hole that made their stomach rumble for a couple of days, but they don’t have any story attached to it. Holding on to the past also includes stereotypes for the breed of horse you have. You know the common mindset of “Arabians are crazy, so I expect it’s perfectly normal for my Arabian to be spooky and anxious,” or for the gender of your horse. In the UK, it’s frequently said that a red mare can be hard to handle and obnoxious. As you read through this book you will realize that responding to your horse as if they are doing what they have done in the past will prevent you from doing what’s required in the present. The reason living in the past is so detrimental to your training is that you will miss opportunities to reward behaviors as they change. Expecting to run into the same problem you had previously encountered will only increase your chances of manifesting that problem. If you bring your past experiences into your training session, you will end up asking too little, too much, too late, or too soon. Due to your preoccupation with these past experiences, your horse will not respond the way you want, and you may respond with the negative emotions of frustration, annoyance, or anger. These feelings will create a loop of poor horsemanship and dissatisfaction. To move forward with your training, you must be willing to show up for your horse daily with a clean slate. You must get rid of the limiting beliefs you have about yourself and your horse to rewrite your future together. The second kind of not Working with The… ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=468))

- This whole idea started at a clinic in Australia when a participant, who is a very good horsewoman, asked me “Do you ever mentally picture what you want your horse to do before you ask them to do it?” When I replied that I didn’t, she said “You ought to try it sometime; you might be surprised what happens.” ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=496))

- It has to do with the second type of not Working With The Horse You Have Today: living in the future. When being around and riding their horse, many people are rightfully concerned about getting injured, or possibly killed. They become very good at mentally picturing what they don’t want to happen. If the enlightened horse-people who hung out with Ray Hunt and the Dorrances can mentally picture what they do want to happen and the horse responds to it, it makes sense that it can also work conversely for people who are picturing what they don’t want to happen. I’ve had many people at clinics who, when they get in a slight bit of trouble while riding a horse, freeze and are unable to make the corrections that will get them out of trouble. Often they overreact, which makes the situation worse. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=510))

- My good friend Jane Pike from New Zealand, who is a Body-mind-nervous system Integration Coach, says that you cannot move away from something, you can only move toward something. In other words, you cannot think about what you don’t want, you can only think about what you do want. Try this. Right now, I don’t want you to picture a big blue tree in your head. While not thinking about the big blue tree, I also don’t want you to think about a yellow bird sitting at the top. I still don’t want you to think about a big blue tree with a yellow bird in it, and I also don’t want you to think about some green grass at the foot of that big blue tree with the yellow bird in it. What mental picture did you just have? Of course, you pictured a big blue tree with a yellow bird in it with some green grass at the base. You can’t help but picture a big blue tree. You can, however, picture something else. Picture say, holding an orange basketball. I want you to feel the ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=534))

Of course, you saw a basketball, you may have even been able to feel the dimples on its surface or the black lines in the leather or smell the worn rubber. What you didn’t see was a big blue tree. You can’t move away or not think about the big blue tree, but you can move toward, or think about, the orange basketball.

- In the case of horses, the only thing you can really control is you. Just like throwing a baseball, you can only control the outcome by controlling yourself. You must be able to control your thoughts because they control your actions. If your thoughts see disaster, your body stiffens up and prepares itself for what the mind has prophesied. If you can focus on what you need to do to control the outcome, not only does your body respond more calmly, but your mind has now replaced a Big Blue Tree thought with an Orange Basketball thought, giving it clarity and purpose.

- It starts out with Jane talking about believing in yourself, and it all seems normal for about the first ten minutes. Suddenly, the Jane in my right ear kept talking and a different Jane popped up in my left ear. For the next twenty-five minutes, there were two different Jane conversations going on, one in my right ear and one in my left. I diligently did my homework listening to this audio: sometimes I’d nod off, and sometimes I’d stay connected, but I didn’t really feel much of a change. At this time, I was at the beginning of a major personal development journey. I had been going to group therapy classes that were supposed to develop one's emotional intelligence. One of the exercises the class assigned was to become aware of and count judgmental thoughts. It was suggested to get a clicker, such as the ones you see air hostesses or bouncers use to count the number of people either getting on the plane or entering a nightclub. Another suggestion was to place some pebbles in a pocket on one side of your body, and as you notice a judgmental thought you shift a pebble to the other side, and at the end of the day, you count the pebbles. I figured I’d probably have three or four judgmental thoughts a day, so I decided I might go with the pebble option. The first morning I started counting I had twenty-one before breakfast. Once you start identifying judgmental thoughts, you realize just how many of them you have. You also begin to recognize that many of these judgments are about yourself. Once you begin noticing these patterns of self-scrutinization, you can catch yourself in the act and redirect your thoughts towards something more positive. This practice is like meditation in that you simply become aware of your thoughts and let them continue on their way without becoming attached to them. During that year of personal development, I was introduced to the work of the professor, lecturer, author, and podcast host Brené Brown. She began her career as a research professor at the University of Houston's Graduate College of Social Work. In 2012 she presented a TED talk that has become one of the top five most viewed TED talks, with over 40 million views. Brown is a self-proclaimed shame researcher: she feels that shame is the scourge of society and is to blame for many of the issues we face on a personal and societal level. One of the key foundations of her work makes a great distinction between shame and guilt. Shame, she says, is a focus on the self. Guilt on the other hand is focused on behavior. Shame is expressed as “I am stupid,” whereas guilt is described as, “I did something stupid.” Being able to recognize when you are being self-judgmental gives you the opportunity to reframe a thought from “I am a bad person,” to “I did a bad thing.” From “I am a bad parent,” to “I made a bad decision.” From “I am useless with horses,” to “That didn’t go very well, I’ll try to get it a little better next time.” ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=601))

- We had just competed at the World Equestrian Games and scored our highest scores ever. It felt absolutely incredible. It felt unlike any other time I had competed, and I was curious. What was different about this event? I had been showing horses for almost twenty-five years at this point. Suddenly it dawned on me, something was missing. I realized that every time I’d ever competed there had been a voice somewhere in the back of my head that said, “You can’t do this,” or “Who do you think you are,” or “You’re not good enough,” constantly nagging like a mosquito. I’d never realized the voice was there ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=634))

- until it wasn’t. I mentioned this to Jane, and she said that the audio track she made for us was actually a hypnotism technique that taps into your subconscious, where 95% of the information we receive is processed. If you remember, there were two different voices. When you listen to one it goes in your conscious mind, while the other one affects the unconscious mind. Jane had been reprogramming my brain to respond on the subconscious level; she had tamed a voice I couldn’t control. Coupling the power of Jane’s hypnotherapy with the conscious effort to disengage from judgmental thoughts had a monumental effect of calmness and purpose. I travel quite often for clinics, so I end up spending a lot of time at airports. After working on being aware of my judgmental thoughts for a while, it became obvious to me that what I thought was people watching in airports was actually people judging. I realized that, when walking through airports, I was looking for the things about people I didn’t like. I started to employ a saying that I learned at a meditation retreat. Every person that passed me, I looked them in the eye and thought to myself, “May you be happy.” The first time I did this it had a profound effect on me. After walking the length of the concourse and instituting my newfound mantra with every person I passed, I had a feeling of lightness inside me that I had not experienced before. I realized that my judgmental thoughts had always caused me to have a dull, dark feeling inside. In fact, it was not until that I’d replaced that dark, dull feeling with a light, connected feeling by changing my thoughts that I realized I’d been having them. At clinics I have always said, “I’m not very talented, I know people who are talented, and they don’t seem to have to do much to get the result they want. I have a process, however, and if I can make small enough steps with my process, I can teach horses to do things really well.” Since I have been working on my inner world, my thoughts, and my energy, I have found that there are times at clinics where someone will have an anxious horse they are struggling with, and I will ask them to hand me the lead rope so I can show them how to solve the issue. When they hand me the lead rope, the horse will often go from distracted and anxious to relaxed and engaged, even though I didn’t do anything at the time. This was not a common occurrence previously. To tell the truth, it had never happened before I began my personal development journey. I think a part of the reason this happens so often at clinics is because I am working with the horse I have today. I have no history with the horse, I have no future deadlines that I have to meet, I have no expectations of what the horse should be doing. I’m simply there to support the horse, however they need it at the moment. This isn’t a method, it’s a mindset. Whenever you work with your horse, show up for them like they show up for you. Be there with them, show them you are… ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=639))

- The same goes for working with our horses; if the ultimate goal is to create a deep, authentic relationship where there is trust and confidence, we’ve got to accept our faults and work through them. With our horses it's less about not going to bed angry - we don’t want anger even to enter the training process - and more about being aware of any buildup of tension.

- Something to point out here is that each horse has their own rabbit-carrying capacity. Some horses can only manage one rabbit, whereas some may be able to hold onto many more. Every horse is different, but the moral of the story is the same: staying under a horse’s threshold of anxiety and releasing those triggers as they build up is the only way to prevent an outburst of antagonistic behavior. Threshold (noun): The point at which a stimulus is of sufficient intensity to begin to produce an effect. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=701))

- My wife Robyn used to suffer from panic attacks. The first one I witnessed happened in the first year of our marriage. She awoke at 2 am to tell me something was wrong, that she didn’t feel right. She said it felt as if she was having a heart attack. I ended up driving her to the emergency room where she was checked out by an ER doctor who looked her in the eye and said, “You are perfectly fine.” She immediately looked at me and said, “I feel like I’m going to die.” When your horse is in the middle of a full-blown meltdown, telling them to knock it off is about as effective as if I’d told Robyn, “Don’t be stupid, there’s nothing wrong with you.” If I were to have said that Robyn would still feel the same, but now she would know I wasn’t empathetic to her feelings. I’d likely lose her trust and make her feel lonely in her condition. This is where the Work with The Horse You Have Today principle comes back into play: you have to accept whatever it is your horse (or wife) is telling you at the moment and not how they were just hours or minutes ago. The panic attacks affected Robyn for many years. She had no control over them. Once a panic attack came on, it was followed by two hours of believing she was going to die. Definitely not a fun place to be in for her, and difficult for me to be of no use in helping her feel better. She was also a nervous flyer. Luckily, she’d never had a panic attack on a plane, as that would be utterly disastrous. If that were to happen, I imagine the flight attendants would have to put a straightjacket on her and strap her to her seat. Robyn then discovered a technique that was purported to help with her panic attacks. On a day when she was completely relaxed, she was to sit somewhere comfortable and mentally picture something that made her feel a little anxious. For Robyn, all she had to do was think of something bad happening to her little dog, Holden. She was then instructed to do a regimented breathing exercise, such as box breathing, until she became relaxed again. There are various relaxation-based breathing techniques, and box breathing is one of the most simple and effective. First, you begin to breathe in for a certain count, say a count of four, then hold for a count of four, then breathe out for a count of four, pause for a count of four, then back in again. Once Robyn was relaxed again, she was advised to repeat the process. When I’d ask Robyn how the exercise was coming along, she’d admit that she hadn’t really worked on it yet. It seemed every time I inquired the answer was the same, so I stopped asking. A few months later we were in Canada, flying from Calgary to Toronto, which is a quick two-hour flight. I usually sleep on planes, falling asleep as they take off and waking up when we are about to land. When we landed in Toronto I woke up and looked at Robyn. She appeared pale and more than a little concerned. I asked, “Are you ok?” she replied, “I am now, but I had a panic attack.” When I heard that news… ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=727))

- Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic To understand why the Principles of Training work so effectively, it is important to understand how our horses’ bodies operate. Of all the systems in the equine body, the autonomic nervous system is the most important in terms of training. The term autonomic simply refers to involuntary or unconscious processes such as breathing, digesting, pumping blood, and a variety of other bodily functions that we don’t have to consciously engage ourselves. The autonomic nervous system is split into two subsystems or branches: the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system. The two nervous systems work together to create and manage energy to meet the physiological and emotional demands of a given situation.  The parasympathetic branch is the brake that slows down the nervous system. This system is responsible for the rest and digest state as well as shutting down parts of the body to conserve oxygen and resources in extreme situations of life threat. If an animal is tense, has a rapid heartbeat, and has adrenaline coursing through its body, the parasympathetic nervous system works to calm the animal by slowing down its heart rate. In 1974, scientists Benson, Beary, and Carol coined the term ‘the relaxation response’ to refer to the parasympathetic deactivation process that allows the body to return to a resting state following exertion. In the simplest terms, it helps animals settle down after exercise or high levels of alertness.  The sympathetic nervous system, on the other hand, is the accelerator that causes the horse to become active, such as performing certain movements, activities, play, exercise, and so on. This system also causes the fight or flight reaction where animals are forced into a heightened state of alertness, ready to protect their lives.  Both systems are needed for everyday living as well as for survival.  For domesticated horses to function well in captivity, the demand on their nervous system needs to be sustainable and the shift between states in response to demands should flow smoothly. Mentally, we want our horses to be present. Physically, we want them to be powerful and appropriately responsive to the conditions at hand. Horses that are overly stimulated may end up experiencing hyper-arousal. This results in bucking, bolting, spooking, and rearing: all dangerous mobile actions that are beyond our control. These outbursts indicate that a threshold has been crossed where the horse is mobilizing a response to danger, as opposed to experiencing sympathetic arousal and engaging in physical activity that feels safe.  Of course, the horse will eventually come back down to a state of rest and relaxation, but once that threshold is crossed there is little we can do to prevent the physical consequences until things run their course. They run around bucking and bolting, which pumps adrenaline into their bodies, the heart rate increases, and we have the whole cycle to look forward to… ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=766))

- The most important part of this principle is to understand that horses don’t learn from pressure; they learn from the release of pressure. Horses constantly seek the place where they can find peace and a lack of external pressures. You might see a horse standing behind a clump of trees when the cold wind blows. They stand there because it’s more comfortable than standing elsewhere. It’s the same if you apply an aid or cue: it’s the removal of that slight pressure when they do what you are asking that is the reward for the horse. If they can’t make something go away, they soon learn to ignore it. If we can time our releases correctly, we can get our horses to be constantly searching for the answer to the question we are asking them.

She said if you were asking a horse for a half turn on their haunches, having them rock their weight back before asking for the turn would negate the need to make the wrong thing hard. I feel this is a misinterpretation of this principle that focuses on the wrong-thing-hard part, not on the right-thing-easy part. This trainer, who said the principle wasn’t necessary, stated that if she wanted a horse to turn on its haunches, asking the horse to rock back first would be more beneficial ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=988))

- than correcting them for doing it wrong. If a horse were to do this particular exercise wrong, they would tend to pivot on their front end and swing their hind end out. If you were to ask them to rock their weight back first, it would make it hard for the horse to swing their hind end out, and it would make it easy for the horse to move his front end over. Sometimes, allowing them to make a mistake is beneficial, like releasing an aid during the spin. However, in this case, the way in which you set the situation up is what makes the right thing easy. An old saying says, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” This is true, but your chances of getting them to drink are higher if you wait until he is thirsty. That's what this part of this principle is about: setting things up so you are more likely to get a yes answer.

One is going back to the beginning (or the last established beginning) when things go wrong in order to give your horse more confidence in the answers they already know. This is what gets you to perfect the basics and myelinate the neural pathways that you will use in your future training. Additionally, this principle focuses on your ability to use transitions, to be able to flow from one step to the next. Just because you can play every single note on a guitar doesn’t mean that you can play the solo to Stairway to Heaven, or Sultans of Swing. Those involve playing those notes one after another, in order, from the beginning, with no mistakes, and that is what The Donkey Kong Principle is truly about.

You can either be conscious of these processes and use them to help you or be unconscious of them and make things harder on yourself.

It’s the way dressage tests are designed. The level you are competing at now is the building block for the next level. We are creating the tool that is going to solve the next problem because we know that problem is going to occur. It’s a bit like loading a tire iron and a spare tire in your trailer before you set off on a trip. Traveling long distances under pressure often causes tires to fail, so we prepare ourselves for the eventuality. As horse’s behaviors are consistent and predictable, I don't attempt to go anywhere near the next stage of training until I actually have the tool to prevent the problem that I will likely run into in the next stage. Usually, the tools to solve problems, and the tools to teach the next step, are the same tools. ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=1772))

Usually, if a horse has a structured, systematic foundation, it doesn’t matter what problem arises, they already have the tools to fix it. Everyone I have ever seen who can do amazing things with horses has a process. Many times, the early part of that process is boring and seems irrelevant to the finished product, a bit like having some good quality adhesive, or how a working can of WD-40 seems irrelevant to fixing the problem of a loose clamp on the back of a washing machine. This is not just a horse training principle. It’s a fact of life. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=1816))

- A few years ago, I was doing a type of therapy called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). This type of therapy was originally designed for people with borderline personality disorder and chronically suicidal individuals. These days it is used to treat a range of conditions from depression to binge eating disorders. I was going once a week to group therapy, and in those sessions, they would give us homework. The homework was usually to work on some sort of exercise to help with emotional regulation issues. When we were given our homework, we were always warned not to try to use this technique when we had an emotional regulation issue if we had not first practiced it over and over and got familiar with the technique first. For instance, when conflict arises. The thing we were told repeatedly is not to try to use these exercises in the middle of an argument with your boss or spouse. If you have not practiced them when you were not in conflict, you wouldn’t be able to implement them in times of distress. They were telling us to create that tool of that skill, before trying to use the tool of that skill when you need it.

- One of the most important tools to have on your horse before going out trail riding is a self-regulating nervous system, which we covered in detail in the Don’t Go to Bed Angry chapter. This means if something scares them, when it’s no longer present, they can return to relaxation. I’ve heard of many people who have been out trail riding, had their horse spook at something, wheel around, and then bolt for several miles, even though they were out of danger (or perceived danger) several seconds into the bolt.

- Not only is self-regulation a necessary tool to have before going out trail riding, but the ability to relax after a period of what the scientific or therapy world might call “sympathetic activation” is necessary as well. To top it off, the ability to use both reins at the same time to slow a horse down after being activated is also a necessary tool and like with all tools, you can't teach it in the middle of the problem. You don’t start to take martial arts lessons in the middle of being mugged. The Navy SEALS have a saying, “You don’t rise to the occasion. You fall to the level of your training,” which they borrowed from a Greek poet named Archilochus who was born around 800 BC. What I’m trying to tell you here is not new information or some radical new way of looking at riding horses. This is old wisdom.

- Like many of the principles, this principle applies not only to horses but to everything in life. Initially discussed in chapter three, there’s a quote that says, “Good leaders only ask yes questions,” meaning good leaders only ask for something doable. They won't ask for things that can’t be done. In the world of horsemanship, the word leadership gets thrown about quite often. It’s usually to do with the outdated model of dominance theory. In that theory, the herd has an unwavering hierarchy. There's a leader, who tells everyone else what to do. Then there’s a number two horse, who tells everyone else what to do, except the leader, and so it goes on down the line. In reality, the herd is a coalition of relationships that are quite fluid. I believe leadership in relation to horsemanship is not telling them what to do all the time but proving yourself to be someone they can trust in times of uncertainty. I have seen many horses that spook at things, not necessarily because the things are that spooky, but because they have a lack of trust in their relationship with their rider. Many times, that lack of trust comes from being over-faced. In showjumping and eventing, the term over-faced is used to describe what happens when the rider asks the horse to jump a fence that they can’t jump. The horse begins to doubt their ability to jump, starts to doubt the judgment of the rider, and oftentimes gets concerned about the correction or punishment they are going to receive from the rider because they don’t jump the fence. Over-facing, however, is not just relevant to jumping. Asking a horse to do something that they can’t do, and then putting a lot of pressure on them to force them to do it, really erodes their faith in the human's judgment. The principle of They Need to Know The Answer Before You Ask The Question might seem a bit strange when you think about it. Many people say, “If I don’t ask a horse to do something until they know how to do it already, and I have an untrained horse, does that mean I can’t ask them to do anything?” This principle is about only asking questions that they can easily figure out the answer to. They may not know the answer to the question, but they have the skills and the mental tools to be able to figure it out. We do this with children when we start to teach them to do simple addition. We make sure they know how to count well before we ask them to add. We may hold up two fingers on one hand, and two fingers on the other hand, and say, “What’s two plus two?” They may not quite know the answer, so you might change the question to, “Can you count how many fingers I am holding up?” They count the fingers and say one, two, three, four! Soon they can add two and two together. Not only is this principle a really good way to instill confidence in what you ask for, but it is also something we use in everyday life that also applies to horses.

- Having a horse know the answer before you ask the question is only part of the process though. Then you need to decide if, even though the horse knows the answer, the situation is right for you to ask the question. Once the horse knows how to stop really well from two reins at the walk, I will only do that if they are relaxed. If they are uptight about something, I will bend to a stop, which as you will remember is not just a stop, but a relaxed and present stop. Pulling on two reins and backing up an anxious horse will only make them more anxious. Read that line again. ([Location 2027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2027))

If they go to a particular water hole a few times in a row and there's always a predator there, they will avoid going there.

- One of the scenarios in the Do the Opposite principle is how important it is to ensure your horse has access to both relaxed and activated states and can switch easily between the two. I'll give you a good example of this. Over the years, I've had a lot of people say something along the lines of: “You know, my horse has always done everything I've ever wanted to do. He's always been perfect. Then the other day I was out trail riding and a tree branch had fallen across the trail. I wanted him to walk over it, and he didn't want to. So I squeezed with my legs then bumped with them a little then, and he reared up and bucked me off. What should I do? Because you know, he's never done anything like that before. He's always done everything I’ve ever wanted.” I will then ask that person, “So do you like to ride your horse around really fast and recklessly?” Usually, they will say, “No, actually, I’m kind of scared, so I like to ride around really nice and slow.” I will then ask, “So your horse, he loves to run around really fast and energetically?” and they will say, “No, actually he's kind of lazy.” I will then reply, “Well there's, there's ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2545))

The first day you asked him to do something he didn’t want to do, he complained quite forcefully. Therefore, it’s important, during the training, to be able to ask the horse to do something that he’s not thinking of doing at the time.” The thing you are trying to achieve is balance: both mental balance and physical balance. The key to obtaining this balance is to make transitions between the mental state, physical positions, and amounts of energy.

John Lyons, one of the earliest well-known U.S. horse training clinicians, said, “A safe horse is always quiet, but a quiet horse isn’t necessarily safe.” What he means in this quote is that a horse that you consider safe needs to be quiet, but he also needs to be able to be asked for energy easily. If you can’t do that, and the horse is only quiet, then in the right circumstances this horse may cause you some trouble. This is very closely related to the Don’t Go to Bed Angry principle, where your horse needs to be able to relax after being activated. On the other hand, if your horse tends to have a lot of high energy, you don't really have a full-functioning horse until you can have that horse have low energy ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2561))

- would apply some pressure (waving of flag, increased bodily energy, etc). When that horse did go off around you, you would immediately remove the pressure to mark the behavior. Releasing pressure or removing an aversive stimulus is what reinforces the desired behavior.   Positive Punishment (+P) occurs when an undesirable behavior is followed by an aversive stimulus, thereby decreasing the likelihood of the undesired behavior. An example would be if you got mad at your partner for not taking out the trash by yelling at them.    Negative Punishment (-P) occurs when an undesirable behavior is followed by the removal of an aversive stimulus, thereby decreasing the likelihood of the undesired behavior. A good example of this might be if you go to feed your horse, and they pin their ears at you, and you leave with the food. Taking away a teenager's phone because of disobedience is another example.   Extinction occurs when a behavior stops happening in response to a particular stimulus. Both classical and operant conditioning can result in extinction. For instance, if someone is exposed to a scary situation or stimulus repeatedly but nothing bad happens, they may stop having a fear reaction to it (classical conditioning). The 300-peck pigeon example includes extinction through operant conditioning: if a pigeon pecks repeatedly and a reward does not occur, it will eventually stop pecking. Another example might occur if you don’t release the pressure when your horse backs up when you ask it to.

- There is no such thing as purely positive training. If you use positive reinforcement, there is a risk that the horse may experience negative punishment. In positive reinforcement, you reward or reinforce the right behavior by giving a marker signal, like a click, followed by a reward of some kind, such as a treat. But in the time that the horse spends searching for the answer, no treat is offered; this could either be experienced as neutral (nothing changes) or as negative punishment (treat is seen as being withheld, resulting in… ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2780))

- They called this new idea Constructional Aggression Training (CAT). When a dog is aggressive, humans and other dogs move away, which is what the dog is wanting. In the CAT treatment, the outcome the dog wanted was only given when they reacted in a calm or friendly way. The trainers started a long way away and approached the dog until they could see he was aware of them but was not yet aggressive. They then waited until the dog started to relax, then moved away. This meant that his need for distance was still being met, and he was in control of it. They then discovered a funny thing that happened during the treatment: after a while, the dogs learned to like being calm and friendly. They not only tolerated strangers they had once been aggressive with, but they were calm and friendly toward the strangers, instead of scared. This method has now been successfully replicated with feral cats, cows, llamas, birds, and even reptiles. As it began to be developed for horses, they altered the name to Constructional Approach Training for Horses (CAT-H). With horses, it doesn’t matter if the fearful thing is a human or an object such as a saddle pad. If you know they are fearful of it, you present it far enough away for them to notice it, but not be fearful, then wait until they show some sign of relaxing, and then remove it or retreat with it. Over time, the horse gets more and more confident with it and learns to relax in its presence. If you ([Location 2849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2849))

- don’t know a horse is fearful of something, and you go over their threshold, meaning the horse moves into a fearful state, immediately remove the stimulus, and start again from a distance using CAT-H. This approach is one of the most pure forms of negative reinforcement, but I believe the big reason it works so well is that it tells the horse how much you are listening, and how aware of the little things you are. This helps the horse to experience safety in the relationship. No matter which of those methods you choose to use, how and when you do things will determine whether the training works. Things need to be done in a certain order. As we saw in chapter nine, horses are very good at anticipating things, and the correct application of your aids ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2859))

- This illustrates the basics of The Application of Your Aids. You will always start out with the smallest aid possible. As you add a new aid, you will maintain all previous aids, so they layer over each other. When you achieve the desired result, you will release all aids simultaneously. It sounds surprisingly simple but being able to apply this consistently and fairly each time requires you to be in the present and to have no attachment to the outcome.

- Her impression was that more pressure was needed but, in reality, a way to avoid the pressure is what was needed. When using pressure and release, or negative reinforcement, there are two types. There is escape and avoidance. Let’s go back to the two horses and the pile of hay. When the bay horse wanted to drive the chestnut horse away from his hay, he started out with a grimace (which is non-physical, meaning physical contact is not involved). When that didn’t work, he added pinning his ears (still non-physical). When that didn’t work, he moved toward the other horse (still non-physical) and then bared his ([Location 2919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2919))

- teeth (which is still non-physical but demonstrating what he will use when he does get physical) and eventually he bites the other horse until he moves away (bingo, this one is physical). When the chestnut horse moved away, he did so to escape the bite. ([Location 2924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2924))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- After this interaction played out a few times, soon the chestnut horse knew what was coming and started to move away from one or more of the non-physical cues, to avoid (or prevent) the bite. This is when the interaction goes from escape to avoidance. A key factor in this is that once the energy of the interaction starts, from the first shift in the horse’s internal energy to the final energy of the bite, that energy stays constant. The amount of energy might increase, but it’s only after the other horse changes his behavior that the energy stops. This is the key to what was causing Max’s pony to appear stubborn. He was standing still, and then out of nowhere came a big whack with the stick. The pony did not respond, yet the whack immediately stopped. Then came another big whack, and the pony still didn’t t move, and then the whack stopped again. Max had an expectation that his pony would move when he whacked him, so Max would… ([Location 2926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2926))

Standing still resulted in a whack and the removal of the whack. As a result, there was no clarity around what to escape or avoid, or a sense that anything the pony did would make the whacking stop. I said to Max, “What we are going to do here is I am going to have you squeeze your pony very softly with your legs.” His mother immediately interjected, “That won’t work.

It was just a change in his thought that we rewarded, but what we showed him was that he had control over the pressure being applied, and that doing something instead of doing nothing is what would interrupt the pressure.

Each time, the pony tried to move earlier in the escalation until eventually we got to the point where he would walk forward for Max with just a squeeze… ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2947))

- Something else to consider when working on The Application of Your Aids is the order in which you apply the aids. You should start out with the lightest of all the aids in that progression and add them in ascending order toward the most energetic pressure response. Your horse will not respond to pressure less than your first aid. If you’d like them to respond to a light aid, you can’t start out with a strong aid. You also must know which aid works and ensure you use it last, to teach a response to the other aids. ([Location 2961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=2961))

It’s about developing relationship, which is based on developing trust and empathy, before attempting to modify or shape any behaviors. Much of this relationship building consists of being with a horse and responding to small social cues without asking anything of them. John Appleseed is not going to pay someone to do nothing with their horse. Which is why I think that you are the best person to train your horse.

- characteristics or behavior to an animal or object. However, I think that sometimes we forget to mammalize, which means we forget that horses are mammals as well as humans, and we forget how similar our nervous systems actually are. Dr. Siegel says “When a child is upset, logic often won’t work until we have responded to the right brain’s emotional needs. We call this emotional connection ‘attunement,’ which is how we connect deeply with another person and allow them to ‘feel felt.’ When parent and child are tuned in to each other, they experience a sense of joining together.” Let’s change that first line to get to the crux of why I believe Relationship Before Horsemanship is so powerful.

This mindset is like the “stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about” parenting style that was prevalent in society during my childhood. When a child is expressing concern about something that worries them, and their caregiver, the one person who is supposed to have their back, says something along the lines of, “Stop showing me that you are concerned about that thing or I… ([Location 3228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=3228))

Many children who were subjected to that style of parenting are now adults and have done some inner work to solve some of their personal issues. They have discovered that a lot of their issues stem from being unseen or unfelt. It was delivered by loving parents who were doing the best they knew how, but that does not mean our nervous systems were meant to tolerate it. When our horses’ show us their concern we have a choice, are we going to acknowledge their feelings and help them through what they are feeling, creating a deep trusting connection along the way, or are we going to put our wants and desires above their concern, producing a more transactional relationship where the horse feels alone and disconnected. Both horses and humans need to be helped when they are worried, not made obedient. As a podcast guest… ([Location 3233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=3233))

- Hanging out with a horse that’s not keen on being caught by humans, or just by a human’s presence in general, helps them move from being worried about humans, towards being less concerned about them. However, you’d only keep doing that while the needle remained on the cautious side. As soon as the horse started to get a little cavalier about humans, maybe a little unaware of our frailness, you might not do the same kind of hanging out. That may look like standing up instead of sitting down on one end of the scale, to hanging out with them on the outside of their pen on the other end of the scale. I have a lot of people who say, “I can’t hang out with my horse, he’s right on top of me, he meets me at the gate pushing on it.” I tell them to hang out exactly the same, except outside the pen.

- horsing the horse. There is no punishment involved, you are just showing them that when you show up, there’s no need to anticipate you going in there and doing something with them. We are working on the Anticipation Is Your Best Friend or Your Worst Enemy Principle, combined with the Do The Opposite principle. If you really think about it, you are also using the Make The Wrong Thing Hard and The Right Thing Easy principle. If you are sitting outside their fence, it’s very hard for them to push on you, and very easy not to. The principles come thick and fast when you really understand them, but the underlying principle we are working on here is Relationship Before Horsemanship. That means we don’t want to ask for something to happen, nor are we going to correct something that happens. If we choose the right method of engagement with the horse, there’s no need to correct anything. This means you can't just go in there after sitting outside her pen for an hour and a half and give her a scratch because you love her. If you truly love her, you will stay on this side of the fence until she starts to behave a little more like one of her species. Relationships in general are about providing the other with what they need, especially initially, and the relationship with your horse is no different. Engaging with Their Muzzle A few years ago, my wife Robyn and I went to a couple’s weekend at The Gottman Institute in Seattle, Washington. John and Julie Gottman are some of the world’s leading researchers on relationships. They can observe a couple interacting for a short time and, with a fair amount of accuracy, predict how long the relationship will last. One of the things the Gottmans pay attention to are what they call, “Bids for Connection.” A bid, or an attempt to connect, could be something as simple as saying “Boy it’s a beautiful day,” and can be met one of three ways. According to the Gottmans the best way is what they call turning towards, by engaging positively with the bid. This might look like the reply, “Yes, I think it’s a great day.” The next less desirable response would be what the Gottmans call turning away, which would be not engaging in a response, basically ignoring the attempt, or bid, to connect. The worst response as far as the relationship… ([Location 3269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BX2PZ6YD&location=3269))

From experience, I now believe that if you are present enough, for long enough, after a while they stop checking to see if you are present. It’s almost like you get the seal of approval, that you have proven yourself to be an aware being, and that they don’t have to check on you.

I think everyone uses it to some extent, mostly without realizing it. A good example would be the tried-and-true horsemanship practice of rewarding the slightest try. When you do that, not only are you rewarding the try, but you are also communicating your awareness of that slight try, you are communicating how in tune with the slightest movements you are.
