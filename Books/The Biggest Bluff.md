## Highlights
- My reasons for getting into poker in the first place were to better understand that line between skill and luck, to learn what I could control and what I couldn’t, and here was a strongly-worded lesson if ever there were: you can’t bluff chance. Poker didn’t care about my reasons for being on the floor. There was no one to whom I could direct a complaint, a plaintive “But it’s the Main Event!” The why didn’t matter. Nerves or stress, migraine or food poisoning, the cards would keep getting dealt. The message was clear. I could plan all I wanted, but the X factor could still always get me. The outcome would be what it would be. All I could do was my best with what I could control—and the rest, well, the rest wasn’t up to me.

- Indeed, when I inevitably ask him the question he gets asked most frequently—what his single piece of advice would be to aspiring poker players—his answer is two words long: pay attention. Two simple words that we simply ignore more often than not. Presence is far more difficult than the path of least resistance.

- What I found was something completely unexpected. Over and over, people would overestimate the degree of control they had over events—smart people, people who excelled at many things, people who should have known better. Not only would they decide ahead of time how they were going to divide their investments, but they would decide based on incredibly limited information which stock was “good” and stick to their guns—even as they started losing money. The more they overestimated their own skill relative to luck, the less they learned from what the environment was trying to tell them, and the worse their decisions became: the participants grew increasingly less likely to switch to winning stocks, instead doubling down on losers or gravitating entirely toward bonds. Because they thought they knew more than they did, they ignored any signs to the contrary—especially when, as inevitably happens in real stock markets, winners became losers and vice versa. In other words, the illusion of control is what prevented real control over the game from emerging—and before long, the quality of people’s decisions deteriorated. They did what worked in the past, or what they had decided would work—and failed to grasp that the circumstances had shifted so that a previously successful strategy was no longer so. People failed to see what the world was telling them when that message wasn’t one they wanted to hear. They liked being the rulers of their environment. When the environment knew more than they did—well, that was no good at all. Here was the cruel truth: we humans too often think ourselves in firm control when we are really playing by the rules of chance.

- It’s called the description-experience gap. In study after study, people fail to internalize numeric rules, making decisions based on things like “gut feeling” and “intuition” and “what feels right” rather than based on the data they are shown. We need to train ourselves to see the world in a probabilistic light—and even then, we often ignore the numbers in favor of our own experience.

- Some of us imbue probability with emotion. It becomes luck: chance that has suddenly acquired a valence, positive or negative, fortuitous or unfortunate. Good or bad luck. A lucky or unlucky break. Some of us invest luck with meaning, direction, and intent. It becomes fate, karma, kismet—chance with an agenda. It was meant to be. Some even go a step further: predestination. It was always meant to be, and any sense of control or free will we may think we have is pure illusion. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=319))

- Von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematical and strategic minds of the twentieth century: he invented that little machine we all carry around with us, the computer (back then, it wasn’t so little), crafted the technology behind the hydrogen bomb, and is the father of game theory. Theory of Games is his foundational text, and here’s what I learned within its pages: the entire theory was inspired by a single game—poker. “Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do,” von Neumann wrote. “And that is what games are about in my theory.” Von Neumann did not care for most card games. They were, he thought, as boring as the people who wasted their lives playing them, trying to coax mastery—impossibly—out of pure chance. Games of pure chance, though, were to his mind not much worse than those at the opposite end: games like chess, where all the information could theoretically be gleaned, where ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=326))

- every move could be mathematically accounted for in advance. There was one exception to his distrust of gaming: poker. He loved it. To him, it represented that ineffable balance between skill and chance that governs life—enough skill to make playing worthwhile, enough chance that the challenge was there for the taking. He was a god-awful player by every account, but that never stopped him. Poker was the ultimate puzzle: he wanted to understand it, to unravel it—to, in the end, beat it. If he could figure out how to disentangle the chance from the skill, how to maximize the role of the latter and learn to minimize the malice of the former, he believed he would hold the solution to some of life’s greatest decision challenges.

- The games that interested von Neumann are the ones that, like life, can’t ever be mapped cleanly. Real life is based on making the best decisions you can from information that can never be complete: you never know someone else’s mind, just like you can never know any poker hand but your own. Real life is not just about modeling the mathematically optimal decisions. It’s about discerning the hidden, the uniquely human. It’s about realizing that no amount of formal modeling will ever be able to capture the vagaries and surprises of human nature.

- Poker isn’t a homogeneous game; there are multiple varieties of play, with names like Stud, Omaha, Razz, Badugi, and HORSE. Each has its own unique set of rules, but in any style of poker, the basic parameters are essentially the same: Some cards are dealt faceup, visible to all—these are the community cards—and some facedown, so that only the person to whom they are dealt can see them. You make bets based on how strong your hand is and how strong you think others’ hands are. Because the only other cards you know for sure are your own, you are in a game of incomplete information: you must make the best decision you can, given the little you know. The last player left standing at the end of the final round of betting takes the pot, or the sum of money that has been bet up to now.

- I’m impressed. My abilities look meager in comparison. “How many people do you get that have that kind of a brain or interests?” Erik continues. “It seems as if Phil and his sister have a very similar brain that functions in a way that they pick up languages in some incredible way. It’s nice to hear that you do have obviously some abilities to pick up languages quickly or to adapt to different languages, because that’s essentially what the challenge is.” It makes a certain amount of sense. In many ways, poker does resemble language learning. After all, there is a new grammar, a new vocabulary, a new way of relating to the world. But there is one big difference that I can see. Humans have built-in language-learning ability. Some are better at it than others, true, but we all learn our native language fairly effortlessly—the brain seems ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=452))

- to come equipped with a road map for discerning meaning out of sounds and figuring out rules without ever being taught them explicitly. Not so poker: no matter how psychologically you want to play, much of the game is about statistics. You need to understand odds, how good your hand is, how good it is relative to others’, how likely it is to improve, and so on. Each of these requires a certain amount of statistical calculation. How well I’ll fare there is another story. “You know, psychology really is the most fascinating part of the game,” Erik says, interrupting my thought process. “What specifically about decision making did you study? Like Kahneman?” “Actually, my graduate adviser was Walter Mischel—you know, the marshmallow guy?” “Oh wow. That’s exciting. Self-control is huge in the game.” So Mr. Seidel knows the marshmallow guy, too. I seem to have picked well. “I figured it might be,” I reply. “I mean, I’ve obviously never played. But here’s what I can tell you: I’m willing to bet I’ve read more about all of this than anyone else at the poker table. I’ve done studies on stress and decision making. Emotional stuff. Time pressure stuff. All sorts of things that I think are going to be super relevant. And—and ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=458))

- and . . .” I’m on a roll and don’t want him to interrupt. I need him to agree to take me on. “Look at this paper I found.” I fish out my ace in the hole—a paper I’ve tracked down on poker tells that, as far as I know, never made it out of academia. And it’s based on a WSOP final table analysis. The real deal. Erik reads carefully. He’s all concentration. And then he starts laughing. “Wow. OK. Just don’t show this to anyone else.” I promise him I won’t. And with that, a partnership is born. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=467))

- POKER, TO THE UNTRAINED eye, is easy. Just like everyone who meets me seems to have “a book in them,” which they’ll write just as soon as they get a chance—everyone can use words, after all—so everyone who meets Erik thinks they are just a hop away from becoming a poker pro or, at the very least, a badass poker bro. Most of us underestimate the skill involved. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=533))

- And poker does have an element of chance, to be sure—but what doesn’t? Are poker professionals “gamblers” any more than the man signing away his life on a professional football contract, who may or may not be injured the next week, or find himself summarily dropped from the team in a year because he failed to live up to his promise? We judge the poker player for gambling; we respect the stockbroker for doing the same thing with far less information. In some ways, poker players gamble less than most. After all, even if they lose an arm, they can still play. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=540))

- And so I tell my grandmother the words that I’ve come to repeat so often they are like my own private mantra: in poker, you can win with the worst hand and you can lose with the best hand. In every other game in a casino—and in games of perfect information like chess and Go—you simply must have the best of it to win. No other way is possible. And that, in a nutshell, is why poker is a skilled endeavor rather than a gambling one. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=546))

- Of course, it’s a long way between betting on your own opinions and judging someone else. When we err, we are much more tolerant than when we think someone else has gone astray. Think of the 2016 presidential election. Every media source had polls showing Hillary Clinton winning—and every media source was wrong. No one was on the receiving end of the subsequent ire more than Nate Silver. He had done such an accurate job forecasting past elections that he was practically pilloried for being so “wrong” this time around. But what exactly did Silver say? In his final poll, on November 8, 2016, he gave Clinton a 71 percent chance of winning—and Trump a 29 percent chance. Twenty-nine percent. That’s a whole lot of percent. That’s nearly a third. And yet most people saw the 71 and read it as certain. The ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=592))

- If we keep saying “I think I’m good here” without quantifying how often we’re actually good, we’ll lose all our money. But in life, we normally do just that without a single thought. Why did I buy that stock? Another investor said it was good over lunch. Why did I sell that? Well, he shorted that one and that sounds right to me. We react emotionally rather than looking at the statistics: traders sell winning stocks to lock in the wins—it feels good, even though the numbers say that winners continue to go up in the short term; they hold on to losers to avoid locking in the losses—that would feel bad, even though the numbers say you should cut and run. In fact, numerous studies show that professional investors have a remarkable ability to ignore statistical information for their own gut and intuition—and that they’d often be better served not trading at all as a result. “For a large majority of fund managers, the selection of stocks is more like rolling dice than like playing poker,” says Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel-winning economist. Not only do most funds underperform the ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=608))

- market, but the correlation in year-to-year performance is incredibly low. Kahneman continues, “The successful funds in any given year are mostly lucky; they have a good roll of the dice. There is general agreement among researchers that nearly all stock pickers, whether they know it or not—and few of them do—are playing a game of chance.” ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=616))

- I’d wager it’s no coincidence that the father of probability—the first person who we know of to go beyond a vision of chance as some sort of unknowable goddess, or otherwise in the purview of the supernatural—was a gambler. Girolamo Cardano was a doctor, a mathematician, a philosopher. He was part of the group responsible for the advent of higher algebra and was known for his thought-provoking prose (Shakespeare, it seems, was a fan, and it has been claimed that Cardano’s Consolation was the book originally held by Hamlet in the “To be ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=640))

- or not to be?” scene). He also made much of his money through gambling—but gambling in a way that was foreign to his contemporaries. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=645))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Cardano lamented one thing, though. Understanding probability wasn’t enough to tame the luck factor. Unless you cheated—and he spent quite some time describing how that would be possible, with crooked dice and marked cards—you had no way of winning consistently. His findings “contribute a great deal to understanding but hardly anything to practical play,” he reflected. Not entirely true, but you can see the sentiment: if you want to improve your odds, understand probabilities; if you want a sure thing, rig the deck. Poker isn’t just about calibrating the strength of your beliefs. It’s also about becoming comfortable with the fact that there’s no such thing as a sure thing—ever. You will never have all the information you want, and you will have to act all the same. Leave your certainty at the door.

- It’s been decades since Erik opened David Sklansky’s The Theory of Poker, the book that first propelled him into the poker world when he picked it up on a whim in a used-book shop. And he isn’t used to taking on students, let alone those who know nothing about the game. So for the basics, he’d sent me to the person who wrote the textbook—literally. Harrington on Hold’em is a classic. Erik may not have given the basics much thought since Sklansky, but Dan Harrington had distilled them for thousands. And luckily for me, he happened to be in New York. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=721))

- by the best players. (“Sign up for Run It Once,” he tells me early on. I find out it’s a coaching site, and when I start looking at the library of available topics, I suddenly feel very, very lost and very, very small and very, very silly. What was I even thinking? What in the world is a merged three-betting range and why does turn bet sizing on three-flush boards merit multiple hours of conversation?) Then we discuss—I ask questions and Erik determines that I have enough of a theoretical basis to get started playing without completely losing my shirt. Then I begin to play for real—online, for tiny stakes, but for real money, to see how I do in putting the lessons into practice. Play money simply won’t cut it. Plenty of people who kill at Monopoly would make terrible real estate agents. Only after I start consistently winning money online will I get to do the thing I thought I’d be doing right away: going to Vegas to play in real life—somehow, online doesn’t feel like real life even though the money is real enough—in real casinos, at real tables, with real chips. (I’ve already bought my very own chip set in preparation. I’ve seen the videos, after all, and everyone knows how to do that thing where you mix two stacks of chips into one with your hand. Riffling, I find out it’s called. The first time I try it, the chips fly all over the room in a flurry of red and green.

- Erik is a big walker. Ever since he got a Fitbit, some years ago, he has been religious in hitting his daily step count, and as I will learn, walking is a big part of his routine, come rain or shine, in New York or Vegas or anywhere else in the world, whether he’s in between playing or in the middle of a tournament. It’s not just for exercise. It’s his way of thinking, his way of reflecting, his way of relating, his way of learning.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- get punched in the mouth.’ And he’s right. Until you go through a month of everything going wrong, you won’t know whether you have what it takes. You will never learn how to play good poker if you get lucky—it’s as simple as that. You just won’t.” ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=851))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What’s crucial, Dan says, is to develop my critical thinking and self-assessment ability well enough that I can constantly reevaluate, objectively, where I am—and whether where I am is good enough to play as I’m playing. It’s not about winning or losing—that’s chance. It’s about thinking—the process. Dan himself is a living illustration of how true this is: he quit not during a downswing but at the top of his game.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And thus my first real poker lesson isn’t about winning. It’s about losing. “You become a big winner when you lose,” Dan says. “Everyone plays well when they’re winning. But can you control yourself and play well when you’re losing? And not by being too conservative, but trying to still be objective as to what your chances are in the hand. If you can do that, then you’ve conquered the game.” ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=880))

- “DAN IS GREAT,” ERIK agrees. And, yes, everything he has told me is true: one of the keys to success, Erik says, if not the key, is objectivity. And objectivity is a hard thing to come by. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=891))

- “When things go wrong, other people see it as unfairness that’s always surrounding them,” he tells me. They take it personally. They don’t know how to lose, how to learn from losing. They look for something or someone to blame. They don’t step back to analyze their own decisions, their own play, where they may have gone wrong themselves. “It’s a really big handicap in life to think that way. All of us can step into that sometimes, but it’s important to know the difference. It’s like that great Kipling quote: ‘If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, and treat those two impostors just the same . . . ’” I nod. I know the one. “I love that. This is such a fundamental part of poker. The wins really go to people’s heads. And the losses—they can’t deal. It’s so easy to be delusional in this game,” he tells me.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When it comes to learning, Triumph is the real foe; it’s Disaster that’s your teacher. It’s Disaster that brings objectivity. It’s Disaster that’s the antidote to that greatest of delusions, overconfidence. And ultimately, both Triumph and Disaster are impostors. They are results that are subject to chance. One of them just happens to be a better teaching tool than the other. ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=911))

- If we lose early, we have a shot at objectivity. But when we win at the start, that’s when we see the illusion of control playing out in full swing. As Langer titled her paper: “Tails, I Win.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “The beauty of poker is generally, delusion is punished,” Erik tells me. You may get away with an illusion of control in the short term, but if you persist, no one will know your name in a few years’ time. In real life, we can remain deluded indefinitely. If we choose delusion over objectivity in poker, we are eventually doomed. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=929))

- Poker is all about comfort with uncertainty, after all. Only I didn’t quite realize it wasn’t just uncertainty about the outcome of the cards. It’s uncertainty about the “right” thing to do. The only certain thing is your thinking. A number of years ago, Erik heard about a seminar led by Mike Caro. Caro is famous for his book on tells—live, in-the-moment reads of others at the table. “He’s a pretty eccentric guy,” Erik says. “And he’s walking around the stage and starts off by saying, ‘What is the object of poker?’” I nod in agreement. A question I’ve been asking myself frequently. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=968))

- Erik continues, “Somebody says, ‘Winning money.’ He says, ‘No.’ Somebody else says, ‘Winning a lot of pots.’ ‘No.’ He says, ‘The object of poker is making good decisions.’ I think that’s a really good way to look at poker.” ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=973))

If you don’t, how will you know whether the outcome of your battle—a bad one in my case, but successful ones, too—is the result of skill or luck? If you’ve just lost your chips, was it because you chanced upon an unlucky situation—or because you planned a poor campaign?

- Bet sizing and what it accomplishes is an incredibly useful analogue for most any decision. How much are you risking to accomplish what, exactly? What are the situations where you want to bet frequently and small? Where do you want to bet less often, but big? When do you over-bet? When do you want to appear pot-committed, like Thomas Schelling and his rogue driver playing a game of chicken, ripping the steering wheel from the car in a display of ultimate commitment to not swerving? And how does it all change depending on your opponent? Every tactic you use, you have to ask what it accomplishes and whether the same thing could have been accomplished more cheaply.

Erik continues, “You know, this is actually really important. A lot of players actually start playing worse when they’re on livestream”—when a poker table is televised so that people can see the cards—“because they’re so worried about how they look.” ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1187))

- In the early days of televised poker, Erik was famous, or infamous if you ask some, for refusing to show his cards to the camera or card reader. It wasn’t because he was afraid of looking stupid. It was because he didn’t want to reveal his strategy. These days, it’s no longer viable to avoid showing your cards, and it never really hurt him to begin with: he’s one of the best players I’ve seen at being able to adjust his play. What do you picture when you think of the most successful hunter in the animal kingdom? Likely a lion, or a cheetah, with its majestic run, or perhaps a wolf stalking its prey. They are all striking beasts. They are all powerful. They are all deadly. And none of them is even close to being the most successful. The cheetah comes in highest, killing approximately 58 percent of the animals it hunts. The lion is next, at less than half that—one quarter of its intended kills hit the mark. And the wolf captures only 14 percent of what it stalks. The true deadly killer is one that hardly anyone would think of: the dragonfly. According to a 2012 study from researchers at Harvard University, the dragonfly manages to capture an astounding 95 percent of its targeted prey. It may not look as glamorous or be the subject of fan adulation—it’s unlikely anyone sees the tiny flying alien look-alike as a kindred spirit—but it’s a far more effective ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1191))

- predator. Its eyes have developed to spot the tiniest deviations in motion. Its wings allow it to swerve and swoop in unimaginably quick configurations. And its brain has evolved to not only see possible targets but predict their future movements with startling accuracy. The dragonfly is so good not only because it sees what its prey is doing, but because it can also predict what it will do and plan its response accordingly. In the world of poker, Erik is the dragonfly. He doesn’t strut or preen. He doesn’t announce his presence with a roar. He just watches quietly—and then changes his hunting approach based on what he’s observed in his prey. He doesn’t just know what his opponents are doing. He can predict what they’ll do and how they will look doing it, and he will craft his own future movements accordingly. It’s fitting that, while an insect rather than a bird, the dragonfly is a creature that flies. There’s a distinctly avian quality to Erik’s watchfulness.

You get dealt the best cards only every so often, and if you wait for them every time, your chips will run out. What’s more, you won’t win any money once you finally have those aces in hand, because even the least attentive player will have ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1335))

And in order to do that, you need to learn to pick your spots: know when to be aggressive, and how to be aggressive. The passive player doesn’t win. And the scared player, who always thinks someone can beat him, doesn’t win. But the openly aggressive player doesn’t win, either; he follows the fate of Aggressive Idiot Asshole. You have to be a strategist. Not playing scared doesn’t mean barreling your way over everything and everyone.

- A few weeks after my first poker win, I’m approached by a magazine to write an article. I look back through my old emails. I’ve played with this opponent before: she’s asked me to write in the past, multiple times. It was always a little too small a sum for the effort required, so I’d never actually written anything. Every time I mentioned money, she walked away. Part of me just wants to accept this assignment: it’s interesting, I’ve done a lot of work on the background already, and the money isn’t all that bad. I’ve been offered worse. It would actually be a nice and needed boost at this precise moment. But on some level, part of me must remember: you can’t play scared. You can’t be afraid of how you look. You can’t be afraid someone will walk away because of what you do or don’t do. You have to play smart. And so I decide to check back: I’m not really doing much freelance work these days, I respond.

Reveal nothing about the strength of my hand until I have to. A day later, I receive another email: What if we paid you more than we’ve offered in the past? This is an opening, and old me would have jumped at it. New me decides I don’t actually have to jump at anything; the smarter strategy might lie in another direction. I’m not sure that would be enough, I counter, since I really need to be paid more than I am at my home magazine to make it worth my while given the constraints on my time. In effect, I’m calling the bet, but I don’t raise. I simply stay in the hand to see what will happen. Three dollars a word, comes the next email. Done. I’ve won the hand and extracted more value than I ever thought I could from it. Thank you, Aggressive Idiot Asshole; you have taught me well.

Probability has amnesia: each future outcome is completely independent of the past. But we persist in thinking that its memory is not only there but personal to us. We’ll be rewarded, eventually, if we’re only patient. It’s only fair. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1572))

- But here’s the all-too-human element: we’re just fine with runs when they are in our favor. Hence the hot hand. When we’re winning, we don’t think we’re due for a change in the least. If the run is on our side, we’re thrilled to let it continue indefinitely. We think the bad streaks are overdue to end yesterday, but no one wants the good to end. Why do smart people persist in these sorts of patterns? As with so many biases, it turns out that there may be a positive element to these illusions—an element that’s closely tied to the very thing I’m most interested in, our conceptions about luck. There’s an idea in psychology, first introduced by Julian Rotter in 1966, called the locus of control. When something happens in the external environment, is it due to our own actions (skill) or some outside factor (chance)? People who have an internal locus of control tend to think that they affect outcomes, often more than they actually do, whereas people who have an external locus of control think that what they do doesn’t matter too much; events will be what they will be. Typically, an internal locus will lead to greater success: people who think they control events are mentally healthier and tend to take more control over their fate, so to speak. Meanwhile, people with an ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1575))

- external locus are more prone to depression and, when it comes to work, a more lackadaisical attitude. Sometimes, though, as in the case of probabilities, an external locus is the correct response: nothing you do matters to the deck. The cards will fall how they may. But if we’re used to our internal locus, which has served us well to get us to the table to begin with, we may mistakenly think that our actions will influence the outcomes, and that probability does care about us, personally. That we’re due to be in a certain part of the distribution, because our aces have already been cracked twice today. They can’t possibly fall yet again. We’ll forget what historian Edward Gibbon warned about as far back as 1794, that “the laws of probability, so true in general, [are] so fallacious in particular”—a lesson history teaches particularly well. And while probabilities do even out in the long term, in the short term, who the hell knows. Anything is possible. I may even final table this charity thing.

- The “big gambling casinos” weren’t exactly that. It wasn’t until Bugsy Siegel brought in the mob and built the Flamingo that Vegas started acquiring something of a more permanent sheen, as a place that wasn’t just on the way to Hollywood but somewhere Hollywood fantasies could come to life. And then Hollywood itself came to Vegas. In 1966, Howard Hughes, the reclusive millionaire mogul, moved into the Desert Inn—and bought the whole hotel rather than leave. He soon owned much of the town. And by the time Steve Wynn decided to build the Mirage, the first of the truly modern Vegas resorts, in 1989, the mob was all but replaced by Hollywood glitter. Vegas should have disappeared into desert. Instead, it became a living, walking fantasy. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1688))

- Once you exit the twilight zone between transit and part-casino, it becomes even harder to tell whether reality still exists or has receded completely. The Strip, that central part of Vegas that holds its myriad casinos and resorts, is engineered so that you never have to see sunlight. There’s Venice under a clear blue sky, with its canals and its piazzas all under one roof. There’s Rome under the stars as you get hopelessly lost among the vast colonnades of Caesars Palace. If flying is an exercise in perspective, seeing the tiny earth from above and realizing just how tiny you yourself are as part of it, the Vegas casino is the opposite. It’s designed to capture your attention and make itself look like the world in its entirety. That’s the true vision of its developers: this is all of life, and you need never leave. Casinos are conceived in a way that depletes your decision-making abilities and emotional reserves. Some of it is on purpose. The slot machines, the free alcohol, the amenities crafted so that you never need to look outside the casino walls. But some are side effects. I don’t know if Sheldon Adelson studied the psychology of creativity or emotional well-being, but had he done so, he’d know ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1698))

- that by building a world where you never have to go outside, he was building a world designed to curtail them. Fresh air, sky, water, trees: these are the elements of clearheadedness. Our minds reset in the presence of greenery. We feel more relaxed after nature walks. We’re less angry, more alive, more thoughtful. Even urban greenery—that is, environments like parks as opposed to actual woodland—can have a similar effect, lowering the stress hormone cortisol, heightening our sense of pleasure, improving our ability to solve difficult problems. (“So casinos aren’t designed for great decision making?” Erik asks me when I share my reservations. “Who would’ve thought.”) Casinos in general—and poker tables in particular—are germ incubators. They are probably worse even than a preschool, since there the surfaces at least get disinfected when the cleaning crew comes through. I’ve touched chips that seem to have been in use since the 1970s without so much as a rinse. Once, I had to tell a player not to touch me after he wanted to demonstrate that he’d washed his hands in the bathroom—by placing a wet hand on top of my arm. I hate Vegas, I think to myself as I wheel my suitcase away from the slot machines, toward the exit. The cold air hits me in a burst of disbelief. It’s full-on Vegas winter. No one ever told me that Vegas can get cold, and that in addition to all the other unpleasantness, I’d also be shivering. Goes to show what I know about desert climates. “I think I hate Vegas,” I tell Erik as I hoist the suitcase into the back of his car.

- “Focus on the process, not the luck. Did I play correctly? Everything else is just BS in our heads,” Erik tells me. “Thinking that way won’t get you anywhere. You know about the randomness of it but it doesn’t help to think about it. You want to make sure you’re not the person in the poker room saying, ‘Can you believe what happened?’ That’s the other people.” I haven’t quite thought of it that way, but as always, the man has a point. How we frame something affects not just our thinking but our emotional state. It may seem a small deal, but the words we select—the ones we filter out and the ones we eventually choose to put forward—are a mirror to our thinking. Clarity of language is clarity of thought—and the expression of a certain sentiment, no matter how innocuous it seems, can change your learning, your thinking, your mindset, your mood, your whole outlook. As W. H. Auden told an interviewer, Webster Schott, in a 1970 conversation, “Language is the mother, not the handmaiden of thought; words will tell you things you never thought or felt before.” The language we use becomes our mental habits—and our mental habits determine how we learn, how we grow, what we become. It’s not just a question of semantics: telling bad beat stories matters. Our thinking about luck has real consequences in terms of our emotional well-being, our decisions, and the way we implicitly view the world and our role in it.

- There is no such thing as objective reality. Every time we experience something, we interpret it for ourselves. How we phrase sentences—are we the one doing the acting or being acted upon?—can determine whether we have an internal or external locus of control, whether we’re masters of our fates or peons of forces beyond us. Do we see ourselves as victims or victors? A victim: The cards went against me. Things are being done to me, things are happening around me, and I am neither to blame nor in control. A victor: I made the correct decision. Sure, the outcome didn’t go my way, but I thought correctly under pressure. And that’s the skill I can control.

In poker, if you’re one of the bad beat dwellers, you can still just hop into the next tournament and regale the table with talk of the unfairness of the poker gods (you’ll be a sought-after companion, no doubt). If you suffer a bad beat in life, it may set you back considerably more—and last a lot longer. All of a sudden, your framing matters significantly more. A victim of the cruel cards? This may serve as something I think of as a luck dampener effect: because you’re wallowing in your misfortune, you fail to see the things you could be doing to overcome it.

- you think, I’ll lose anyway, why try?; your mental health suffers; and the spiral continues. If you think of yourself instead as an almost-victor who thought correctly and did everything possible but was foiled by crap variance? No matter: you will have other opportunities, and if you keep thinking correctly, eventually it will even out. These are the seeds of resilience, of being able to overcome the bad beats that you can’t avoid and mentally position yourself to be prepared for the next time. People share things with you: if you’ve lost your job, your social network thinks of you when new jobs come up; if you’re recently divorced or separated or bereaved, and someone single who may be a good match pops up, you’re top of mind. That attitude is what I think of as a luck amplifier. Sure, you can’t actually change the cards, and the variance will be what it will be—but you will feel a whole lot happier and better adjusted while you take life’s blows, and your ready mindset will prepare you for the change in variance that will come at some point… ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=1916))

- you do simply because you have more information available to you, can be a dangerous thing. In this particular case, Edward does block the nut flush, it’s true. But there is also a straight flush possibility out there, one that becomes a reality on the river. By that point, though, Edward is so invested in his game plan that he fails to adjust. Lack of presence has brought down many a player. (“What was he thinking?” Erik tells me on the next break, when we discuss the hand that Edward and Bob played. “Bob would have never played a weak hand that way. If you’d been paying attention to what he was signaling, you knew he had a flush, at the very least.” And Erik seems to not be alone in his opinion. Ike, who’s been following our conversation and heard Edward’s short rant at his departure, chimes in with his signature half laugh: “The good thing about poker is there’s enough luck that you never have to admit it’s your fault you lost.”) Attention is a powerful mitigator to overconfidence: it forces you to constantly reevaluate your knowledge and your game plan, lest you become too tied to a certain course of action. And if you lose? Well, it allows you to admit when it’s actually your fault and not a bad beat. The connection to bad beats runs even deeper. The more focus you can bring to something, the more attention you pay, the more you maximize your skill edge before the bad beat can even happen—and so you minimize the times when you leave your fate in the cards. You fold before that runout that you will then foist as garbage on whatever neighbor happens to be near. You can’t avoid bad beats altogether. But paying attention is one of the best ways I can see of minimizing the window for negative variance to peek through. In an age of constant distraction and never-ending connectivity, we may be so busy that we miss the signals that tell us to swerve before we’re in the bad beat’s path.

Is it like the dog that didn’t bark in “Silver Blaze”—the absence of information that conveys crucial evidence? In that particular story, the fact that a dog didn’t bark meant that the intruder was someone the dog knew; had it been a stranger, there would have been noise. In a phenomenon known as omission neglect, we often pay attention to the barks but not to the moments when they are absent: we ignore what is omitted. That’s not quite Phil’s point.

- When you defend your dissertation in grad school, at least at Columbia, you have the option of having your defense be private, with just the committee members, or public, open to anyone who wants to attend. When it came time for me to plan mine, I decided on the public option. I was nervous to be presenting to some of the best psychologists in the world—but also had to make sure that what I said would be accessible to everyone in the room, even those with no knowledge of my topic. There was one section in particular I fretted about: how to explain the sense of overconfidence that smart people so often exhibit without making anyone feel personally under attack. I’d settled on one particular illustration, but until the moment I actually used it in my talk, I didn’t know if I’d have the nerve to pull it off. That’s because the illustration involved calling people “big swinging dicks.” I’d borrowed the image from Michael Lewis’s description of the old Salomon Brothers trading floor in Liar’s Poker. The people who’d made the most money and were allowed to have certain privileges as a result were referred to on the floor as big swinging dicks, and Lewis’s aspiration was to one day be a big swinging dick himself. The image had stuck with me, and I decided that, when illustrating the failure of the best minds to adjust to reality and their persistence in being irrationally proud of their strategy and performance and, well, balls, I’d bring up the big swinging dicks. And I did. And to my immense relief, the great Walter Mischel and company burst out laughing. It was, after all, the perfect image for the kind of misplaced, single-minded aggression that we’d observed over and over in people who failed to account for the outsize role of chance in shaping events around them. That’s what I think about now, at this, my first ever final table. It’s all about big swinging dicks, isn’t it. To them goes the money, the support, the adulation. The most irrationally exuberant have the most entrusted to them. They’re used to pushing others out of the way ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2322))

When I excitedly tell Erik about my rate of cashes at a final breakfast before flying back to New York, I’m expecting something of a standing ovation, or at least a muted declaration of fellow excitement. See how well he’s done teaching me the ropes? What I get instead is the kind of “Well . . .” that I’ve come to associate with the moments where he’s trying and failing to extract some sort of positive lesson from a hand I’ve absolutely butchered. It’s the face a parent makes when taking a bite of a cookie his first-time-baker six-year-old proudly presents, only to realize that she’s mistakenly dumped in salt instead of sugar. I must admit I’m confused. What’s not to like? “Generally speaking,” Erik begins, “your tournament cash rate should be around twenty, twenty-five percent. Not fifty percent.” What? I’m cashing too much? How is that a bad thing? ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2659))

That makes sense, but I still am not sure how I’m doing anything wrong. “You need to be playing for the win, not for the min cash. If you’re cashing this much and then busting soon after, you are doing something wrong. You’re getting to the bubble short-stacked.” I think back on my tournaments and realize that he’s right. Every single time, I just tried to hold on until the money. For multiple hours, as we got close, I’d get cautious, fold hands, bow to pressure. I didn’t want to be the person who bubbled—that is, bust out of the tournament right before being paid. I wanted the cash. And wanting the cash isn’t the same as wanting the win. “Generally, the people who cash the most are actually losing players. You can’t be a winning player by min cashing. It’s just not possible.” Do the math, he urges me. How much does airfare cost? Hotels? Food? How high were the entries to the tournaments I didn’t cash? Now how much am I making for this trip?

Those fields were small enough that to cash, you all but had to final table. The money was concentrated at the top, just like here, but I’d reached it. This isn’t just a better player pool. It’s a much larger one. Instead of beating out thirty or a hundred players, you have to get through hundreds, sometimes thousands. The math is completely different. The considerations are different. Sure, I may have learned the basics of not busting early, of slowly building chips, of playing a solid game of poker. But I haven’t really learned about the dynamics of multiday events, about bubbles, about the type of aggression you need to exhibit—can’t avoid exhibiting—if you want to actually have a shot at finishing well. At this level, it becomes a far different game. I feel momentarily overwhelmed. It all suddenly feels that much further out of reach, instead of closer. “Don’t get me wrong,” Erik says. “You’re doing… ([Location 2675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2675))

- level and cash, we need to work on identifying what you’re doing wrong leading up to the money. I’d rather you cash less, but go deeper.” Be willing to bust more often, take the higher variance lines that might mean I lose all my chips—but if I win, will propel me into a far more commanding position to go deeper, last longer, get closer to that final table. Be willing to be more aggressive even if that means losing more. There’s a saying in poker that if you’re never caught in a bluff, you’re not bluffing enough. I try to think of a time in the last week when I showed down a bluff with pride, confidently flipping over my cards when someone called my final bet even though I knew I held nothing, and I come up short. “Good players are going to realize if the min cash is important to you,” Erik says. “And they’re going to take advantage of that. They’ll really abuse you.” In poker, I’m experiencing firsthand the learning trajectory that I so often modeled in the lab. The more you learn, the harder it gets. The better you get, the worse you are—because the flaws that you wouldn’t even think of looking at before are now visible and need to be addressed. If you want to grow, if you want to progress, you need to always dig deeper. It’s fine to be proud at some milestones, like cashing in an international event—but it’s also important to stay focused on the bigger picture, and remain aware of how much you have yet to accomplish. It’s important not to let a minor victory lull you into thinking you’re doing great, when all you’re doing is better than before but not good enough to actually make it count. Too often, we settle for the minor tokens that mark our accomplishment—the participation trophy rather than that podium finish—and let them make us feel that just fine is good enough. And sometimes, maybe it is. But not now, not here, not for me. Erik isn’t discouraging me. Quite the opposite. He’s moving my target ever higher. He’s fighting my complacency before I realize I could possibly become complacent. Min cashing is great, and a good goal before, just to show that I could actually play in this field. But now I’ve shown I can. We move the goal higher. We move… ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2685))

- the real money. And the good players? I’ve likely been abused more than I realize, bluffed off a hand, pushed off a pot, made to fold in a spot where I shouldn’t have just because I was so fixated on proving that I could last, that I could cash, that I could get that little Monaco flag under my name on my Hendon Mob page. Do I do that often? I find myself asking. Do I go for the min cash in my life decisions, holding on for the safer sure thing rather than taking more risk for the more uncertain but ultimately more attractive option? Do I lack gamble in my life? Do I let myself be taken advantage of by people who recognize the fright behind my eyes? I’m not sure I’m prepared to know the answer. “Do you think I’ll be ready to play the Main in two months?” I almost whisper. “Let’s see what happens,” Erik says. “We’ll take a look at the preliminary schedule and see how you’re doing.” He proposes I play the smaller events, maybe a satellite or two, to see how everything is coming together. I’ve come a long way in a short time, it’s true. But when he originally took me on, we discussed a year of preparation. In his mind, that was a year of playing. Not a third of a year. A third of a year is a high ask for anyone. I nod. I’ll do everything I can. ([Location 2704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2704))

- We form impressions about someone from the first moment we see them. As Solomon Asch, one of the great psychologists of the twentieth century, once wrote, “We look at a person and immediately a certain impression of his character forms itself in us. A glance, a few spoken words are sufficient to tell us a story about a highly complex matter. We know that such impressions form with remarkable rapidity and with great ease. Subsequent observations may enrich or upset our view, but we can no more prevent its rapid growth than we can avoid perceiving a given visual object or hearing a melody.” Indeed, we now know that we don’t even need a few words or a real glance: in as little as thirty-four milliseconds—less than the time it takes to blink—we have already formed judgments on things like trustworthiness and aggression. We grow more confident in these judgments the longer we look at someone, says Alexander Todorov, ([Location 2760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2760))

- the man largely responsible for refining our knowledge of perception into ever-tinier and tinier fragments of time, but we don’t often change that initial reading. The process occurs at the level of perception rather than thinking: it’s subconscious, processed by our visual system rather than the part of our brain responsible for logical assessment. And it’s remarkably powerful. I see a shaved head and tattoos, and bingo! I think aggression. I think maniac. I think bully. I see someone in his seventies, smiling sweetly and asking me to translate for him because he’s found out I speak Russian and he doesn’t understand English—of course! I’m happy to help—and I think, when he raises me in a huge pot, well, I guess I have to fold my two pair because he clearly has me beat. And then, of course, he triumphantly turns over the bluff and I find myself short on chips and feeling awfully sad that the nice old man I helped could have possibly bluffed me like that. There are no friends at the poker table, the saying goes, but I still somehow take it personally. Why did he have to turn over the bluff with quite so much glee? Couldn’t he have at least had the decency to pretend he held a good hand? Our brains, it turns out, are veritable prediction machines. We are constantly making sense of the environment—and making guesses about what will happen. It’s called predictive processing: we actively think one step ahead and look at the environment accordingly. Our brains are more proactive than reactive. Whether our predictions are accurate or not, of course, depends on the inputs and the prediction-making process. Whether they improve in accuracy or not over time depends on our capacity and willingness to learn. The moment someone new sits down at the table, I’m already predicting how he will play. I’m already adjusting my own moves accordingly. I’m already changing my strategy, even at the most subconscious level, simply based on my impression. I don’t do this on purpose. I don’t do this actively. It just happens. It’s on me to notice it and to change it if it’s wrong. Otherwise, it will govern my actions without my quite realizing it. When we make thin-slice judgments of people—the term for the fleeting perceptions our brain creates, first coined by psychologist Nalini Ambady—our inputs are often mistaken. We’re governed by things like facial structures and expressions—the things we rely on in those thirty-four-millisecond judgments—as well as our own past experiences, which, as it usually happens, are closer to incidental peripheral noise that has no bearing on the current situation. We decide that a person is aggressive because they have tattooed biceps like someone ([Location 2767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2767))

- But our denial belies the fact that we often don’t really know why we make decisions—and we justify them with objective-sounding reasons even when, in reality, we were acting based on faulty intuitive reads. That’s not so bad if we were to listen to corrections. But instead, we often argue with the truth: if someone gives us our actual thought process, we dismiss it in favor of the version we’ve constructed for ourselves. In a series of now-classic studies, psychologists Richard Nisbett and Timothy Wilson found that people systematically denied the reason for their decision even after presented with evidence. First, they showed students a video clip of a college professor giving a lecture on the philosophy ([Location 2820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2820))

- of education in a European accent. In some cases, he was warm and friendly in answering questions. In others, autocratic and distrustful. The students then rated his likability, his physical appearance, his mannerisms, and his accent. The ones who had seen the warm video not only liked the professor more (a reasonable response) but rated his appearance, mannerisms, and accent as attractive, whereas those who’d seen the cold video not only disliked him but rated those same three factors as irritating—even though the professor and the lecture itself had remained identical. What’s more, in the students’ minds, the causality for their choices was flipped: they were certain they’d found the professor more or less likable because of the other three factors, and not, as was actually the case, the other way around.

- More often than not, though, we aren’t motivated to correct our mistaken reads. We operate instead by an inflated sense of our own power of person perception. After all, we’re social animals! We’ve had all the practice in the world. And we can always blame our faulty reads on something else—I’m normally so good at this, but here’s why this specific case was an exception. One thing we’re incredibly good at is making excuses for ourselves and crafting explanations for why we’re still as good as we thought.

- If your goal is predictive accuracy, it’s enough to bring you to despair. Can I soul-read? The real answer is usually a resounding no, despite what I might think at the moment. Sorry to disappoint everyone who seems to think that just because someone studies psychology and the psychology of deception, they’re qualified to judge when someone else is lying. On the flip side, if there’s anything I learned from studying con artists, it’s that the better the deceiver, the worse we are at spotting the deception. Paul Ekman, the psychologist most closely associated with studying how well we can discern deception, found that the vast majority of people don’t fare any better than a coin toss at deciding whether someone is lying ([Location 2849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2849))

- or telling the truth—and even with significant training, people are unlikely to spot the practiced deceiver. The face, in the end, is not a particularly good metric—and the eyes are certainly not the window into the soul. If you try to stare someone down to figure out if they are for real, you’re in for a disappointment. So do I just admit defeat and give up on tells? The answer to that, it turns out, is also a resounding no. Impressions, whether based on a certain look, as in the case of my maniac turned nit, or on certain actions (he’s raising me every hand!), can actually be valuable. I’ve witnessed enough Lodden Thinks, for one, to see that some people really can pick up on seemingly invisible information. Maybe not deception as such. But something. It’s just that one very specific criterion has to be met: the resulting judgment has to be based on reams of data. Hundreds of hands, in the case of poker, thousands of points of behavioral observation. Countless hours, repeated interactions. It’s too easy to read into something because it meshes with your existing perceptions, but the validity of any information is highly suspect unless it’s layered in expertise. The cognitive shortcuts that are problematic in isolation become powerful when backed by the kind of data and observation that we simply don’t have time to gather ([Location 2854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=2854))

(I can’t help but think of moments in my past, at the table and far from it, when I was likely bluffed but failed to see the signs—either because I wasn’t looking or I didn’t know where or how to look. It’s uncomfortable enough that I don’t particularly want to dwell on it. I don’t like thinking of myself as a sucker.) Concealment, or how a player chooses to actively hide what they perceive to be telling behaviors, is actually the second type of pattern that the Beyond Tells team has found. “It’s a lot more difficult to process and understand,” Blake says. “It’s not really about the processing of raw emotion”—the proverbial poker face. “It’s about understanding a player’s level of concealment and how exactly they are concealing.” How still is someone, for instance? Maybe they are very still when bluffing but only partially still with the nuts. “Same strategy, different magnitude,” Blake says. Or maybe their hand placement differs. Or their breathing. Find out how they conceal and you begin the process of reverse engineering exactly what they might be concealing. Blake is hesitant to give out any more specifics, and I don’t blame him.

But I do want to get specific about one player: me. Would Blake agree to break down my nonverbal cues the same way he has in his courses? Am I more of an open book than I think—and if I am, could he give me a pointer or two to render me more inscrutable? Can he make sure that I’m a locked box rather than a tell box before I sit down to take on the summer sharks? “I love this stuff,” he says. “Let’s do it.” And so, over the next two months, Blake does what he’s been doing for the past six years: he looks at multiple hours of my live play, complete with hole cards, correlates it with the thousands of hands and hours he’s seen from other players, and gives me a report.

Boy, did we have some in-depth conversations before they pulled their big moves. And they certainly seemed to have gotten a much better read on me than I did on them. I was being genuine.

- Scene: A six-year-old me on the playground in the back of the subsidized housing complex we’ve just moved into. It’s nothing fancy, a swing, a slide, a set of metal bars for climbing, swinging, monkeying around. Those bars are my nemesis. I desperately want to be able to hug the thin rail with my knees and swing down, carefree, hands dangling midway to the ground, seeing the world from an inverted freedom. My older sisters do it effortlessly. And oh god, how I want to join them (though I’d never say it out loud). I feel like a stupid, silly fraud. One of them taunts me. I try, for what seems like the hundredth time. I sit on top of the bar. I slide slowly down so that my knees brace against the top, as I’ve seen them do. I start leaning back. And I can’t let go. My hands won’t let me. I’m stuck in an awkward half crouch and must once more admit defeat as I lever myself back up to full sitting position. I can’t help it. I’m simply too afraid my legs will betray me and I’ll go crashing headfirst to ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3078))

- the pavement. All I can think of is my broken neck, and how pointless of a way it would all be to die. “Scaredy-cat,” a kid yells. I am. I know it. But I just cannot let go. To this day, I’ve never swung upside down off a monkey bar. I’ve done headstands and handstands, dives and balances, but the playground remains unconquered. I’m a scaredy-cat. Risk-taking scale score, from zero (never takes risk) to ten (always seeks risk): negative two, give or take. And yet. When I was in college, I decided that for my senior thesis, I would travel to Georgia—the country, not the state. And I would do so during a civil war. You see, I wanted to observe decision-making psychology in action, to experience how real people and real leaders reacted during real crises, not just ones that had been created in a college lab. And so, notebook in hand, I flew halfway across the world, hired a bodyguard, and made my way into the literal line of fire. What risk-taking score do I get on that one? How about for putting my career at the New Yorker on hold to play poker? Or for being too afraid to ever ride on a motorcycle or fly in a helicopter unless under duress? Or for moving in with my now husband less than two months after we met? Or for never having tried a single recreational drug, not even pot, because I’m too afraid to ([Location 3085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3085))

- cause any sort of permanent damage to my neurons? At the end of it all, am I risk-seeking or risk-averse? The answer, as Walter would tell you, is it all depends on the situation. It’s impossible to tell in the abstract. But at the poker table, it turns out, my “profile,” or behavioral signature, as Walter would call it, emerges in full. Blake could pick up on some small physical habits that may give off information—and I’m certainly going to make every single effort to eliminate those entirely. But the more powerful tells could well be psychological. I shy away from small risks—in a marginal spot, where a more aggressive player may call or raise, I’ll just choose to fold. But given the right circumstances, I’m also apt to run insane bluffs for my tournament life. Observe me over a day at the table, and you’… ([Location 3094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3094))

- One of the most important lessons of poker strategy, intimately connected to self-assessment, is this: sometimes, it’s the hands you don’t play that win you the title. We remember the hero calls. What about the hero folds? What you don’t do rather than what you do—that can be greatness. The art of letting go can be the truly strong one. Acknowledging when you’re behind rather than continuing to put good money after bad. Acknowledging when the landscape has shifted and you need to make a shift yourself as a result.

Know when you need to reassess your strategy, prior plans be damned. Everyone thought he’d play. I thought he’d play. He’d thought he’d play. And then he didn’t. And it was all fine. And he went on to play that event the following year—this time, he was feeling just great—and came in fourth place, for over $1.2 million.

- THE CONCEPT OF TILT in poker is one that’s remarkably malleable: it applies to all sorts of situations. It means that you’re letting emotions—incidental ones that aren’t actually integral to your decision process—affect your decision making. You are no longer thinking rationally. It can be used as a noun (I’m on tilt), verb (I tilted), or adjective (that guy is so tilting), and it’s a pithy way to recognize and describe when your decisions are not what they should be.

- But everyone tilts differently. And while tilt often is a negative feeling—anger, frustration, and the like—it can also be a positive emotion—being very happy at winning a hand, liking someone at the table, and so on. All it means is that you’re experiencing an emotion that is not, strictly speaking, related to your decision.

- Touching a hot stove makes you feel pain and anger—and you avoid touching the stove in the future. By anticipating the negative emotion caused by pain, you make a more prudent choice the next time around. We experience emotions for a reason, and the goal is not to stop experiencing them. Instead, the goal is to learn to identify our emotions, analyze their cause, and if they’re not actually part of our rational decision process—and more often than not, they aren’t—dismiss them as sources of information.

- In Schwarz and Clore’s seminal study on the phenomenon they term “mood as information,” they called people in various zip codes to ask them how satisfied they were with their life—a simple question rather than an elaborate decision task. The zip codes were chosen alongside weather reports. Some people were experiencing a sunny day, and others a rainy day. On average, people expressed higher life satisfaction when the sun was out. But the effect disappeared when the experimenter drew their attention to the weather, by asking, “How’s the weather down there?” ([Location 3562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3562))

- Tell people what’s going on, though, and they can often overcome it. Which is great news for dealing with tilt—at least up to a point. If I start to understand the sources of my tilt, I have a chance to stop misattributing the emotions I’m feeling to other things and instead to dismiss the emotions as irrelevant. If I’m upset about losing a pot, I can acknowledge that fact and realize it’s not technically relevant to the next hand. Unfortunately, that remedy seems to work only for the kinds of emotions that are more subtle than not—more priming effect than visceral storm. When it comes to emotions that are stronger, you often can’t get away. Anger. Jubilation. The emotions that have a powerful magnitude—they are visceral and strong—tend to creep in no matter what. Knowing you are acting emotionally rather than rationally ([Location 3569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3569))

- isn’t enough: the knowledge can’t protect or prevent you from the course you’re on. It’s unlikely that telling Steinmetz’s gambler that he’s a bit angry before he bites into the wooden table will prevent that table, or his teeth, from breaking all the same. All it would likely accomplish is catch you in the crossfire. ([Location 3575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3575))

- In those cases, it may help to learn to anticipate the emotion before it arises, thereby cutting it off at the source. Walter Mischel often said that he couldn’t keep chocolate in his house. He knew himself too well: if it was there, he would eat it, even though he had spent his life mastering self-control. The chocolate caused positive tilt. A longing so intense it couldn’t be denied. That’s why preventing that emotion in the first place was so essential. You need to learn to anticipate how something will make you feel in the future and act accordingly in the present.

- What we need to do is optimize my thought process in the moment. Erik can give me all the actual strategy advice I need before and after the fact, preparing me to play and analyzing my hands. He can even prepare me for the fact of tilt. “You really have to make sure that you’re still thinking clearly and still going through the process of thinking through things in a way that’s not influenced or impacted by the fact that you just lost or won a big hand,” he’s told me before. But in the moment, as hot conditions rise, I need to prepare myself to deal with the emotions that will inevitably bubble up. How do I control them in order to be able to go back to my rational process, the one that Erik and I have constructed? To do that, we need to do some emotional digging. I already know that I have emotional triggers—I’ve said as much. ([Location 3602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=3602))

- Jared gives me an assignment: I need to map out my emotional process so that I can start finding ways to solve each problem. I need to actually sit down and make a spreadsheet. Each time something happens, write it down in the situation or trigger column. In the next column, write a description of the thoughts, emotional reactions, and behaviors that the situation or trigger causes. In the next column, give my best assessment of the underlying flaw or problem, and finally, write a logic statement that I can use in the moment to inject some rationality into the issue.

- In one study conducted in Italy, for instance, seven hundred students were randomly assigned to seat numbers during a written exam. Some of the numbers were tagged as culturally lucky—that is, according to Italian cultural reference, they brought good fortune--and others unlucky. It turns out that students who were in the “lucky” seats were consistently overconfident in how they would do—and those in “unlucky” seats were actually expecting lower grades. Confidence is an important factor in how you play. Wouldn’t you want to minimize the potential confounding variables? On the one hand, I recognize the power of the placebo effect: if you believe it’s working, it may well work. If you think an object brings you luck, you are more confident. And yet what the Italian students in the “lucky” seats showed wasn’t confidence; it was overconfidence. They thought they were doing better, but the evidence didn’t actually back them up. And then there’s the flip side of the placebo, the nocebo effect: the belief in evil signs or bad luck. It turns out people can literally scare themselves to death. If you think you’ve been cursed or otherwise made ill, you may end up actually getting sick, failing to improve poor health, or, yes, dying altogether. In one medically documented instance, a man was given three months to live after a diagnosis of metastatic cancer of the esophagus. He died shortly after. When his body was autopsied, doctors realized that he had been misdiagnosed: he did indeed have cancer, but a tiny, non-metastatic tumor on his liver. Clinically speaking, it could not have killed him. But, it seems, being told he was dying of a fatal illness brought about that very outcome. In another case, a man thought he was hexed by a voodoo priest. He came close to death, only to recover miraculously after an enterprising doctor “reversed” the curse through a series of made-up words. In yet a third, a man almost died in the emergency room ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQYGSL&location=4201))

- after overdosing on pills. He’d been in a drug trial for depression and decided to end his life with the antidepressants he’d been prescribed. His vitals were so bad when he was admitted that doctors didn’t think he would make it—until they discovered his blood was completely clear of any drugs. He’d been taking a placebo. Once he found out he had not in fact taken a life-threatening quantity of pills, he recovered quickly. The effect our mind has on our body makes for a scary proposition.

- AUTHOR AND STATISTICIAN NASSIM TALEB distrusts the premise of my entire project: he believes we cannot use games as models of real life because in life, the rules derived from games can break down in unforeseen ways. It’s called the ludic fallacy. Games are too simplified. Life has all sorts of things it can throw at you to make your careful calculations useless. And that’s true enough. After all, that knowledge is precisely what brought me to poker. That life is uncertain. That we can’t know everything. That we can’t control it all, no matter how much we think we may be able to.
