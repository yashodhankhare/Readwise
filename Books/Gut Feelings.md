- The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. —Blaise Pascal ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=83))

- April 8, 1779 If you doubt, set down all the Reasons, pro and con, in opposite Columns on a Sheet of Paper, and when you have considered them two or three Days, perform an Operation similar to that in some questions of Algebra; observe what Reasons or Motives in each Column are equal in weight, one to one, one to two, two to three, or the like, and when you have struck out from both Sides all the Equalities, you will see in which column remains the Balance. […] This kind of Moral Algebra I have often practiced in important and dubious Concerns, and tho’ it cannot be mathematically exact, I have found it extreamly useful. By the way, if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married. I am ever your affectionate Uncle, B. FRANKLIN1 ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=108))

- Here and in similar experiments, deliberate thinking about reasons seems to lead to decisions that make us less happy, just as consciously thinking about how to ride a bike or put on a spontaneous smile is not always better than its automatic version. The unconscious parts of our mind can ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=126))

- People who reported exhaustive search in shopping and leisure were called maximizers, because they tried hard to get the best. Those who engaged in a limited search and ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=134))

- settled quickly with the first alternative that was satisfactory or “good enough” were called satisficers.3 Satisficers were reported to be more optimistic and have higher self-esteem and life satisfaction, whereas maximizers excelled in depression, perfectionism, regret, and self-blame.

- The answer is surprisingly simple. The Germans used a rule of thumb known as the recognition heuristic:4 ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=150))

- If you recognize the name of one city but not that of the other, then infer that the recognized city has the larger population. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=152))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The American students could not use this rule of thumb because they had heard of both cities. They knew too much. Myriad facts muddled their judgment and prevented them from finding the right answer. A beneficial degree of ignorance can be valuable, although relying on name recognition is of course not foolproof. For instance, Japanese tourists will likely falsely infer that Heidelberg is larger than Bielefeld, not having heard of the latter. Nonetheless, this rule gets the answer right in most cases and does so better than a considerable amount of knowledge does.

- When a man throws a ball high in the air and catches it again, he behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting the trajectory of the ball. He may neither know nor care what a differential equation is, but this does not affect his skill with the ball. At some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to the mathematical calculations is going on.5 ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=173))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is there a simple rule of thumb that players use to catch balls? Experimental studies have shown that experienced players in fact use several rules of thumb. One of these is the gaze heuristic, which works in situations where a ball is already high up in the air: Fix your gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=187))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The angle of gaze is the angle between the eye and the ball, relative to the ground. A player who uses this rule does not need to measure wind, air resistance, spin, or the other causal variables. All the relevant facts are contained in one variable: the angle of gaze. Note that a player using the gaze heuristic is not able to compute the point at which the ball will land. Yet the heuristic leads the player to the landing point. As mentioned before, the gaze heuristic works in situations where the ball is already high in the air. If this is not yet the case, the player only needs to change the last of his strategy’s three “building blocks”:7 ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=192))

- Fix your gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that the image of the ball rises at a constant rate. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=197))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One can intuitively see its logic. If the player sees the ball rising from the point it was hit with accelerating speed, he’d better run backward, because the ball will hit the ground behind his present position. If, however, the ball rises with decreasing speed, he needs to run toward the ball instead. If the ball rises at a constant speed, the player is in the right position. Now we can understand both how people catch fly balls without thinking and the cause of Phil’s dilemma. Although the coach wrongly believed that players somehow calculate a trajectory, they in fact unconsciously rely on a simple rule of thumb that dictates the speed at which a player runs. Because Phil didn’t understand why he did what he did either, he couldn’t defend himself. Not knowing the rule of thumb can have unwanted consequences.

- Most fielders are blithely unaware of the gaze heuristic, despite its simplicity.8 Once the rationale underlying an intuitive feeling is made conscious, however, it can be taught. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=205))

- The gaze heuristic and its relatives work for a class of problems that involve the interception of moving objects. In both ball games and pursuit, it helps to generate collisions, while in flying and sailing, it helps to avoid them.9 Intercepting moving objects is an important adaptive task in ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=211))

- human history, and we easily generalize the gaze heuristic from its evolutionary origins—such as hunting—to ball games. Interception techniques travel across species. From fish to bats, many organisms have the innate ability to track an object flying through three-dimensional space, a biological precondition for the gaze heuristic. The teleost fish catches its prey by keeping a constant angle between its line of motion and that of the target, and male hoverflies intercept females in the same way for mating.10 When a dog goes after a sailing Frisbee, it is guided by the same instinct as the outfielder. In fact, a Frisbee has a more complicated flight path than a baseball; it curves in the air. By attaching a tiny camera to the head of a spaniel, a study showed that the dog ran so that the image of the ball was kept moving along a straight line.11 Interestingly, although the gaze heuristic works on an unconscious level, part of it appears in popular wisdom. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=214))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Note that the gaze heuristic does not work for all interception problems. As many ballplayers say, the hardest ball to catch is the one that heads straight at you, a situation in which this rule of thumb is of no use. The gaze heuristic exemplifies how a complex problem that no robot could match a human in solving—catching a ball in real time—can be easily mastered. It ignores all causal information relevant to computing the ball’s trajectory and only attends to one piece of information, the angle of gaze. Its rationale is myopic, relying on incremental changes, rather than on the ideal of first computing the best solution and thereafter acting on it. Strategies relying on incremental changes also characterize how organizations decide on their yearly budgets. At the Max Planck Institute where I work, my colleagues and I make slight adjustments to last year’s budget, rather than calculating a new budget from scratch. Neither athletes nor business administrators need to know how to calculate the trajectory of the ball or the business. An intuitive “shortcut” will typically get them where they would like to be, and with a smaller chance of making grave errors.

- Let me be clear about what a gut feeling is.17 I use the terms gut feeling, intuition, or hunch interchangeably, to refer to a judgment that appears quickly in consciousness, whose underlying reasons we are not fully aware of, and is strong enough to act upon. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=279))

- But can we trust our guts? ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=283))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Therefore the real question is not if but when can we trust our guts? To find the answer, we must figure out how intuition actually works in the first place. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=290))

- In this book, I will argue that intuition is more than impulse and caprice; it has its own rationale. Let me first explain what I believe this rationale is not. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=294))

- How do I believe gut feelings work? Their rationale consists of two components: simple rules of thumb, which take advantage of ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=301))

- evolved capacities of the brain. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=302))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The term evolved does not refer to a skill made by nature or nurture alone. Rather, nature gives humans a capability, and extended practice turns it into a capacity. Without evolved capacities, the simple rule could not do the job; without the rule, the capacities alone could not solve the problem either. There are two ways to understand the nature of gut feelings. One is derived from logical principles and assumes that intuition solves a complex problem with a complex strategy. The other involves psychological principles, which bet on simplicity and take advantage of our evolved brain. Franklin’s rule embodies the logical way: for each action, specify all consequences, weigh them carefully, and add the numbers up; then choose the one with the highest value or utility. Modern versions of this rule are known as maximizing the expected utility. This logical view assumes that minds function like calculating machines and ignores our evolved capacities, including cognitive abilities and social instincts. Yet these capacities come for free and enable fast and simple solutions for complex problems. The first goal of this book is to explicate the hidden rules of thumb underlying intuition, and the second is to understand when intuitions are likely to succeed—or fail. The intelligence of the unconscious is in knowing, without thinking, which rule is likely to work in which situation.

- In the year 2000, the investment magazine Capital announced a stock-picking contest. More than 10,000 participants, including the editor-in-chief, submitted portfolios. The editor laid down the rules: he chose fifty international Internet equities and set out a period of six weeks in which everyone could buy, hold, or sell any of these stocks in order to make profit. Many tried to gain as much information and insider knowledge about the stocks as possible, while others used high-speed computers to pick the right portfolio. But one portfolio stood out from all others. This portfolio was based on collective ignorance rather than on expert knowledge and fancy software, and it was submitted by economist Andreas Ortmann and myself. We had looked for semi-ignorant people who knew so little about stocks that they had not even heard of many of them. We asked a hundred pedestrians in Berlin, fifty men and fifty women, which of the fifty stocks they recognized. Taking the ten stocks whose names were most often recognized, we created a portfolio. We submitted it to the contest in a buy-and-hold pattern; that is, we did not change the composition of the portfolio once it was purchased. We hit a down market, which was not good news. Nevertheless, our portfolio based on collective recognition gained 2.5 percent. The benchmark proposed by Capital was its editor-in-chief, who knew more than all the hundred pedestrians together. His portfolio lost 18.5 percent. The recognition portfolio also had higher gains than 88 percent of all portfolios submitted, and beat various Capital indices. As a control, we had submitted a low-recognition portfolio with the ten stocks least recognized by the pedestrians, and it performed almost as badly as the editor-in-chief ’s. Results were similar in a second study, where we also analyzed gender differences. Interestingly, women recognized fewer stocks, yet the portfolio based on their recognition made more money than those based on men’s recognition. This finding is consistent with earlier studies suggesting that women are less confident about their financial savvy, yet intuitively perform better.10 In these two studies, partial ignorance rather than extensive knowledge paid. Was that a one-off stroke of luck, as financial advisers are quick to suggest? As there is no foolproof investment strategy, name recognition will not always be a winner. We conducted a series of experiments that together suggest, however, that mere brand-name recognition matches financial experts, blue-chip mutual funds, and the market.11 You may be asking whether I myself trust the collective wisdom enough to put my money where my mouth is. In one case I did and invested some fifty thousand dollars in a portfolio created by the name recognition of the most ignorant pedestrian group. After six months, the portfolio had gained 47 percent, better than the market and mutual funds managed by financial experts fared.

- According to rational choice theory, people weigh the costs and benefits of each alternative and pick the one they prefer. The more alternatives people have the higher the chance that the best one will be included and the more satisfied customers will be. But this is not how the human mind works.

- THE BEST POPS UP FIRST A golfer has to go through a long list of steps when putting: judge the line of the ball, the grain of the turf, and the distance and angle to the hole; position the ball; align shoulders, hips, and feet to the left of the target; prepare for backswing; and so on. What advice should a coach give to a golfer? How about “Take your time, concentrate on what you are doing, and don’t get distracted by anything around you.” That seems like clever consulting to some, and patently obvious to others; in any case, it is backed by research on the… ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=503))

- In an experiment, novices and expert golfers were studied under two conditions: they had either only up to three seconds for each putt or all the time they wanted.18 Under time pressure, as mentioned, novices performed worse and had fewer target hits. Yet surprisingly, experts hit the target more often when they had less time than when they had no time limit. In a second experiment, players were either instructed to pay attention to their swing or distracted by an unrelated, second task (counting tape-recorded tones). When they were asked to pay attention to their swing, as one might expect, novices did better than when they were distracted. Yet with experts, it was again the opposite. When experts concentrated on their swings, their performance decreased; when experts’ attention was distracted, their… ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=510))

- Thus, having more time to generate options opens the door for inferior ones. This ability to generate the best options first is characteristic of an experienced player. Inexperienced players, by contrast, will not automatically generate the best actions first, and for them, more time and reflection may help. That the best option tends to pop up first has been reported for experts in various fields, such as firefighters and pilots.20 ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=535))

- The speed-accuracy trade-off is one of psychology’s well-established more-is-better principles. This earlier research was generally done with naive students rather than experts, however, and as we have seen, more (time, thought, attention) is better doesn’t apply to expertly mastered skills. In such cases, thinking too much about the processes involved can slow down and disrupt performance (just think about how you tie your shoes). These processes run best outside of conscious awareness. Stop thinking when you are skilled—this lesson can be applied deliberately. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=543))

- Gut feelings are based on surprisingly little information. That makes them look untrustworthy in the eyes of our superego, which has internalized the credo that more is always better. Yet experiments demonstrate the amazing fact that less time and information can improve decisions. Less is more means there is some range of information, time, or alternatives where a smaller amount is better. It does not mean that less is necessarily more over the total range. For instance, if one does not recognize any alternative, the recognition heuristic cannot be used. The same holds for choices between alternatives. If more people buy jam when there are six as opposed to twenty-four varieties, that does not imply that even more will buy when there are only one or two alternatives. Typically, there is some intermediate level where things work best. Less is more contradicts two core beliefs held in our culture: More information is always better. More choice is always better.

- These beliefs exist in various forms and seem so self-evident that they are rarely stated explicitly.22 Economists make an exception when information is not free: more information is always better unless the costs of acquiring further information surpass the expected gains. My point, however, is stronger. Even when information is free, situations exist where more information is detrimental. More memory is not always better. More time is not always better. More insider knowledge may help to explain yesterday’s market by hindsight, but not to predict the market of tomorrow. Less is truly more under the following conditions: A beneficial degree of ignorance. As illustrated by the recognition heuristic, the gut feeling can outperform a considerable amount of knowledge and information. Unconscious motor skills. The gut feelings of trained experts are based on unconscious skills whose execution can be impeded by overdeliberation.

Without cognitive limitations, we would not function as intelligently as we do. The freedom-of-choice paradox. The more options one has, the more possibilities for experiencing conflict arise, and the more difficult it becomes to compare the options.

- Note that the first five items are genuine cases of less is more. Even if the layperson gained more information or the expert more time, or our memory retained all sensory information, or the company produced more varieties, all at no extra cost, they would still be worse off across the board. The last case is a trade-off in which it is the costs of further search that make less information the better choice. The little boy was hurt by the continuing diagnostic procedures, that is, by the physical and mental costs of search, not by the resulting information. Good intuitions ignore information.

- The region in which the face disappears corresponds to the “blind spot” in the retina of the human eye. The eye acts like a camera, with a lens that directs light rays so that a picture of the world is created on the retina. The sheet of photoreceptors on the retina is much like a sheet of film at the back of the camera. But unlike film, there is a hole in it, through which the optical nerves exit the retina to transport the information to the brain. Because the hole has no photoreceptors, objects that would be processed in this region cannot be seen. When you look around with one eye closed, you might therefore expect to see a blank slate corresponding to this blind spot. In fact, you won’t notice a thing. Our brains “fill in” the blank slate with a good guess. In Figure 3-1 (top), the best guess is “white” because the surrounding field is white. That guess makes the sad face disappear.

The brain again makes its best guess based on the surrounding information: an elongated object crosses the blind spot from one side and continues on the other, thus it is likely that it exists in between.

These unconscious perceptual inferences are strong enough to act upon, but unlike other intuitive judgments, they are not flexible. They are triggered by external stimuli in an automatic way. An automatic process cannot be changed by insight or information external to the process. Even now, when we understand how the intuitive perception works, we cannot change what we see. We continue to see the concave dots suddenly pop out of the surface when we turn the book upside down. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=657))

- Why do non-autistic children have a clear intuition about what Charlie wants, whereas autistic children do not? The answer is that the non-autistic children automatically engage in “mind reading.” Mind readers can work with only minimal clues. They notice, but perhaps not consciously, that Charlie’s eyes are pointed to the Milky Way, and so infer that this is the one he wants. However—and this is crucial—when asked what Charlie is looking at, children ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=670))

- In non-autistic children, this mind-reading heuristic is effortless and automatic. It is part of their folk psychology. The ability to infer intentions from a gaze seems to be localized in the superior temporal sulcus of our brain.6 In children with autism this instinct appears to be impaired. They don’t seem to understand how the minds of others work. In the words of Temple Grandin, an autistic woman who holds a PhD in animal science, much of the time she feels “like an anthropologist on Mars.” ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=676))

- have them, but we are prepared to act on them. Rules of thumb are responsible for producing gut feelings. For instance, the mind-reading heuristic tells us what others desire, the recognition heuristic produces a feeling of which product to trust, and the gaze heuristic generates an intuition of where to run. Evolved capacities are the construction material for rules of thumb. For example, the gaze heuristic takes advantage of the ability to track objects. It is easy for humans—in contrast to robots—to track a moving object against a busy background; at three months old, babies have already begun to hold their gaze on moving targets.8 Thus, the gaze heuristic is simple for humans but not for present-day robots. Environmental structures are the key to how well or poorly a rule of thumb works. For instance, the recognition heuristic takes advantage of situations where name recognition ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=696))

- Automatic rules, such as inferring depth from shade, and flexible rules, such as the recognition and gaze heuristics, all work according to this scheme. Yet there is an important difference.

If one doesn’t work, there are others to choose from. The phrase “intelligence of the unconscious” refers to this quick process of evaluation. Brain imaging indicates that it might be associated with the anterior frontomedian cortex (see chapter 7). Gut feelings may appear simplistic, but their underlying intelligence lies in selecting the right rule of thumb for the right situation.

- Brunswik once compared the mind and the environment to a married couple who have to come to terms with one another. I will use his analogy to sketch out the difference between mental (internal) and adaptive explanations. To generalize, let me distinguish between two ways a husband and wife can interact: to be kind and try to make each other happy, or to be nasty and try to hurt each other. Consider two couples, the Concords and the Frictions, who are in many respects similar. Yet the Concords are kind, warm, caring, and get along very well, while the Frictions fight, yell, insult each other, and are on the verge of splitting up. How can we explain the difference? According to a widespread account, every person has a set of beliefs and desires, and these are the causes of behavior. For instance, ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=721))

- Mr. and Ms. Friction might have sadomasochistic impulses and derive pleasure from hurting each other, and they simply maximize that pleasure. Alternatively, the couple might not have such desires but might instead have failed to calculate how they should behave. The first is the rational account and the second the irrational one, both assuming that people rely on mental calculations equivalent to Franklin’s balance sheet. A third account is in terms of personality traits and attitudes, such as an overly aggressive temperament, or a dismissive attitude toward the other sex. Note that each of these explanations seeks the cause of a person’s behavior in the individual mind. Personality theories investigate traits, attitude theories study attitudes, and cognitive theories focus on probabilities and utilities, or beliefs and desires. The tendency to explain behavior internally without analyzing the environment is known as the “fundamental attribution error.” Social psychologists have studied this tendency in the general public, but the same error creeps into social scientists’ explanations as well.

As a student, I was fond of personality and attitude research but learned the hard way that it rarely predicts behavior well, and for good reason. The idea of fixed traits and preferences overlooks the adaptive nature of Homo sapiens. For the same reason, knowing the human genome does not mean understanding human behavior; the social environment also has a direct influence, possibly even on DNA’s production of growth hormones.10 As Brunswik observed, to understand the wife’s behavior, one needs to find out what her husband is doing, and vice versa. Adaptive theories focus on the relation between the mind and the environment, rather than on the mind alone.11 Would that suggest a different story for… ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=735))

Ms. and Mr. Concord are kind to each other on the first occasion. The next time, she imitates his cooperative behavior, he imitates hers, and so on. The result can be a long harmonious relationship. The phrase “keep a memory of size one” means that only the last behavior (kind or nasty) is imitated and needs to be remembered.

- American political scientist Robert Axelrod had fifteen strategies compete with each other, and the winnings were totaled up for all games. The winning strategy was tit for tat, despite its simplicity.12 In fact, the most complex strategy was the least successful. Axelrod then worked out that if someone had submitted tit for two tats to his tournament, it would have been the winner instead. It is good at avoiding rounds of mutual recrimination, as happened with the Frictions. Does this mean that tit for two tats is generally better than tit for tat? No. Just as in real life, there is no single best strategy—it depends on the games the other players play. When Axelrod announced a second tournament, the eminent evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith submitted tit for two tats. But the saintly heuristic did not win.

- Consider the gaze heuristic again. It has three building blocks: (1) Fix your gaze on the ball, (2) start running, and (3) adjust your running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant. Each of these building blocks is anchored in evolved capacities. The first makes use of the human capacity to track objects, the second the capacity to maintain balance while running, and the third the capacity for fine-tuned vision-motor adjustments. These allow an original solution to the problem of catching a ball that is entirely different from estimating its trajectory.

- In contrast to other primates, we humans not only give and share outside our families or when sharing proves costly, but we can get angry if someone does not. Consider the ultimatum game, which was invented by the economist Werner Güth, one of my colleagues at the Max Planck Society. In the game’s classic version, two people who have never met before and never will are seated in different rooms. They cannot see or hear each other. A coin is flipped that assigns to them the role of the Proposer or the Responder. Both are told the rules of the game: The Proposer receives $10 (in ten single bills) and offers any part of this to the Responder, that is, any amount from $0 to $10. The Responder then decides whether to accept the amount. If the Responder accepts, both players keep what they have; if ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=967))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the Responder rejects, both players receive nothing. If you were the Proposer, how much would you offer? According to the logic of self-interest, both players will aim at maximizing their gain. Since the Proposer moves first, he should offer the Responder a single dollar bill and not more, because that maximizes the Proposer’s gain. The Responder should subsequently accept the offer, because one dollar is obviously more than none. This logical norm is called a Nash equilibrium, after the Nobel laureate John Nash. But neither Proposer nor Responder tends to respond this way. The most frequent offer is not $1, but $5 or $4. Thus, people seem to be concerned with equity, sharing roughly the same amount—here we meet the 1/N rule in a different context. Even more surprising to the logic of self-interest, about half of those who were offered only one or two dollars rejected the money and preferred to take home nothing. They were annoyed and angry for being treated unfairly. One might object that a few dollars are just peanuts, and that people would turn selfish as ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=973))

Yet when the game was played in other cultures with amounts that corresponded to the earnings of a week or even a month, little changed.13 If the Proposer was a computer, humans were less likely to reject a small offer. Yet could the Proposer’s concern for the other’s welfare simply be calculated selfishness, that is, not wanting to take the risk of being rejected? Would people still give away money if the Responder could not reject? This version of the ultimatum game is called the dictator game, in which the Proposer simply dictates whether or not to give money and how much. Yet even when the other party has no possibility to reject, a substantial number of people give away some of their money. University students in the United States, Europe, and Japan playing the dictator game typically keep 80 percent and give 20 percent, whereas adults… ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=981))

Yet women’s intuitive judgments were not better than men’s; they identified the real smile correctly in 71 percent of cases, whereas men did so in 72 percent. Interestingly, men could better judge women’s genuine smiles than those of other men, whereas women were less adept at judging the sincerity of the opposite sex.

But sometimes they turn right, though this is the worse option, puzzling many a researcher.

- The interplay between mind and environment can be expressed in a powerful analogy coined by Herbert Simon. In the epigraph to this chapter, mind and environment are compared to the blades of a pair of scissors. Just as one cannot understand how scissors cut by looking only at one blade, one will not understand human behavior by studying either cognition or the environment alone. This may seem to be common sense, yet much of psychology has gone a mentalist way, attempting to explain human behavior by attitudes, preferences, logic, or brain imaging and ignoring the structure of the environments in which people live. Let us have a closer look at one important structure of the environmental blade: its uncertainty, that is, the degree to which surprising, novel, and unexpected things continue to happen.

- How do we know whether or not an optimal solution can be found for a game, or another well-defined problem? A problem is called “intractable” if the only known way of finding the perfect solution requires checking a number of steps that increase exponentially with the size of the problem. Chess is computationally intractable, as are the classic computer games Tetris, where one has to arrange a sequence of falling blocks, and Minesweeper.12 These games illustrate that even when problems are well defined, the perfect solution is often out of reach. A famous example from astronomy is the three-body problem.

No general solution for this problem (or with four or more bodies) is known, whereas the two-body problem can be solved. With earthly bodies, even two defy a solution. There is no way to perfectly predict the dynamics of their mutual attraction, particularly if the attraction is emotional. In these situations, good rules of thumb become indispensable.

I call such logical norms content-blind because they ignore the content and the goals of thinking. Rigid logical norms overlook that intelligence has to operate in an uncertain world, not in the artificial certainty of a logical system, and needs to go beyond the information given. One major source of uncertainty in the Linda problem is the meaning of the terms probable and and. Each of these terms has several meanings, as any good English dictionary or its equivalent in other languages will reveal. Consider the meanings of probable.

In fact, patients accept the treatment more often if doctors choose a positive frame.6 Kahneman and Tversky, however, interpret attention to framing to mean that people are incapable of retranslating the two versions of the doctors’ answer into a common abstract form and are convinced that “in their stubborn appeal, framing effects resemble perceptual illusions more… ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1389))

- Not being able to recall a name occurs more often the older one gets, particularly if one has a Y chromosome. Yet if the husband no longer recognized his wife’s name or her face, his gaffe would be in a different ballpark. He would be considered a clinical case and possibly end up in a neurological institution. Recognition memory is more reliable than recall memory both at the beginning and at the end of our lives and is also more fundamental; it is difficult, for instance, to recall individual information about a person whom one does not recognize.1 Recognition memory is an evolved capacity that the recognition heuristic makes use of. We have already had a glimpse at recognition; let us take a closer look at it now. No single rule of thumb can guide someone through an entire life. But the following story of a guy named Reese explores how mere recognition profoundly shapes our intuitions and emotions in everyday life.

- Recognition is the ability to tell the novel from the previously experienced, or the old from the new. Recognition and recall carve out our world into three states of memory. When visitors enter my office, they will be one of three kinds: those whose faces I do not recognize, those whom I recognize but don’t recall anything else about (this is called tartling in Scotland), and those whom I both recognize and recall something about. Note that recognition memory is not perfect; I may have a wrong feeling of déjà vu, or not remember that I have already encountered a person. However, such errors need not be dysfunctional, because, as we will see shortly, forgetting can actually benefit the recognition heuristic.

- In contrast, humans have an extraordinarily large capacity for recognizing faces, voices, and pictures. As we wander through a stream of sights, sounds, tastes, odors, and tactile impressions, some novel and some previously experienced, we have little trouble telling the two apart. In a remarkable experiment, participants were shown 10,000 pictures for five seconds each. Two days later, they correctly identified 8,300 of them.3 No computer program to date can perform face recognition as well as a human child can. Why is this? As mentioned in chapter 4, humans are among the few species whose unrelated members exchange favors, such as trading goods, engaging in social contracts, or forming organizations. If we were not able to recognize faces, voices, or names, we would not be able to tell whom we’d encountered previously, and as a consequence, not recall who treated us fairly and who cheated. Hence, social contracts of reciprocity—“I share my food with you today, and you return the favor tomorrow”—could not be reinforced. Recognition memory often remains when other types of memory, such as recall, become impaired. Elderly people suffering memory loss and patients suffering certain kinds of brain damage have problems saying what they know about an object or where they have encountered it. But they often know (or can act in a way that proves) that they have encountered the object before. Such was the case with R., a fifty-four-year-old policeman who developed such severe amnesia that he had difficulty identifying people he knew, even his wife and mother.

Yet in a test in which he was shown pairs of photographs consisting of one famous and one unfamous person, he could point to the famous persons as accurately as healthy people could.4 It was his ability to recall anything about the persons he recognized that was impaired. Because recognition continues to operate even when everything else breaks down, I view it as a primordial psychological mechanism. As the $1 million question in chapter 1 illustrates, the purpose of the recognition heuristic is not to recognize objects, but to make inferences about something else.

All players were ranked according to the number of ordinary people who recognized their names, and the prediction was made that the one with higher name recognition would win. I refer to this ranking as collective recognition. Would you bet money on the combined ignorance of people who had not even heard of half of the Wimbledon contestants?

- Instead, I had been like a sleepwalker who had failed to understand the creative hunches of the intuitive mind. Discovery arose by serendipity: failing to do one thing and yet achieving another, more interesting one. But how exactly does the less-is-more effect arise? Consider three American brothers who apply to a new school in Idaho. The principal tests each of them on their general knowledge, starting with geography. He names two European countries, Spain and Portugal, and asks which one has more inhabitants. The youngest brother goes first. He has not even heard of Europe, let alone the countries, and just guesses. The principal tests him on other pairs of countries, but the little brother performs at chance level and fails. Now it’s the second brother’s turn. Unlike his little brother, he occasionally watches TV news and has heard of half of the European countries. Even though he thinks he is guessing because he knows nothing specific about the countries he recognizes, he gets two-thirds of the questions correct and passes. Finally, the oldest brother is tested. He has heard of the names of all the countries, although he also knows nothing specific beyond their names. Surprisingly enough, he does worse than the second brother. How can that happen? The youngest brother who has heard of none of the countries cannot use the recognition heuristic and performs at chance level (Figure 7-3). The oldest brother who has heard of all the countries cannot use it either and also performs at chance level (50 percent).

- middle brother who has heard of some but not all of the countries can use the recognition heuristic; since he has heard of half of them, he can use the heuristic most often and does best. He scores 65 percent correct. Why? The recognition validity is 80 percent, a typical value. Half of the time the middle brother has to guess and half of the time he can use the heuristic. Guessing results in 25 percent correct (half of the half ) and using the heuristic results in 40 percent correct (80 percent of the other half ). Together, that makes 65 percent—much better than chance, even though he knows nothing about population sizes. The line in the figure that connects the three brothers shows how they would have performed at intermediate levels of name recognition. On the right side of this curve, a less-is-more effect is visible: the brother who recognizes all the countries performs less well.

This means that someone knows enough to get 80 percent of the questions right when she recognizes both countries and 80 percent when she recognizes only one.10 Here, less is no longer more.

First, it can occur between two groups of people, when a more knowledgeable group makes worse inferences than a less knowledgeable group—take the performance of the American and German students on the question of whether Detroit or Milwaukee is larger (chapter 1). Second, a less-is-more effect can occur ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1685))

- between domains, that is, when the same group of people achieve higher accuracy in a domain in which they know little than in a domain in which they know a lot. For instance, when American students were tested on the largest American cities (such as New York versus Chicago) and on the largest German cities (such as Cologne versus Frankfurt), they scored a median 71 percent correct on their own cities but slightly higher on the less familiar German ones, with 73 percent correct.11 This effect was obtained even though many Americans already knew the three largest U.S. cities in order and did not have to make any inferences. Third, a less-is-more effect can occur during knowledge acquisition, that is, when an individual’s performance first increases but then decreases again. All these are expressions of the same general principle, which help to understand why tennis amateurs were able to make better predictions than the official rankings of the ATP and Wimbledon experts.

The notorious Benetton campaign, for instance, only presented their brand name together with shocking images such as a corpse in a pool of blood or a dying AIDS patient. Why do firms invest in this type of advertisement? The answer is to increase brand-name recognition, important because of consumers’ reliance on the recognition heuristic. Oliviero Toscani, the designer and man behind the Benetton campaign, pointed out that the ads had pushed Benetton beyond Chanel into the top-five best-known brand names across the world, and that Benetton’s sales increased by a factor of ten.15 If people did not rely on brand-name recognition in consumer choice, noninformative advertisement would be ineffective and so obsolete.

- Yet blind taste tests have repeatedly shown that consumers were unable to detect their own preferred brand. Some three hundred randomly selected American beer drinkers (who drank beer at least three times a week) were given five national and regional brands of beer.17 The beer drinkers assigned “their” brands superior ratings over all competitors, as long as the label was on the bottle. When the label was taken off, and the test was “blind,” none of the groups favoring a certain brand rated it as superior! If consumers can only tell the difference between competing brands by name, then there is little economic justification for the idea that more choice is always better. Firms that spend their money on buying space in your recognition memory already know this. Similarly, politicians advertising their names and faces rather than their programs, and colleges, wannabe celebrities, and even small nations operate on the principle that if we do not recognize them, we will not favor them. Taken to the extreme, being recognized becomes the goal in itself. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1761))

- An effective use of the recognition heuristic depends on two processes, recognition and evaluation. The first asks, “Do I recognize this alternative?” and determines whether the heuristic can be applied. The second asks, “Should I rely on recognition?” and evaluates whether it should be applied to the situation at hand. For instance, most of us are hesitant to gather and eat unfamiliar mushrooms that we find while hiking in the woods. Yet when we find the same mushrooms on our plate in a good restaurant, we will probably not even think twice about gobbling them down. In the woods, we follow the recognition heuristic: if it’s unknown, it might be poisonous.

The evaluation process is absent in automatic (reflex-like) rules of thumb. The recognition heuristic, by contrast, is flexible and can be consciously suppressed. How the evaluation process works is not yet known, but we have some clues. One aspect of this process seems to be whether reliable knowledge about what one wants to know can be retrieved.

- economist and statesman Turgot was a reformer. As the story goes, he wanted to introduce potatoes to France, but peasants resisted the unknown food, until he came up with a trick. He ruled that only experimental state-run farms would be allowed to plant potatoes. Soon the peasants protested, clamoring for the privilege to grow them. Here, novelty aversion was trumped by a competitive social motive: “If another has it, I want it, too.” Thus, the impulse to prefer what one recognizes can be overridden in various ways. A conductor like Rattle can ignore name recognition, although not consistently, and a politician like Turgot overcame it by putting the aversion to novelty in conflict with envy. Nonetheless, much of the time the gut feeling to “go with what you know” is a helpful guide in life. An effective use depends on two processes, recognition and evaluation.

- Who would ever base an important decision on only one reason? If anything unites the various tribes of rationality, it is the dictum that one should search for all relevant information, weigh it, and add it up to reach a final judgment. Yet, defying the official guidelines, people often base their intuitive judgments on what I call one-reason decision making.1 Keenly aware of this tendency, so do many ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1829))

- advertising campaigns. What did McDonald’s do when Burger King and Wendy’s began to rival its top-ranked name recognition? It launched a campaign that provided the one reason to choose McDonald’s: “It’s an easy way to feel like a good parent.” As an internal memo explained the underlying psychology, parents want their kids to love them, and taking their children to McDonald’s seems to accomplish this, making them feel like good parents.2 Wouldn’t a few more reasons make a more convincing case? There is a proverb that a man with too many good excuses shouldn’t be trusted. In this chapter, I will deal with intuitive judgments that are based on recall memory. Recall goes beyond mere recognition; it retrieves episodes, facts, or reasons from memory. I use the term reasons to refer to cues or signals that help make decisions. Let’s first take a look at how evolution creates minds and social environments in which the use of one good reason spreads.

- Darwin considered two mechanisms underlying dazzling male features. The first was male-male competition, which had led to developments such as deer antlers and antelope horns. But battles between males could not account for the train of the peacock, so Darwin proposed a second mechanism, the power of female choice. He believed that females have a sense of beauty and are excited by the extravagant ornaments displayed by males. Darwin’s theory of sexual selection was almost completely ignored for nearly a hundred years.4 His male contemporaries could not be convinced by the idea that birds or deer would have a sense of beauty, and even less, ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1854))

Men close to Darwin, such as Thomas Henry Huxley, known as Darwin’s bulldog, tried to persuade him to abandon the theory of sexual selection.5 Today, this theory is a vigorously pursued branch of biology, and one might speculate whether its acceptance has been facilitated by the rising public role of women in Western societies. Yet we are only beginning to understand the connection between sexual selection and one-reason decision making. Just as the theory of sexual selection was rejected for a long time in biology, so the theory that one good reason is a viable strategy is still controversial in decision theory. But there is hope, as science itself is evolving. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1859))

It is so emotionally overwhelming that it can also structure what is politically acceptable in our everyday lives.

- In the United Kingdom, parents of children under thirteen were asked this and similar questions.17 The pairs of consultations described were variations of four reasons that earlier studies had identified to be of primary concern for British parents: where their child was seen, by whom, the time taken between call and treatment (waiting time), and whether the doctor listened to them. Many seemed to carefully weigh each of the four reasons and combine them into their decision. However, almost every second parent had one dominant reason that made their decision. For the largest group, over a thousand parents, it was whether or not the doctor listened to what they were saying—even if it meant ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=1988))

- waiting forty minutes longer. These parents were more likely to be female, well educated, and have more children. For about 350 parents, the dominant reason was waiting time. Fifty parents needed to see a physician they knew, whether or not the doctor listened and no matter how long the waiting time would be. The fourth reason—whether the child was seen at home or in an emergency center—by contrast, was not a dominant reason for any of the parents. How can we understand these parents’ intuitions? Assume that the order of importance is from top to bottom: the doctor’s tendency to listen, waiting time, familiarity, and location.

- But how accurate are intuitions based on only one reason? As mentioned above, according to traditional theories of rationality, these intuitions are doomed to failure. One should never ignore reasons, but combine number of games won and halftime score. In this view, hunches that rely on Take the Best commit one of two “sins.” If, as in the first example, an intuitive judgment relies solely on the base rate information (the number of games won) and ignores the halftime score, it commits what has been called conservatism. Conservatism means that only the old information is taken into consideration and the new information, the halftime result, is ignored.

- If, as in the second example, intuition is instead based on the halftime score only, this “sin” has been labeled the base-rate fallacy.20 These alleged sins are presented in virtually every psychology textbook as verdicts against intuition: people may use simple rules as a shortcut, but it’s naive to do so. Yet, as I discussed earlier, Take the Best can predict school dropout rates faster and more accurately than a complex version of Franklin’s rule does. The NBA study provided another test of Take the Best, this time against Bayes’s rule, the Goliath of rational strategies.21 Bayes’s rule does not waste information. It always uses base rates and halftime score, as well as the actual difference in scores at halftime, whereas Take the Best either ignores halftime or simply considers who is ahead in a match. The question is, if people followed the rational Bayes’s rule, how much more accurate would they be in predicting the outcomes of all 1,187 NBA games than if their intuitions followed the simple Take the Best heuristic? The test showed by way of computer simulation that if people used Bayes’s rule, they would be able to predict 78 percent of the winners ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2079))

- correctly. Take the Best, in spite of committing alleged sins against rationality, predicted exactly the same percentage of winners, yet more quickly and with less information and computation. Something must be wrong, it seems, with this result. Yet it held in soccer as well. A student of mine replicated the result with soccer matches in the German major league, the Bundesliga, for the seasons 1998–2000. Take the Best used the same order of reasons. For both seasons, it predicted the outcomes of more than four hundred games as well as or better than Bayes’s rule did.22 The advantage of the simple rule was most pronounced when the base rates (the games won) were two years old rather than from the previous season, that is, when the problem was most difficult. In each case, Take the Best embodied the intuition that if one team had been considerably more successful than its opponent in a previous season, it would likely win again; otherwise, the team that led at halftime would win. The complex calculations could not beat this intuition. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2089))

Lawyers seem to be regarded by doctors as especially litigious patients who should be treated with caution when it comes to risky procedures such as surgery. The rate of hysterectomy in the general population in Switzerland was 16 percent, whereas among lawyers’ wives it was only 8 percent—among female doctors it was 10 percent.12 In general, the less well educated a woman is and the better private insurance she has, the more likely it is that she’ll get a hysterectomy. Similarly, children in the general population had significantly more tonsillectomies than the children of physicians and lawyers.

- DOCTORS’ DILEMMA Patients tend to trust their doctors, but they do not always consider the situation in which the doctors find themselves. Most physicians try to do their best in a world in which time and knowledge are severely limited. In the United States, the average time patients have to describe their complaints before they are interrupted by their physicians is twenty-two seconds. The total time the physician spends with a patient is five minutes—“how are you” and other formal niceties included. That is markedly different in countries such as Switzerland and Belgium that have an “open market” in which patients have access to more than one general practitioner or specialist. In this competitive situation the doctor invests time in his patients to encourage them to return. Here the average duration of a visit is fifteen minutes.13 Continuing education is indispensable in the rapidly changing world of medicine. Yet most physicians have neither the time to read even a few of the thousands of articles published every month in medical journals nor the methodological skills to evaluate the claims in these articles. Rather, continuing education mostly happens in seminars sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, usually at a nice vacation spot, with spouses’ and other expenses included.

The assertions in 175 different leaflets distributed to German physicians could be verified in only 8 percent of the cases.14 In the remaining 92 percent of cases, statements in the original study were falsely reported, severe side effects of medication were not revealed, the period during which medication could safely be taken was exaggerated, or—should doctors have wanted to check the original studies—the cited source was not provided or was impossible to find. As a consequence, many physicians have only a tenuous connection with the latest medical research. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2304))

- You might think that even if a patient doesn’t have a heart attack, it was better to be safe than sorry. But being in the ICU carries its own risks. Some twenty thousand Americans die every year from a hospital-transmitted infection, and many more contract one. Such infections are particularly prevalent in the intensive care unit, making it one of the most dangerous places in the hospital—a dear friend of mine died in the ICU from a disease he’d picked up there. Yet when putting patients into this extremely dangerous situation, doctors protect themselves from being sued. A team of medical researchers from the University of Michigan was called in to improve conditions. When they checked the quality of physicians’ decisions—and quality control is not yet always the rule in hospitals—they found a disturbing result. Not only did doctors send most patients into the unit; they sent those who should have been there (who had a heart attack) as often as those who should not have been there (who did not have a heart attack). Doctors’ decisions were no better than chance, but nobody seemed to notice. As a second study revealed, the long-term-risk factors doctors were looking for were not the most relevant ones for discriminating between patients with and without acute ischemic heart disease. Specifically, the physicians looked for a history of hypertension and diabetes, “pseudo-diagnostic” cues, instead of the nature and location of patients’ symptoms and certain clues in the electrocardiogram, all of which are more powerful predictors of a heart attack.21 What to do? The team first tried to solve the complex problem with a complex strategy. They introduced the heart disease predictive instrument.22 It consists of a chart with some fifty probabilities and a long formula that enable the physician, with the help of a pocket calculator, to compute the probability that a patient should be admitted to the coronary care unit. The physicians were taught to find the right probabilities for each patient, type these into the calculator, press ENTER, and read off the resulting number. If it was higher than a given threshold, the patient was sent to the care unit. A quick glance at the chart makes it clear why the physicians were not happy using this and similar systems (Figure 9-1). They don’t understand them.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Nevertheless, after the physicians were first exposed to the system, their decisions improved markedly and overcrowding eased in the coronary care unit. So the team surmised that calculation, rather than intuition, worked in their cases. But they were well-trained researchers and tested their conclusion by taking the chart and the pocket computer away from the physicians. If calculation were the key, the quality of their decisions should fall back to the initial chance level. Yet the physicians’ performance did not drop. The researchers were surprised. Had the physicians ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2383))

- that they hadn’t, nor had they understood the formula in the pocket calculator. The researchers then returned the calculator and the chart to the physicians, withdrew them again, and so on. It made no difference. After the physicians’ first exposure to the chart, their intuitions improved permanently, even without further access to the calculating tools. Here is the puzzle: how could the physicians make the right calculations when they no longer had the key tools? It was at this point that I met Green, the principal investigator, and it was during my talk that he found the answer: the physicians did not need the chart and the calculator because they did not calculate. But what then improved their intuitions? All that seemed to matter were the right cues, which the physicians had memorized. They still worked with their intuitions, but now they knew what to look for, whereas earlier they had looked in the wrong places. This insight opened up a third alternative, beyond mere intuition… ([Location 2388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2388))

Interestingly, among those who do not follow the default, most opt in but few opt out—28 percent of Americans opted in and 0.1 percent of the French opted out. If people were guided by stable preferences rather than rules of thumb, the striking differences in Figure 10-1 should not exist. In this classical economic view, the default would have little effect because people would immediately override any default that challenges their preference.

- The psychologist Jon Haidt proposed five evolved capacities, each like a taste bud: a sensitivity to harm, reciprocity, hierarchy, ingroup, and purity.6 He suggests the mind is prepared to attach moral sentiments to all or several of these, depending on the culture in which it develops. Let me connect the taste buds with the three roots. In a society with an individualistic ethic, only the first two buds are activated: to protect people from harm, and to uphold individual rights by insisting on fairness and reciprocity. According to this ethic, the right to abortion or to free speech and the rejection of torture are moral issues. Western moral psychology has been imprinted with this focus on the individual, so that from its perspective, moral feelings are about personal autonomy. In a society with a family-oriented ethic, moral feelings concerning harm and reciprocity are rooted in the family, not in the individual. It is the welfare and honor of the family that needs ([Location 2575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2575))

- protection. When it leads to nepotism, this ethic may appear suspect from the individualist point of view. In many traditional societies, however, nepotism is a moral obligation, not a crime, and smaller dynasties exist in modern democracies as well, from India to the United States. Yet while individualist societies frown on nepotism, their behavior toward family members can be in turn resented by other societies. When I first visited Russia in 1980, I found myself in a heated discussion with students who were morally outraged that we Westerners dispose of our parents when they are old, delivering them to homes where they eventually die. They found our unwillingness to take care of our own parents repulsive. A family ethic also activates a sensitivity for hierarchy. It creates emotions of respect, duty, and obedience. In a society with a community orientation, concerns about harm, reciprocity, and hierarchy relate to the community as its root, rather than to the family or individual. Its ethical view activates all five sensitivities, including those for ingroup and purity. Most tribes, religious groups, or nations advocate virtues of patriotism, loyalty, and ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2582))

- heroism, and individuals from time immemorial have sacrificed their lives for their ingroup. In times of war, “support our troops” is the prevailing patriotic feeling, and criticizing them is seen as betrayal. Similarly, most communities have a code of purity, pollution, and divinity. People feel disgusted when this code is violated, be it in connection with eating dogs, sex with goats, or simply not taking a shower every day. Whereas in Western countries moral issues tend to center on personal freedom (such as the right to end one’s life), in other societies, moral behavior is more focused on the ethics of community, including duty, respect, and obedience to authority, and on the ethics of divinity, such as attaining purity and sanctity. Note that these are orientations rather than clear-cut categories. Each human society draws its moral feelings from the three roots, albeit with different emphases.

- mother” ensures respect of familial authority, and “You shall have no other gods besides me” necessitates obeying the laws of divinity in the community. Because moral feelings are anchored in different roots, conflicts will be the rule rather than the exception. In contrast to my view, moral psychology—like much of moral philosophy—links moral behavior with verbal reasoning and rationality. Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of cognitive development, for instance, assumes a logical progression of three levels of moral understanding (each subdivided into two stages). At the lowest level, young children define the meaning of what is right in terms of “I like it,” that is, a selfish evaluation of what brings rewards and avoids punishment. At the intermediate “conventional” level, older children and adults judge what is virtuous by whether “the group approves,” that is, by authority or one’s… ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2599))

- form of rational moral thought process which all persons could articulate.”7 The evidence for these stages comes from children’s answers to verbally presented moral dilemmas, rather than from observations of actual behavior. Kohlberg’s emphasis on verbalization contrasts with our first principle, lack of awareness. The ability to describe the grammatical rules of one’s native language would be a poor measure of one’s intuitive knowledge of the grammar. Similarly, children may have a much richer moral system than they can tell. Kohlberg’s emphasis on individual rights, justice, fairness, and the welfare of people also assumes the individual to be the root of moral thinking, rather than the community or family. However, years of experimental studies do not suggest that moral growth resembles strict stages. Recall that Kohlberg’s scheme has three levels, each divided in two stages; thus in… ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2607))

- My first principle of moral intuitions states that people are often unaware of the reasons for their moral actions. In these cases, deliberate reasoning is the justification for, rather than the cause of, moral decisions. Consider this story: Julie and Mark are sister and brother, traveling together in France on a summer vacation from college. One night in a cabin, they decide to make love, using both birth control pills and condoms, just to be sure. They both enjoyed making love but decided not to do it again. They kept that night a secret, which makes them feel even closer to each other. What do you think about that? Was it OK for them to make love? Most people who hear this story feel immediately that it was wrong for the siblings to make love.8 Only after being asked why they disapprove or even feel disgusted, however, do they begin to search for reasons. One might point out the danger of inbreeding, only to be reminded that Julie and Mark used two forms of birth control. Another begins to stutter, mumbles, and eventually exclaims, “I don’t know why, but I know it’s wrong!” Haidt called this state of mind “morally dumbfounded.” Many of us find incest between siblings, or even cousins, repulsive, although it did not seem to have bothered the royal families of ancient Egypt. Similarly, most of us would refuse to eat the brains of our parents when they die, whereas in other cultures not doing so, leaving them to be eaten by worms, would be an insult to the deceased. According to a long philosophical tradition, the absolute truth of ethical issues can be seen intuitively, without having to reason.9 I agree that moral intuitions often seem self-evident, but not that they are necessarily universal truths.

This rule has the potential to turn a soldier both into a loyal comrade and a killer. As an American rifleman recalls about comradeship during World War II: “The reason you storm the beaches is not patriotism or bravery. It’s that sense of not wanting to fail your buddies. There’s sort of a special sense of kinship.”12 What appears as inconsistent behavior—how can such a nice guy act so badly; how can that nasty person suddenly be so nice?—can result from the same underlying rule.

- reasons, but between feelings based on unconscious reasons and deliberate reasoning. The third principle is very practical, saying that when one knows both the mechanisms underlying moral behavior and the environments that trigger them, one can prevent or reduce moral disasters. Consider the case of organ donation. A legal system aware of the fact that rules of thumb guide behavior can make the desired option the default. In the United States, simply switching the default would save the lives of many patients who wait in vain for a donor. Setting proper defaults is a simple solution for what looks like a complex problem. Similarly, consider once again the men of the Reserve Police Battalion 101. These men grew up with the Judeo-Christian commandment “Don’t murder.” With his offer, Major Trapp brought this commandment into conflict with the rule “Don’t break ranks.” Yet Trapp could have framed… ([Location 2649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2649))

Since we can’t turn back the clock this is impossible to test, but both of these examples demonstrate that insight into moral intuition can influence moral behavior “from the outside.” To continue this thought experiment, imagine now the opposite: that the behavior of the reserve policemen was caused by traits such as authoritarianism, attitudes such as anti-Semitism and prejudices against minorities, or other evil motives. In these cases no such potential for immediate intervention would be possible. The social environment—Major Trapp and the other men—should make little difference, and a single policeman isolated from his comrades would have “decided” to kill, just as he did in the real situation when together with his comrades. Traits, in contrast to rules of thumb, give us little hope for change. Moral gut feelings are based on evolved capacities.

- One of the initial decisions the legal system makes is whether to release a defendant on bail unconditionally or punish him with curfew or imprisonment. In the English system, magistrates, most of whom are members of the local community without legal training, are often responsible for making this decision. In England and Wales, magistrates deal with some two million defendants every year. The work involves sitting in court for a morning or afternoon every one or two weeks, and making decisions in a bench of two or three. How should magistrates decide? The law says that they should pay regard to the nature and seriousness of the offense; to the character, community ties, and bail record of the defendant; as well as to the strength of the prosecution’s case, the likely sentence if convicted, and any other factor that appears to be relevant.13 Yet the law is silent on how magistrates should combine these pieces of information, and the legal system does not provide feedback on whether their decisions were in fact appropriate or not. The magistrates are left to their own intuitions. ([Location 2673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2673))

- How do magistrates actually make these millions of decisions? Magistrates tend to say, with confidence, that they thoroughly examine all the evidence in order to treat individuals fairly and without bias. For instance, one explained that the decision “depends on an enormous weight of balancing information, together with our experience and training.” The chairman of the council stated, “We are trained to question and to assess carefully the evidence we are given.”14 As one explained self-assuredly, “You can’t study magistrates’ complex decision making.” The truth is that one can; people tend to believe they solve complex problems with complex strategies even if they rely on simple ones. To find out what rationale actually underlies magistrates’ intuitive decisions, researchers observed several hundred hearings in two London courts over a four-month period.15 The average time a bench spent with each case was less than ten minutes. The information available to the London magistrates included the defendants’ age, race, gender, strength of community ties, seriousness of offense, kind of offense, number of offenses, relation to the victim, plea (guilty, ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2681))

- not guilty, no plea), previous convictions, bail record, the strength of the prosecution’s case, maximum penalty if convicted, circumstances of adjournment, length of adjournment, number of previous adjournments, prosecution request, defense request, previous court bail decisions, and police bail decision. In addition, they saw whether the defendant was present at the bail hearing, whether or not legally represented, and by whom. Not all of this information was present in every case, while additional information was provided in others. Recall that the magistrates explained—and no doubt also believed—that they carefully examine all the evidence. However, an analysis of the actual bail decisions in court A revealed a simple rule that had the structure of a fast and frugal tree (Figure 10-2, left). It predicted 92 percent of all decisions correctly. When the prosecution opposed bail or requested conditional bail, the… ([Location 2690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2690))

The rules of thumb in both London courts appear to violate due process. Each bench based their decision on only one reason, such as whether the police had imposed conditions or imprisonment. One could argue that the police, or prosecution, has already looked at all the evidence concerning the defendant, and therefore magistrates simply use a shortcut—although this argument would of course make magistrates dispensable. However, the reasons in the simple tree were related neither to the nature and seriousness of the offense nor to other pieces of information relevant for due process. Furthermore, magistrates actually asked for information concerning the… ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2698))

- This defensive decision making is known as “passing the buck.” The English bail system thus requests that magistrates follow due process, but it doesn’t provide the institutional setting to achieve this goal. The result is a gap between what magistrates do and what they believe they are doing. If magistrates were fully aware of what they are doing, they would come into conflict with the ideal of due process.

The experimenter asked her why she was laughing, and she blamed it on his funny tie. The picture only went to her right (nonverbal) side of the brain. Because the brain was split, the left (verbal side) had to do the explaining without any information. Split-brain patients confabulate fascinating post-hoc stories with the left sides of their brains to rationalize behavior initiated by the right side.

- French mathematician Blaise Pascal proposed maximizing as the answer to moral problems, such as whether or not one should believe in God.19 He argued that this decision should not be based on blind faith or blind atheism, but on considering the consequences of each action. If one believes in God, but he does not exist, one will forgo a few worldly pleasures. However, if one does not believe in God but he exists, eternal damnation and suffering will result. Therefore, Pascal argued, however small the probability that God exists, the known consequences dictate that believing in God is rational. What counts are the consequences of actions, not the actions themselves. This way of thinking also exists in a collective rather than an individual form, best known by the maxim: Seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number. The English legal and social reformer Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) proposed this guideline and supplied a calculus for actually determining the action that produces the greatest happiness.20 His hedonic calculus is the felicific equivalent of Franklin’s moral algebra, which we met in chapter 1. •  •  • The Hedonic Calculus The value of each pleasure or pain arises from six elements, its intensity, duration, degree of certainty, remoteness, fecundity (the… ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TO0T8U&location=2771))

Many people believe nothing would justify trading off these sacred values for money or other secular goods.
