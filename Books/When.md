- This is a book about timing. We all know that timing is everything. Trouble is, we don’t know much about timing itself. Our lives present a never-ending stream of “when” decisions—when to change careers, deliver bad news, schedule a class, end a marriage, go for a run, or get serious about a project or a person. But most of these decisions emanate from a steamy bog of intuition and guesswork. Timing, we believe, is an art. I will show that timing is really a science—an emerging body of multifaceted, multidisciplinary research that offers fresh insights into the human condition and useful guidance on working smarter and living better. Visit any bookstore or library, and you will see a shelf (or twelve) stacked with books about how to do various things—from win friends and influence people to speak Tagalog in a month. The output is so massive that these volumes require their own category: how-to. Think of this book as a new genre altogether—a when-to book.

- Positive affect—language revealing that tweeters felt active, engaged, and hopeful—generally rose in the morning, plummeted in the afternoon, and climbed back up again in the early evening. Whether a tweeter was North American or Asian, Muslim or atheist, black or white or brown, didn’t matter. “The temporal affective pattern is similarly shaped across disparate cultures and geographic locations,” they write. Nor did it matter whether people were tweeting on a Monday or a Thursday. Each weekday was basically the same. Weekend results differed slightly. Positive affect was generally a bit higher on Saturdays and Sundays—and the morning peak began about two hours later than on weekdays—but the overall shape stayed the same.2 ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=150))

- DRM research, for instance, has shown that during any given day people typically are least happy while commuting and most happy while canoodling. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=199))

- When the researchers crunched the numbers, they found a “consistent and strong bimodal pattern”—twin peaks—during the day. The women’s positive affect climbed in the morning hours until it reached an “optimal emotional point” around midday. Then their good mood quickly plummeted and stayed low throughout the afternoon only to rise again in the early evening.7 ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=205))

- So far I’ve described only what DRM researchers found about positive affect. The ups and downs of negative emotions—feeling frustrated, worried, or hassled—were not as pronounced, but they typically showed a reverse pattern, rising in the afternoon and sinking as the day drew to a close. But when the researchers combined the two emotions, the effect was especially stark. The following graph depicts what you might think of as “net good mood.” It takes the hourly ratings for happiness and subtracts the ratings for frustration.

- CEOs are human beings, of course, and therefore presumably subject to the same daily changes in mood as the rest of us. But CEOs are also a stalwart lot. They’re tough-minded and strategic. They know that millions of dollars ride on every syllable they utter in these calls, so they arrive at these encounters poised and prepared. Surely it couldn’t make any difference—to the CEO’s performance or the company’s fortunes—when these calls occur? Three American business school professors decided to find out. In a first-of-its-kind study, they analyzed more than 26,000 earnings calls from more than 2,100 public companies over six and a half years using linguistic algorithms similar to the ones employed in the Twitter study. They examined whether the time of day influenced the emotional tenor of these critical conversations—and, as a consequence, perhaps even the price of the company’s stock. Calls held first thing in the morning turned out to be reasonably upbeat and positive. But as the day progressed, the “tone grew more negative and less resolute.” Around lunchtime, mood rebounded slightly, probably because call participants recharged their mental and emotional batteries, the professors conjectured. But in the afternoon, negativity deepened again, with mood recovering only after the market’s closing bell. Moreover, this pattern held “even after controlling for factors such as industry norms, financial distress, growth opportunities, and the news that companies were reporting.”8 In other words, even when the researchers factored in economic news (a slowdown in China that hindered a company’s exports) or firm fundamentals (a company that reported abysmal quarterly earnings), afternoon calls “were more negative, irritable, and combative” than morning calls.9 Perhaps more important, especially for investors, the time of the call and the subsequent mood it engendered influenced companies’ stock prices. Shares declined in response to negative tone—again, even after adjusting for actual good news or bad news—“leading to temporary stock mispricing for firms hosting earnings calls later in the day.” While the share prices eventually righted themselves, these results are remarkable. As the researchers note, “call participants represent the near embodiment of the idealized homo economicus.” Both the analysts and the executives know the stakes. It’s not merely the people on the call who are listening. It’s the entire market. The wrong word, a clumsy answer, or an unconvincing response can send a stock’s price spiraling downward, imperiling the company’s prospects and the executives’ paychecks. These hardheaded businesspeople have every incentive to act rationally, and I’m sure they believe they do. But economic rationality is no match for a biological clock forged during a few million years of evolution. Even “sophisticated economic agents acting in real and highly incentivized settings are influenced by diurnal rhythms in the performance of their professional… ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=240))

- For this group of participants, mental keenness, as shown by rationally evaluating evidence, was greater early in the day. And mental squishiness, as evidenced by resorting to stereotypes, increased as the day wore on.14 Scientists began measuring the effect of time of day on brainpower more than a century ago, when pioneering German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted experiments showing that people learned and remembered strings of nonsense syllables more effectively in the morning than at night. Since then, researchers have continued that investigation for a range of mental pursuits—and they’ve drawn three key conclusions. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=293))

- First, our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the course of a day. During the sixteen or so hours we’re awake, they change—often in a regular, foreseeable manner. We are smarter, faster, dimmer, slower, more creative, and less creative in some parts of the day than others. Second, these daily fluctuations are more extreme than we realize. “[T]he performance change between the daily high point and the daily low point can be equivalent to the effect on performance of drinking the legal limit of alcohol,” according to Russell Foster, a neuroscientist and chronobiologist at the University of Oxford.15 Other research has shown that time-of-day effects can explain 20 percent of the variance in human performance on cognitive undertakings.16 Third, how we do depends on what we’re doing. “Perhaps the main conclusion to be drawn from studies on the effects of time of day on performance,” says British psychologist Simon Folkard, “is that the best time to perform a particular task depends on the nature of that task.” ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=298))

- Alertness and energy levels, which climb in the morning and reach their apex around noon, tend to plummet during the afternoons.18 And with that drop comes a corresponding fall in our ability to remain focused and constrain our inhibitions.

- When Harvard’s Francesca Gino and two Danish researchers looked at four years of test results for two million Danish schoolchildren and matched the scores to the time of day the students took the test, they found an interesting, if disturbing, correlation. Students scored higher in the mornings than in the afternoons. Indeed, for every hour later in the day the tests were administered, scores fell a little more. The effects of later-in-the-day testing were similar to having parents with slightly lower incomes or less education—or missing two weeks of a school year.19 Timing wasn’t everything. But it was a big thing. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=323))

    - Note: This is important and useful
- But before you go rearranging your own work schedules to cram all the important stuff before lunchtime, beware. All brainwork is not the same. To illustrate that, here’s another pop quiz. Ernesto is a dealer in antique coins. One day someone brings him a beautiful bronze coin. The coin has an emperor’s head on one side and the date 544 BC stamped on the other. Ernesto examines the coin—but instead of buying it, he calls the police. Why? This is what social scientists call an “insight problem.” Reasoning in a methodical, algorithmic way won’t yield a correct answer. With insight problems, people typically begin with that systematic, step-by-step approach. But they eventually hit a wall. Some throw up their hands and quit, convinced they can neither scale the wall nor bust through it. But others, stymied and frustrated, eventually experience what’s called a “flash of illuminance”—aha!—that helps them see the facts in a fresh light. They recategorize the problem and quickly discover the solution. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=334))

- (Still baffled by the coin puzzle? The answer will make you slap your head. The date on the coin is 544 BC, or 544 years before Christ. That designation couldn’t have been used then because Christ hadn’t been born—and, of course, nobody knew that he would be born half a millennium later. The coin is obviously a fraud.) Two American psychologists, Mareike Wieth and Rose Zacks, presented this and other insight problems to a group of people who said they did their best thinking in the morning. The researchers tested half the group between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and the other half between 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. These morning thinkers were more likely to figure out the coin problem . . . in the afternoon. “Participants who solved insight problems during their non-optimal time of day . . . were more successful than participants at their optimal time of day,” Wieth and Zacks found.21 What’s going on? The answer goes back to those sentries guarding our cognitive castle. For most of us, mornings are when those guards are on alert, ready to repel any invaders. Such vigilance—often called “inhibitory control”—helps our brains to solve analytic problems by keeping out distractions.22 But insight problems are different. They require less vigilance and fewer inhibitions. That “flash of illuminance” is more likely to occur when the guards are gone. At those looser moments, a few distractions can help us spot connections we might have missed ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=342))

- when our filters were tighter. For analytic problems, lack of inhibitory control is a bug. For insight problems, it’s a feature. Some have called this phenomenon the “inspiration paradox”—the idea that “innovation and creativity are greatest when we are not at our best, at least with respect to our circadian rhythms.”23 And just as the studies of school performance in Denmark and Los Angeles suggest that students would fare better taking analytic subjects such as math in the morning, Wieth and Zacks say their work “suggests that students designing… ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=354))

- In short, our moods and performance oscillate during the day. For most of us, mood follows a common pattern: a peak, a trough, and a rebound. And that helps shape a dual pattern of performance. In the mornings, during the peak, most of us excel at Linda problems—analytic work that requires sharpness, vigilance, and focus. Later in the day, during the recovery, most of us do better on coin problems—insight work that requires less inhibition and resolve. (Midday troughs are good for very little, as I’ll explain in the next chapter.) We are like mobile versions of de Mairan’s plant.

- LARKS, OWLS, AND THIRD BIRDS In the hours before dawn one day in 1879, Thomas Alva Edison sat in his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, pondering a problem. He had figured out the basic principles of an electric lightbulb, but he still hadn’t found a substance that worked as a low-cost, long-lasting filament. Alone in the lab (his more sensible colleagues were home asleep), he absentmindedly picked up a pinch of a sooty, carbon-based substance known as lampblack that had been left out for another experiment, and he began rolling it between his thumb and forefinger—the nineteenth-century equivalent of squeezing a stress ball or trying to one-hop paper clips into a bowl. Then Edison had—sorry to do this, folks—a lightbulb moment. The thin thread of carbon that was emerging from his mindless finger rolling might work as a filament. He tested it.

- enabled other night owls. “He was more likely to be found hard at it in his laboratory at midnight than at midday,” one early biographer wrote.25 Human beings don’t all experience a day in precisely the same way. Each of us has a “chronotype”—a personal pattern of circadian rhythms that influences our physiology and psychology. The Edisons among us are late chronotypes. They wake long after sunrise, detest mornings, and don’t begin peaking until late afternoon or early evening. Others of us are early chronotypes. They rise easily and feel energized during the day but wear out by evening. Some of us are owls; others of us are larks. You might have heard the larks and owls terminology before. It offers a convenient shorthand for describing chronotypes, two simple avian categories into which we can group the personalities and proclivities of our featherless species. But the reality of chronotypes, as is often the case with reality, is more nuanced. The first systematic effort to measure differences in humans’ internal clocks came in 1976 when two scientists, one Swedish, the other British, published a nineteen-question chronotype assessment. Several years later,… ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=377))

- “free days” (when we can awaken when we choose). People respond to questions and then receive a numerical score. For example, when I took the MCTQ, I landed in the most common category—a “slightly early type.” However, Roenneberg, the world’s best-known chronobiologist, has offered an even easier way to determine one’s chronotype. In fact, you can do it right now. Please think about your behavior during “free days”—days when you’re not required to awaken at a specific time. Now answer these three questions: What time do you usually go to sleep? What time do you usually wake up? What is the middle of those two times—that is, what is your midpoint of sleep? (For instance, if you typically fall asleep around 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 7:30 a.m., your midpoint is 3:30 a.m.) Now find your position on the… ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=388))

- have found that “[s]leep and wake times show a near-Gaussian (normal) distribution in a given population.”26 That is, if you plot people’s chronotypes on a graph, the result looks like a bell curve. The one difference, as you can see from the chart, is that extreme owls outnumber extreme larks; owls have, statistically if not physiologically, a longer tail. But most people are neither larks nor owls. According to research over several decades and across different continents, between about 60 percent and 80 percent of us are third birds.27 “It’s like feet,” Roenneberg says. “Some people are born with big feet and some with small feet, but most people are somewhere in the middle.”28 Chronotypes are like feet in another way, too. There’s not much we can do about their size or shape. Genetics explains at least half the variability in chronotype, suggesting that larks and owls are born, not made.29 In fact, the when of one’s birth plays a surprisingly powerful role. People born in the fall and winter are more likely to be larks; people born in the spring and summer are more likely to be owls.30 After genetics, the most important factor in one’s chronotype is age. As parents know and lament, young… ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=399))

They reach their peak owliness around age twenty, then slowly return to larkiness over the rest of their lives.31 The chronotypes of men and women also differ, especially in the first halves of their lives. Men tend toward eveningness, women toward morningness. However, those sex differences begin to disappear around the age of fifty.

But the essence is straightforward. Figure out your type, understand your task, and then select the appropriate time. Is your own hidden daily pattern peak-trough-rebound? Or is it rebound-trough-peak? Then look for synchrony. If you have even modest control over your schedule, try to nudge your most important work, which usually requires vigilance and clear thinking, into the peak and push your second-most important work, or tasks that benefit from disinhibition, into the rebound period. Whatever you do, do not let mundane tasks creep into your peak period. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=489))

- The Hospital of Doom may not be a real name. But it is a real place. Everything I’ve described is what happens in modern medical centers during the afternoons compared with the mornings. Most hospitals and health care professionals do heroic work. Medical calamities are the exceptions rather than the norm. But afternoons can be a dangerous time to be a patient. Something happens during the trough, which often emerges about seven hours after waking, that makes it far more perilous than any other time of the day. This chapter will examine why so many of us—from anesthesiologists to schoolchildren to the captain of the Lusitania—blunder in the afternoon. Then we’ll look at some solutions for the problem—in particular, two simple remedies that can keep patients safer, boost students’ test scores, and maybe even make the justice system fairer.

- the United Kingdom, sleep-related vehicle accidents peak twice during every twenty-four-hour period. One is between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., the middle of the night. The other is between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., the middle of the afternoon. Researchers have found the same pattern of traffic accidents in the United States, Israel, Finland, France, and other countries.8 One British survey got even more precise when it found that the typical worker reaches the most unproductive moment of the day at 2:55 p.m.9 When we enter this region of the day, we often lose our bearings. In chapter 1, I briefly discussed the “morning morality effect,” which found that people were more likely to be dishonest in the afternoon because most of us are “better able to resist opportunities to lie, cheat, steal and engage in other unethical behavior in the morning than in the afternoon.”10 This phenomenon depended in part on chronotype, with owls displaying a different pattern from larks or third birds. But in that study, evening types proved more ethical between midnight and 1:30 a.m., not during the afternoon. Regardless of our chronotype, the afternoon can impair our professional and ethical judgment. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=731))

- Nature breaks may replenish us the most.24 Being close to trees, plants, rivers, and streams is a powerful mental restorative, one whose potency most of us don’t appreciate.25 For example, people who take short walks outdoors return with better moods and greater replenishment than people who walk indoors. What’s more, while people predicted they’d be happier being outside, they underestimated how much happier.26 Taking a few minutes to be in nature is better than spending those minutes in a building. Looking out a window into nature is a better micro-break than looking at a wall or your cubicle. Even taking a break indoors amid plants is better than doing so in a green-free zone.

- and boosted mood in a way that multitasking breaks did not.27 Tech-free breaks also “increase vigor and reduce emotional exhaustion.”28 Or, as other researchers put it, “Psychological detachment from work, in addition to physical detachment, is crucial, as continuing to think about job demands during breaks may result in strain.”29 ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=846))

- So eat breakfast if you’d like. Or skip it if you’d prefer. But if you’re concerned about the perils of the afternoon, start taking more seriously the often-maligned and easily dismissed meal called lunch. (“Lunch is for wimps,” 1980s cinematic supervillain Gordon Gekko famously declared.) By one estimation, 62 percent of American office workers wolf down lunch in the same spot where they work all day. These dismal scenes—smartphone in one hand, soggy sandwich in the other, despair wafting from the cubicle—even have a name: the sad desk lunch. And that name has given rise to a small online movement in which people post photographs of their oh-so-pathetic midday meals.34 But it’s time we paid more attention to lunch, because social scientists are discovering that it’s far more important to our performance than we realize. For example, a 2016 study looked at more than eight hundred workers (mostly in information technology, education, and media) from eleven different organizations, some of whom regularly took lunch breaks away from their desks and some of whom did not. The non–desk ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=874))

- desk lunchers were better able to contend with workplace stress and showed less exhaustion and greater vigor not just during the remainder of the day but also a full one year later. “Lunch breaks,” the researchers say, “offer an important recovery setting to promote occupational health and well-being”—particularly for “employees in cognitively or emotionally demanding jobs.”35 For groups that require high levels of cooperation—say, firefighters—eating together also enhances team performance.36 Not just any lunch will do, however. The most powerful lunch breaks have two key ingredients—autonomy and detachment. Autonomy—exercising some control over what you do, how you do it, when you do it, and whom you do it with—is critical for high performance, especially on complex tasks. But it’s equally crucial when we take breaks from complex tasks. “The extent to which employees can determine how they utilize their lunch breaks may be just as important as what employees do during their lunch,” says one set of researchers.37 Detachment—both psychological and physical—is also critical. Staying focused on work during lunch, or even using one’s phone for social media, can intensify fatigue, according to multiple studies, but shifting one’s focus away from the office has the opposite effect. Longer lunch breaks and lunch breaks away from the office can be prophylactic against afternoon peril. Some of these researchers suggest that “organizations ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=883))

- could promote lunchtime recovery by giving options to spend lunch breaks in different ways that enable detachment, such as spending a break in a non-work environment or offering a space for relaxing activities.”38 Ever so slowly, organizations are responding. For instance, in Toronto, CBRE, the large commercial real estate firm, has banned desk lunches in the hope that employees will take a proper lunch break.39 Given this evidence, as well as the dangers of the trough, it’s becoming ever clearer that… ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=895))

- However, the returns from napping extend beyond vigilance. An afternoon nap expands the brain’s capacity to learn, according to a University of California–Berkeley study. Nappers easily outperformed non-nappers on their ability to retain information.43 In another experiment, nappers were twice as likely to solve a complex problem than people who hadn’t napped or who had spent the time in other activities.44 Napping boosts short-term memory as well as associative memory, the type of memory that allows us to match a face to a name.45 The overall benefits of napping to our brainpower are massive, especially the older we get.46 As one academic overview of the napping literature explains, “Even for individuals ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=914))

- who generally get the sleep they need on a nightly basis, napping may lead to considerable benefits in terms of mood, alertness and cognitive performance. . . [It] is particularly beneficial to performance on tasks, such as addition, logical reasoning, reaction time, and symbol recognition.”47 Napping even increases “flow,” that profoundly powerful source of engagement and creativity.48 Naps also improve our overall health. A large study in Greece, which followed more than 23,000 people over six years, found that, controlling for other risk factors, people who napped were as much as 37 percent less likely as others to die from heart disease, “an effect of the same order of magnitude as taking an aspirin or exercising every day.”49 Napping strengthens our immune system.50 And one British study found that simply anticipating a nap can reduce blood pressure.51 Yet, even after absorbing this evidence, I remained a nap skeptic. One reason I so disliked naps is that I woke up from them feeling as if someone had injected my bloodstream with oatmeal and replaced my brain with oily rags. Then I discovered something crucial: I was doing it wrong. While naps between thirty and ninety minutes can produce some long-term benefits, they come with steep costs. The ideal naps—those that combine effectiveness with efficiency—are far shorter, usually between ten and twenty minutes. For instance, an Australian study published in the journal Sleep found that five-minute naps did ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=922))

But once the nap lasted beyond about the twenty-minute mark, our body and brain began to pay a price.52 That price is known as “sleep inertia”—the confused, boggy feeling I typically had upon waking. Having to recover from sleep inertia—all that time spent splashing water on my face, shaking my upper body like a soaked golden retriever,… ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=936))

- healthy adults “should ideally nap for approximately 10 to 20 minutes.” Such brief naps “are ideal for workplace settings where performance immediately upon awakening is usually required.”54 But I also learned I was making another mistake. Not only was I taking the wrong kind of nap, I was also failing to use a potent (and legal) drug that can enhance a short nap’s benefits. To paraphrase T. S. Eliot, we should measure out our naps in coffee spoons. One study makes this case. The experimenters divided participants into three groups and gave them all a thirty-minute midafternoon break before sitting them at a driving simulator. One group received a placebo pill. The second received two hundred milligrams of caffeine. The third received that same two hundred milligrams of caffeine and then took a brief nap. When it came time to perform, the caffeine-only group outperformed the placebo group. But the group that ingested caffeine and then had a nap easily bested them both.55 Since caffeine takes about twenty-five minutes to enter the bloodstream, they were getting a secondary boost from the drug by the time their naps were ending. Other researchers have found the same results—that caffeine,… ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=945))

Today, escaping the midafternoon trough is a psychological imperative. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=969))

- Faced with problems as vexing as underperforming teenagers or flattened wages, we often search for solutions in the realm of what. What are people doing wrong? What can they do better? What can others do to help? But, more frequently than we realize, the most potent answers lurk in the realm of when. In particular, when we begin—the school day, a career—can play an outsize role in our personal and collective fortunes. For teenagers, beginning the school day before 8:30 a.m. can impair their health and hobble their grades, which, in turn, can limit their options and alter the trajectory of their lives. For somewhat older people, beginning a career in a weak economy can restrict opportunities and reduce earning power well into adulthood. Beginnings have a far greater impact than most of us understand. Beginnings, in fact, can matter to the end.

In most endeavors, we should be awake to the power of beginnings and aim to make a strong start. If that fails, we can try to make a fresh start. And if the beginning is beyond our control, we can enlist others to attempt a group start. These are the three principles of successful beginnings: Start right. Start again. Start together.

- As much as I prefer to believe that my swift path from jobless graduate to youthful working stiff was due to my sterling credentials and winning personality, the more plausible reason is one that won’t surprise you by now: timing. I graduated at an auspicious time. In 1986, the United States was surging out of a deep recession. The national unemployment rate that year was 7 percent—not an amazing figure but a huge drop from 1982 and 1983, when the jobless rate reached nearly 10 percent. This meant that it was simpler for me to find a job than for those who’d entered the job market just a few years earlier. It’s not that complicated: You don’t need a degree in economics to grasp that finding work is easier when the unemployment rate is 7 percent than when it’s 10 percent. However, you have to be a pretty good economist to understand that the advantage I gained from the pure luck of beginning my work life in a relative boom lasted well beyond my first job. Lisa Kahn is more than a pretty good economist. She made her mark in the economics world by studying people like me—white males who graduated from college in the 1980s. Kahn, who teaches at the Yale School of Management, harvested data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which each year asks a representative sample of American young people questions about their education, health, and employment. From the data, she selected white men who had graduated from college between 1979 and 1989—and examined what happened to them over the next twenty years.* Her big discovery: When these men began their careers strongly determined where they went and how far they traveled. Those who entered the job market in weak economies earned less at the beginning of their careers than those who started in strong economies—no big surprise. But this early disadvantage didn’t fade. It persisted for as long as twenty years. “Graduating from college in a bad economy has a long-run, negative impact on wages,” she writes. The unlucky graduates who’d begun their careers in a sluggish economy earned less straight out of school than the lucky ones like me who’d graduated in robust times—and it often took them two decades to catch up. On average, even after fifteen years of work, people who’d graduated in high unemployment years were still earning 2.5 percent less than those who’d graduated in low unemployment years. In some cases, the wage difference between graduating in an especially strong year versus an especially weak one was 20 percent—not just immediately after college but even when these men had reached their late thirties.27 The total cost, in inflation-adjusted terms, of graduating in a bad year rather than a good year averaged about $100,000. Timing wasn’t everything—but it was a six-figure thing. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=1290))

- Research on Stanford MBAs has found that the state of the stock market at the time of graduation shapes these graduates’ lifetime earnings. The chain of logic and circumstance here has three links. First, students are more likely to take jobs on Wall Street when they graduate in a bull market. By contrast, in bear markets, a sizable portion of graduates choose alternatives—consulting, entrepreneurship, or working for nonprofits. Second, people who work on Wall Street tend to remain working on Wall Street. Third, investment bankers and other financial professionals generally outearn those in other fields. As a result, “a person who graduates in a bull market” and goes into investment banking earns an additional $1.5 to $5 million more than “that same person would have earned if he or she had graduated during a bear market” and therefore had shied away from a Wall Street job.31 My sleep will remain undisturbed knowing that a swerving stock market steered some elite MBAs to jobs at McKinsey or Bain rather than at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley and thereby left them extremely rich rather than insanely wealthy. But the effects of beginnings on a large swath of the workforce is more troubling, especially since the early data on those who entered the job market during the 2007–2010 Great Recession look especially dim. Kahn and two Yale colleagues have found that the negative impact on students who graduated during 2010 and 2011 “was double what we would have expected given past patterns.”32 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, looking at these early indicators, warned that “those who begin their careers during such a weak labor market recovery may see permanent negative effects on their wages.”33 This is a tough problem. If what you earn today depends heavily on the unemployment rate when you started working rather than on the unemployment rate now, the previous two strategies in this chapter—starting right and starting again—are insufficient.34 We can’t solve the problem unilaterally, as with school starting times, and simply dictate that everyone will begin her career in a healthy economy. Nor can we solve it individually by exhorting people to recover from their slow start by looking for a new job on the day after their birthday. On this sort of problem, we must start together. And two previous smart solutions offer some guidance. ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=1330))

They recede rather than reverberate. They get lost, well, in the middle. Yet the science of timing is revealing that midpoints have powerful, though peculiar, effects on what we do and how we do it.

Second, use them to wake up rather than roll over—to utter an anxious “uh-oh” rather than a resigned “oh, no.” Third, at the midpoint, imagine that you’re behind—but only by a little.

Hull was a prominent American psychologist of the early twentieth century, one of the leading figures in behaviorism, which held that human beings behave not much differently from rats in a maze. In the early 1930s, Hull proposed what he called the “goal gradient hypothesis.”5 He built a long ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=1931))

- runway that he divided into equal sections. He placed food at every “finish line.” Then he sent rats down the runway and timed how fast they ran in each section. He found that “animals in traversing a maze will move at a progressively more rapid pace as the goal is approached.”6 In other words, the closer the rats got to the vittles, the faster they ran. Hull’s goal gradient hypothesis has held up far longer than most other behaviorist insights. At the beginning of a pursuit, we’re generally more motivated by how far we’ve progressed; at the end, we’re generally more energized by trying to close the small gap that remains.7 The motivating power of endings is one reason that deadlines are often, though not always, effective.

- The encoding power of endings shapes many of our opinions and subsequent decisions. For instance, several studies show that we often evaluate the quality of meals, movies, and vacations not by the full experience but by certain moments, especially the end.19 So when we share our evaluations with others—in conversations or in a TripAdvisor review—much of what we’re conveying is our reaction to the conclusion.

Indeed, they evaluated a life with twenty-nine years of treachery and six months of goodness the same as a life with twenty-nine years of goodness and six months of treachery. “[P]eople are willing to override a relatively long period of one kind of behavior with a relatively short period of another kind just because it occurred at the end of one’s life.”22 This “end of life bias,” as the researchers call it, suggests that we believe people’s true selves are revealed at the end—even if their death is unexpected and the bulk of their lives evinced a far different self. Endings help us encode—to register, rate, and recall experiences. But in so doing, they can distort our perceptions and obscure the bigger picture. Of the four ways that endings influence our behavior, encoding is the one that should make us most wary. ([Location 2013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2013))

- This makes intuitive sense. When we leave the workforce, we can lose connections and friends that once enriched our daily lives. When our kids depart home and enter their own act twos, we often see them less and miss them more. When we reach our sixties and seventies, our contemporaries begin dying, extinguishing lifelong relationships and leaving us with fewer peers. The data confirm what we’ve long suspected: Act three is full of pathos. Old age can be lonely and isolating. It’s a sad story. But it’s not a true story. Yes, older people have much smaller social networks than when they were younger. But the reason isn’t loneliness or isolation. The reason is both more surprising and ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2033))

- “I’ve got some good news and some bad news.” You’ve undoubtedly said that before. Whether you’re a parent, a teacher, a doctor, or a writer trying to explain a missed deadline, you had to deliver information—some of it positive, some of it not—and opened with this two-headed approach. But which piece of information should you introduce first? Should the good news precede the bad? Or should the happy follow the sad? As someone who finds himself delivering mixed news more often than he should or wants to, I’ve always led with the positive. My instinct has been to spread a downy duvet of good feeling to cushion the coming hammerblow. ([Location 2076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2076))

- My instinct, alas, has been dead wrong. To understand why, let’s switch perspectives—from me to you. Suppose you’re on the receiving end of my mixed news, and after my “I’ve got some good news and some bad news” windup, I append a question: “Which would you like to hear first?” Think about that for a moment. Chances are, you opted to hear the bad news first. Several studies over several decades have found that roughly four out of five people “prefer to begin with a loss or negative outcome and ultimately end with a gain or positive outcome, rather than the reverse.”28 Our preference, whether we’re a patient getting test results or a student awaiting a midsemester evaluation, is clear: bad news first, good news last.

- We blunder—I blunder—because we fail to understand the final principle of endings: Given a choice, human beings prefer endings that elevate. The science of timing has found—repeatedly—what seems to be an innate preference for happy endings.30 We favor sequences of events that rise rather than fall, that improve rather than deteriorate, that lift us up rather than bring us down. And simply knowing this inclination can help us understand our own behavior and improve our interactions with others.

- The researchers found that at the core of meaningful endings is one of the most complex emotions humans experience: poignancy, a mix of happiness and sadness. For graduates and everyone else, the most powerful endings deliver poignancy because poignancy delivers significance. One reason we overlook poignancy is that it operates by an upside-down form of emotional physics. Adding a small component of sadness to an otherwise happy moment elevates that moment rather than diminishes it. “Poignancy,” the researchers write, “seems to be particular to the experience of endings.” The best endings don’t leave us happy. Instead, they produce something richer—a rush of unexpected insight, a fleeting moment of transcendence, the possibility that by discarding what we wanted we’ve gotten what we need. • ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2131))

- Endings offer good news and bad news about our behavior and judgment. I’ll give you the bad news first, of course. Endings help us encode, but they can sometimes twist our memory and cloud our perception by overweighting final moments and neglecting the totality. But endings can also be a positive force. They can help energize us to reach a goal. They can help us edit the nonessential from our lives. And they can help us elevate—not through the simple pursuit of happiness but through the more complex power of poignancy. Closings, conclusions, and culminations reveal something essential about the human condition: In the end, we seek meaning.

- The breakthrough that most enabled us to do these things came in the late 1500s, when Galileo Galilei was a nineteen-year-old medical student at the University of Pisa. Inspired by a swinging chandelier, Galileo conducted a few makeshift experiments on pendulums. He discovered that what most affected a pendulum’s motion was the length of its string—and that for any given length of string a pendulum always took the same amount of time to make one full swing. That periodicity, he concluded, made pendulums ideal timekeepers. Galileo’s insight led to the invention of pendulum clocks a few decades later. And pendulum clocks, in turn, produced something ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2305))

- that we don’t realize is a relatively new concept: “the time.” Imagine life without even a rough consensus on what time it is. You’d find a way to manage. But it would be cumbersome and inefficient in ways we can scarcely fathom today. How would you know when to make a delivery, expect a bus, or take your kid to the dentist? Pendulum clocks, which were far more accurate than their predecessors, remade civilization by allowing people to synchronize their actions. Public clocks appeared in town squares and began establishing a single standard of time. Two o’clock for me became two o’clock for you. And this notion of public time—“the time”—greased the wheels of commerce and lubricated social interaction. Before long, local time standardization became regional, and regional standardization became national, giving rise to predictable schedules and the 5:16 p.m. train to Poughkeepsie.2 This ability to synchronize our actions with others, liberated by the cascade Galileo set off a few centuries ago, has been critical to human progress. Yet a consensus about what the clock says is only the first ingredient. Groups that depend on synchronization for success—choirs, rowing teams, and those Mumbai dabbawalas—abide by three principles of group timing. An external standard sets the pace. A sense of belonging helps individuals cohere. And synchronization both requires and heightens well-being. Put another way, groups must synchronize on three levels—to the boss, to ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2310))

- people, as in some experiments—our behavior gradually drifts so that before long we’re asleep in the afternoons and wide-awake at night.4 What prevents such misalignment in the aboveground world are environmental and social signals such as sunrise and alarm clocks. The process by which our internal clocks synch up with external cues so we wake up in time for work or go to sleep at a reasonable hour is called “entrainment.” ([Location 2354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2354))

- In 1995, two social psychologists, Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary, put forth what they called “the belongingness hypothesis.” They proposed that “a need to belong is a fundamental human motivation . . . and that much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness.” ([Location 2427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2427))

- After we primates climbed down from trees to roam the open savannah, belonging to a group became essential for survival. We needed others to share the work and watch our backs. Belonging kept us alive. Not belonging turned us into lunch for some prehistoric beast. Today, this enduring preference for belonging helps us time our actions with others. Social cohesion, many scholars have discovered, leads to greater synchrony.10 Or, as Simmons puts it, “You get a better sound if there’s a sense of belonging. You get better attendance rates at rehearsals, better smiles on their faces.” But while the drive for belonging is innate, its emergence sometimes requires some effort. For group coordination, it comes in three forms: codes, garb, and touch. ([Location 2433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2433))

- When I began working on this book, I knew that timing was important, but also that it was inscrutable. At the start of this project, I had no idea of the destination. My goal was to arrive at something resembling the truth, to pin down facts and insights that could help people, including me, work a little smarter and live a little better. The product of writing—this book—contains more answers than questions. But the process of writing is the opposite. Writing is an act of discovering what you think and what you believe. I used to believe in ignoring the waves of the day. Now I believe in surfing them. I used to believe that lunch breaks, naps, and taking walks were niceties. Now I believe they’re necessities. I used to believe that the best way to overcome a bad start at work, at school, or at home was to shake it off and move on. Now I believe the better approach is to start again or start together. I used to believe that midpoints didn’t matter—mostly because I was oblivious to their very existence. Now I believe that midpoints illustrate something fundamental about how people behave and how the world works. I used to believe in the value of happy endings. Now I believe that the power of endings rests not in their unmitigated sunniness but in their poignancy and meaning. I used to believe that synchronizing ([Location 2798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072Q985YX&location=2798))
