- What made Frazier so great, Terry wrote, was his link to the men he fought – George Foreman and Muhammad Ali – and the significance the bouts had. ‘We would all do well to remember that we are defined by those with whom we compete – be they boxer, banker or politician.’ ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=168))

- Myth number one: algorithms have taken over the world and there is no serious alternative to passive investing, exemplified by the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds have indeed grown exponentially, ostensibly offering far more reliable returns compared to so-called “active” investing. But Fundsmith has demonstrated that there is a profitable niche in the market alongside the titans of BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard. Myth number two: so-called value investing has run its course. Chief witness for the prosecution is Neil Woodford, long hailed as Britain’s Golden Boy. Woodford certainly had his moments at Invesco; but after striking out on his own in 2014, his record looks more similar to that of another golden boy: Billy Walker, the British heavyweight from Stepney, known as “the Blond Bomber” who eventually gave up his gloves for a brief career in movies. In fact, Woodford’s demise owes more to hubris and an unhealthy reliance on illiquid stocks. It does not spell the end of the savvy stock picker. Myth number three: asset allocation trumps all considerations and, almost by implication, the addition of a small/mid-cap element to a portfolio constitutes an unacceptable level of risk. In fact, as Terry argued in a myth-busting FT column in August 2018, ‘there is no doubt that adding a small/mid-cap element to a portfolio can achieve the seemingly impossible feat of generating additional return while reducing risk.’ No doubt Terry had half an eye on the launch of Smithson, his small-to-mid-cap fund; but once again the subsequent performance of the fund speaks for itself. Myth number four: blue-chip companies deserve a measure of respect which makes them impregnable or untouchable. Terry has shown time and again a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. He has taken on national champions such as IBM in the US and Tesco in the UK, relentlessly probing their underlying performance and profitability. In retrospect, his critical analysis has proven remarkably prescient. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=186))

- Some of these naysayers are protagonists in the ongoing debate about so-called value investing, which they contrast with growth or quality investing. Value investing can be traced back at least to Ben Graham, the author of The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, who was Warren Buffett’s mentor. For Ben Graham, and Buffett in his early years, value investing meant buying a stock below its intrinsic value as the most important investment consideration, and then waiting for the two to converge – hopefully by means of the share price rising rather than the intrinsic value declining. Latterly, in the hands of other practitioners, it has morphed into a simplistic approach of investing in stocks with low valuations, which is not the same thing – hence my use of the term “so-called”. A stock may have a low valuation but an even lower intrinsic value. Buying such a stock is not a recipe for investment success. Nor is growth or quality investing (I believe the latter is a more accurate descriptor for Fundsmith’s approach) best done irrespective of valuation. However, the level of valuation which may represent good value at which to buy shares in a high-quality company may surprise you. The following chart shows the “justified” PEs (price-to-earnings ratios) of a group of stocks of the sort we invest in. What does that mean? It looks at the period 1973 to 2019 when the MSCI World Index produced an annual return of 6.2% and works out what PE an investor could have paid at the outset for those stocks and still returned 7% p.a. over the period, so beating the index.

- You could have paid 281 times earnings for L’Oréal in 1973 and beaten the index return. Or a PE of 126 for Colgate. A PE of 63 for Coca-Cola. Clearly this approach would not fit the mutation of value investing in which the rating must simply be low. Yet it is hard to argue with the fact that these stocks would have been good value even on some eye-watering valuation metrics. The fact, as Warren Buffett has acknowledged, is that growth is a component of valuation. Growth can enhance or diminish the value of a company – growing a business with inadequate returns is simply sending good money after bad. But when a company has superior returns on capital employed, and a source of growth which enables it to reinvest a substantial portion of those returns, the result is compound growth in its value and share price over time. It is important to realise that this is over the long term. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=258))

Galbraith on this subject: ‘The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.’ This applies not only to economic forecasts.

- Even if they were not handicapped by blinkers in predicting the outcome of events, those who wish to rely upon forecasts would still labour under the problem that markets are second-order systems. In order for a forecast to be useful it not only has to be accurate (and that includes the timing) but you also need to know what the market expects in order to have a chance to predict how it will react to events and benefit from it. But where was the recession which we were told would follow a vote for Brexit, or the market crash which would follow a Trump victory? To return to J. K. Galbraith: ‘We have two classes of forecasters. Those who don’t know – and those who don’t know they don’t know.’ We are in the former camp, and so long as many other investors rely upon people in the latter camp this gives us an advantage. The irony of this is that as Ian E. Wilson, the former chairman of General Electric, said, ‘No amount of sophistication is going to allay the fact that all your knowledge is about the past and all your decisions are about the future.’ Given that we acknowledge that the future is unknowable – we regard the phrase “foreseeable future” as an oxymoron – how do we manage to select companies to invest in which will perform well in future and better than our benchmarks? The short answer is carefully. Very few companies make it through our filtering system as potential investments and even fewer make it into our portfolio. The longer answer is that, whilst we seek companies which have superior financial performance, that should be an outcome of their operations – not their primary objective. We are seeking companies that offer a superior product and/or service to customers which enables them to generate these impressive financial returns and prevent competition from eroding them.

- We try not to let share prices inform us about businesses but rather do this the other way around. If you look back to the “How growth became value but value didn’t” table earlier it suggests that the reason why “value” investors fell into the trap of owning some of those stocks is because they felt that the low valuation and share price was the most important piece of information. It is not. The fundamental performance of the business is. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=381))

- Performance fees do not work. They extract too much of the return and encourage risky behaviour. The only way to focus your fund manager on performance without gifting him or her most of your returns is to ensure he or she invests a major portion of their net worth alongside you in the fund and on exactly the same terms.

- Benchmarks are useful for measuring performance, provided a long enough timescale is used. Problems arise when fund managers start to use them for portfolio construction. At Fundsmith we do not endeavour to track any index or to minimise our “tracking error” versus any index (even the use of the expression tracking “error” tells you that an active fund manager has the wrong mindset).

- Put simply this means that we own shares in businesses which are higher quality than the market on a valuation lower than the average for the market. Whilst that is not a total solution to successful investing, it strikes us as at least a good start. We regard an equity holding as a claim on a share of the cash flow produced by a business. In the fund we seek to own companies which produce high cash returns on capital and distribute part of those returns as dividends and re-invest the remainder at similar rates of return. And we want to own those companies’ shares at prices which at best undervalue their returns and at worst value them fairly. We do not regard equity investment as a sophisticated game of pass the parcel in which we buy shares in companies that we don’t understand, which may be poorly performing businesses and/or which are overvalued, hoping to sell them to a greater fool when they have become even more expensive as a result of some fad or share price ramp. Such games are best left to video consoles unless your hobby is losing money whilst investing, which I rather suspect it is for some people. I aim to restrict myself to one rant per letter about a subject relevant to investment. Frankly, given the behaviour of much of the wealth/asset management industry, I regard this as a model of self-restraint in a target-rich environment. This year’s rant is a warning about the misunderstanding and misuse of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). I think this is relevant as the Fundsmith Equity Fund launch was somewhat against the tide of events. We launched an active equity fund at the end of a decade in which a) equities have performed badly; and b) the average active fund manager has again underperformed the index and so made a bad performance by the asset class worse. Faced with this failure of active management, it is hardly surprising that investors have turned their backs on active management and headed for lower-cost, passive alternatives. As a result, the rise of ETFs has been a major feature of the investment landscape in recent years. By the third quarter of 2010, there were 2,379 ETFs with 5,204 listings on 45 exchanges managing $1,181.3 billion of assets. So what’s the problem? I suspect that the average investor regards all ETFs as just another form of index fund, and indeed many of them are. But many aren’t and therein lies the potential for misunderstanding. Or worse. Some ETFs do indeed replicate the performance of an index by purchasing a weighted package of all or most of its constituent securities. But many so-called synthetic ETFs do not do so and instead use so-called swap agreements with counterparties who agree to provide a monetary return which matches the underlying asset class or the index the ETF is seeking to track. Anyone who has studied the events of the Credit Crisis should be able to spot a potential problem here: what if the counterparty supplying the swaps defaults? This risk may once have been considered… ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=560))

- Capital allocation decisions are amongst the most important decisions which management of companies make on behalf of shareholders. Yet share buybacks are not sufficiently understood by company investors and commentators, and maybe even by company management. One of the most important facts that is continually overlooked is share buybacks only create value if the shares repurchased are trading below intrinsic value and there is no better use for the cash which would generate a higher return. Most share buybacks destroy value for remaining shareholders, and management is able to get away with this as the current accounting for share buybacks conceals their true effect. So what needs to change? Management should be required to justify share buybacks by reference to the price paid and the implied return and compare this with alternative uses for the cash. Investors and commentators should analyse share buybacks on exactly the same basis as they would if the company bought shares in another company. Investors and commentators should use return on equity to analyse the effect of share buybacks rather than movements in earnings per share. Share buybacks need to be viewed with more than average scepticism when done by companies whose management are incentivised by growth in EPS. Accounting for share buybacks should be changed so that the shares remain as part of shareholders’ funds and as an equity accounted asset on the balance sheet in calculating returns.

- However, there is another and perhaps more pernicious danger with ETFs than misunderstanding or mis-selling. An ETF is in effect a hybrid vehicle which combines features of an open-ended or mutual fund with those of a closed-end fund. They are like open-ended funds insofar as a purchaser buys or redeems so-called ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=721))

- called creation units. But they are also tradable in the secondary market, so ostensibly providing real-time liquidity. Secondary trading activity brings with it the possibility that market participants will short the ETFs themselves. And there is no limit to the short selling, which is impossible in an ETF in the same way that there is in an equity. In an ordinary equity, the short selling is limited by the ability of the short sellers to borrow the stock so that they can deliver it to complete their sell bargains. In an ETF, a short seller can always rely on the process of creating shares in the ETF to ensure he can deliver. This leads to the possibility that a buyer of an ETF share is buying from a short seller and that no new share has yet been created. The investors who buy from the short sellers don’t own a claim on the underlying basket of securities or swap in the ETF; they own a promise to deliver the ETF share given by the short seller. The problem this causes is that, as no new shares are created in the ETF by this process, the assets of the ETF may become significantly less than the outstanding cumulative buy orders would suggest. This is a significant problem given reports that there has been short selling up to levels of 1,000% short in some ETFs. You might think that one way to overcome the risks involved in this at a stroke is for the ETF sponsor to create the shares represented by the cumulative buying interest, but this may be easier said than done. Take an ETF like IWM in which the short interest recently exceeded 100% or $15bn (£9.3bn). IWM invests in the Russell 2000 US small-cap index. To invest $15bn in the basket of stocks involved would require about a week’s trading – and that is if the ETF creation was the sole trading in those stocks. The scope for a short squeeze is tremendous. The net result is that across the entire ETF asset class a portion of the funds which ETF purchasers think has been invested in ETFs, via the creation of new shares, has in effect been lent to hedge funds. The ETF holdings are not all backed by assets of the sort investors expect, even if they understand what the ETF is meant to do.

- This week there was a new development in the share-buyback mass-shareholder-value-destruction exercise which has gripped American companies and has some following in the UK. To date this year Citigroup reckons that in the US market there have been 26 accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) totalling $8.5bn. What happens in an ASR is that the company does the whole or a significant proportion of a share buyback programme in a single transaction with an investment bank or a small group of banks, rather than executing the programme over an extended period in line with volumes traded in the market. The investment bank(s) makes a short sale to the company and borrows the stock it delivers to the company. Of course, at some point the investment bank will need to purchase stock to cover its short position and enable it to return the borrowed stock to the stock lender(s). Investment banks are not noted for doing something for nothing and certainly not taking on short positions just to assist companies. After all, share buybacks can generate share price rises at least in the short term and indeed part of the raison d’être for ASRs is to trigger a bigger short-term boost to share prices. No sane organisation would go short of shares faced with that likelihood. So the company is required to give the investment bank an agreement to cover any losses it incurs in purchasing the shares to cover the short. In an 118.8m share ASR which IBM did in May 2007, it paid an initial price of $105.18 per share for the shares purchased from the investments bank’s short sales totalling $12.5bn, and then another $2.95 per share or a total of $351m to cover the higher price of $108.13 at which the banks eventually closed their shorts. One of the rules that I have found in business life is that when management is doing something they really don’t want examined they use polite euphemisms to camouflage the reality of the situation. Thus, the payments by IBM to the banks are termed ‘adjustments’ in its accounts not “extra costs” or even “losses”. This is a truly amazing thing for a company to do. I have previously contended (“Share buybacks – friend or foe?”, page 20) that many companies seem to pay little or no apparent heed to the implied returns from share repurchases or even the price at which they buy back shares. With an ASR they literally have no idea at what price they are repurchasing them. They have in effect agreed to write a blank cheque to the investment bank to cover the cost of eventually purchasing the shares. How can this be acceptable? Surely all but the most stupid management must accept the contention that the price at which shares are repurchased has some bearing on whether the repurchase creates or destroys value for remaining shareholders. What this implies about managements’ lack of understanding and/or care about shareholder value seems to me to amount to malfeasance. Add to that the fact an ASR gives investment banks even more ways to take money from the… ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=754))

- What if (when?) such ETF trades cause such a mammoth loss in a counterparty which does not have sufficient capital to bear the loss and pay out under the derivative contract? Answer: the ETF will fail. ETFs do not always match the underlying in the way people expect. Because of daily rebalancing and compounding, you can own a leveraged long ETF and lose money over a period when the market goes up but during which there are some sharp falls. Equally, you can own an inverse ETF (which provides a short exposure) during a period when the market goes down but there are some sharp rallies and lose money. This actually occurred with some inverse ETFs in 2008. I would strongly suggest that people would not expect to be leveraged long and lose money if the market goes up or short and lose it when it goes down. Because you can exchange trade these funds, they are used by hedge funds and banks to take positions and they can short them. Because they can apparently rely upon creating the units to deliver on their short, there are examples of short interest in ETFs being up to 1,000% short, i.e. some market participants are short ten times the amount of the ETF. If the ETF is in an illiquid sector, can you really rely upon creating the units as you may not be able to buy (or sell) the underlying assets in a sector with limited liquidity?

- During the year we wrote to the management of those companies within our portfolio which have engaged in share buybacks to ask for some insight into their rationale. The responses ranged from prompt, personalised (by the CEO) and well reasoned to being completely ignored. We regard the greatest risk for our investors – after the obvious potential for us to buy the wrong shares or pay too much for shares in the right companies – as being reinvestment risk: we seek to buy companies which deliver high returns on capital in cash. What the management then does with these cash returns is one of the major factors affecting future returns on the portfolio.

- Management faces three main options for deploying these cash returns: return cash to shareholders, invest to grow the business organically or make acquisitions. The criteria they use for choosing between these options are important. So are the ways in which they operate each option. So, for example, having determined to return a portion of earnings to shareholders, how does a management decide between a dividend and a buyback? In many cases we do not know as the management does not give any detailed rationale and we suspect that the answer is with the “benefit” of advice from their investment bankers who get fees, commissions, bid–offer spreads and maybe proprietary trading profits for advising companies to pursue buybacks but get nothing when a dividend is used. No prizes for guessing which way the advice is slanted. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=988))

- One more problem with ETFs became apparent to me in the course of this debate. ETFs are represented as low-cost investments. Yet research published during the year demonstrated that ETFs were amongst the largest profit generators for some banks. This seems counterintuitive: how does a low-cost product become a major profit contributor? The answer, of course, is that synthetic ETFs in particular provide banks with innumerable ways to “clip the ticket” of the ETF. The fees paid by the ETF investor are a very small portion of the total revenues which operating the ETF provides. They also deal for the ETF, provide the swap agreements by which it holds its synthetic positions (I wonder who works out whether the bank is providing them a fair price?), and maybe earn leverage, prime brokerage, custodian and registrar fees. The banks also deal for the hedge funds and traders who want to trade the ETF. At about this ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1040))

- During 2010 Fundsmith also launched a SICAV and a US LLP. Neither of these affects your investment in the Fundsmith Equity Fund but I feel that you should be informed about this and it affords me an opportunity to raise another subject – currencies. The SICAV is denominated in euros and based in Luxembourg. It is a so-called “feeder” fund – the only assets it holds are units in the Fundsmith Equity Fund. The US LLP is a Delaware partnership denominated in US dollars which is invested with exactly the same strategy as the Fundsmith Equity Fund but it cannot be run as a feeder fund. We launched these two funds in response to investor demand. US-based investors face a massive tax disadvantage in investing in a UK fund as it cannot issue a Form K1 for IRS reporting, and offshore investors wanted a non-UK vehicle for investment. But in neither case does the denomination of the fund in a currency other than sterling affect the investments’ currency exposure. We are often asked by investors whether we hedge currencies. The answer is a firm “No”. How would we do so? Should we base it on the currency of the country in which the companies are listed? This obviously would not work. There may be no connection between the country in which a company is listed and its area of operations. The same is true of its country of ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1054))

- incorporation or headquarters. Nestlé is an example we often cite in this respect. Although it is headquartered in Switzerland, has its main listing there and reports in Swiss francs, it has only about 2% of its revenues in Switzerland, so hedging our holding by selling Swiss francs forward against sterling would surely not be a hedge at all. It is also far from unknown for companies to report in a different currency to that of the country in which they are headquartered or listed. Perhaps we should hedge currencies based upon the country in which each of our investee companies has its revenues? The problem with this approach is twofold. Firstly, most of the companies supply low-value items and so manufacture and sell locally or at least regionally. No one exports significant amounts of bulky low-value items such as detergent. So the exposure, if there is any, relates only to the profit margin. Secondly, the corporate treasurer may already have taken out a currency hedge for the translation and/or transmission of those profits so that any currency hedge by us would in fact be creating an exposure. A lot of nonsense is talked about currency exposure and hedging. Our new funds denominated in euros and US dollars do not change the currency risks of those funds, which are driven by the underlying investments. For those who don’t believe this, we are prepared to launch a new class of our fund which will change its currency denomination each year to the worst-performing currency. In 2011 it would have been denominated in Turkish lira – and would have risen by 32%. However, since you would receive this depreciated currency when you sell the fund units, you won’t be any wealthier as a result. If you think you would be, let us know and we will set up the Money Illusion class of the fund. We view the year ahead with some trepidation. It seems that it has yet to dawn on many of the key participants in the financial crisis that you cannot borrow and spend your way out of a crisis caused by overleverage, and that there is no higher authority than the governments (whose credit is now in doubt) which can extend further funds to provide a painless “solution” or maybe even a temporary respite. The dawning of this reality is sure to have some very painful consequences. However, in contrast, the credit default swaps of Nestlé have been less expensive than the cost of insuring against default on the debt of European governments and the US Treasury for some time. We are far from believers that the market is always right, but this does suggest that holding shares in major, conservatively financed companies which make their profits from a large number of small, everyday, predictable events is a relatively safe place to be if you have the patience, fortitude and liquidity to ride out the share price volatility which is likely to occur in such circumstances. And that’s exactly where and how our fund is invested. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1065))

- You might ask what this has to do with investment. There’s at least one vital lesson for successful investment from the Tour. It will be run for the 100th time next year, yet has never been won by a rider who won every stage, and it never will. That’s because cyclists, like investment products, are built for different ends. Imagine the peloton is like the mass of index-hugging funds. In each stage (quarter or year) it produces a winner, but the leadership continually changes. In the mountain stages, the climbers are those defensive funds that outperform in adverse market conditions, but don’t do so well in rampant bull markets. The sprinters are the high-frequency traders built for speed. Gearing and derivatives are the investment equivalent of EPO and steroids – they can boost performance but at a cost, and added risk. The Tour has three distinct stages. In the flat stages, the riders group together in the peloton, gaining advantage by slipstreaming those around them to save the effort of riding alone. In the time-trial stages, the riders are on bikes with tri-bars on which they place their arms so that their posture is more aerodynamic. They wear skinsuits because they cannot “slipstream” as in the peloton. They set off individually, so the result is a pure test of riding ability. Then there are the lung-busting mountain stages in which the rider must ride up alpine passes and roads. Here, it’s about endurance. There is no one rider with the physique to win all three types of stage. The way to win is to be excellent at one discipline, not bad at others, and to work with your team. Searching for an investment strategy or fund manager who can outperform the market in all reporting periods and varying market conditions is as pointless as trying to find a rider who can win every stage of the Tour. But this is precisely what many investors do. We persist in examining our funds’ performance in every reporting period, as often as every quarter, and sometimes exiting when a manager underperforms. An element of this is sensible – investment performance has to be measured over some time period, and some funds are persistent “dogs” in almost all market conditions. But a quarter is too short a period to judge performance reasonably, and even a year is just the time it takes the earth to go round the sun. It is not a natural time period over which to measure the performance of any business or investment unless it is linked to the earth’s orbit. To assess an investment strategy or a fund, you need to see its results across a full economic cycle with both bull and bear markets. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that where investors are switching between funds and changing investment strategies, their timing is almost invariably wrong. Professional investors, in the form of trustees of endowments and pension funds, are just as guilty of this as retail investors. They often ditch managers after a poor streak only to find those managers recover their touch,… ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1178))

- It is also worth bearing in mind that we do not seek to outperform in every reporting period or in all market conditions. Rather, we seek to outperform the market and other funds over longer periods of time. The analogy I use for this is the Tour de France, which topically was won by a British rider – the now “Sir” Bradley Wiggins – for the first time in 2012. The Tour is the greatest of cycling Grand Tours, with 21 stages run over 23 days. In the 100 years since the Tour was first run, no rider has ever succeeded in winning every stage of a Tour. Nor in my view will anyone ever achieve this. This is because the Tour encompasses three distinct types of stage: The stages in which the riders form a peloton and riders can gain vital aerodynamic assistance by slipstreaming (or getting “a wheel”) from the rider(s) in front of them. A team can carry a sprinter (like Mark Cavendish) in the peloton and release him close to the line for the final sprint in an effort to win the stage. Time trials in which the riders are released individually and so cannot gain any assistance from each other. In order to maximise their own aerodynamic efficiency, the riders use tri handlebars, wear skin suits and aerodynamic helmets and often have solid rear wheels and wide rims on the front wheel. This is a test of individual riding ability over the whole stage. Mountain stages which are run as a team but involve significant climbs, unlike the main peloton stages which are much flatter. A rider needs a very different physique to win as a sprinter to a time trialist or a mountain climber – compare Bradley Wiggins with Mark Cavendish – which is why no one can win all stages. The rider who wins the Tour is likely to be one who excels at one discipline – Wiggins is a time trialist, the discipline in which he also won a gold medal at the 2012 Olympics – and is not too bad at, and obtains help from his team with, the other stages. Indeed, on two occasions, the Tour has been won by riders who did not win a single stage. In my view there is a moral here for investors. What we are trying to achieve with Fundsmith is to win the investment equivalent of the Tour de France for you – to outperform over a long period of time. However, we do not expect to outperform all the time or in all market conditions. Rather our expectation is that we will perform relatively well in bear market conditions, and may struggle to keep pace in more bullish conditions, which is why I am surprised that we outperformed the market albeit modestly in 2012. It is important that our investors recognise that this is what we are aiming for. Too often investors seek to find fund managers who can outperform all the time and in all market conditions. The trouble is that no such person exists. But the attempt to find this mythical creature leads to some investors moving their assets between managers, incurring costs and most frequently ditching a manager whose investment style is out of step with the current market… ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1253))

- So I did what you should always do when you get it wrong (but which all of us rarely manage to): a) admit this (most importantly to yourself) b) reverse the decision. So Domino’s was repurchased. Fortunately there was a period of share price weakness after the refinancing which enabled us to do this on reasonable terms, but frankly that does not matter as much as whether the shares were still good value when we repurchased them, which we believe they were. It is always a mistaken strategy to wait for the shares to get below the point at which you sold them before repurchasing, or the even more common trait of waiting for a loss-making share purchase to get back to break-even before selling. As I am fond of saying, the shares are unlikely to follow this desired pattern since they do not know whether you own them or not or at what price you bought or sold. There are several morals to the Domino’s trades but the main one is that almost every time we sell a position in a quality company we get to regret it in terms of subsequent share price performance. The good news is that we don’t do it very often. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1303))

- The return on capital of the companies in our portfolio averaged about 32% p.a. This compares to an average of about 20% p.a. for the non-financial stocks in both the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. Bearing in mind the longevity and resilience of our portfolio companies, I think we can remain confident that we own stocks with a superior fundamental performance to the average which is not fully reflected in their valuation relative to bonds or other equities. It may seem surprising that we can buy shares in quality companies at reasonable or even cheap valuations and thereby expect to generate superior investment performance. I have written a short research note in an effort to explain this entitled “Return Free Risk” which can be downloaded from our website at tinyurl.com/y2hro8py. The title is not a mistype, rather it’s a pun. As investors we are taught that to obtain higher returns you must assume higher risk, but much of the evidence contradicts this assumption. The fact is that for much of the time you get better returns from investing in predictable high-quality companies than in smaller, riskier, more obscure company shares. But there appears to be a human desire to indulge in excitement and back the 100–1 shot rather than the favourite, and to engage in complicated bets such as the Yankee (defined as ‘four selections and consisting of 11 separate bets: 6 doubles, 4 trebles and a fourfold accumulator’). Can you accurately calculate whether the odds on such a bet are fair, in your favour or the bookmaker’s favour? If you can’t, then the bookmaker has the advantage. For bookmaker, read “market”. The principle is the same. At Fundsmith we obtain excitement not from the delusion that we have discovered an investment that no other investors have found or from a long shot winning, but from delivering predictable, superior investment returns.

- The title of this piece is a play on the expression “risk-free return” used to describe the return on investment which can be obtained without incurring any risk to the capital sum invested. Prior to the current financial crisis, this characteristic was generally assumed to apply to sovereign debt in the developed world. The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are “efficient” in that the only way an investor can achieve higher returns is to take on more risk. But this is not necessarily true in practice. Research by Robert Haugen of Haugen Financial Systems and Nardin Baker of Guggenheim Partners shows that the least volatile decile of stocks generated annualised total returns of 8.7%, while the most volatile decile lost 8.8% a year. These results seem flatly to contradict the risk/return bit of the EMH.

- in fundamental quality – defined as cash return on cash invested, or CROCI. It created portfolios based upon CROCI performance and found that market returns increase with relative CROCI. Better companies made better investments. But why can “quality” shares outperform like this when EMH postulates that only more risk can drive superior returns? Part of the answer lies in investor psychology. Imagine you have a gravely ill loved one, but you can purchase treatment that would enhance their chances of survival by 10%. What would you pay for it? Research suggests that this depends upon their starting chances of survival without the treatment. If their chances were 50/50, then a 10% improvement would certainly be valuable. But if their chances were zero, I’d suggest most people would pay more to improve that to 10%. Similarly, most people would surely pay more highly for certainty – if the relative had a 90% chance of survival, but by paying you could take this to 100%. This goes some way towards explaining why investors will buy a bond which yields less than an equity in the same company. They desire certainty of outcome: the bond will pay a certain coupon and be redeemed for a certain value at a certain time. By contrast, dividends from the equity may vary or even disappear and the price of the shares is unpredictable. Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist and behavioural economist, illustrates this point in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow using the chart on page 53. The solid line is the “decision weight” – the psychological importance attached to each level of probability, derived from laboratory experiments. You can see that from about zero to 30% probability of survival, the relative will pay more for a given level of probability. From about 30% to close to 100% they will underpay, but there is a sharp increase in the relative amount they will pay from about 90% probability to certainty. In investing, the near-certain bit just before 90% is the world of low beta/high-quality stocks. They have bond-like returns and low share-price volatility, but they are still stocks with uncertainty about share price and dividend payments. This helps to explain why “boring” quality stocks tend to be consistently undervalued, and that undervaluation is what helps to produce superior performance. The upshot of all this is relatively simple, but nonetheless startling. Rather than seeking superior portfolio performance by chasing high-risk stocks (“return-free risk”), investors should seek out “boring” quality companies which have predictable returns and superior fundamental financial performance, and take advantage of their persistent undervaluation relative to those returns to buy and hold them.

- What is meant by market timing? It’s the classic investor aim: to buy low and sell high. This can be applied to individual stocks or funds, trying to buy them at the bottom of a business or market cycle and sell close to the top, or to the timing of committing your funds to the market as a whole – waiting for a market bottom before coming out of cash and taking the plunge, and cashing out when the market is at a top.

- But what do I mean by “good companies”? If you read investment research, you will see a great deal about earnings growth, growth in earnings per share or valuations based on earnings per share. You will rarely read much about a company’s return on capital employed (ROCE). That’s a shame, because ROCE is important. If you invest your capital in a fund, a bond or a bank account, you will be very interested in the expected rate of return you will get. If you buy a share in a company, you are in effect purchasing your share of its capital. Why aren’t you interested in the return it will earn on it? After all, you own part of it. Return on capital employed is usually calculated as cash operating profit divided by the sum of shareholders’ equity and long-term liabilities – all numbers that can be found in a normal set of company accounts. If, as individuals, we borrow money at a rate of say 5% each year and we invest it at a return of 10% a year, we will become richer. But if we earn a return of 2.5% we would become poorer. The same is true of companies. Those that make a return above their cost of capital create value for their shareholders, while those that make a return below their cost of capital destroy value. But assessing companies on this basis is less easy than just looking at earnings because of the cost of capital concept. We can easily assess the cost of a company’s debt – a description of the debt profile and interest costs is usually included in the notes to a company’s annual accounts – but what is the cost of its equity capital? This is the subject of much research and in reality it can only ever be an estimate. But don’t let that put you off, because as an investor you should only be truly interested in companies whose returns are so high that they exceed any feasible cost of capital.

- If the investments are held in mutual funds, there will be an annual management charge (AMC) of 0.75–1.5%. In addition, the funds charge certain expenses to the fund: typically things such as custody, administration and legal expenses, but they have been known to charge marketing expenses too. Add that lot up and you get to what used to be called the total expense ratio and is now known as the ongoing charges figure. That’s typically 1.0–1.75%; add in platform and advice costs and the running total is generally between 1.75% and 3%. Even that isn’t it. There is also a hidden cost which is not disclosed in any of these figures: the cost of dealing within the fund. When a fund manager or an investor deals in stocks, he or she pays commissions, stamp duty at 0.5%, the levy that funds the Takeover Panel and the difference between the broker’s bid and offer prices (the spread).

- Having been involved in financial analysis for nearly four decades, I have increasingly formed the view that there are some words and phrases used by company managements, analysts and commentators which investors should be wary of. Apart from being an abuse of the English language, they represent a combination of woolly thinking and a desire to disguise or divert attention from a problem. Take Walmart, the US-based retailer. In a recent results presentation, the management used the term “leverage” no fewer than 80 times. Leverage has a legitimate meaning. It can mean to use a rigid bar to move an object. It can also mean the use of borrowing for finance which magnifies or “leverages” the operating results of a business. It should not be used, as Walmart did, to say, ‘Asda is a leader in online grocery delivery, and we’ve leveraged that experience in the US.’ Copied, benefitted or learnt from, but not leveraged. It is probably no coincidence that this mass outbreak of Banned Word Syndrome (or BWS, as you must have a three-letter acronym) accompanied a set of results in which Walmart revealed falling sales. So this first category of words which shouldn’t be used, and which should raise your suspicions when they are, is words which are used for a meaning beyond their original purpose. Other examples include “runway” used to describe the scope for development of a product or service as in “there’s plenty of runway to develop sales for this product”. A runway is a strip on which an aircraft lands or takes off. You should only describe something as “key” if it relates to a lock, so no “key objectives”. “Footprint” should only be used in relation to feet or footwear, not the area of operations of a business. Another category is words which are used in an effort to sound profound, when a much simpler word exists. You will often hear management and investment analysts talking about granular data or granularity. Detail is a perfectly good word. Sometimes the word used is not intended to convey an impression of profundity but has a pejorative or critical tone. I have lost count of the number of failed bankers and CEOs whose pension “pot” has been the subject of critical reporting and subsequent rage. I wonder if they would have suffered the same fate if it was correctly described as a pension fund. A pot is a type of container. There are also some expressions that you should be wary of. If someone tells you they are “reaching out” to you, you might ask how this is different to or better than contacting you. And, of course, be wary of anyone who begins a statement with “to be honest”, as it begs the question of whether they are normally dishonest. Always be wary of any organisation which is run by a “steering committee”. Would you ever steer a boat or a car by committee, and what do you think the outcome would be if you did? Organisations run by steering committees are unlikely to achieve any good results in my view.

- what many of them actually do)? The new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has been struggling to get the markets to accept his “forward guidance” on interest rates. He might like to pause to think whether he would ever use backward guidance. If so, perhaps he would also be happy to “group together” (can you group apart?) and do some “forward planning” (what other sort is there?). Perhaps he would have more success if he just called it a prediction. Be wary of management or commentators who engage in hyperbole. “Global” is a common example of hyperbole. Very few businesses are truly global. They may be international, but that is not the same. And when “global” is used in job titles, it is almost always an example of status inflation. Whenever I am given the business card of a head of global sales, I am tempted to ask how many globes he or she has sold. A newspaper this year ran a cycling event which it described in its advertising as “iconic”. The Tour de France is iconic, but a ride around the Surrey Hills isn’t. At Fundsmith we keep a banned word count for the companies we analyse because we think they provide an insight into their management. Our investment approach is about investing in good companies. They are best spotted by their good results – we do not need managements to tell us how good they are – but when we do listen to management, the straight talkers get our vote and our money. A classic example is Domino’s Pizza, which began a turnaround in 2009 by publishing harsh criticism from its customers such as ‘Pizza was cardboard’. You only do that if you intend to change.

- We don’t often look at price-to-earnings (PE) ratios, the traditional measure of value, at Fundsmith as we prefer to look at cash flows, but since almost everybody else uses them, it is the simplest way of expressing the relative valuation of our portfolio, which currently has a PE about two points higher than the market – the Fundsmith stocks are on about 21 times forecast earnings and the MSCI World Index is on about 19 times. In judging what this implies, there are a number of things which you should also be aware of, namely that not all earnings (the “E” in that ratio) are of equal value. The shares in the Fundsmith portfolio produce their earnings with significantly less capital intensity (hence their higher return on capital) than the market in general, and they deliver more of their earnings in cash, which is more valuable. Their earnings are also more predictable, which brings me back to compounding. ([Location 1767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1767))

- Our 17th-century forebears would have known all about that. They encountered these same problems over 300 years ago and developed products called “tontines” to deal with them. A tontine is an investment plan named after a banker, Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. Each subscriber paid a sum into the tontine, and thereafter received an annuity. Sound familiar? As members died, their shares transferred to the other participants, and so the value of each remaining annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Tontines were relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries. France established a state tontine in 1689. The English government organised one in 1693. But tontines soon caused problems. Their structure created an obvious incentive for members to kill each other, one reason why they are often used as a plot device in murder mysteries. And just as they have today, governments running tontines tended to underestimate the longevity of the population. What’s the purpose of this history lesson? It is that you might be well advised to check the history of any investment product you are offered to see how it has fared in the past, even if it was called something else at the time.

- Now this might strike you as odd, that a sell-off in the market coincided with increasing evidence of economic recovery, but apart from the fact that no one has ever established a correlation between GDP growth and the performance of stock markets, one of the more apparently perverse aspects of markets has been the growing view that “good news is bad news”. It all comes down to QE – the markets were more concerned that economic recovery would lead to the withdrawal of this stimulus than they were bullish about the recovery itself. Although we have an interest in this subject, these market shenanigans have no bearing on the manner in which our portfolio is invested. People often ask us what we think the outlook is for the economy and/or the market. Apart from prefacing any response with the phrase, “we don’t know”, we usually point out that whatever the outlook it will not alter our methodology of investment. We mention this because we sometimes feel that the questioner supposes that if we too scent economic recovery we might switch the portfolio into cyclicals, financials and highly leveraged companies which might benefit from a recovery most (but which might otherwise go bust). Whatever our view on the economy, the Fundsmith Equity Fund will always be fully invested in high-quality companies which satisfy our exacting criteria on financial performance and have done so for many decades. However, at least one aspect of the debate about economic recovery and so-called tapering of QE puzzles us. If we are in an economic recovery, why is the growth rate of our investee companies slowing? We both understand and accept that in an economic recovery, companies in areas of discretionary spending and big-ticket durable items such as cars and houses will fare better than the companies in our portfolio, as will companies in the cyclical industries which supply them. But we keep track of the “underlying” (excluding acquisitions, currency effects and exceptional items) revenue growth rate at all the companies in our investable universe (currently 64 stocks) and there is no doubt that it has slowed by a couple of percentage points over the past year. Remarks from several of their CEOs make it clear that consumer markets are not becoming significantly better. We can see why they would lag cyclical stocks in an upturn but not why their performance would start to deteriorate. This leaves us feeling sceptical about the nature and strength of the recovery.

- Minimising portfolio turnover is one of our objectives and this was again achieved with a negative turnover of -17.6% during the period. Negative turnover occurs because the method of calculating turnover excludes flows into or out of the fund, otherwise a newly established fund would automatically have 100% or more turnover. However, it is not very helpful in judging our activities. It is perhaps therefore more helpful to know that we spent a total of £351,227 or just 0.025% (2.5bps) of the fund on dealing other than that associated with flows into the fund which was involuntary. Why is this important? It helps to minimise costs, and minimising the costs of investment is a vital contribution to achieving a satisfactory outcome as an investor. Too often investors, commentators and advisers focus on the annual management charge (AMC) or the ongoing charges figure (OCF), which includes some costs over and above the AMC, which are charged to the fund. The OCF for 2013 for the T-class shares was 1.11%. The trouble is that the OCF does not include an important element of costs – the costs of dealing. When a fund manager deals by buying or selling investments for a fund, the fund typically incurs commission paid to a broker, the bid–offer spread on the stocks dealt in and, in some cases, stamp duty. This can add significantly to the costs of a fund yet it is not included in the OCF. I find that investors are often confused by this and in my view do not pay enough attention to it. The fact is that as an investor you can only benefit from the price appreciation of shares in your fund and dividends paid. Costs of dealing detract from those returns and therefore need to be taken into account when you are comparing funds. We have published our own version of this total cost including dealing costs, which we have termed the “total cost of investment”, or TCI. For the T-class shares in 2013 this amounted to a TCI of 1.2%, including all costs of dealing for flows into and out of the fund, not just our voluntary dealing. As a result of the Investment Management Association’s campaign for fuller disclosure I am hopeful that we will eventually get such disclosure from many more funds so that investors can make a well-informed comparison between funds. When they are able to do so, I fully expect that the Fundsmith Equity Fund will compare favourably. ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=1922))

- There are many ways of looking at valuation, but here are a few thoughts: We seek to buy our portfolio companies when their free cash flow (FCF) yield (the free cash flow they generate divided by their market value) is at or above the yield we would expect to get on long-term government bonds in the same currency. Please note: not the current yield on bonds, which in most cases has been depressed by governments buying their own bonds, but the yield we think might apply if this were to stop and all bonds had to be sold to third-party investors. Our starting guess for the yield that might then be required is 1% over the expected rate of inflation. If we can buy shares with FCF yields higher than that and which will grow, unlike the coupon on the bonds, we should have captured some value. There are still shares within our portfolio which look good value on this basis, albeit not as many or as cheap as they were a year or two ago. The weighted average FCF yield of the portfolio started the year at 5.7% and ended it at 5.1% – still above the level we would find acceptable on the basis of the comparison with expected bond yields. Our companies on average grew their free cash flow per share by 6.6% during the year. They actually grew their operating cash flow by 8.1% but also spent 21% more on capital expenditure (capex). We find the fact that they have significantly increased their capex to be encouraging as we have yet to find an industry which can grow without committing additional capital in order to do so. This 5.1% FCF yield compares with a median FCF yield for the non-financial stocks in the S&P 500 of 4.6% and a mean of 4.1%, or a median for the non-financial stocks in the FTSE 100 of 4.0% and a mean of 3.7%. Our stocks do not look bad value in comparison to the market. Of course, both may be expensive – and both may continue to be so or become more expensive. Consumer staples, in particular, have been more highly rated in the past than they are now. We mention this because we frequently read or are told that they are more expensive than ever. This is simply not so – they were more highly rated in the 1990s, for example. Moreover, whilst commentators seem to focus on consumer staples stocks, these are less than half of our portfolio, and some of our medical equipment stocks are much closer to the low end of their historic valuation range. We examined the relative performance of Colgate-Palmolive and Coca-Cola over a 30-year time period from 1979–2009. Why 30 years? Because we thought it was long enough to simulate an investment lifetime in which individuals save for their retirement after which they seek to live on the income from their investment. Why 1979–2009? We wanted a recent period and in 1979 it so happens that Coca-Cola was on exactly the same price-to-earnings ratio (PE) as the market (10×) and Colgate was a little cheaper (7×). The question we posed is what PE could you have paid for those shares in 1979 and still performed in line… ([Location 2002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2002))

- we are talking about compound returns in which the gains are added to the capital sum to which each successive period’s rate of return is applied. Consequently, the answer is a counterintuitive seven years. It only takes a compound return of 7% p.a. to double your money in ten years. That is a simple enough example, but how about this one: starting with the same initial sum, what is the difference in final capital from 30 years of investment at 10% p.a. compounded versus 30 years at 12.5% p.a.? I ask this because it may represent a reasonable range of outcomes from an investment lifetime. The answer, rather surprisingly, is that the extra 2.5% of compound return would double the final sum. As discussed earlier, Coke and Colgate’s total returns grew at about 5% p.a. faster than the market over the period 1979–2009. This 5% differential multiplied their share prices four times more than the market over that period. Of course, the next 30 years may be different to the 1979–2009 period. However, if I had to guess how it would affect this calculation it would be that companies like Coke and Colgate will fare even better versus the rest of the market in terms of growth, given that the cyclical stocks are unlikely to benefit from a repetition of the growth stimulated by the credit bubble. But what do I know? It is also fair to point out that quality stocks may indeed not be too expensive relative to the rest of the market but that both will prove to be expensive, particularly when interest rates rise. But even so, I suggest you consider how you might have reacted if someone had suggested that you invest in Coke or Colgate at, say, twice the market PE in 1979. In rejecting that idea you would have missed the chance to make nearly twice as much money as an investment in the market indices over that period, which included some periods of very high interest rates. Of course, capturing this opportunity would have required you to have the fortitude to sit on your hands during those periods of high interest rates and poor performance (hint: we will be reminding you about this when interest rates rise). As at 31 December 2013 they were trading at PEs slightly above the market – our portfolio was on a PE of 20.6× versus 17.4× for the S&P 500, which doesn’t sound quite so expensive when you look at their historical performance and quality. In fact, we rarely look at PEs, usually only doing so to make such comparisons as other market commentators use them. We prefer instead to rely upon free cash flow yields when evaluating our investments, as not all Es – or Earnings – are created equal. Our portfolio companies’ businesses are less capital intensive than the market as whole. As their earnings are generated with less capital, their return on capital employed is much higher than the average, which we regard as the primary test of their performance. The return on capital of the companies in our portfolio averages 34%. This compares with an average of about 19% for… ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2034))

- average, which is not fully reflected in their valuation relative to bonds or other equities. A striking and direct comparison is between the dividend yield on some of our stocks and the redemption yield on their bonds. Take Nestlé, for example. At the end of December 2013 its 2018 bonds had a redemption yield of 0.21%, whilst its ordinary shares yielded 3.1%. Leaving aside fund managers who are limited to investing in bonds by their mandate, why would anybody in their right mind own the bonds rather than the shares? The answer is that some investors are willing to overpay for the apparent certainty which the bonds bring. They have a fixed coupon, a redemption date and a par value which will be repaid to the holder on redemption. The shares have none of those things. (Although it has to be said that the dividend is pretty safe given that Nestlé has only reported one loss in 146 years, but it is still not a fixed charge, as the interest coupon is.) And you cannot rely on the shares being a particular price if you need to dispose of them. But this does seem to suggest that the shares are at least good value relative to the bonds. While that does not mean that either of them is cheap, it does raise the… ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2060))

- The first is the concept of “energy return on energy investment” or EROEI. This is the ratio of the amount of energy generated from an energy source to the amount of energy expended to obtain that energy. It is an important and mostly ignored ratio which determines both the efficiency of our economies – how much of our resources have to be expended into getting our energy – and the economics of energy exploration and generation. The oil discoveries which took place a century or more ago were mostly in onshore locations, often in politically stable countries and close to key consumer markets. However, there is a natural tendency to pick the low-hanging fruit first, and over time, oil and gas exploration and production has, out of necessity, moved to less hospitable and remote locations, which place logistical barriers between oil and gas and the markets. Shale gas/oil and fracking are just an extension of this trend. US oil production had an EROEI of 100:1 in the 1930s – every hundred units produced required one unit to be expended. By 2000, despite huge technological advances, that had dropped to 11:1. The ratio for shale oil is about 5:1. This is a critical difference. There is also the issue of depletion. An old trick in investment analysis is to ask whether an annual return of £20 for an investment of £100 is good or bad. Most people will say it is a good return. But you lack other vital information necessary to assess the investment: the asset life and maturity value. If the asset only lasts for three years and is then worthless, it is a bad investment, as you will only recoup £60 in total from £100 invested. If it lasts for 20 years, it’s a good investment, as you will recoup £400. Asset life is critical to assess all investments. In the case of oil and gas exploration and production, it is the period until the well or field is no longer economically viable and has to be abandoned. The steepness of decline in production rates for shale oil wells has been a surprise. A typical well in the Bakken Formation, North Dakota, drilled in 2012 is likely to be producing at less than 30% of its initial production rate today. Recent disappointing performance relative to expectations at the newer Utica Shale play in the northeast US and Canada mirrors this. Investor returns on shale gas investments have broadly come in two main periods. From the discovery of most shale gas in 2002 until 2007, share prices of shale companies rose rapidly. Once the newly discovered gas came on stream, natural gas prices fell – and so did returns and share prices. The largest shale player in the UK is Cuadrilla Resources, which was founded in 2007 and is owned by AJ Lucas, Riverstone Holdings and Carlyle and is exploring for shale gas deposits in Lancashire. AJ Lucas, a quoted Australian company, owns 42% of Cuadrilla. Its own shares are just a quarter of what they were worth in 2009. Nor is this disappointing performance limited to small companies. BP wrote off $1bn on… ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2162))

- The vast majority of us are terrible at so-called “market timing”, in which investors try to sell at or close to market peaks and buy at market lows. All the statistics about investor flows show that believing you can accomplish this feat is the triumph of hope over experience. The wisest investors who are most likely to get the best performance are those who have at least realised that they can’t do this successfully and so don’t try. The other major fault that most investors have, whether private investors or professional fund managers, is that they are too active – they deal too much. Leaving aside the fact that if our timing decisions are almost all bad we would be better off making as few as possible, all dealing activity has a cost, much of which is hidden. We are taught that, to be successful investors, we need up-to-the-minute information and the ability to deal instantaneously. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. We should instead emulate the favourite client of fund manager Jonathan Ruffer, who said that ‘he would be monitoring performance on a quarterly basis, and if, after the first 25 years…’ It is a sobering thought: the fund management industry may serve us badly as investors, but there is one thing more detrimental to our wealth than that – us.

- It so happens that I was looking at IBM at about the same time as Warren Buffett was accumulating his stake, but I decided to avoid it. Why? A couple of features about IBM unsettled me. One was that they had announced a ‘roadmap’ to generate growth in earnings per share (EPS) to $20 by 2015, up from $11.50 in 2010. I do not like management that uses terms such as “roadmap” unless they are discussing driving cars. “Plan” is a perfectly good word. I also dislike the focus on EPS. Not all earnings are created equal. Some require greater or lesser amounts of capital to generate them and not all are delivered in cash. This should come as no surprise to Mr Buffett, who identified return on capital as the primary test of company performance in his 1979 annual chairman’s letter. Much EPS growth is generated at the expense of return on capital and so destroys value. But if the focus on EPS growth was worrying, the planned means of achieving this identified in the ‘roadmap’ was even more troubling: roughly 40% revenue growth, including acquisitions, 30% operating leverage and 30% share buybacks. Revenue growth is a higher-quality source of value creation than share buybacks or cost control (which is what I take it IBM means by ‘operating leverage’), provided it is not achieved at the expense of returns. I am wary of revenue growth achieved through acquisitions, the majority of which do not create value. However, there is at least no limit to revenue growth, while cost-cutting and buybacks are both finite. Moreover, although some buybacks create value for shareholders, many do not and are executed seemingly irrespective of the valuation of the shares. A company cannot create value for remaining shareholders if it pays more for the shares it buys than their intrinsic value, but many companies (and investors) are fooled by the familiar boast that buybacks are accretive to EPS. In an age where the alternative use of cash often generates little income because interest rates are close to zero, almost any alternative is accretive to EPS, but it does not necessarily create value. I found a five-year plan for significant share buybacks particularly disturbing. How can the management possibly know whether the shares will trade sufficiently below intrinsic value to create value-enhancing buyback opportunities on such a scale and so far ahead? One other feature of IBM struck me in 2010, when my Fundsmith colleagues and I were reading the company’s 2009 annual report. We noticed that it had a $1.9bn error in its cash flow statement. We rang IBM to check that we were not misinterpreting it, and they confirmed we were correct and that we were the only people who had asked about it. Maybe others had discovered it and didn’t bother to call, but I suspect the reality is that very few investors or analysts read annual reports and 10-K filings any more. The error was corrected in the 2010 annual report and did not materially affect my view of IBM, but it certainly affected… ([Location 2255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2255))

- A big reason for this disappointment lies in what makes up these indices. The largest companies, which dominate the EM index, are Asian consumer electronics companies, Chinese banks and internet companies, phone companies and Russian energy companies. I would regard all of these companies as uninvestable. In the case of the banks in particular, their risk exposure is opaque. I wouldn’t invest in a bank in the UK, so what would possess anyone to trust the accounts of a Chinese bank? Yet the largest sector by far in the EM index, representing over a quarter of it, is financials. The companies that I would regard as most investable are consumer staples. These represent just 8% of the EM index. So it is no surprise to me that the EM index, its tracker funds and the closet trackers among the active funds who secretly track it too have performed badly.

- Ally this to the consistent high returns on capital that many consumer companies are able to sustain and you have an investment strategy with the potential for superior returns. Consumer staples companies generate those returns as their combination of brands, pricing power, distribution and control of their supply chain helps fend off competition. A strategy of investing in consumer staples companies with the bulk of their operations in developing markets has substantially outperformed the other emerging markets investment strategies that I reviewed in my previous article, over the past five to ten years. Of course, the past is an imperfect guide to the future but it would be unwise to ignore the rapid and predictable growth in consumption of everyday necessities and luxuries when considering investment in emerging markets.

- This is not the first such chart that I have come across in which a company reports steadily rising earnings per share (EPS), on which most analysts and “investors” focus. For them, the rise in EPS seems to have a mesmeric effect like Kaa, the snake in The Jungle Book. But they ignore the point that more capital is being employed to generate those earnings at ever lower returns. Add in the fact that Tesco has changed its definition of return on capital employed (ROCE) eight times during those years, and there’s more than enough material to send investors running for cover – even those who have less aversion than I do to retailers.

- Even if return on capital employed does not have the same importance for you as it does for me, or the Sage (at least in 1979), consider this: in 14 of the past 18 years (taking us back to 1997 when Sir Terry became chief executive), Tesco’s free cash flow less its dividend (with free cash defined as operating cash flow less gross capital expenditure) was a negative number. In plain English, Tesco was not generating enough cash both to invest and to pay its dividend. In half of those 14 years, the proceeds of fixed asset disposals took the numbers back into the black, but that is not exactly a sustainable source of financing. So guess what they did instead? Yes, they borrowed it. Tesco’s gross debt, which was £894m when Sir Terry took over, peaked at nearly £15.9bn in 2009. The company spent much of its free cash on fixed asset investment and raised debt to help pay the dividend. This is neither healthy nor sustainable, as investors in Tesco have now come to realise. The concept that this might not be sustainable hardly requires much thought. Neither does charting the ROCE versus the growth in EPS. Yet it is evident that many investors, including it seems the Sage of Omaha (who has been trimming his Tesco stake in recent years) either didn’t do this or ignored the results if they did. It makes me wonder what else they are ignoring. ([Location 2427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2427))

- This brings me to the subject of fund names. You may be familiar with the concept of the circle of competence, often quoted by the great investor Warren Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger. The idea is that you are only likely to succeed in investing if you stick to investing in things which you understand, which seems intuitively obvious but is often disregarded by many investors. Names of funds are often a clue to the fact that you may not understand what they do (or perhaps aren’t meant to). I am spoilt for choice with regard to examples, but I wonder what investors in the “SocGen UK Step Down Defensive Kick-out Plan” think they own, for example. Many fund names also send warning signals by breaching Smith’s Law, which states that you should never use a phrase if its opposite is so illogical that you would never say it. For example, you may find individuals who refer to “forward planning”. Has anyone ever done any backward planning? At best, forward planning is tautology. How many companies say they will grow by means of “selective acquisitions”? Of course, none would say they have a policy of indiscriminate acquisitions (even though that is surely the reality in some cases). What are we to make of the Sanlam Global Best Ideas Fund? Would anyone ever market a Worst Ideas Fund? If I were an investor with the group I might be concerned about what I was getting in any of their other funds. How about Pimco’s Fundamental Advantage Fund? Would the fees perhaps be lower to attract investors into a Fundamental Disadvantage Fund?

- This seems like a good week to explain why I don’t own bank shares. Although it is seven years since the onset of the financial crisis, around 24–25 banks in Europe still have insufficient capital, according to the latest European Central Bank “stress tests”. I’ve often been asked why I won’t invest in bank shares given that I was once the top-rated banking analyst in the City. The answer is that having an understanding of banks would make anyone more wary of investing in them. One of my basic tenets is never to invest in a business which requires leverage or borrowing to make an adequate return on equity. Most of the companies that we invest in at Fundsmith have some borrowing. But they do not require it in order to survive, and they make decent returns before the use of debt, rather than making small returns on their assets and then financing most of those assets with debt. Banks rely on leverage to a greater extent than any other business. A 5% equity to assets ratio for a bank is leverage of 19 in debt to 1 of equity. The good news about such high leverage is that when something goes wrong, at least you go bust quickly. ([Location 2480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2480))

- Someone working in the bank’s treasury department may have altered all those exposures with a phone call or the click of a mouse and there is no way for investors to know. Judging by the events of the financial crisis, it is clear that a fair few bank managements were in the dark too. All of which leads me to suggest that if you are going to own any bank shares, they should be in retail banks which simply take deposits, lend money to their own customers and make payments for them. Such banks do exist and if I had to invest in a bank, that would be where I would look. But even those institutions are not immune to the threat which can arise from so-called systemic risk. They can be brought down by a run caused not by their own misjudgements, but by those of other banks in the system. The fragility of banks is illustrated by a story from the 1980s, when there was a wave of nervousness in Hong Kong following the signing of the joint declaration regarding the colony’s handover to China. Property prices began to collapse and banks ran up bad debts as a result. During this febrile period, a queue of people waited for a bus. It started to rain, and the queue moved across the pavement to shelter under the cover of a canopy on a building, which happened to house a branch of a local family-controlled bank. Passers-by, seeing the queue, concluded that there was a problem with the bank. Rumours of a run spread rapidly and by the following day, the bank was besieged by depositors demanding to withdraw their savings.

- We are often asked what our view is of the economic outlook for the world and how our fund is positioned to take advantage of, or cope with, those conditions. Our investment approach is thankfully not based upon our view of the global economic outlook. I say thankfully because we do not profess any great expertise in this area, and we are not particularly optimistic. This is in contrast to many others in the industry who certainly profess to such expertise, often it seems without any obvious justification. We are at least one step ahead of most of them in recognising that we do not know what will happen. ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2681))

- What does this table demonstrate? Taking each of the measures in turn: Return on capital employed: The legendary investor Warren Buffett in his 1979 annual letter as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway described ROCE as ‘The primary test of managerial economic performance’. In our “company” it was 29% versus an average of 18% for the market. For every pound of capital which we own, our companies produce 29p of profits versus 18p for the market. Gross margin: The difference between sales revenue and cost of goods sold for our company was 60% versus about 40% for the market. Our company makes things for £4 and sells them for £10. The market makes things which cost £6 and sells them for £10. Operating profit margin: Our company’s operating profit margin is 25% versus an average of 16% for the market. Cash conversion: Our company converts just over 100p out of every £1 of profit into cash, whereas the market manages about 80p as its businesses require more capital expenditure and working capital to function. Leverage: Our company has net debt (net of cash) of about a quarter of shareholders’ funds whereas the market has around 40%. Interest cover: Our company’s profits are 15 times its interest charge, which means there is little doubt that it can service its debt even in a dramatic downturn. The market looks quite safe, too, but its interest cover is below ten times. In short, our “company” has much better financial performance than the market as a whole and is more conservatively funded. So when it comes to quality we are confident that we have selected good companies, but one of the questions which most frequently arises when we are talking to investors is that of valuation. The companies we invest in may be high-quality businesses, but perhaps their shares have become too expensive. There is no doubt that the shares in our portfolio have become more highly rated over the past four years. It is also true that this is not the way we would prefer the performance of the portfolio to be delivered, as increases in the multiples which company shares trade on are finite and reversible. But there is no certainty that such improvements in valuation will reverse any time soon or indeed that they won’t continue. We remain unimpressed by those who tell us about their concerns about valuation and who have been doing so for several years. No doubt they may prove to be right at some point but following their advice would have been very expensive in the interim. We do not attempt to make any so-called “market timing” judgements. We aim to have our fund fully invested in companies of the sort we like, thereby acknowledging that we do not possess any expertise in guessing the right moment or even the right year in which to invest or to sell. In this we seem to have an advantage over those investors who think they can accomplish this, exemplified in my mind by at least one investor who refused to invest with us at the launch of our fund because he thought our timing was… ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2732))

We took the view that the e-cigarette development, whilst not necessarily harmful to the cigarette companies, was a potentially disruptive change which could adversely impact its Snus smokeless product. We are sensitive to the possibility of permanent loss of value which disruptive change can cause and on the whole we seek to avoid investing in companies which could be affected by it.

- As an investor you will probably have encountered two terms which have the word “shareholder” in common: shareholder value and activist shareholder. Just before the end of last year we were contacted by an activist investor who has a stake in one of our portfolio companies to discuss a set of proposals. They basically amounted to a demand that the company should seek to sell itself to one of its competitors to ‘create additional shareholder value’. This set me thinking again about the nature of shareholder value, and indeed activism. In this and a subsequent article, I’ll attempt to explain what I think these terms really mean and how they fit into the world of investment. Company managers, fund managers and activist investors often say they are committed to generating or releasing shareholder value without ever spelling out precisely what that means. For me, it is simply determining whether or not a company is creating additional wealth for its ultimate owners, and whether its managers are acting appropriately to achieve this. I’m not sure this is everyone’s definition, though. Latterly, I have come to wonder whether this concept has come to be misused, like so many others in finance. Put simply, my definition of value creation is when a company delivers returns that are above the cost of the capital used to generate them. Companies are in essence just like us. If you borrow money at a cost of 10% a year and invest it at a return of 5% a year, you will become poorer. If you invest it at a return of 20% a year, you will become richer. Similarly, companies which consistently make returns above their cost of capital become more valuable and vice versa. A company that can sustain a return on capital above its cost of capital creates value for its shareholders, who should want it to retain at least part of its profits to reinvest at these attractive rates of return rather than handing them all ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2855))

- over as dividends or using them to buy back shares. I define returns as the “return on capital employed” or ROCE. That is fairly easily determined from company accounts; it’s basically operating cash flow divided by the sum of shareholders’ equity and net debt. Determining what the cost of capital is for a company is rather more difficult. If you borrow money at a cost of 10% in order to invest, then your cost of capital is fairly clear. A company’s cost of debt capital is equally clear and can often be found in, or calculated from, the notes to its accounts. But what about the cost of its equity? The commonest way of estimating this uses the so-called capital asset pricing model, often snappily known as “Cap-M” after its acronym. This defines the cost of equity capital as a risk-free rate, usually taken as the yield on government bonds in the same currency as the company, plus a risk premium. This premium is observed over time from the actual return that equities deliver relative to the bonds that form the risk-free rate. If I haven’t lost your attention with that last paragraph, I’d be amazed. And therein lies one of the problems: a company’s cost of capital is not easy to define and can only ever be an estimate. These problems have been compounded more recently because of the financial crisis. This has led some investors to query whether government bonds are truly risk-free, while ultra-low official interest rates, quantitative easing and a lack of inflation have sent bond yields down to record lows and even into negative territory. Perhaps because cost of capital is not straightforward to define or compute, the most commonly accepted means of measuring value creation is growth in earnings per share (EPS), which is just the profits net of tax divided by the number of shares in issue. What could be simpler to calculate? Not much – which is probably why so much importance is attached to this simplistic measure of performance and its related valuation metric, the price/earnings ratio. Look through any analyst’s research and you’ll find dozens of references to them, often on the front page. Simple they may be, but EPS and PE ratios suffer from some serious flaws. The most important is that they take no account of the capital employed or the returns made on it. As the Tesco example… ([Location 2871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2871))

- In the first article of this two-part series I explained how I define the term shareholder value: whether or not a company is able to generate a sustained return on capital employed (ROCE) above its cost of capital. This time I want to link that definition with shareholder activism. When an activist shareholder becomes involved in a company, the modus operandi is often something like this: Acquire a stake in the company, usually via on-market purchases. Campaign noisily for change, which can entail the company trying to sell itself to an acquirer, splitting itself into a number of listed entities for each of its activities, taking on more debt, buying back its own shares, or some combination of these. The share price rises as a result of excitement about this activity, which it is claimed will “create shareholder value” and benefit all investors. Sell the shares at a profit. Nothing wrong with that, you might think, and certainly not from the point of view of the activist. But there is plenty wrong for those of us who are long-term investors and actually want to own the shares to gain from their ability to compound in value over time. We are often left trying to make sense of fragmented businesses, new management teams, higher leverage, the costs of separation or integration and financial statements which are rendered incomprehensible by many adjustments. This… ([Location 2898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2898))

- You might conclude from this that the main target of my criticism is activists who pursue corporate action to promote short-term share price gains. But there are plenty of pitfalls for exponents of shareholder value, including those who embrace my own view on how to measure its creation. Too often, the measures of shareholder value creation become the objectives of management. ROCE is after all only a financial ratio. In order to improve it, executives focus on getting the numerator to rise or reducing the denominator, or both. The numerator is usually taken as operating profit, which may be increased by raising prices (which may lose market share and build a platform for competitors), cutting costs (which is not a likely source of growth), and cutting research, product development and marketing spend (to the long-term detriment of the company). When it comes to the denominator, managers usually look to reduce the capital employed by “de-equitising” the business, using debt to buy back shares. But if the pursuit of improving shareholder value in the form of high ROCE can lead to problems, they are nothing compared to those which can arise when growth in earnings per share is the target. A fixation on earnings per share (EPS) is one factor behind the mania which has developed for share buybacks. In an era of zero interest rates, every buyback which reduces cash or increases debt can be claimed to be “accretive to EPS”. Sadly, it doesn’t actually make the shrunken share base any more valuable. When it comes to misconceived actions which aim to boost shareholder value metrics, Stanley Druckenmiller, the legendary hedge fund manager, has described IBM as a ‘poster child’. Last year, IBM abandoned its 2015 EPS target of $20 per share, having made only $10.76 in the first three quarters of 2014. The computer services business had delivered its “IBM 2015 Roadmap” in May 2010, purporting to show how IBM would increase its 2010 EPS of $11.52 per share to $20 by 2015. Quite why any other investor should be impressed with this goal, even if IBM could achieve it, is beyond me. As I never tire of reminding people, EPS takes no account of the capital required to generate it, or the return on that capital. The IBM ‘roadmap’ described a… ([Location 2914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=2914))

- People often say to us: “Oh, you try to pick winners.” The reality is that we don’t seek to predict who will win, but rather to bet on a company that has already won. To explain what we seek to do, I would turn to the world of horse racing. As a professional gambler, Alex Bird made a fortune betting on photo finishes. You can read about it in his autobiography, Alex Bird: The Life and Secrets of a Professional Punter. In Bird’s day, photo finishes were not digital and it took several minutes to develop the film and view the outcome, during which time bookmakers continued laying odds on the outcome. Bird realised that they were breaking one of the fundamental rules of bookmaking – never make odds on an event that has already occurred, as someone who knows the outcome can take you to the cleaners. Allegedly, bookmakers in the vicinity of St James’s Palace learnt this the hard way when they laid odds on the name of royal babies while the Queen Mother, who liked a bet, was still alive. Bird noticed that when horses crossed the line together, the horse on the far side often appeared to have won. What he had figured out was “parallax”: the difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight. He discovered a simple technique to exploit this. By standing as near to the winning post as possible, closing one eye and creating an imaginary line across the track at the finishing line, he could tell which horse had actually won. Using this simple system for the next 20 years he made himself a fortune, with a reported 500 consecutive successful bets. This can happen in the financial world. When Warren Buffett announced that after a career investing only in the US he had bought a British share for the first time, the bookmakers made odds on which share it was. This was dangerous given that a number of intermediaries, such as Berkshire Hathaway’s brokers, already knew. What has all this got to do with investment? At Fundsmith we do not seek to pick winners in the sense that most punters do, which is studying form, viewing the horses in the ring and then betting. We seek to emulate Alex Bird – we wait until we know who has won and then wait for the bookmakers to offer us odds against them winning. In our case, these are not bookmakers in the sense of a racecourse; we are talking about the market mispricing shares. There are some companies where we do not need to speculate on whether they have won in the sense of being successful and dominating certain product categories. Nestlé is the world’s largest food and beverage company and has been in business for 148 years with only one loss. Colgate-Palmolive has 45% of the world market for toothpaste and 35% for toothbrushes. It is also the leader in liquid soap and third in pet food. We simply need to wait until the market misprices these shares in order to get our chance to bet on a certain winner. This can happen for many reasons, for example when a panic occurs such as the… ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3039))

- Investors can learn a lot from the world of sport. Last week I looked at how the professional punter Alex Bird made a fortune betting on horse races after the race was over. The moral of his story: don’t try to predict which horse will win, but find a way to bet on the horse that has already won. An important element of success in sports, and in investment, is narrowing the chance of success. Another good example comes from football. Research by the United States Sports Academy found that more than 90% of goals in the matches studied were scored from inside the penalty area. Faced with these statistics, any sensible player would stop shooting from outside the area. How does this apply to the world of investment? Many investors spend their time trying to predict the next big winner in a sector, particularly in technology, despite the difficulty of forecasting developments in this area. The following table shows the top ten software companies from just over 30 years ago. All bar one have more or less ceased to exist. Clearly trying to predict a long-term winner in the software sector is extremely difficult, even if you start with those that are already leading. What must the odds be like if you are backing start-ups and early-stage investments? ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3075))

- ‘It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,’ Warren Buffett once said. I agree with Mr Buffett’s description of a good company. To quote from his 1979 annual chairman’s letter: ‘The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share.’ What Mr Buffett is describing is return on equity capital and despite this guidance more than 35 years ago from one of the world’s most successful investors, his advice continues to be ignored by most. One of the objections levelled at investors who attempt to invest along the lines which Mr Buffett suggested – and I would count myself as one of them – is that the sort of companies with these characteristics may be too expensive. This concern has reached fever pitch recently, with myriad warnings about what will happen to so-called “bond proxies” when US interest rates rise. A “bond proxy” is shorthand to describe equities such as consumer staples and utilities with safe, predictable returns, but have higher yields than much of the bond market (and, crucially, yields which can grow over time). Bond markets have experienced a bull run since the financial crisis and the onset of quantitative easing, which has seen central banks pump billions into buying their own governments’ bonds, and a disinflationary environment which has led to the sister policy of zero interest rates. Faced with seemingly ever-lower yields, investors have crowded into equities in general and especially those which are considered “bond proxies”. The obvious problem is what happens if – or when – interest rates rise. Bond yields then rise and those equities which have been used as bond proxies will surely fare badly. I would suggest a slightly less simplistic approach. Let’s start with the assumption that interest rates will rise. Eventually that must be true, but when and by how much is less easy to predict. The “when” has some bearing on the matter. There are a number of fine fund managers who have had their performance shredded by attempting to time this and other events. The “how much” also matters. In my view, we remain in a disinflationary environment with a mostly weak economic recovery, so the rise when it… ([Location 3133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3133))

- Investors have learnt that dividends are an important contributor to equity performance over the long term. But as with many concepts in finance, it is necessary to understand the concept fully and I doubt that many do. Investors often quote evidence such as that from Jack Bogle, the father of index funds and one of my investment heroes, about the importance of dividends. He said: ‘An investment of $10,000 in the S&P 500 Index at its 1926 inception with all dividends reinvested would by the end of September 2007 have grown to approximately $33.1m (10.4% compounded). If dividends had not been reinvested, the value of that investment would have been just over $1.2m (6.1% compounded) – an amazing gap of $32m. ‘Over the past 81 years, then, reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95% of the compound long-term return earned by the companies in the S&P 500.’ There you have it – dividends are more important than share price appreciation. Right? Sadly, it’s not as simple as that. Note that Mr Bogle uses the word “reinvestment” no fewer than three times. It is this reinvestment and the return on it that accounted for almost all of stocks’ long-term total return. You do not achieve this result if you invest in equities and take the dividend and spend it. The critical feature that Mr Bogle alighted upon is the benefit from reinvesting the dividends in equities. While this does make a dramatic difference to the outcome, it does not prove that income funds or high-yielding equities are likely to deliver a superior return. You would have had a better result than in Mr Bogle’s example if you had invested dividends not in the whole index, but in companies that delivered a return superior to the index; and/or if instead of paying a dividend the companies had simply retained all the earnings and reinvested them, assuming they could deploy the additional cash at an adequate rate of return. This is illustrated by the performance of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which has never paid a dividend during the 50 years he has run it. Mr Buffett correctly concluded that if the rate of return he could obtain by reinvesting funds at Berkshire was higher than the rate of return on the S&P 500 Index, it would produce a better performance for investors if he retained all the earnings and reinvested them. You might think you could get the same result if Berkshire paid a dividend and you reinvested it. Not if you pay income tax on your investment income, as you would only have the amount of the dividend net of tax to reinvest. So it is not the dividend that is important, or even just the reinvestment of the dividend, but rather it is the rate of return on reinvestment of the dividend that drives the return.

- Understanding of this subject might not be assisted by the plethora of research available online that basically asserts “dividend-paying stocks outperform non-dividend payers”. Just try typing those words into a search engine and see how many links you get. This statement is a classic example of statistical analysis that finds a correlation without proving cause and effect. I am told you can find a correlation between the sightings of storks and the number of births, but it does not mean one leads to the other. Similarly, the observation that dividend payers tend to outperform non-dividend-paying equities does not explain the factors which cause this. Understanding those factors is vital to avoid fundamental errors. There are two types of company into which non-dividend payers might be divided: those that cannot pay a dividend as they do not have the profits and/or cash flows from which to do so – these are start-ups and companies in some distress; and companies that have the capability to pay a dividend, but choose not to and reinvest the whole of their earnings and cash flow to expand the business. There is clearly a massive gulf in quality between these two groups, yet research often simply lumps them both together as “non-dividend payers”. They include companies such as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. I wonder what the result would be if you compared the performance of dividend payers with those non-dividend payers that are capable of paying a dividend, but choose not to? After all, where management is behaving in a logical manner and retaining all the earnings because they are capable of earning a superior investment return, like Mr Buffett did, they will outperform a company in the same situation that pays a dividend. Nor is Berkshire an isolated example. There is also an intermediate class of companies that pay a dividend, but retain most of their earnings for reinvestment. In most cases this means they are unlikely to qualify as high yielders and find their way into income funds. But if this distribution policy is driven by reinvestment opportunities to earn high returns within their business, they are likely to be good performers as investments. The chart here illustrates this. It shows the return to investors from investment in three companies based on the following: Company A makes a 20% return on capital. It pays no dividend and reinvests 100% of its profits. Company B also makes a 20% return on capital. It reinvests 70% of its profits – the other 30% is distributed as a dividend to investors who spend it, or at least do not reinvest it. Company C reinvests 100% of its profits, but makes only a 10% return on capital. The vertical axis shows the resulting net asset value (NAV) of the companies plus the amount of the dividends, if any, received by the investors.

- The chart illustrates the point that it is the rate of return you make on the reinvested earnings or dividend that makes the most difference, as A and B outperform C. It also makes the case that you do not perform as well if you either spend the dividend or do not reinvest it. You might argue that NAV is not the best indicator of the performance for investors – what about the share price? I agree, but I would suggest that A and B will obtain a higher “share price to NAV” ratio than C, as the market will value their higher returns, and that A would be more highly rated than B because it invested more of its earnings at the high rate of return. So £1 reinvested by A or B is likely to be far more valuable in stock market terms than £1 reinvested by C. You might also argue that the relative valuation at which you – or your fund manager – could buy each of these shares would affect the outcome. This is true, but if you are a long-term investor it has less of an effect than the rate of return the companies can generate. This was covered in a previous column, “Bond proxies: can you afford not to own them?” on page 108. Turning to individual investors’ behaviour, it seems the desperate search for yield and the popularity of income funds is in part driven by a view, which many investors seem to hold, that they can only safely spend the income from their portfolio. This view seems particularly prevalent among retirees, for whom this is the sole source of income. This thinking is what attracts investors to income funds and high-yield equities. While it might seem commendably prudent, it is erroneous and can lead to the assumption of risks associated with high-yield investment.

- What investors should be doing is seeking to maximise their total return. Maximising total return over the long term relies upon investing in companies that can generate a high return on capital and retain some or all of their earnings to reinvest at that high rate of return. Such companies are unlikely to feature heavily in true income funds. If the resulting yield is too low to fund investors’ spending requirements, the solution is simply to redeem some of the capital sum. I realise that what I have just said may sound like sacrilege to many investors. But what they fail to realise is that providing you leave at least enough of your gains invested to allow capital to keep pace with inflation, you are not behaving imprudently, assuming savings were adequate to begin with. The suggestion also has the merit of tax… ([Location 3271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3271))

- In August 1992, my book Accounting for Growth was published. It exposed how companies used accounting trickery to flatter their reported performance. Nowadays, there are brokers such as Muddy Waters and Iceberg who specialise in revealing these practices, but in 1992 such research was most unusual so it caused quite a stir. My then-employer tried to stop its publication, which of course only made people want to read it, sending it to the top of the nonfiction charts. I was fired, which sent my career off in a more entrepreneurial direction, and several of the companies named in the book got into serious difficulty or simply went bust. A second edition was published in 1996 and I’ve often been asked to reprise the subject with another book. One of the reasons I haven’t is that publication of the book roughly coincided with the start of a successful campaign by the Accounting Standards Board, led by Sir David Tweedie, to stamp out many of the abuses in company accounting. Another is that I am not sure many investors or analysts study company accounts any longer. Instead, they seem to rely upon management presentations using “adjusted”, “core” or “underlying” earnings or profits. One sector in which my Fundsmith Equity Fund does not own any stocks is pharmaceuticals. This seems to surprise some commentators, who think that drug companies would represent exactly the sort of dependable returns we seek. After all, such stocks benefit from seemingly inexorable growth in demand for healthcare, especially among the ageing populations of the developed world, and margins that are shielded from competition by patents. One reason we don’t own them is that the sector has become rated on the basis of “underlying” earnings. Beginning in about 2010, many major pharmaceutical companies started a switch to reporting what they term “core” earnings. This switch was allegedly to smooth out exceptional items from reported earnings and make trends more recognisable. So what is excluded from earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to get to “core” earnings? Restructuring costs, although they seem to be a recurring item in the accounts of a number of companies. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, has not had a quarter without any since 2008. “Exceptional” legal charges. Once again, given the nature of the industry involving patents, patent disputes,… ([Location 3283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3283))

- Similarly, it is hard to make a good return over the long term by investing in poor-quality or even average businesses. I am not suggesting that investing in high-quality companies is the only way to make money. However, investing in poor-quality companies has a couple of disadvantages. One is that you are continually faced with the problems of timing and the headwind of their value destruction. If investors have any coherent reason for such investments, they usually are diversification and/or the belief they can buy them when their fortunes and share prices are depressed and about to improve, and sell them close to or preferably just before they turn down. Taking the diversification point first, I am also surprised how many investors assume that it is better to be diversified across low-quality investments than to be concentrated in high-quality ones.

- Our best share was Domino’s Pizza Inc, with a return of over 600% from the initial stake purchased on the day the fund opened. What might we learn from this? People often assume that for an investment to make a high return it must be esoteric, obscure, difficult to understand and undiscovered by other investors. On the contrary – the best investments are often the most obvious. Run your winners. Too often investors talk about “taking a profit”. If you have a profit on an investment it might be an indication that you own a share in a business which is worth holding on to. Conversely, we are all prone to run our losers, hoping they will get back to what we paid for them. Gardeners nurture flowers and pull up weeds, not the other way around. Domino’s is a franchiser. If you regard a high return on capital as the most important sign of a good business, few are better than businesses which operate through franchises, as most of the capital is supplied by them. The franchiser gets a royalty from revenues generated by other people’s capital. Domino’s has focused on the most important item for success in its sector – the food. This is in sharp contrast to other fast-food providers like McDonald’s which are struggling. Domino’s is mostly a delivery business. This means that it can operate from cheaper premises in secondary locations, and so cut the capital required to operate compared with fast-food operators who need high street restaurant premises. Domino’s was owned by Bain Capital. Like a lot of private equity firms, Bain leveraged up the business by taking on debt to pay themselves a dividend before IPO, so it started life as a public company with high leverage. This can enhance equity returns. In a business which can service the debt there is a transfer of value to the equity holders as the debt is paid down and the equity is de-risked. Please note – this does not indicate that leverage always enhances returns. ([Location 3471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3471))

- Switching into cyclical stocks in anticipation of a rise in interest rates, what could possibly go wrong? As ever, spotting potential problems with our or any other investment strategy is not that difficult. In all my years in business I have never found that identifying a problem is quite as difficult as solving it. Likewise, suggesting what it is you should switch into that is immune from problems which may result from an interest rate rise is a bit more difficult. However, it seems likely that sooner or later the “stopped clock” commentators will prove to be right and our fund will experience a period of underperformance. What to do about that? You could try some market timing and redeem your shares in the fund in advance of this event and maybe re-invest later when you think the time is right for it to begin outperforming again. If you do so I hope you have better luck and/or skill than I have because I know that I can’t accomplish that successfully. If you intend to remain invested in the fund, as I do, including through any periods of underperformance, you might also, like me, take comfort in the fact that our investment strategy is based first and foremost on buying shares in good companies. We cannot promise you much about our fund. But one thing we are clear about is that we seek to own shares in good companies and at least most of the time we succeed in that objective.

- What does this table demonstrate? In short, that our companies have much better financial performance than the market as a whole and are more conservatively funded. The companies in our portfolio are certainly not immune to periodic downturns in business and/or management errors, and their share prices are subject to the usual factors which affect the stock market, but we can at least be reasonably sure that they are adding to their intrinsic value over time by continuing to invest at wonderful rates of return. If I gave you an exhaustive list of all the subjects in investment – and the ways in which investors and commentators behave – that perplex me, this annual letter would be considerably longer. However, one of these subjects is the obsession with share prices. Ultimately, of course, a focus on share price movements must be correct. It is no use owning shares in good companies if the strength of their business is never reflected in the share price, but a continuous focus on share price movements to the exclusion of the underlying fundamental economics of the companies is neither healthy nor useful. In the long term one will follow the other, and it is not the fundamentals which will follow the share price. Returning to the subject of valuation, what are the facts as opposed to commentators’ views? The weighted average free cash flow (FCF) yield of the portfolio (the free cash flow generated by the companies divided by their market value) started the year at 4.5%* and ended it at 4.3%* so the overall portfolio saw little increase in valuation in 2015. Our companies on average grew their free cash flow per share by 9.7%* during the year, which was a much more significant contribution to performance.

- If you do one thing with your money in 2016 it should be this: buy an investment you can forget about. The saying “cobblers’ children have no shoes” exemplifies the tendency for professionals to concentrate on their work and neglect their own needs – even in their own area of speciality. Investment professionals are not exempt from this tendency. But if you don’t have the time or inclination to manage your investments every day or even every week or month, then surely the best option is to adopt an investment strategy which can prosper as a result of this apparent neglect. I say apparent neglect because, combined with the right investment strategy, such inactivity is a virtue as it cuts dealing costs, a significant drag on investment performance.

- But don’t take my word for it. Here’s what Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett’s business partner, said on the subject in a speech entitled “A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as it Relates to Investment Management and Business”: ‘Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 ([Location 3708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3708))

- years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return – even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.’ Mr Munger was not guessing or putting forward a theory. He was stating a fact. If you are a long-term investor, the return on capital which a company can generate, and its ability to reinvest at a superior rate of return, is more likely to determine how well its shares do – and not the valuation at which you buy or sell it. Or as his partner Warren Buffett once said more pithily, ‘It’s better to buy a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price.’ However, most people are incapable of behaving as long-term investors either for behavioural reasons and/or because they have the “benefit” of advisers who see their raison d’être and fees as driven by activity. The arithmetic is inexorable – high rates of return on capital can compensate for seemingly high valuations, whereas low-return companies are not worthwhile for the long-term investor almost irrespective of how lowly the shares are rated. The strategy of most investors who choose to invest in persistently low-return companies is usually some combination of buying them ahead of a perceived cyclical upturn in results or events, and/or waiting for the valuation and therefore the share price to improve. The problem – other than the fact that very few investors seem able to perform this successfully – is that even if you get it right, you then have to sell the shares and find a new investment that fits these criteria. Such shares should never be allowed to become long-term holds otherwise the share price returns will start to gravitate to the low return on capital the underlying business produces.

- Last week, I suggested that we might learn something about the outlook for so-called bond proxy stocks by studying the events of the Nifty Fifty era and its aftermath in the US. So what happened? The term refers to a period in the 1960s and 70s when 50 large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that were widely regarded as solid buy-and-hold growth stocks reached towering valuations. The stocks were often described as “one-decision”. They were viewed as extremely stable, even over long periods of time, so that only a decision to buy them was required as they never needed to be sold. Their most common characteristic was solid earnings growth, for which these stocks were assigned extraordinarily high price/earnings ratios (PE). Critics of the quality investment strategy cite the Nifty Fifty as evidence of the bad things that can happen to investors who ignore valuation. Drawing comparisons with bond proxy stocks today, they point to the subsequent underperformance of most of the Nifty Fifty list as a warning today’s investors should heed.

- events, I find that they more frequently rely upon urban myth rather than analysis. So let us examine the data. The first problem? There was never an official Nifty Fifty. Various lists of stocks published by Morgan Guaranty and Kidder Peabody have been taken as a proxy. The Morgan Guaranty List was cited by Malcolm Forbes Jr in a Forbes Magazine article in 1977 entitled “When Wall Street Becomes Enamored”. The Kidder Peabody list is actually from a monthly list published by Kidder of the stocks traded on the NYSE which had the highest PE ratios. A research paper then christened the 24 stocks which were found on both lists as the ‘Terrific 24’. However, whichever list you want to take, the average PE was somewhere between double and treble than that of the wider market: PE ratios, end of 1972 Stocks Average multiple Morgan Guaranty Nifty Fifty 45.2 Kidder Peabody Nifty Fifty 57.9 ‘Terrific 24’ 59.8 S&P 500 19.2 Source: Fundsmith research How this group of stocks came to be so highly valued is not clear. It wasn’t a typical market mania such as the 1920s excitement over mass production, or the dotcom era’s blind zeal over the promise of technology – though the Nifty Fifty lists were sprinkled with new technology stocks which have since proven to be costly disasters. (Eastman Kodak, Polaroid and Xerox are the most obvious examples.) What seems to have happened is that investor behaviour somewhat mirrored that of society as a whole. There was a kind of “Woodstock moment” as investors decided to throw away their old conservative dividend-paying stocks and move into so-called growth companies. This became self-fulfilling as an investment strategy whilst the performance lasted. One commentator concluded that it was a ‘change in the Zeitgeist of Wall Street’. The bursting of the bubble is rather simpler to explain. The S&P peaked on 5 January 1973 and then fell 48% over the next 22 months as inflation rose from 3.2% in 1972 to 11.8% by the beginning of 1975. Oil prices almost quadrupled after the Yom Kippur War, the 1973–75 recession began and the US became gripped by Watergate. Data are difficult to come by but the Nifty Fifty stocks held up somewhat longer than the market – although they eventually succumbed to the inevitable. That said, Coca-Cola’s share price peaked in January 1973 at the same time as the market peak and then fell 66% over the next 22… ([Location 3761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=3761))

- But the growth in index funds and ETFs has significant side effects. In an index fund or ETF, the weighting of stocks is based upon whatever criterion is used to compile the index, typically the market capitalisation of the companies. This means that as more money is invested via index funds or ETFs it is automatically routed via the fund into the companies in the relevant index based solely upon their market value. This can cause some major distortions, one of which we are almost certainly seeing recently in emerging markets. Funds flow into emerging markets has increased significantly in the past couple of years as investors have sought to capitalise on a recovery. However, all of this inflow and more has gone into emerging markets ETFs whilst money has actually been withdrawn from emerging market active funds as this chart shows: ([Location 4079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4079))

- It looks rather like the Jaws of Death, a term taken from shark-attack movies and military encounters such as the Charge of the Light Brigade. Increasing amounts of money are being allocated via this inflow into the largest companies in the emerging markets index, and they are not good companies. Last year the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the top ten constituent stocks of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index averaged just 12%. Of course, this is a single year and you might wonder whether it is representative. Looking back at the returns of the largest companies in the index for the past ten years or so shows a more or less continuous decline, particularly amongst the Chinese companies which seem to be investing on the basis that debt capital in particular for them is close to free. This is always a dangerous assumption, as the dotcom era and Japan in the late 1980s illustrated. Or maybe the shares which dominate the index are lowly rated, which more than compensates for their low returns? This does not seem to be the case, given the current price/earnings ratio of 28 times for the top ten largest constituents, versus 23 times for the MSCI index, unless their earnings are about to undergo a sharp recovery. However, this seems unlikely for a mixture of internet and e-commerce stocks, electronics manufacturers, Chinese banks and mobile telecoms companies. Many active managers bemoan the rise of index funds and ETFs as they say it makes their job more difficult. In the short term this is undoubtedly true. If money pours into markets via ETFs it will cause the shares of the largest companies in the index to perform well irrespective of their quality or value, or lack of it, even though active managers seeking quality and/or value will not want to own them. The weight of money flows will make it a self-fulfilling prophesy that the index will outperform the active managers who behave in this rational manner.

- Investment in stocks and shares – equities – has a unique advantage over other asset classes which in my experience is rarely understood and almost never discussed. Equities can compound in value in a way that investments in other asset classes, such as bonds and real estate, cannot. The reason for this is quite simple: companies retain a portion of the profits they generate to reinvest in the business. If you look at companies in the major indices, such as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100, you will find that on average companies pay out about half of their earnings in dividends. The earnings that are not paid out are invested in the business. No other asset class provides this. If you own bonds, you receive an interest payment but it is not automatically reinvested in the bonds. The only exception to this is so-called “payment in kind” bonds issued by highly leveraged companies, which provide the option for them to issue more bonds if they are unable to pay the cash coupon. So you get more bonds but only at a moment when the last thing you want is for your interest payment to be invested in more of this junk. Similarly, if you own real estate, you will receive rental income but none of it will be reinvested in property for you. As well as being a unique feature of equity investment, this can also be a valuable source of compounding in the value of your investments. For example, if you owned the average company in the S&P 500 it earned a return on equity capital employed of 13% last year. If it can retain half the earnings which are attributable to you as an investor, and it can continue to invest at its current rate of return as its business grows, that half should also earn 13%. What makes it even more attractive is… ([Location 4109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4109))

- value – at three times book value currently in the S&P – whereas each $1 of retained earnings gets reinvested at book value. It is the reinvestment of retained earnings, not dividends, which provide the majority of the growth in the value of equities. Of course, what is even more attractive is if instead of simply owning the index and seeing the companies reinvest your retained earnings at an average rate of return, you own only companies which can achieve a high return on capital and which can as a result manage to translate each $1 of retained earnings into a market value which is a much higher multiple of book value. If you follow this reasoning you would conclude that if a company is able to invest retained earnings at a high rate of return then the last thing you would want it to do is pay you a dividend. This is perhaps best illustrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which has not paid a dividend in over half a century. Of course, this needs to be pursued with care. There is a reasonably sound piece of economic theory called “mean reversion” which suggests that companies which generate high returns should attract competition which… ([Location 4127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4127))

Biggs found him useful to talk to because once the broker had given his views on what would happen or what to do, Biggs knew that the opposite was bound to be correct. For what it’s worth, my diagnosis of the problem for these commentators who seem to emulate this broker is that they are experiencing role confusion. They seem to have forgotten that their role is to report events accurately and have decided that instead they need to influence the outcome to one they desire. They also seem to have missed the point that voicing your views in an echo chamber is not likely to lead to a challenging debate in which to test your opinions.

- What seems to have happened over the past decade is a prolonged experiment in borrowing your way out of a debt problem. Maybe it will work, although I am amongst those who would bet against it, but it certainly is not the sort of circumstance which would suggest that a “normal” economic recovery or a rapid rise or “hike” in interest rates is likely. As an aside, I would suggest that the headlong expansion of credit in much of the Western world which preceded the financial crisis was an attempt to compensate for the effects of deflation. Instead of accepting that the loss of manufacturing and service jobs to the developing world meant we had to accept lower pay and lower standards of living to compete, we opted for an expansion of the state, the mushrooming of non-productive jobs and borrowing to maintain our spending patterns. Secondly, if you nonetheless take the view that our fund’s strategy has indeed delivered a good performance but that valuations (which I will come to later) for stocks of the sort it owns are high and that this will limit their share price performance at least in the near term, the obvious problem this poses is what you or we might invest in as an alternative.

- This presents several problems. One is that the valuation of the fund’s stocks are not all that much higher than the market, especially when their relative quality is taken into account. Of course, all this may prove is that everything is expensive or at least highly rated, and there are plenty of pundits and fund managers who have indeed suggested that we are in a bubble which will end badly with everything falling a long way. So far, they have only managed to demonstrate the difficulty in making predictions and implementing actions based upon them. Even if they are eventually proven right, why will a basket of cyclical stocks and financials prove to perform better in these circumstances than a group of companies which are high quality and defensive in terms of supplying everyday consumables and necessities? The events of 2007–09 suggest that the opposite is true. There is also the fact that the alternative of investing in cyclicals, financials and so-called “value” stocks involves investing in companies, which over time do not create shareholder value by generating returns on capital above their cost of capital and growing by deploying more capital at such favourable returns. We seek to invest in companies which accomplish this. Quoting Warren Buffett, the “Sage of Omaha” and arguably the best investor over the past 50 or so years, has in my view become somewhat passé. It is frequently done by acolytes or imitators, many of whom seem to have done only the most cursory study of what he actually does, if anything at all. So instead I am going to quote his business partner and Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger: ‘Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return – even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.’ (Emphasis added.) I have no idea why Mr Munger chose those particular rates of return but what I do know is that he is not voicing an opinion. What he is describing is a mathematical certainty. If you invest for the long term in companies which can deliver high returns on capital, and which invest at least a significant portion of the cash flows they generate to earn similarly high returns, over time that has far more impact on the performance of the shares than the price you pay for them. Yet I have been asked far more frequently whether a share, a strategy or a fund is cheap or expensive than I am asked about what returns the companies involved deliver and whether they are good companies which create value or not.

- Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock is a frequent demand of activists and is invariably described as “returning cash to shareholders” and not only when it is suggested by activists. The correct description for this action should be “returning cash to exiting shareholders” as we remaining shareholders don’t receive any of it and this perhaps best encapsulates the problem we identify with this practice. Those of us who actually seek to own the company and remain shareholders see debt raised to take out shareholders who wish to exit. It is beyond us why we would want that to happen unless the shares purchased are demonstrably cheap. ([Location 4558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4558))

- There is a deeper problem. Your ESG/SRI fund manager may monitor your investments for the commonly collected statistics such as CO2 emissions, hazardous waste production, and the age and benefits of the labour force, but how many monitor fundamental business sustainability? Or how much a company spends on research & development? Or its capital expenditure? We have rarely found businesses that can prosper without renewing and expanding physical facilities. What return does a company get on its capital expenditure? If it is inadequate it will fail. There are virtually no examples of sustainable funds monitoring these real-world sustainability measures. Without them your sustainable investment will simply fail no matter how low its CO2 emissions. It is the investing equivalent of the hybrid car that rusts away. The results of this for investors are clear and not in a good way. The average five-year annualised return for ethical and sustainable equity funds in the Investment Association universe is 11.9%. The equivalent for the MSCI World Index is 15.5%. I would guess some investors may be willing to forgo performance in return for ensuring that their principles are adhered to. Given the lack of hard sector exclusions, though, they get the worst of both worlds – poor performance and a breach of their principles.

- As Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize for physics, said: ‘It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.’ What about asset allocation? The seminal research on this was published in 1986 by Brinson, Hood and Beebower (or “BHB” as they are known in the industry). Their study of large pension plans, entitled “Determinants of Portfolio Performance”, is often incorrectly cited as concluding that asset allocation was responsible for 91.5% of the portfolios’ returns. Unfortunately, that’s not what BHB’s paper said. What it concluded was that asset allocation was responsible for 91.5% of the variability in returns – not the returns themselves. However, this mistaken conclusion has led a large portion of the investment industry to focus almost exclusively on asset allocation. If you attend enough meetings with investment advisers you will surely hear that asset allocation is more important than choice of individual assets, such as which stocks to own in an equity portfolio.

- There appears to be something so alluring about dividend income that it often seems to lead investors to abandon common sense or be encouraged to do so by the investment industry. For example, how many times have you heard it said that the majority of returns from investment in equities comes from reinvestment of the dividends? This assertion is usually accompanied by charts which show the difference in returns from an index with the dividends paid out versus one where the dividends are reinvested. Unsurprisingly, the latter has a significantly higher return. But this is not the same as demonstrating that the majority of returns come from reinvested dividends. In fact, they come from retained profits. ([Location 4774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4774))

- Take the example of an average S&P 500 company. Currently it has a payout ratio of 52% – in other words, half its profits are distributed as dividends – a return on equity net of tax of 15% and its shares trade on a price to book (market value divided by book value) of 3.5×. So, which generates more value for shareholders – reinvestment of the dividend paid out, or the reinvestment of profits by the company? The first handicap of reinvested dividends is that dividends are taxable in the hands of most shareholders. The exact amount of tax payable will depend upon where the shareholder is resident and which tax band they are in. If you are in the UK and a higher-rate taxpayer, dividend income will be taxed at 32.5%, so you will only be left with 67.5 cents out of every dollar of dividend to reinvest. (I am using US dollars as I chose the S&P index for the example, but the principles are the same for the FTSE 100 and sterling.) Handicap number two is that you reinvest at the market price for the shares which, given the price to book is 3.5×, means that you will get to own just 28.5 cents (100 ÷ 3.5) of the company’s capital for every $1 you reinvest. For every $1 of dividend paid out you get 67.5 cents after tax, which buys you just 19 cents of the company’s capital (67.5 ÷ 3.5).

- That doesn’t sound like much of a bargain. In contrast, every $1 of retained income which also belongs to you as a shareholder suffers no additional tax and is reinvested in the company’s capital at book value, so you get 100 cents of capital for every $1 retained. As if that is not enough of a reason to prefer retained earnings to dividends, each $1 which is retained on your behalf is turned into $3.50 of market value because the company’s shares trade on 3.5× book.

- This is a feature of equities which no other asset class possesses. A portion of the returns that companies generate are retained and automatically reinvested on your behalf. This creates more value than you can ever capture by reinvesting dividends – except, of course, when the reinvestment is done badly, with management investing when returns are inadequate. It is not a feature of bonds or property assets. Investors receive interest or rent from these investments, but they are not reinvested for you. This advantage of equities is magnified if instead of investing in an average company you invest in a company with a higher than average rate of return on capital.

- However, a research paper by Hendrik Bessembinder published in the September edition of the Journal of Financial Economics posed the question “Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?” with some rather worrying conclusions for most equity investors. Prof Bessembinder examined the performance of all the common stocks listed on the NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq exchanges from 1926 to 2016 and found that only 47.8% of the monthly returns from these stocks were greater than for one-month US Treasury bills in the same month. When focusing on the stocks’ return over their full lifetime as quoted entities, up until the end of the period or delisting – essentially a buy-and-hold strategy for all stocks – he found that only 42.6% of stocks exceeded the return on one-month Treasury bills, even with dividends reinvested. The reason that equity index returns beat US Treasuries while most of the stocks in them do not is really quite simple. Large positive returns from a few stocks offset the modest or negative returns from the vast majority of stocks. In one sense this is not surprising. The study covers a 90-year period, but very few companies have long lives as quoted entities. In fact, during the period covered by the study, the median life was just 7.5 years. The rarer stocks which have been listed for longer have more time to compound in value and if they have been in existence as quoted companies for multiple decades the chances are it is because they are relatively successful businesses. Nonetheless, the degree of concentration of returns is still startling. Just five companies out of the universe of 25,967 in the study account for 10% of the total wealth creation over the 90 years, and just over 4% of the companies account for all of the wealth created. But does a 90-year study have much relevance to your actual investment experience? It is, after all, longer than the average life expectancy, let alone the average investing lifespan and covers a period which most investors probably regard as prehistoric. However, it would probably be wrong to dismiss the implications of the study for these reasons. The study also looks at returns decade by decade and reaches more or less the same conclusion: that the decade returns for most equities are lower than those earned by investment in Treasury bills. Moreover, the results have been getting worse for equity investors more… ([Location 4860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4860))

However, I would suggest that the background needs to be taken into account and not just how the market indices performed but also other active funds.

- I often use the term “value” in inverted commas for a number of reasons: What some people mean by value is lowly rated. A stock may be lowly rated but not good value if the (lack of) quality of its business and/or its prospects mean that its intrinsic or fundamental value is still below its lowly valuation. The distinction which many commentators make between growth or quality investing and value investing is in my view a somewhat superficial one. To quote Warren Buffett: ‘Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: “value” and “growth”. Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. ‘We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must ([Location 4990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=4990))

- be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.’ Most investment strategies require some regard for the valuation of the stocks purchased or held – even strategies like ours which focus on high-quality companies. The rate of growth of a company is a critical component of its valuation. As pointed out in point six above, most stocks are not currently at valuations which would attract classic value investors.

- Unlike our strategy – which is to seek such stocks and hold on to them, letting the returns which the company generates from this reinvestment produce good share price performance – value investing suffers from two handicaps. One is that whilst the value investor waits for the event(s) which will crystallise a rise in the share price to the intrinsic value that has been identified, the company is unlikely to be compounding in value in the same way as the stocks we seek. In fact, it is quite likely to be destroying value. Moreover, it is a much more active strategy. Even when the value investor succeeds in reaping gains from a rise in the share price to reflect the intrinsic value he identified, he or she needs to find a replacement value stock, and as events of the past few years have demonstrated, this is far from easy. Moreover, this activity has a transaction cost. Our strategy has the merit that inactivity is a benefit. If we have correctly identified the good companies whose stock can compound in value, we can hope to hold them indefinitely and still derive good investment performance from them with lower transaction costs.

- Of course, all that is in the past and the future for Facebook is likely to be different. When we started buying its shares we estimated that its revenue growth rate would halve to about 20% p.a. In the third quarter of 2018 they grew at 34% p.a., but the company has indicated that the growth rate would slow further to perhaps the mid 20% range in the fourth quarter, and the operating margin was down to a still impressive 42%. Against the background of the media furore over the use of personal data, this has been enough for some commentators on Facebook to experience very public attacks of the vapours. But bear in mind the following: The 42% operating margin in the third quarter which gave 13% profit growth was after a 53% increase in costs. You could look at this as a glass half full or empty, but in its third quarter Facebook increased R&D costs by 29%, marketing and sales costs by 65% and general and administrative costs by 76%. You might see such a rise in costs as problematic, but I suspect that faced with a furore Facebook’s management has decided to very publicly spend a lot of money on data security and content control and to improve users’ experience. In doing so it has, a) depressed Facebook’s results, albeit to a still very acceptable level – showing great results whilst under such scrutiny might be a red rag to a bull, and b) built an even bigger barrier to entry for competitors. Ironically the response to the furore may just have cemented Facebook’s competitive position. I also note that at the time of writing, Facebook’s new political advertising transparency tools show that the UK government spent £96,684 on Facebook ads promoting Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal. Political attacks on Facebook have the look of a circular firing squad. Similarly, Facebook’s capital expenditure doubled in the first nine months of 2018 to $9.6bn, yet free cash flow in the third quarter was still 16% higher than it was a year ago. Yet Facebook is on an historic PE of 19.7× – about the same as the S&P 500. Unless there is going to be a much more severe deterioration in Facebook’s operational performance than we have seen to date or reasonably expect, this looks cheap to us. Also consider the following: Facebook makes no money from its social network users. It makes most of its revenue from online advertising, a business in which it has a virtual duopoly with… ([Location 5162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=5162))

- This year I thought I would use the opportunity afforded by this letter to talk about our engagement with companies. We are often asked by investors whether we meet company management and how we engage with them. The answer is that we meet them a lot. We visit companies we wish to research and meet them physically or virtually at results meetings and industry conferences. We are often engaged by members of the board remuneration committee and we review and vote on all resolutions and proxy statements at general meetings. We do not employ any outside agency for this. However, meeting management is not our primary test of whether a business is of sufficient quality for us to invest. We think good businesses are identifiable from the numbers they produce. Nor do we meet management to give them our views on how to run the business. If they don’t know how to do so we are in serious trouble.

- But then most fund managers are not trying to do anything different: ‘Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally,’ said John Maynard Keynes, the famous economist who was also a successful fund manager. The majority of fund managers do not see the biggest threat to their career as underperforming their benchmark but in differing from that benchmark and their peers. As a result, they become “index huggers” who own enough shares in whatever market index is used for their performance benchmark to make sure their performance more or less matches it. But that of course is before fees and other costs such as dealing. The inevitable result is that the majority of active fund managers underperform the index. I agree with Warren Buffett and John Bogle (the founder of Vanguard, one of the world’s largest index fund providers) that most investors would be better served investing in a low-cost tracker fund which charges a lot less than the “active” managers who are simply index hugging.

- This year we have included the Sharpe and Sortino ratios for our fund and the index in the performance table. I realise that for those of you who are not investment professionals what I say next may well seem to be gobbledegook. However, whilst the returns which our fund provides are very important so is the amount of risk assumed in producing those returns. These ratios attempt to measure that. The Sharpe ratio takes the return on the fund, subtracts a so-called risk-free return (basically the return on government bonds) to get the excess return over the risk-free rate, and divides the resulting number by the variation in that excess return (measured by its standard deviation – I warned you it was gobbledegook). The result tells you what unit of return you get for a unit of risk and our fund has a Sharpe ratio of 1.22 since inception against 0.63 for the MSCI World Index – it is producing about twice the amount of return that the index produces for each unit of risk. The Sortino ratio is an adaption of the Sharpe ratio, and in my view an improvement. Whereas the Sharpe ratio estimates risk by the variability of returns, the Sortino ratio takes into account only downside variability as it is not clear why we should be concerned about upside volatility (i.e. when our fund goes up a lot) which mostly seems to be a cause for celebration. The result for our fund since inception is a Sortino ratio of 1.22 but the MSCI World Index Sortino ratio is lower than its Sharpe ratio at 0.59.

- Here’s how Buffett explained this change in his 1989 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: ‘[t]he original “bargain” price probably will not turn out to be such a steal after all. In a difficult business, no sooner is one problem solved than another surfaces – never is there just one cockroach in the kitchen. [Plus], any initial advantage you secure will be quickly eroded by the low return that the business earns. For example, if you buy a business for $8 million that can be sold or liquidated for $10 million and promptly take either course, you can realize a high return. But the investment will disappoint if the business is sold for $10 million in ten years and in the interim has annually earned and distributed only a few per cent on cost. Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.’ The problems of waiting for value investment to pay off can be seen in the performance of the MSCI World Value Index (USD) which hit 6570 at the end of October 2007 and was lower than this at the end of February 2016. At 31 December 2019 it stood at 9812, just 49% higher than its 2007 peak value. Compare and contrast the S&P 500 (USD) which peaked on 9 October 2007 but had regained its 2007 high by 2013 and at 31 December 2019 stood 189% higher. Ah, but I can hear the siren song of the value investors who will take this data as confirmation that the resurgence of value investment which they have long predicted is about to commence. As an old saying goes, “To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail”. The longer the strategy underperforms the market, and the more money it costs investors, the louder the siren song becomes. And sooner or later they will be right. But a) they have no idea when that will be (note the reference above to Investment Adviser’s comment in 2012); b) if you had followed their advice to date it would require a gargantuan reversal of performance to make up the gains forgone; and c) that may continue to be the case for some time to come. Lastly, there are some commentators who say that one way to address this is to have a portion of your portfolio invested in both strategies – some in quality growth and some in value. I think the assertion that there is no harm in this diversification approach has been disproved rather comprehensively by Warren Buffett, but what does he know? Perhaps we should look at the value investment versus quality and growth strategy debate this way: would you rather side with a) a large section of the UK financial press and rent-a-quote investment advisers; or b) Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger (Berkshire Hathaway), Bill Gates (Microsoft), the ([Location 5805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=5805))

- Bettencourt family (L’Oréal), the Brown family (Brown-Forman), the Walton family (Walmart) and Bernard Arnault (LVMH)? The latter all seem to have become extraordinarily rich by concentrating their investment in a single high-quality business and not trading regardless of valuation. So much for it not doing any harm to diversify across strategies. It seems impossible to comment upon developments in equity investing in the UK in 2019 without mentioning the word Woodford. The demise of Woodford Investment Management following the “gating” of its main LF Woodford Equity Income Fund was undoubtedly the main news in the industry last year. We have no desire to engage in a general commentary on this matter or to engage in an unseemly exercise in schadenfreude. We had long identified the problems which were brewing at Woodford but we kept our own counsel on the matter. The only comments you will find from us mentioning Woodford were in answer to direct questions concerning Woodford from our investors at our annual meeting. We regard it as a lack of professional courtesy to comment upon our competitors except when we are asked to do so by our investors. We only wish others in the industry would maintain the same stance.

- However, we now feel freer to comment on Woodford since it is hard to see how it can now exacerbate the situation, and I feel that we need to as the Woodford debacle has raised important questions about the industry, some of which have been directed at us and I feel that our investors should know our response. The most obvious problem at Woodford was the lethal combination of a daily-dealing open-ended fund with significant holdings in unquoted companies and large percentage stakes in small quoted companies which had very limited liquidity. Whilst this was clearly a very bad idea, Woodford is not the only fund to have encountered this problem. A large swathe of UK property funds was gated after the Brexit referendum for the same reason, and more recently so was the M&G Property Portfolio. An open-ended daily-dealing fund is clearly not an appropriate vehicle through which to hold such assets. The daily dealing and open-ended structure give investors the illusion of liquidity but when a large number of them try to exercise it at once the effect is similar to shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theatre. Amongst the causes which commentators seem to have failed to realise is the effect which the rise of investment platforms has had on this and other areas of the fund management industry. It is now the case that no one can expect to effectively market an open-ended fund on any of the major investment platforms which retail investors and wealth managers use to manage their investments unless it is a daily-dealing fund. As none of these platforms will admit an open-ended fund, unless it allows daily dealing, that is what fund managers will use even for strategies for which this structure is wholly inappropriate. Where does the Fundsmith Equity Fund stand on this? We have always regarded liquidity as an important issue. As evidence of this, we have published a liquidity measure on our fund factsheet since 2012. Equally, we only invest in large companies. At 31 December 2019 the average market capitalisation of the companies in our fund was £114bn and we estimate we could liquidate 57% of the fund in seven days. The reality is that the only type of fund which can guarantee 100% liquidity on demand is a cash fund, and I presume that is not what you wish us to invest in. But I suspect you will find it hard to find more liquid equity funds than ours. It tells you much about its liquidity that some of the least liquid stocks we hold are the FTSE 100 companies, InterContinental Hotels, Intertek and Sage. Another question which arises from the Woodford incident is the question mark over so-called “star” fund managers, a label the press seems obsessed by. I can’t say I like the term; it strikes me as equally inappropriate as the term “beauty parade”, which is used when selecting professional advisers, many of whom do not seem to me to have obvious photogenic qualities. I think this concern is focused on the wrong issue. I think it makes no more sense to avoid funds… ([Location 5837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=5837))

- rated during the dotcom mania. Similarly, in the run up to the Credit Crisis he decided not to hold bank stocks. However, when he opened his own fund management business he took positions in a wide range of companies – AA, AstraZeneca, Capita, Imperial Brands, Provident Financial and Stobart are some examples. There is no common theme that I can detect to those companies, other than the fact that they all subsequently fared badly. This was supplemented by a raft of unquoted investments in start-ups and biotech. My suggestion is that what went wrong is that Neil Woodford changed his investment strategy. In the technical jargon of the industry, he engaged in “style drift”. The problem wasn’t that he was regarded as a star but that he changed his game. This style drift actually started when he was still at Invesco Perpetual in that his Income Fund began to accumulate large stakes in small illiquid companies and unquoteds, but this was taken further once he had his own firm. Is there any chance of style drift or a similar change of strategy at Fundsmith? I think not. We published an Owner’s Manual at the outset which describes our investment strategy, write to you in these annual letters analysing how we are faring in implementing our strategy and are the only mutual fund in the UK which holds an annual meeting at which our investors can question us and see their questions answered publicly. So, it would be extraordinary if we were able to effect a change in our investment strategy without you noticing. Moreover, we have no desire to change our strategy. We are convinced that it can deliver superior returns over the long term. I would pose a different question which links the discussion of the Woodford affair with the earlier discussion of the “rotation” from quality stocks into value stocks. If you expect such a “rotation”… ([Location 5866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3W9KFZ&location=5866))

- I have long said that no one should invest in equities for income. If you had invested in the IA UK Equity Income sector over the past five years, you would on average have lost nearly 1.3% a year. The best way to approach this is to invest for the highest total return you can achieve and sell whatever shares or units you need to provide cash. However, I realise that for many investors, the idea of realising part of their capital to provide income is anathema. So what to do? If you insist on investing for dividend income, consider investing alongside a family which founded and has control of a public company. Out of the 47 stocks in the Stoxx Europe 600 that are “family influenced”, only three have cancelled or postponed dividends. Very often these extended families, descended from the business founder, rely on the dividend income from the family business. The chief executive of one of the family-controlled companies we invest in at Fundsmith says his first piece of advice from the patriarch of the family was to never cut the dividend. Investing alongside them can help to preserve your income too, and in this market environment you may get some attractive opportunities to do so.
