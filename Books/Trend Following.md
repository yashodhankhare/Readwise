- David Harding, a man you might not know yet, ratchets up the polemic by describing EMT in apocalyptic terms: “Imagine if the economy as we know it was built on a myth. Imagine if that myth was the foundation stone on which the mainstream financial systems that control the global economy have been erected—the great bazaars of stock markets, bond markets, fiendishly complex financial instruments, credit default swaps, futures and options on which the fortunes of billions rest. Imagine if the myth was the key cause of the global crash in 2008—and if its perpetuation today threatened another catastrophic crash in the future. We don’t have to imagine. The myth is Efficient Market Theory (EMT).”7 ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1007))

- Harding goes further, explaining EMT madness in an everyman way: “This theory of rational markets treats economics like a physical science—like Newtonian physics—when in fact it is a human or social science. Human beings are prone to unpredictable behavior, to over-reaction or slumbering inaction, to mania and panic. The markets that reflect this behavior do not ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1024))

- In the face of such chaos, complexity, and human frailty, my curiosity is quite simple. Answer a question: “Why does David Harding think he is right and, more importantly, how in the hell did he get all that money trading the likes of Apple, Tesla, gold, U.S. dollars, crude oil, NASDAQ, natural gas, lean hogs, palm oil, wheat, and coffee without investing in an index or having a fundamental expertise in any of those markets or the ability to predict directions?” That is a worthy question, and the answer is a follow the big money adventure.

- Out of the gate let me break down the term trend following into its components. The first part is trend. Every trader needs a trend to make money. If you think about it, no matter what the technique, if there is not a trend after you buy, then you will not be able to sell at higher prices. Following is the next part of the term. We use this word because trend followers always wait for the trend to shift first, then follow it.12 Every good trend following method should automatically limit the loss on any position, long or short, without limiting the gain. Whenever a trend, once established, reverses quickly, there is always a point, not far above or below the extreme reached prior to the reversal, at which evidence of a trend in the opposite direction is given. At that point any position held in the direction of the original trend should be reversed—or at least closed out—at a limited loss. Profits are not limited because whenever a trend, once established, continues in a sustained fashion without giving any evidence of trend reversal, the trend following principle requires a market position be maintained as long as the trend continues.13 A big reason this conceptually works is seen in the wonky-sounding Bayesian statistics. Named for Thomas Bayes (1701–1761), the belief is the true state of the world is best expressed in probabilities that continually update as new unbiased information appears, like a price trend that keeps updating and extending. New data stays connected to prior data—think of it chain-ganged together. Random dice rolls this is not. Trend following thus aims to capture the majority of a connected market trend up or down for outsized profit. It is designed for potential gains in all major asset classes—stocks, bonds, metals, currencies, and hundreds of other commodities. However straightforward the basics of trend following, it is a style of trading widely misunderstood by both average and pro investors, if it is known at all. Academic literature and real-world investors, for example, have put forth a host of strategies that, on the surface, appear unique, but at a high level they are all related to trend following.14 ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1059))

- Yet without a narrative explanation few readers would appreciate the ramifications of data mining. Robert Shiller has said “that there is a narrative basis for much of the human thought process, that the human mind can store facts around narratives, stories with a beginning and an end that have an emotional resonance. You can still memorize numbers, but you need stories. For example, the financial markets generate tons of numbers—dividends, prices, etc.—but they don’t mean anything to us. We need either a story or a theory, but stories come first.”15 ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1092))

- One of my sources who helped break apart this puzzle was Charles Faulkner. He observed elite traders are almost “floating above the world, seeing it from a different perspective than the rest of other market participants.” His insights go straight to the core: It doesn’t matter what you think; it’s what the market does that matters. What matters can be measured, so keep refining your measurements. You don’t need to know when something will happen to know that it will happen. Successful trading is a probabilistic business, so plan accordingly. There is an edge to be gained in every aspect of your trading system.

- Speculation is dealing with the uncertain conditions of the unknown future. Every human action is a speculation in that it is embedded  in the flux of time. —Ludwig von Mises1 ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1354))

- ‘Keep down your losses—never let them get away from you. Let your profits take care of themselves.’”6 That precept is huge. Timeless. If you were to put Ricardo into language of modern day computer science 134 years later you would say, optimal stopping or win-stay, lose-shift or A/B testing. More clarification from 1883 keeps the focus on taking a loss: “Speculation is looked upon as being so much more risky than other avocations cause its results are more sudden and startling, though not one whit more disastrous. Statistics show that ninety-five out of one hundred men fail in mercantile life. The proportion is not greater among speculators: quicker action is obtained whether it be favorable or unfavorable, and it does not take five or ten years’ time to find that you are playing a losing game.”7 No one is saying that attitude comes naturally. From The Art of Investing (1888): “Then, in theory, it is so easy to win by speculation! To buy at a low figure and sell at a higher, or to sell at a high figure and afterward buy at a lower, seems such a simple operation! It almost looks as if you could go into Wall Street and pick up money from the sidewalks.”8 ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1412))

- A second consideration is: “How does the mental attitude of the individual trader affect his chances of success?” To what extent, and how, can he overcome the obstacles placed in his pathway by his own hopes and fears, his timidities and his obstinacies?11 ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1461))

- Winning versus Losing It is typical the general public equates winning in the markets with abusing the financial market system—you know the horror stories so I won’t overwhelm you. However, there are players with the utmost integrity who achieve spectacular returns year after year. Examine their beliefs and self-perceptions and you will understand what keeps them honest. But before you examine their perspectives, take a moment to consider your own. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1480))

- Wide swaths of the population think as investors in search of a bargain. However, if you were to learn the most consistent market winners call themselves traders, you would want to know why. Simply put, they don’t invest—they trade. Investors put their money, or capital, into a market, such as stocks or real estate, with the assumption that value will always increase over time: “I am long and never wrong!” As value increases, their investment and psychological reinforcement also increase. But investors have no plan when their value drops. They hold on to their investment, hoping the value will go back up. Investors succeed in bull markets and lose in bear markets—like clockwork. This is because investors have zero plan to respond when losses mount. They always choose to hang tight and continue to lose. And if mainstream press continually positions investing as good or safe and trading as bad or risky, average investors will be reluctant to align themselves with trading. Better to trust the mutual fund, and government systems, and fall asleep. ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1510))

- A trader, on the other hand, has a defined plan or strategy to put capital to work to achieve profit. Traders don’t care what they buy or what they sell as long as they end up with more money than their starting capital. They are not investing in anything. They are trading. It is a critical distinction. Trader Tom Basso believes a person is a trader whether or not he or she is trading. Some mistakenly think they must be in and out of the markets every day to call themselves traders. What makes someone a trader has more to do with their perspective on life more than making a given trade. For example, a great trader’s perspective must include extreme patience. Like the African lion waiting days for the right moment to strike its unsuspecting prey, great trading strategy can wait weeks or months for the right trade with the right odds, and only then pull the trigger. Additionally, and ideally, traders will go short as often as they go long, enabling them to make money in both up and down markets. However, many traders won’t or can’t go short. They struggle with the counterintuitive concept of making money on market declines. I would hope the confusion associated with making money in down markets will dissipate, but it won’t. Human nature believes in only up. ([Location 1521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1521))

- Trader Ed Seykota notes across the board cognitive dissonance in play with a simple story: “One evening, while having dinner with a fundamentalist, I accidentally knocked a sharp knife off the edge of the table. He watched the knife twirl through the air, as it came to rest with the pointed end sticking into his shoe. ‘Why didn’t you move your foot?’ I exclaimed. ‘I was waiting for it to come back up,’ he replied.”18 ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1572))

- Trend following works because you don’t try to outthink it. You are a trend follower, not a trend predictor.26 ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1621))

- Even traders not typically associated with trend following eventually find their way. In Hedge Fund Market Wizards, Jack Schwager asked Ed Thorpe, an American mathematics professor, author, hedge fund manager, and blackjack player best known as the “father of the wearable computer,” if he believed “there are trends inherent in the markets?” Thorpe replied: “Yes. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have believed it. But a few years ago, I spent a fair amount of time looking at the strategy. My conclusion was that it works, but that it was risky enough so that it was hard to stay with it.”34 Thorpe noted he used trend following, too. And so it goes; price-based trend strategies discovered by new and old generations at different times. Salem Abraham, now an established trend following veteran, began researching the markets in his early twenties by asking a simple question: “Who is making money?” His answer was “trend followers” and his journey began.35 ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1674))

- Let’s put change in perspective. Markets behave the same as they did hundreds of years ago. In other words, markets are the same today because they always change—humans are involved, after all. This behavioral view is the philosophical underpinning of trend following. A few years ago, for example, the German mark had significant trading volume. Then the euro replaced the mark. This was a huge change, yet a typical one. If you are flexible and have a plan of attack—a solid strategy—market changes, like changes in life, won’t kill you. Trend followers traded the mark; now they trade the euro. That’s how to think. Accepting that inevitability of change is an initial step to understanding. One trend follower elaborates: ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1695))

- But what won’t change? Change. When a period of difficult performance continues, however, most investors’ natural conclusion is that something must be done to fix the problem. Having been through these draw downs before, we know that they are unpleasant, but they do not signal that something is necessarily wrong with the future. During these periods, almost everyone asks the same question in these exact words: “Have the markets changed?” I always tell them the truth: “Yes.” Not only have they changed, but they will continue to change as they have throughout history. Trend following presupposes change. It is based on change.37 Markets of course are built by design to go up, down, and sideways. They trend or chop. They flow or don’t. They are consistent, then they surprise. No one accurately can forecast a trend’s beginning or end until it becomes a matter of record. However, if your trading strategy is designed to adapt, you can take advantage of changes: ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1701))

- If you have a valid basic philosophy, the fact that things change turns out to be a benefit. At least you can survive. At the very least, you will survive over the long-term. But if you don’t have a valid basic philosophy, you won’t be successful because change will eventually kill you. I knew I could not predict anything, and that is why we decided to follow trends, and that is why we’ve been so successful. We simply follow trends. No matter how ridiculous those trends appear to be at the beginning, and no matter how extended or how irrational they seem at the end, we follow trends.38 ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1711))

- Further, don’t try to guess how far a trend will extend. You can’t. You will never know how high or how low any market might go. Peter Borish, former second-in-command with Paul Tudor Jones, lays bare the trader’s only concern: “Price makes news, not the other way around. A market is going to go where a market is going to go.”45 The concept of price as the paramount trading signal is too simple for Wall Street to accept. This confusion or misinformation is seen across the mainstream press where they always emphasize the wrong numbers. Bill Griffeth, of CNBC, “At some point, investing is an act of faith. If you can’t believe the numbers, annual reports, etc., what numbers can you believe?” He misses the point. It doesn’t matter whether you can or cannot believe an earnings statement. All of those numbers can be doctored, fixed, cooked, or faked. The traded market price can’t be fixed. It’s the only number you can believe. You can see it every day. However, this does not diminish confusion. Alan Sloan, a finance reporter, doesn’t get it: “If some of the smartest people on Wall Street can’t trust the numbers, you wonder who can trust the numbers.” ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1788))

- Understanding how a trend follower implements that philosophy is illustrated in Ed Seykota’s sugar story. He had been buying sugar— thousands of sugar futures contracts. And every day, the market was closing limit up. Every day, the market was going nonstop higher and higher. Seykota kept buying more and more sugar each day limit up. An outside broker was watching all of Seykota’s action. And one day the broker called him after the market close, and since he had extra contracts of sugar that were not balanced out, he said to Seykota, “I bet you want to buy these other 5,000 contracts of sugar.” Seykota replied, “Sold.” After the market closes limit up for days in a row, Seykota says, “Sure, I’ll buy more sugar contracts at the absolute top of the market.” Everybody instinctively wants to buy sugar on the dip or on the retracement. Let it come down lower they pine. “I want a bargain” is their thinking—even if the bargain never appears. Trend following works by doing the opposite: It buys higher highs and sells short lower lows.

- Trend followers know to pick the trend start is a masochistic exercise. When trends start they often come from flat markets that don’t appear to be trending anywhere—it’s choppy, up-and-down, trendless, go-nowhere market action. The solution is to take small bets early to see if the trend will mature and get big enough to ride. An executive at trend following pioneer Graham Capital Management clarifies, “The ability of trend following strategies to succeed depends on two obvious but important assumptions about markets. First, it assumes that price trends occur regularly in markets. Secondly, it assumes that trading systems can be created to profit from these trends. The basic trading strategy that all trend followers try to systematize is to ‘cut losses’ and ‘let profits run.’”50 I asked Charles Faulkner to expand: The first rule of trading is to, “Cut your losses, and let your profits run.” And then, that it’s the hardest thing to do. Seldom do any of them wonder why, and yet this is exactly where the efficient market theory breaks down, and the psychological nature of the markets shows through. When we lose or misplace something, we expect to find it later. The cat comes back. We find our car keys. But we know a dollar on the street will not be there with the next person who passes by. So experience teaches us that losses are unlikely and gains are hard. “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” This is when I tell them that they earn their trading profits by doing the hard thing—by going against human nature. This is where the discipline comes in, the psychological preparation, the months of system testing that give the trader the confidence to actually trade against his natural tendencies. If cutting losses and letting profits run is the trend following mantra, it is because harsh reality dictates you can’t play the game if you run out of money. No money, no honey! Trend trader Christopher Cruden sarcastically builds the thought: “I would prefer to finish with a certain currency forecast, based upon my own fundamental reading of the market and one that underpins my personal investment philosophy. . . . The only problem is I can’t tell you when this will happen or which event will be first. On that basis alone, it seems best to stay with our systematic approach.”52 ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1839))

- Surf the Waves I am fortunate to have learned from trader Ed Seykota starting in 2001 with our first Virgin Islands meeting, through a 2012 panel with Larry Hite, and up to his 2016 podcast appearance. But early on he told me a story about being in Bermuda with a new trader who wanted secrets. “Give me the quick-and-dirty version of your magical trading secrets,” the neophyte beamed. Seykota took the new trader out to the beach. They stood there watching the waves break against the shoreline. The newbie asked, “What’s your point?” Seykota said, “Go down to the shoreline where the waves break. Now begin to time them. Run out with the waves as they recede and run in as the waves come in. Can you see how you could get into rhythm with the waves? You follow the waves out and you follow them in. You follow their lead.” The truth of trend following is its philosophical underpinnings are relevant not only to trading, but to life in general, from business to personal relationships. The old-pro trend followers were clear with me, in their words and actions: Trend following works best when pursued with the right mindset and unbridled passion. First, consider the role of proper mindset. As Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck teaches, “In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort. They’re wrong. In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Virtually all great people have had these qualities.”55 Second, trading coach and psychologist Brett Steenbarger argues the passion point: “Find your passion: the work that stimulates, fascinates, and endlessly challenges you. Identify what you find meaningful and rewarding, and pour yourself into it. If your passion happens to be the markets, you will find the fortitude to outlast your learning curve and to develop the mastery needed to become a professional. If your passion is not the markets, then invest your funds with someone who possesses an objective track record and whose investment aims match your own. Then go forth and pour yourself into those facets of life that will keep you springing out of bed each morning, eager to face each day.”56 In my experience it became crystal clear when used within the context of mindset and passion, the term trend following can be substituted in this edition for other aspects of life. That insight crystallized in a passage from Brenda Ueland’s 1938 book on creative writing: “Whenever I say writing in this book, I also mean anything you love and want to do or to make. It may be a six-act tragedy in blank verse, it may be dressmaking or… ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1883))

- The first question you have to ask yourself: “who are you?” I’m not kidding. And don’t look at your driver’s license! But what you got to say to yourself: “What am I comfortable doing?” Am I an arbitrager? Am I a short-term trader? It is really important that you understand who you are and what you want to do. The next thing you have to ask yourself, one of the real details, “What are you going to do?” What are you going to do exactly? What has to be done? Is it hard to you? Is it easy? Do you have the materials to do it? One of the great things about the market is the markets don’t care about you. The market doesn’t care what color you are. The markets don’t care if you are short or tall. They don’t care about anything. They don’t care whether you leave or stay. The last question you have to ask yourself: “What follows?” You have to ask yourself, “If I do this and it works, where am I? What have I got?” Now what I’ve said may really sound like it’s pretty simple and common sense, [but think about the failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management] those were some very, very smart people [Nobel Prize winners] who did some pretty stupid things. And they did it because they didn’t ask themselves the basic questions. ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=1917))

- Summary Food for Thought Galileo Galilei: “All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.” Hendrik Houthakker (1961): “Price changes are not purely random, but follow certain longer run trends.” Inspired by Benoit Mandelbrot, Houthakker was an early EMT critic. Ed Seykota: “All profitable systems trade trends; the difference in price necessary to create the profit implies a trend.” Prices, not traders, predict the future. If you don’t have losses, you are not taking risks. If you don’t risk, you can’t win anything. Price goes either up, down, or sideways. No advance in technology, leap of modern science, or radical shift in perception will alter this fact.

Paul Samuelson The trend is your friend except at the end when it bends. Ed Seykota30 Defining a trend is like defining love. We know it when we see it, but we are rarely sure exactly what it is.

They give us a working model that quantitatively defines their value for us.

- Markets don’t move from one state to another in a straight line: There are periods of countertrend shock and volatility. We spend most of our time trying to find ways to deal with those unsettling but inevitable events. That being said, it is really not difficult to put together a simple trend following system that can generate positive returns over a realistic holding period and there are many, many commercial systems that have been generating strong, albeit volatile, returns for a long time. So there are definitely firm grounds for believing in Santa Claus. Paul Mulvaney By honest I don’t mean that you only tell what’s true. But you make clear the entire situation.

- Ed Seykota is a genius and a great trader who has been phenomenally successful. When I first met Ed he had recently graduated from MIT and had developed some of the first computer programs for testing and trading technical systems. . . . Ed provided an excellent role model. For example, one time, he was short silver and the market just kept eking down, a half penny a day. Everyone else seemed to be bullish, talking about why silver had to go up because it was so cheap, but Ed just stayed short. Ed said, “The trend is down, and I’m going to stay short until the trend changes.” I learned patience from him in the way he followed the trend.

- Trend following is similar to being long options because the stop loss creates a limited downside, and the continuation of the trend creates the large upside. This is why the phrase for this approach to trading is to cut losses and to let profits run. Of course, if trends continually fail to materialize, these limited losses can accumulate to large losses. This is also true for any option purchase strategy. For trend followers, the option premium is paid for after an unsuccessful trade is closed when a stop loss has been reached. The premium can also be paid after markets have moved a great deal, profits have been made, and a reversal causes a trailing stop to be hit, and some of the profits reversed.

- Being able to trade your system instead of your psychology means separating yourself from your trading. This can begin with your language. “I’m in the trading business” and “I work as a trader” are very different from “I’m a trader” or “I own a few stocks and bonds” (from a major East Coast speculator). The market wizards I’ve met seem to live by William Blake’s phrase, “I must make my own system or be enslaved by another’s.” They have made their own systems—in their trading and in their lives and in their language. They don’t allow others to define them or their terms. And they are sometimes considered abrupt, difficult, iconoclastic, or full of themselves as a result. And they know the greater truth—they are themselves and they know what works for them. ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=2297))

- We only have two systems. The first system is the one I started with in 1974. The other system, we developed and launched in 1989. The major strategic elements of these two models—how and when to trade, how much to buy and sell—have never changed in almost 30 years. We expect change. None of the things that have happened in the development of new markets over the past 30 years strike us as making the marketplace different in any essential way. The markets are just the markets. I know that is unusual. I know in the past five years a lot of competitors have purposefully lowered the risk on their models i.e., they are deleveraging them or trying to mix them with other things to reduce the volatility. Of course, they have also reduced their returns.23 He is addressing a critical issue: reducing risk to reduce volatility for nervous clients. The result is always lower absolute returns. If you remain fixated on volatility as an enemy, instead of seeing volatility as the source of profit, you will never get this.

Prices, not investors, predict the future. Despite this, investors hope or believe that they can predict the future, or someone else can. A lot of them look to you to predict what the next macroeconomic cycle will be.

- After you enter the world of markets you will eventually run across Market Wizards by Jack Schwager. Of all the trader interviews in Market Wizards the most memorable is with Ed Seykota. While some may perceive him as extremely direct, most will agree his thinking is unique. One profound and now famous statement of his: “Everybody gets what they want out of the market.” This was a response to a question about trading, but I feel certain Seykota would say it also applies to life. Even though he is almost unknown to both traders and laymen alike, Seykota’s achievements rank him as one of the great trend followers (and traders) of all time. I first met him at a small beachside café. I had received an invitation from him to get together to discuss the outreach possibilities of the Internet. During that first meeting, he asked me what I thought Richard Dennis was looking for when he hired his student traders, the Turtles (Seykota knew my website www.turtletrader.com). My reply was to say Dennis was looking for students who could think in terms of odds. His response was to ask me if my reply was my own thinking or something I was told by someone else. This was my indoctrination to his direct nature. This story passed along from an associate is pure Seykota: I attended a day-long seminar in February 1995 in Toronto, Canada where Seykota was one of the guest speakers. The whole audience peppered him with questions like: Do you like gold, where do you think the Canadian $ is headed, how do you know when there is a top, how do you know when the trend is up etc.? To each of these, he replied: “I like gold—it’s shiny, pretty—makes nice jewelry” or “I have no idea where the Canadian dollar is headed or the trend is up when price is moving up, etc.” His replies were simple, straight-forward answers to the questions asked of him. Later, I learned through the event organizer that a large majority of the audience (who paid good money, presumably to learn the “secrets” of trading from a Market Wizard) were not impressed. Many felt they had wasted their time and money listening to him. Seykota’s message couldn’t be clearer to anyone who cared to listen. The answers were found in the very questions each person asked. Don’t ask, “How do you know the trend is moving up?” Instead, ask, “What is going to tell me the trend is  up?” Not, “What do you think of gold?” Instead, ask, “Am I correctly trading gold?” Seykota’s answers effectively placed everyone in front of a huge mirror, reflecting their trading self back at them. If you don’t even know the question to ask about trading, much less the answers, get out of the business and spend your life doing something you enjoy.52 ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=3260))

- Think about how you would have reacted to his speech. Performance Seykota earned, after fees, nearly 60 percent on average each year from 1990 to 2000 managing proprietary money in his managed futures program.53 But he is different than Harding, Henry, and Dunn. He literaly has been a one-man shop his entire career. There is no fancy office or other employees. He does not hold himself out as a fund manager and he is extremely selective of clients. He doesn’t care whether people have money or that they want him to trade or not. Seykota takes big risks and he gets big rewards—that takes a strong stomach. Seykota was born in 1946. He earned his Bachelor of Science from MIT in 1969 and by 1972 had embarked on the trading career he pursues to this day—investing for his own account and the accounts of a few select others. He was self-taught, but influenced in his career by Amos Hostetter and Richard Donchian.

- His trading is largely confined to the few minutes it takes to run his internally written computer program, which generates trading signals for the next day. He also mentors traders through his website and his Trading Tribe, a widespread community of like-minded traders. He has served as a teacher and mentor to some great traders, including Michael Marcus and David Druz. The Secret Seykota debunks market ignorance with terse, Zen-like statements that force the listener to look inward: “The biggest secret about success is that there isn’t any big secret about it, or if there is, then it’s a secret from me, too. The idea of searching for some secret for trading success misses the point.”55 That self-deprecating response emphasizes process over outcome, but don’t be misled by his modesty, for he gets impatient with hypocrisy and mindlessness. He is a fearless trader and does not suffer fools gladly. Yet when he remembers his first trade, I saw the passion: “The first trade I remember, I was about five years old in Portland, Oregon.

- Later on he was more directly inspired: “I saw a letter published by Richard Donchian, which implied that a purely mechanical trend following system could beat the markets. This too seemed impossible to me. So I wrote computer programs (on punch cards in those days) to test the theories. Amazingly, his [Donchian] theories tested true. To this day, I’m not sure I understand why or whether I really need to. Anyhow, studying the markets, and backing up my opinions with money, was so fascinating compared to my other career opportunities at the time, that I began trading full time for a living.”57 Trading was now in his blood, and at age 23 he went out on his own with about a half-dozen accounts in the $10,000–25,000 range.58 He found an alternative to the Wall Street career built only on commissions.

- FAQs Examples of Seykota’s clear wisdom63: To avoid whipsaw losses, stop trading. Lesson: You will have losses. Accept them. Here’s the essence of risk management: Risk no more than you can afford to lose, and also risk enough so that a win is meaningful. If there is no such amount, don’t play. Lesson: Position sizing or money management is crucial. Trend following is an exercise in observing and responding to the ever-present moment of now. Traders who predict the future dwell upon a nonexistent place, and to the extent they also park their ability to act out there, they can miss opportunities to act in the now. Lesson: All you have is now. It is much better to react to the fact of market movements in present time than a future time that doesn’t exist. Markets are fundamentally volatile. No way around it. Your problem is not in the math. There is no math to get you out of having to experience uncertainty. Lesson: You can crunch all the numbers you like, but your “gut” still has to handle the ups and downs. You have to live with and feel the uncertainty.

- I recall, in the old days, people showing a lot of concern that markets are different and trend following methods no longer work. Lesson: Today or yesterday, skeptics abound. They sound like broken records in their desires to see trend following debunked. It can be very expensive to try to convince the markets you are right. Lesson: Go with the flow. Leave your personal or fundamental opinions at the door. Do you want to be right or make money? Losers try to convince everyone they are right. When magazine covers get pretty emotional, get out of the position. There’s nothing else in the magazine that works very well, but the covers are pretty good. This is not an indictment of the magazine people, it’s just that at the end of a big move there is a communal psychological abreaction that shows up on the covers of magazines.65 Lesson: Crowd psychology is real and the price reflects all.

- Salem Abraham Salem Abraham does it differently than most. He truly proves physical location is meaningless. It would be hard to find a financial firm in the United States as removed from Wall Street, geographically and culturally, as Abraham Trading Company. Housed in the same building where his grandfather Malouf Abraham once chewed the fat with local politicians and ranchers, the company has evolved into one of the nation’s most unusual trading operations.84 It was while he was a student at Notre Dame University that Abraham found he had a natural ability for and interest in trading. Like Greg Smith, one of Seykota’s students, he researched which traders were the most successful and discovered trend following. Abraham returned home to the family ranch in Canadian, Texas, after graduating and discussed the idea of trading for a living with his “granddad,” who cautiously agreed to help him get started as a trader. According to Abraham he was to “try it out for six months,” and then discard the idea (“throw the quote machine out the window”) if he failed.85 There was no failure for Abraham. He quickly developed a Wall Street business in the most anti–Wall Street way. Abraham’s firm’s culture is astonishingly different: “No one at the company has an Ivy League degree. Most of the employees at Abraham Trading have backgrounds working at the area’s feedlots or natural-gas drilling and pipeline companies. Their training in the complexities of trading and arbitrage is provided on the job. ‘This beats shoveling manure at 6 am in the morning,’ said Geoff Dockray, who was hired as a clerk for Mr. Abraham after working at a feedlot near Canadian. The financial markets are complicated but they’re not as relentless as dealing with livestock all the time.”86 Abraham’s meat-and-potatoes approach to trading: “The underlying premise of Abraham Trading’s approach is that commodity interests will, from time to time, enter into periods of major price change to either a higher or lower level. These price changes are known as trends, which have been observed and recorded since the beginning of market history. There is every reason to believe that in free markets prices will continue to trend. The trading approach used by Abraham is designed to exploit these price moves.”87 When asked about his relationship with Jerry Parker, Abraham gave an example of six degrees of… ([Location 3589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=3589))

They decided to experiment by seeing whether they could teach novices successful trading. Twenty-plus students were accepted into two separate training programs. Legend has it Dennis named his students “Turtles” after visiting a turtle-breeding farm in Singapore. How did it start? Dennis ran classified ads saying Trader Wanted and was immediately overwhelmed by some 1,000 queries from would-be traders. He picked 20+ novices, trained them for two weeks, and then gave them money to trade for his firm. His Turtles included two professional gamblers, a fantasy-game designer, an accountant, and a juggler.

- Dale Dellutri, a former executive at Dennis’s firm, managed the Turtle group. He said they were looking for “smarts and for people who had odd ideas.” Ultimately, they selected several blackjack players, an actor, a security guard, and a designer of the fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons. One of the ways they screened candidates was by having them answer true-or-false questions. The following true-or-false questions were sent to the Turtles and were used to decide who was picked and who went home: One should favor being long or being short, whichever one is comfortable with. On initiation, one should know precisely at what price to liquidate if a profit occurs. One should trade the same number of contracts in all markets. If one has $100,000 to risk, one ought to risk $25,000 on every trade. On initiation, one should know precisely where to liquidate if a loss occurs. You can never go broke taking profits. It helps to have the fundamentals in your favor before you initiate. A gap up is a good place to initiate if an uptrend has started.

- From a period of dullness and inactivity, watch for and prepare to follow a move in the direction in which volume increases. Limit losses and ride profits, irrespective of all other rules. Light commitments are advisable when market position is not certain. Clearly defined moves are signaled frequently enough to make life interesting and concentration on these moves will prevent unprofitable whip-sawing. Seldom take a position in the direction of an immediately preceding three-day move. Wait for a one-day reversal. Judicious use of stop orders is a valuable aid to profitable trading. Stops may be used to protect profits, to limit losses, and from certain formations such as triangular foci to take positions. Stop orders are apt to be more valuable and less treacherous if used in proper relation to the chart formation. In a market in which upswings are likely to equal or exceed downswings, heavier position should be taken for the upswings for percentage reasons—a decline from 50 to 25 will net only 50 percent profit, whereas an advance from 25 to 50 will net 100 percent profit. In taking a position, price orders are allowable. In closing a position, use market orders. ([Location 3783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=3783))

They say there are two sides to everything. But there is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. I think it was a long step forward in my trading education when I realized at last that when old Mr. Partridge kept on telling the other customers, “Well, you know this is a bull market!” he really meant to tell them that the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is, not in reading the tape, but in sizing up the entire market and its trend. The reason is that a man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do. That is why so many men in Wall Street, who are not at all in the sucker class, not even in the third grade, nevertheless lose money. The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight. Old Turkey was dead right in doing and saying what he did.

- An absolute return trading strategy means you are trying to make the most money possible. Author Alexander Ineichen defines it succinctly: An absolute return manager is essentially an asset manager without a benchmark—Bench marking can be viewed as a method of restricting investment managers so as to limit the potential for surprises, either positive or negative.2 Trend following in its purest form doesn’t track or attempt to mimic any particular index—ever. If trend following had a coat of arms, Absolute Returns would be emblazoned upon it. It thrives and profits from the surprises benchmarking artificially stops. However, not all trend followers are shooting for absolute returns or the most amount of money possible. Not all play the game full tilt. Jerry Parker, for example, purposefully aims for lower returns to cater to a  different client base (those who want less risk and less return).

- But John W. Henry long made the case “[that] the overall objective is to provide absolute returns.

We have no such investment benchmark, so its aim is to achieve returns in all market conditions, and is thus considered an absolute return manager.”3 ([Location 4464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=4464))

- Shoot for a benchmark in returns and you run with the crowd. Benchmarks such as the S&P might make you feel safe, even when that feeling is clearly artificial.

- The concept of indexing and benchmarking is very useful in the EMT world of traditional long-only passive investing, but it has almost zero usefulness for an absolute return process. Again, it gets back to what it takes to achieve an absolute return—you need an enormous amount of latitude and freedom in executing a trading strategy to ensure capital preservation and achieve a positive return. At its core, the concept of absolute return investing is antithetical to benchmarking, which encourages traditional managers to have similarly structured portfolios and look at their performance on a relative basis.4 ([Location 4471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=4471))

- Hedge fund researcher Nicola Meaden compared monthly standard deviations (volatility as measured from the mean) and semi-standard deviations (volatility measured on the downside only) and found that although trend following arguably experiences higher volatility, it is often concentrated on the upside (positive returns), not the downside (negative returns). Trend following performance is thus unfairly penalized by performance measures such as the Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio ignores whether volatility is on the plus or minus side because it does not account for the difference between the standard deviation and the semi-standard deviation. The actual formula is identical, with one exception—the semi-standard deviation looks only at observations below the mean. If the semi-standard deviation is lower than the standard deviation, the historical pull away from the mean has to be on the plus side. If it is higher, the pull away from the mean is on the minus side. Meaden points out the huge difference ([Location 4661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=4661))

Traders, portfolio managers, and mathematicians seem well equipped to describe risk with a battery of formulas and ratios they use to measure volatility. However, even if you can easily handle the math, it can be a challenge to truly conceptualize it. I can sum it up as follows: Surrender to the reality that volatility exists or volatility will introduce you to the reality that surrender exists.

- Zero Sum The zero-sum nature of many markets is arguably the most important concept in markets. Larry Harris, chair in finance at the Marshall School of Business at University of Southern California: “Trading is a zero-sum game when gains and losses are measured relative to the market average. In a zero-sum game, someone can win only if somebody else loses.”31 Harris told me he was amazed at how many people came from my websites to download his white paper on zero-sum trading—the topic left out of most strategy discussions. It’s one winner and one loser. Harris examines the factors that determine who wins and who loses in market transactions. He does this by categorizing traders by type and then evaluating speculative trading styles to determine whether  the styles lead to profits or losses: “Winning traders can only profit to the extent that other traders are willing to lose. Traders are willing to lose when they obtain external benefits from trading. The most important external benefits are expected returns from holding risky securities that represent deferred consumption. Hedging and gambling provide other external benefits. Markets would not exist without utilitarian traders. Their trading losses fund the winning traders who make prices efficient and provide liquidity.”32 There are those who absolutely do not accept that there must be a loser for them to be a winner. They cannot live with the fact everyone can’t be a winner. Although they want to win, many do not want to live with the guilt by their winning, someone else has to lose. This is a poorly thought out yet all too common view of the losing trader’s mindset. Harris is clear on what separates winners from losers: On any given transaction, the chances of winning or losing may be near even. In the long run, however, winners profit from trading because they have some persistent advantages that allow them to win slightly more often or occasionally much bigger than losers win. . . . To trade profitably in the long run, you must know your edge, you must know when it exists, and you must focus your trading to exploit it when you can. If you have no edge, you should not trade for profit. If you know you have no edge, but you must trade for other reasons, you should organize your trading to minimize your losses to those who do have an edge. Recognizing your edge is a prerequisite to predicting whether trading will be profitable.33 Nobel Prize winner and cofounder of famed trend following incubator Commodities Corporation Paul Samuelson adds, “For every trader betting on higher prices, another is betting on lower prices. These trades are matched. In the stock market, all investors (buyers and sellers) can profit in a rising market, and all can lose in a falling market. In futures markets, one trader’s gain is another’s loss.” Dennis Gartman adds to the perspective: “In the world of futures speculation, for every long there is an equal and opposite short.

- George Soros The trading success of famed speculator George Soros is well known. In 1992 he was labeled the man who broke the British pound for placing a $10 billion bet against the pound that netted him at least $1 billion in profit.34 Yet even successful pros sometimes miss a key point. Years back, Soros appeared on Nightline, an old-school ABC news program. This exchange between Soros and then-host Ted Koppel goes to the zero-sum understanding—or lack thereof: Ted Koppel: As you describe it, the market is, of course, a game in which there are real consequences. When you bet and you win, that’s good for you, it’s bad for those against whom you have bet. There are always losers in this kind of a game? George Soros: No. See, it’s not a zero-sum game. It’s very important to realize. Ted Koppel: Well, it’s not zero-sum in terms of investors. But, for example, when you bet against the British pound that was not good for the British economy? George Soros: Well, it happened to be quite good for the British economy. It was not, let’s say, good for the British treasury because they were on the other side of the trade . . . It’s not—your gain is not necessarily somebody else’s loss. Ted Koppel: Because—put it in easily understandable terms—I mean if you could have profited by destroying Malaysia’s currency, would you have shrunk from that? George Soros: Not necessarily because that would have been an unintended consequence of my action. And it’s not my job as a participant to calculate the consequences. This is what a market is. That’s the nature of a market. So I’m a participant in the market. Soros opens a can of worms with his description of zero-sum. From a blog post that incorrectly analyzes Soros’ interview: “Cosmetically, Koppel wipes the floor with Soros. He’s able to portray Soros as a person who destroys lives and economies without a second thought, as well as simplify, beyond belief, something that should not be  simplified.”35 ([Location 5047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=5047))

- This is nonsense. The fact Soros is a player in the market does not establish him as a destroyer of lives. You might disagree with Soros’s political ideology, but you can’t question his morality for participation in markets. You have a 401(k) plan designed to generate profits from the market—like Soros. Others, such as Lawrence Parks, a union activist, correctly state that Soros is in a zero-sum game, but Parks then goes jealous by declaring zero-sum unfair and harsh for the working-man: Since currency and derivative trading are zero-sum games, every dollar “won” requires that a dollar was “lost.” Haven’t they realized what a losing proposition this has been? What’s more, why do they keep playing at a losing game? The answer is that the losers are all of us. And, while neither rich nor stupid, we’ve been given no choice but to continue to lose. And every time one of these fiat currencies cannot be “defended,” the workers, seniors, and business owners of that country—folks like us—suffer big time. Indeed, as their currencies are devalued, workers’ savings and future payments, such as their pensions, denominated in those currencies lose purchasing power. Interest rates increase. Through no fault of their own, working people lose their jobs in addition to their savings. There have been press reports that, after a lifetime of working and saving, people in Indonesia are eating bark off the trees and boiling grass soup. While not a secret, it is astonishing to learn how sanguine the beneficiaries have become of their advantage over the rest of us. For example, famed financier George Soros in his recent The Crisis of Global Capitalism plainly divulges: “The Bank of England was on the other side of my transactions and I was taking money out of the pockets of British taxpayers.” To me, the results of this wealth transfer are inescapable.37 Parks says his only choice is to lose. He loses, his union loses—it’s a pity party. It seems everyone loses in the zero-sum game (even though Parks’ fund will of course have their assets invested in the very funds he criticizes). Look, there are winners and losers and he knows that. Yes, the zero-sum speculation game is indeed a wealth transfer. The winners profit from the losers. Life is not fair. If you don’t like being a loser in the zero-sum game, then it is time to consider how the winners play the game.

- To comprehend trend following’s true impact you must look at its performance across the biggest events, bubbles and crashes of the last 50 years where it won huge profits in the zero-sum game of surprises. While world governments and Wall Street are notorious for country wipeouts, central bank errors, corporate collapses, bank implosions, and fund blow-ups that transfer capital from losers to winners, the winners are almost always missing from after-the-fact analysis. Like clockwork, the press is over-the-top fascinated with the losers when surprises roll in. Following their lead, the public also gets caught up in the losers’ drama, oblivious to: Who were the winners and why did they win? Sometimes they get close to the insight: “Each time there’s a derivatives disaster I get the same question: If Barings was the loser, who was the winner? If Orange County was the loser: Who was the winner? If Procter & Gamble was the loser: Who was the winner?”2 Prominent finance academics searching for winners often come up short, as Christopher Culp of the University of Chicago lamented: “It’s a zero-sum game. For every loser there’s a winner, but you can’t always be specific about who the winner is.”3 When big market events happen, smart people know the losers’ losses are going somewhere, but time passes and they stop thinking about it or forget the original goal. Reflecting on an implosion is not pleasant: “Fear is still in the bones of some pension fund trustees—after Mr. Leeson brought down Barings Bank. The failure of Barings Bank is probably the most often cited derivatives disaster. While the futures market had been the instrument used by Nick Leeson to play the zero-sum game and someone made a lot of money being short the Nikkei futures Mr. Leeson was buying.”4 Someone did make a lot of money trading short to Leeson’s long. But most of Main Street and Wall Street look at it through the wrong lens. Michael Mauboussin sees standard finance theory coming up short when explaining winners during high-impact times: “One of the major challenges in investing is how to capture (or avoid) low-probability, high-impact events.

- For markets to move in tandem, there has to be a common perception or consensus about economic conditions that drives it. When a major “event” occurs in the middle of such a consensus, such as the Russian debt default of August 1998, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the corporate accounting scandals of 2002 [and the 2008 equity market crash], it will often accelerate existing trends already in place . . . “events” do not happen in a vacuum . . . This is the reason trend following rarely gets caught on the wrong side of an “event.” Additionally, the stop loss trading style will limit exposure when it does—When this consensus is further confronted by an “event,” such as a major country default, the “event” will reinforce the crisis mentality already in place and drive those trends toward their final conclusion. Because trend following generally can be characterized as having a “long option” profile, it typically benefits greatly when these occurrences happen.7 Said more bluntly: “Even unlikely events must come to pass eventually. Therefore, anyone who accepts a small risk of losing everything will lose everything, sooner or later. The ultimate compound return rate is acutely sensitive to fat tails.”8 However, big events also generate plenty of inane analysis by focusing on the unanswerable like questions posed by Thomas Ho and Sang Lee, authors of The Oxford Guide to Financial Modeling9: What do these events tell us about our society?

- Are these financial losses the dark sides of all the benefits of financial derivatives? Should we change the way we do things? Should society accept these financial losses as part of the “survival of the fittest” in the world of business? Should legislation be used to avoid these events? It is not unusual to see market wins and losses positioned as a morality tale to be solved by government. This drama absolves the losers’ guilt for poor strategies (i.e., Amaranth, Bear Stearns, Bernard Madoff, LTCM, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, Valeant, etc.). Yet the market is no place for politics or social engineering. No law will ever change human nature. As Dwight D. Eisenhower noted: “The search for a scapegoat is the easiest of all hunting expeditions.” Bottom line, trend following performance histories during the 2016 Brexit event, the 2014–2016 oil implosion, the 2008 market crash,… ([Location 5477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=5477))

- September 11, 2001 September 11, 2001 demonstrates unpredictable on a grand scale. How could anyone know in advance where the safe place to be was? Before considering September 11 specifically, consider Ed Seykota’s words in general: “A surprise is an event that catches someone unaware. If you are already on the trend, the surprises seem to happen to the other guys.”23 No one predicted a terrorist attack would close Wall Street for four days. Although it was difficult to stay focused on the rigors of everyday life, trend following maintained. It confronted markets as it always had—with a plan set in motion long before the unexpected event happened. Trend following was short stocks and long bonds ahead of the attack because those markets were already headed in that direction. For example, Sunrise Capital Partners noted how lucky they were to be positioned ahead of the attack. Further, Campbell & Company made the case that currency markets had followed through with continued trends. “The U.S. dollar had already begun to weaken before the attacks, hence Campbell was short that market.” Campbell had been long bonds and short a number of global stock index futures contracts ahead of the attack because of established trends.24 Although Enron, the California energy crisis, and September 11th are vivid illustrations of the zero-sum game with trend following as the winner, the story of Long-Term Capital Management in the summer of 1998 is an even better case study.

- out the winning lessons trend follower Jerry Parker teaches: Transparent—By and large, trend followers trade markets on regulated exchanges. They are not cooking up new derivatives in basements. Trend followers typically trade on freely traded markets where a price that everyone can see enables anyone to buy or sell. Trend followers have nothing in common with the derivatives fiascos that damaged Orange County or Procter and Gamble. Understandable—Trend following strategies can be understood by anybody. No high-level math only PhDs can comprehend. No rock stars—There are individuals who not only want to make money, but also want a rock star as their portfolio manager. They want to think that the strategy being used to make them money is exciting and state-of-the-art. Trend followers are not in the game for notoriety, only to win. I always wonder what would have happened and how much more money trend following models would have made if LTCM had been allowed to implode without preferential government interference. And I asked Dunn Capital whether they thought LTCM’s bailout was proper. They replied with a one-word answer: No. Bill Dunn responded with even more clarity: ([Location 6051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=6051))

- I believe the Long-Term Capital Management collapse was caused by: Their trading approach was based on the theory prices and relationships between prices tend to vary, but they also tend to return to their mean value over long periods of time. So in practice, they probably looked at a market (or a spread between markets) and determined what its mean value was and where the current price was in relation to their estimate of its “true mean” value. If the current price was below the mean, a “buy” was indicated, and if it was above the mean, a “sell” was indicated. (I don’t know what their exit strategy was.) The main problem with the above is that as market prices move further against your position, you will be experiencing losses in your open positions and your above trading approach would suggest that adding to the current position will prove to be even more profitable than originally expected. Unless this market very quickly turns and starts its anticipated… ([Location 6062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=6062))

- survivability or by having a nearly unlimited amount of capital/credit to withstand the occasional extreme excursions from the mean, or better yet, adopt both of these ideas. But the situation became even more unstable when LTCM ventured into highly illiquid investment vehicles and also became a very major part of these very thin markets. In the end, they became overextended and they ran out of capital before any anticipated reversion to the mean could bail them out. Those who cannot or will not learn from the past always set themselves up for another August–September 1998 lightening bolt. Another LTCM fiasco is always in the offing since the Black–Scholes way of life, where the world is a normal distribution, is still considered a viable approach to investing in 2017.

To this day in 2017 if you drive around Bangkok, Thailand or Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, you can still see unfinished skyscrapers left as artifacts of yet another financial implosion. One of the biggest losers during this meltdown was infamous trader Victor Niederhoffer. Always opinionated, bombastic, and for most of his trading career, exceptionally successful, Niederhoffer’s trading demise was swift. Niederhoffer played a big game, whether at speculating, chess, or squash. He challenged grandmasters in chess and he won repeated titles as a national squash champion. He regularly bet hundreds of millions of dollars and consistently won until Monday, October 27, 1997. That day he lost an estimated $50 million to $100 million, and his three hedge funds, Limited Partners of Niederhoffer Intermarket Fund L.P., Limited Partners of Niederhoffer Friends Partnership L.P., and Niederhoffer Global Systems S.A., bellied up.48 Imagine receiving this letter faxed from Niederhoffer on Wednesday, October 29, 1997: ([Location 6096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=6096))

- I also pulled The Economist from March 1987, which to my fortunate surprise included quotes and references to a then 26-year-old David Harding and a then 31-year old Larry Hite. Highlights: Technical analysis of financial markets starts with the assumption markets follow trends determined by previous patterns of price behavior, and that rarely, if ever, move randomly. A chartist will attempt to discern a trend by spotting recognizable movements in the price of a security or commodity which confirm a break out, either up or down, from the range within which the price has previously been trading. Larry Hite compared a computer to an anvil. Ideas can be hammered out on it and discarded if they do not come up to scratch. David Harding’s computer system not only generates buy and sell signals; it also shows how long an investment should be held. Only  50 percent of his trades are profitable, but winners are on average 3× bigger than losers. 1987 critics call Harding and Hite’s trend following efforts a fad.75 ([Location 6439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=6439))

- I was having dinner with Larry Hite in late 2016 and I brought up that he was called a 1987 fad. But his mantra doesn’t change. What he said in 1987, he says in 2017. The evidence is in. All we can do is trust evidence, until it changes. A main reason trend following trading has done so well for so long is because it has no quarterly performance constraints. Both Wall Street and Main Street measure success on the artificial constraints of the calendar. Trend following does not. For example, looking back at the end of 2008 you can see that without October 2008’s home run, trend following would have had a different performance profile. History now would be remembered differently. ([Location 6449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=6449))

- In my opinion, luck is far and away the most important determinant in our lives. Various events of infinitesimal probability—where you are born, to whom you are born, who you marry, where you take your first job, which school you choose—have an enormous impact on our lives. People tend to deny that luck is an important determinant. We like explanations. For instance, during a basketball game, there are innumerable random events. If a guy hits three in a row, he’s really hot. Most of the time, it’s random. Of course, the announcer doesn’t want to say, “Oh my! Another random event!” That’s not exciting, so he’ll give a reason. But it is just luck. Not all of our luck is good, but there is more good luck behind our performance than even I like to acknowledge.

Those of us on the outside, it’s easy for us to say whatever we think, because there are no consequences to it. It’s much harder to say, ‘I think the conventional wisdom is full of beans, and I’m not going to go along with it,’ when you’re inside the system and exposed to the possibility of actual failure. I think the people who do this drive the world to get better, whereas the people who snipe at anybody who dares suggest that the conventional wisdom is malarkey are, in my view, gutless conspirators in the mediocrity of the universe.” ([Location 7312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=7312))

Consistency is something to strive for, but it’s not always optimal. Trading is a waiting game. You sit and wait and make a lot of money all at once. The profits tend to come in bunches. The secret is to go sideways between the home runs, not lose too much between them.”12 “What kind of people are getting rich these days? People like John W.

- Human nature never changes. Therefore, the stock market never changes. Only the faces, the pockets, the suckers, and the manipulators, the wars, the disasters and the technologies change. The market itself never changes. How can it? Human nature never changes, and human nature runs the market—not reason, not economics, and certainly not logic. It is our human emotions that drive the market, as they do most other things on this planet. —Jesse Livermore (1940) We are not really interested in people who are experts at the French stock market or German bond markets due to the technical nature of the trading . . . it does not take a huge monster infrastructure: neither Harvard MBAs nor people from Goldman Sachs . . .

- Trend following is as much about observing and understanding human behavior as it is about moving averages, breakouts, and position sizing. Understanding human behavior and how it relates with markets is commonly referred to as behavioral economics or behavioral finance. It evolved from the contradiction between classical economic theory (EMT) and reality. The assumption people act rationally, have identical values and access to information, and use rational decision making is one preposterous assumption. However, trend following strategies only work if price trends continue. But why should trends continue? If prices initially underreact to either good or bad news, trends tend to continue as prices slowly move to fully reflect changes in fundamental value. These trends have the potential to continue even further as investors herd (or chase trends). Herding can cause prices to overreact and move beyond fundamental value after the initial under-reaction. Naturally, all trends must eventually end, as deviation from fair value cannot continue infinitely.3 ([Location 7552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=7552))

- Daniel Kahneman, who was the first psychologist to win the Nobel Prize in Economics (see my podcast episode #212), attributed market manias to investors’ illusion of control, calling the illusion prospect theory. He studied the intellectual underpinnings of investing—how traders estimate odds and calculate risks—to prove how often people act from the mistaken belief they know more than they do. Kahneman and his associate Amos Tversky found a typical person acts on what they christen the law of small numbers—basing broad predictions on narrow samples of data. For instance, if you buy a fund that’s beaten the market three years in a row, you become convinced it’s on a hot streak. People are unable to stop themselves from overgeneralizing the importance of a few supporting facts. Limited statistical evidence satisfies, no matter how inadequate the depiction of reality.5 ([Location 7580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=7580))

- Take a moment to think through your motivations for trading. If you have any reason for trading other than to make money, find something else to do, get a dog, whatever, and avoid the stress. There is nothing good or bad about money. Money is a tool—nothing more, nothing less. Ayn Rand articulates nonjudgmental and rational attitudes about money: You think that money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?12 ([Location 7647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=7647))

- David Harding knows deep in his bones the need for proper risk thinking in all of life. At the University of Cambridge he created a professorship to help improve people’s understanding of the mathematics of risk. Questions requiring a scientific ability to assess the chances of something happening—or not happening—arise all the time. Here are some examples: Following the poisoning of the Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, traces of polonium-210 were found at various locations in London he had visited. Statistically, how probable is it that someone who visited the same locations at a later stage would contract radiation poisoning? An apparently healthy woman is judged to be at risk of breast cancer and is advised to undergo a mastectomy. Should she do so? A person has to cross a main road to reach a few shops. Should he walk straight across the road, or use an available footbridge instead? How sensible would it be for me to invest in the stock market today? Might delaying improve my prospects greatly? A 29-year-old man decides to marry his girlfriend of three years. What is the chance he will meet a more suitable partner at a later stage? As these examples show, risks must considered in the most ordinary of situations and high-pressure environments alike. But always be careful to not torture the statistics as a form of confirmation bias. ([Location 7668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=7668))

When I asked him how he made this determination, he said he put the chart on the other side of the room and if it looked like it was going up, then he would buy it . . . Of course this trade was seen through the eyes of someone with deep insight into the market behavior.”32 Seykota doesn’t pretend to have all the answers, but he is extremely good at turning the mirror back on students so they focus on the self. His precision with language forces one to pay attention. One of his students broke down his teachings into breathing exercises—for me, an immediate connection to yoga and meditation: “The mind is a filter, letting only some information in . . . When you’re designing systems or setting stops, it’s an ever-present part of what you do. My goal is to get in touch with those subconscious processes. A lot of what Seykota does is a breathing technique to achieve an altered state of consciousness where you somehow relax your conscious filters. We did it both unstructured and in a structured way, with ideas to concentrate on, such as, ‘Why do I always do this when I’m trading?’”33 I am nearly five years into my yoga practice. If you have never tried it, please do. In my experience it is my single best tool to de-clutter the mind. You may also enjoy my podcast episode with Andy Puddicombe (#261)—a mediation expert.

The reason is that beliefs guide behavior, which has evolutionary importance among human beings.

- Trend followers excel because they control what they know they can control. They know they can choose a level of risk. They know they can estimate volatility. They know the transaction costs. However, there is still plenty they know they do not know, but in the face of that uncertainty they still step up to the plate and swing. That ability to make a decision is core to trend trading philosophy—that is, swinging the bat without fear. Those decision-making skills might not appear worthy of endless discussion, but the philosophical framework of that decision making is critical to execution. If we were to keep the trend following style in baseball terms, the question would be: “Do you want to play ball or not?” When the pitch comes—if it’s your pitch, swing the bat. There is no time to wait for more information before you swing. In an uncertain world, if you wait until the data is clear, the ball has crossed the plate, you miss the pitch. You are out.

- Tackling the challenge of making smart decisions in a complicated market world is hardly new. As far back as the fourteenth century, when medieval life was as rigidly complex as its cathedrals, philosophers grappled with how to make simple decisions when pressed for time. In any scientific realm, especially when a new set of data requires the creation of a new theory, many hypotheses are proposed, studied, and rejected. And even when all unfit hypotheses are thrown out, several might remain. In some cases they reach the same end, but have different underlying assumptions. To choose among similar theories, scientists (and trend traders) use Occam’s razor. ([Location 8136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8136))

- Occam’s razor is a principle attributed to logician and Franciscan friar William of Occam. The principle states entities must not be multiplied unnecessarily. In its original Latin form, Occam’s razor is Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate. This bit of Latin still underlies all scientific modeling and decision making. A common interpretation of the principle is the simplest of two or more competing theories is preferable.7 Occam’s razor does not guarantee the simplest solution will be correct, but it focuses priorities.

- Trend following is inherently simple, but very few want to believe—especially many respected market players—that something simple can make money consistently. The reason trend followers do well is because they stay focused and very disciplined. They execute their game plan—that is their real strength.19 Not everyone agrees with the science of fast and frugal heuristics. One group said, “This can’t be true, it’s all wrong, or it could never be replicated.” Among them were financial advisors, who certainly didn’t like the results. Another group said, “This is no surprise. I knew it all along. The stock market’s all rumor, recognition, and psychology.”20 However, staying exclusively with the simple heuristic of price is tricky. Traders can’t help trying to improve. They become impatient or even bored with systems. Far too many like to make decisions even if those decisions are short-term emotional fixes that have zero to do with making a profit. For example, let’s say you have a buy signal for Google. You must buy the stock if it follows rules. You must trust the rules and your decision making to follow the rules. Don’t make it more complicated than it is—buy when you get the signal. That’s not to say that trend following in its entirety is elementary. However, the decisions that go along with it should be processes you can jot out on the back of a napkin.

- opposed to ‘help me understand so I can decide what to do.’ . . . Wall Street analysts are theory-free investors. All they can do is react to the numbers. But the numbers they react to are measures of past performance, not future performance. That’s why they go in big herds. Wall Street professionals and business consultants have enshrined as a virtue the notion you should be [fundamental] data-driven. That is the root of companies’ inability to take action in a timely way.”22 Christensen drives home again that you must make decisions without all the facts. You cannot foresee how a changing market will look until change has taken place, and then it’s too late. Take, for example, an up and down stock such as Yahoo!. You probably said, “I should have bought here and sold there.” But there was no way you could have predicted the future of Yahoo!. You could only act early before the direction of the trend was obvious. You must be in ready, set, go mode, long before pundits say the coast is clear. They are the herders Christensen slams—those in the sheep business. ([Location 8229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8229))

- The decision-making process is that—a process. You can’t make decisions based on what you want the outcome to be. Michael Mauboussin has long presented a compelling argument for process: In too many cases, investors dwell solely on outcomes without appropriate consideration of process. The focus on results is to some degree understandable. Results—the bottom line—are what ultimately matter. And results are typically easier to assess and more objective than evaluating processes. But investors often make the critical mistake of assuming that good outcomes are the result of a good process and that bad outcomes imply a bad process. In contrast, the best long-term performers in any probabilistic field—such as investing, sports team management, and pari-mutuel betting—all emphasize process over outcome.24 ([Location 8253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8253))

You can also lose a good bet, no matter how sound the underlying proposition, but if you keep placing good bets, over time, the law of averages will be working for you.” ([Location 8271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8271))

- Trading your money necessarily means dealing with numbers and varying quantities—like a physics experiment. But the connection goes deeper. Physics is at its core about developing mathematical models of our world. Those models may describe different types of complexity such as the movement of molecules in a gas or the dynamics of stars in a galaxy. And it turns out similar models can be applied to analogous complex behavior in financial markets.4 When I use the term science of trading, it is not a reference to the engineers or scientists who develop elegant and complex academic models prone to fragility (trend following is in the antifragile headspace). Keeping it simple is hard because it is hardest to do what is obvious. Famed physicist, Nobel Prize winner, and Manhattan Project scientist Richard Feynman beautifully sums up the needed mindset in his classic 1960s lecture: ([Location 8453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8453))

- In general, we look for a new law by the following process. First, we guess it (audience laughter), no, don’t laugh, that’s really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess, to see what, if this is right, if this law we guess is right, to see what it would imply and then we compare the computation results to nature, or we say compare to experiment or experience, compare it directly with observations to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it. He added: It is much more likely that the reports on flying saucers are the result of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence, rather than the unknown rational efforts of extraterrestrial intelligence. It’s just more likely, that’s all. And it’s a good guess. We always try to guess the most likely explanation, keeping in the back of our mind that if it doesn’t work, then we must discuss the other possibilities.5 ([Location 8462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8462))

- Critical Thinking Trend followers, like physicists, approach the investing landscape with an open mind. They examine, experiment and A/B test to find solid ground. Like physicists they think critically and develop the ability to ask the right questions, including: Digging deep to face the real problem, instead of mindlessly going for the easy superficial query. Being completely honest regarding the real reason you might want an answer. Discovering how to interpret information before asking the question—in other words, questions that offer the opportunity to make a midcourse correction. Facing cold, hard facts about human nature. Facing the reality of where the new answer might lead. Facing subjective takes on the world and factoring in objective data. Seek questions that engender important details that might be missed because people did not ask.7 Charles Faulkner prioritized his favorites: “The questions that are most critical—in both senses of that word—are the ones that question our assumptions, our assumptions of what is or is not a fact or a  truth or possible. After this comes questions that assist statistical  thinking.” You must be determined to know what is real. You do not avoid asking a question if you’re suspicious you might not like the answer. You do not ask self-serving questions that reinforce an opinion you already have. You do not ask mindless questions or accept mindless answers. You are content to ask questions knowing there might not be an answer. This is not an easy process for the masses. Most go the wrong way every time. The questions become superficial and ill-informed because they have not taken ownership. Instead they ask dead-end questions, “Is this going to be on the test?” Their questions demonstrate a complete lack of desire to think. They might as well be sitting in silence with minds on pause. To think critically, you must want to stimulate your intellect with questions that lead to more questions. You must undo the damage previous traditional rote memorization schooling has done to your curiosity. You need to want to resuscitate your mind.8 Linear versus Nonlinear Chaos theory dictates a nonlinear universe. Our world does not move in a straight line.

- Jean-Jacques Chenier, like Parker, knows markets are far less linear and efficient than the typical view. Remember, not everyone across markets plays to win. Some might be hedgers, playing to lose, using the markets as insurance: “The Bank of Japan will intervene to push the yen lower . . . a commercial bank in Japan will repatriate yen assets overseas just to window dress its balance sheets for the end of the fiscal year. These activities create liquidity but it is inefficient liquidity that can be exploited.”19 To better understand Parker’s words, it helps to break down the concepts of skew and kurtosis. Skew measures the statistical likelihood of a return in the tail of a distribution being higher or lower than commonly associated with a normal distribution. For example, a return series of –30 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent has a mean of 0 percent. Only one return is less than 0 percent, whereas three are higher but the one that is negative is much farther from the  mean (0 percent) than the positive ones. This is called negative  skewness. Negative skewness occurs when the… ([Location 8563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8563))

- Trend following exhibits a positive skew return profile. Kurtosis, on the other hand, measures the degree to which exceptional values, much larger or smaller than the average, occur more frequently (high kurtosis) or less frequently (low kurtosis) than in a normal (bell-shaped) distribution. High kurtosis results in exceptional values called fat tails, which indicate a higher percentage of very low and very high returns than would be expected with a normal distribution.23 Skew may be either positive or negative and affects distribution symmetry. Positive skew means there is a higher probability for a significant positive return than for a negative return the same distance from the mean. Skew will measure the direction of surprises. Outliers, or extremes in performance not normally associated with a distribution, will clearly affect skewness. The crash of 1987 is usually considered an extreme outlier. For example, a positive outlier will stretch the right-hand tail of the distribution. Because this method eliminates losing positions and holds profitable positions, historically there has been a tendency for positive outliers and a higher chance of positive returns. A negative skew results in a higher probability of a significantly negative event for the same distance from the mean.24 These concepts are not as entertaining as listening to the latest money… ([Location 8575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8575))

- Warren Buffett is positioned as the single biggest proponent of value investing and buy and holding—accurate or not. Like Sir Galahad,  he has achieved his real Holy Grail, and I am the first to salute his immense success. However, can you achieve what he has via insurance companies and arcane tax advantages? No. He is the classic exception to the rule. There is only one Buffett. Unfortunately, many mistakenly assume Buffett is the simple buy and hold investor: “Honey, Warren made all of his money holding Coke for 40 years!” Uh, his $60+ billion net worth is far more complex than that. For example, Buffett was once against financial derivatives: “‘Things are less lucrative in the stock market. We have more money than ideas,’ he said, adding that 6 percent to 7 percent was a fair rate of return in the current environment. The company has more than $37 billion in cash to invest. One place the money certainly won’t go is derivatives. ‘There’s no place with as much potential for phony numbers as derivatives.’ Buffett’s billionaire vice chairman, Charlie Munger, couldn’t resist chiming in. ‘To say that derivative accounting is a sewer is an insult to sewage.’”8 Sixteen days later, Buffett changed tune: “Berkshire Hathaway Inc. announced today that it has sold $400 million of a new type of security, named ‘SQUARZ,’ in a private placement to qualified institutional investors . . . ‘Despite the lack of precedent, a negative coupon security seemed possible in the present interest rate environment. I asked Goldman Sachs to create such an instrument and they responded promptly with the innovative security being announced today,’ said Warren Buffett.”10 If Buffett was forthright at first, what made him change two weeks later and create an instrument so complicated and secretive not even his press release could explain it? Even more confusing is that Buffett contradicted himself a year later, lambasting with vigor his financial Frankenstein creation: “Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers, while now latent, are potentially lethal . . . We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.”11 In 2008 Buffett was again trading derivatives, and helping to promote government bailouts. Still today, in 2017, his firm maintains massive derivative positions. The Buffett legend of value investing or buy and hold as his strategy to make billions has permeated the public consciousness with books by the literal dozens. And when he launches a new derivatives strategy against his legend, no one talks. Long-time fund manager Michael Steinhardt was the exception: “[Buffett] is the greatest PR person of recent times. And he has managed to achieve a snow job that has conned virtually everyone in the press to my knowledge . . . and it is remarkable that he continues to do it.”12 Warren Buffett is an investing icon and deserves high praise, but unlike trend following, where there are examples of multiple… ([Location 8902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=8902))

- “Could the typical small investor have discovered a year ago that Enron was  on the brink of disaster? It’s highly unlikely. Still, if you looked for the right thing, you would have never bought Enron in the first place.”15 Hold on, there was a way to spot Enron’s problems. The price going from $90 to 50 cents was a clear indication the brink of disaster was right around the corner hiding in plain sight. Jesse Livermore knew 80 years earlier how to avoid averaging losers: I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most common practice. Great numbers of people buy a stock, let us say at 50, and two or three days later if they can buy it at 47 they are seized with the urge to average down by buying another hundred shares, making a price of 48.5 on all. Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second shares. If one is to apply such an unsound principle, he should keep on averaging by buying 200 at 44, then 400 at 41, 800 at 38, 1,600 at 35, 3,200 at 32, 6,400 at 29, and so on. How many speculators could stand such pressure? So, at the risk of repetition and preaching, let me urge you to avoid averaging down.

- From an early age, we are all conditioned by our families, our schools, and virtually every other shaping force in our society to avoid risk. To take risks is inadvisable; to play it safe is the counsel we are accustomed both to receiving and to passing on. In the conventional wisdom, risk is asymmetrical: it has only one side, the bad side. In my experience—and all I presume to offer you today is observations drawn on my own experience, which is hardly the wisdom of the ages—in my experience, this conventional view of risk is shortsighted and often simply mistaken. My first observation is that successful people understand that risk, properly conceived, is often highly productive rather than something to avoid. They appreciate that risk is an advantage to be used rather than a pitfall to be skirted. Such people understand that taking calculated risks is quite different from being rash. This view of risk is not only unorthodox, it is paradoxical—the first of several paradoxes which I’m going to present to you today. This one might be encapsulated as follows: Playing it safe is dangerous. Far more often than you would realize, the real risk in life turns out to be the refusal to take  a risk.4 ([Location 9539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9539))

Blind risk is the calling card of laziness, the irrational hope, something for nothing, the cold twist of fate. Blind risk is the pointless gamble, the emotional decision, and the sucker play. The man who embraces blind risk demonstrates all the wisdom and intelligence of a drunk. However, calculated risk builds fortunes, nations, and empires. Calculated risk and bold vision go hand in hand. To use your mind, to see the possibilities, to work things out logically and then to move forward in strength and confidence is what places humans above animal.

The only way for everyone to succeed is to ignore the blonde and hit on the brunettes. This scene dramatizes the Nash Equilibrium, his most important contribution to game theory. Nash proved in any competitive situation—war, chess, even picking up a date at a bar—if the participants are rational and they know that opponents are rational, there is only one optimal strategy. That theory won Nash a Nobel Prize in economics and transformed the way we think about competition in both games and the real world.10 Building off Nash’s work Ed Seykota lays out a basic risk definition: “Risk is the possibility of loss.” That is, if you own a stock, and there is a possibility of a price decline, you are at risk. The stock is not the risk, nor is loss the risk. The possibility of loss is risk. As long as you own the stock you are at risk. The only way to control risk is to exit. In the matter of trading stocks for profit, risk is unavoidable, and the best you can do is to manage the risk. Risk management is to direct and control the possibility of your loss. The activities of a risk manager are to measure risk and to increase and decrease risk by buying and selling. In general, good risk management combines several elements: Clarifying trading and risk management systems until they can translate to computer code. Include diversification and instrument selection in the back-testing process. Back-testing and stress-testing to determine trading parameter sensitivity and optimal values. Clear agreement among all parties regarding volatility and return expectations. ([Location 9602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9602))

- Five Questions Answer the following five questions and you will have the core components of a trend following trading system—and be on your way to having your edge: How does the system know what to buy or sell? How does the system know how much to buy or sell? How does the system buy or sell short? How does the system get out of a losing position? How does the system get out of a winning position? These five questions are seminal to trend following, but no less important is attitude. Don’t forget: “What do you want? Why are you trading? What are your strengths and weaknesses? Do you have any emotional issues? How disciplined are you? Are you easily convinced? How confident are you in yourself? How confident are you in your system?

- Money management is like sex: Everyone does it, one way or another, but not many like to talk about it and some do it better than others. When any trader makes a decision to buy or sell short, they must also decide at that time how many shares or contracts to buy or sell—the order form on every brokerage page has a blank spot where the size of the order is specified. The essence of risk management is making a logical decision about how much to buy or sell when you fill in this blank. This decision determines the risk of the trade. Accept too much risk and you increase the odds that you will go bust; take too little risk and you will not be rewarded in sufficient quantity to beat the transaction costs and the overhead of your efforts. Good money management practice is about finding the sweet spot between these undesirable extremes. ([Location 9703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9703))

- Placing a trade with a predetermined stop-loss point can be compared to placing a bet: The more money risked, the larger the bet. Conservative betting produces conservative performance, while bold betting leads to spectacular ruin. A bold trader placing large bets feels pressure—or heat—from the volatility of the portfolio. A hot portfolio keeps more at risk than does a cold one. Portfolio heat seems to be associated with personality preference; bold traders prefer and are able to take more heat, while more conservative traders generally avoid the circumstances that give rise to heat. In portfolio management, we call the distributed bet size the heat of the portfolio. A diversified portfolio risking 2 percent on each of five instruments has a total heat of 10 percent, as does a portfolio risking 5 percent on each of two  instruments.16 A student of Ed Seykota’s adds: “There has to be some governor so I don’t end up with a whole lot of risk. The size of the bet is small around 2 percent.” Seykota calls his risk-adjusted equity “core equity” and the risk tolerance percentage “heat.” Heat can be turned up or down to suit the trader’s pain tolerance—as the heat gets higher, so do the gains, but only up to a point. Past that point more heat starts to reduce the gain. Traders must be able to select a heat level where they are comfortable.17 ([Location 9727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9727))

- One trend trader outlined the simplicity: “As our systems are designed to send a buy or sell signal only when a clear trend develops. By definition, we never get in at the beginning of a trend or get out at the top.”20 If your goal is to ride a trend that starts at 50 and goes to 100, it does not make a difference whether you got in at 52 or 60 or 70. Even if you got in at 70 and the trend went to 100, you still made a lot. Now, if you got in at 52 (and how you think you might predict the bottom, I will never know) you made more money than if you got in at 70. There are plenty of traders out there who think, “Oh, I couldn’t get in at 52 so I won’t get in at all even if I have the chance to get in at 70.” ([Location 9766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9766))

- Technical indicators, however, are small components of the overall trading system. They are some of the tools needed in the trading toolkit, but not the kit itself. A technical indicator accounts for maybe 10 percent of the overall trading success. When some trader opines, “I tried indicator X and found it was worthless” or “I tried indicator Y and found it useful,” that makes no sense. These statements imply an indicator is the actual trading system. By itself a technical indicator is meaningless. That means the suits that come on CNBC every week to talk technicals are meaningless?

- The logic of cutting losses and then cutting them even more has been around far longer than trend following, as Bernard Baruch notes: “If a speculator is correct half of the time, he is hitting a good average. Even being right 3 or 4 times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he is wrong.” For example, you enter GOOG with a 2 percent stop loss. This means if you lose 2 percent, you exit. Period. Get out. Don’t debate it. Look back at the British pound trade in my Chapter 2 Dunn profile. That chart (see Figure 2.3) shows the constant starts and stops. Dunn keeps receiving entry signals and then exit signals. The trend is up and then it is down. He enters and then exits. Dunn knows he can’t predict the direction of the British pound. He only knows he has received an entry signal, so he gets on board. Then he receives an exit right after that, so he gets out. Then another entry signal, then another exit comes. Dunn did say he “rides the bucking bronco.” Traders call these back-and-forth swings whipsaws. Whipsaws are quick ups and downs that go nowhere. Your trade is jerked, or whipsawed, back and forth, causing small losses due to lack of sustained trends. Seykota says the only way to avoid whipsaws is to stop trading (see his “Whipsaw” song on YouTube). Whipsaws are part of the game. Don’t want to live with them—don’t trade.

- You have seen the headline hype: “Use Japanese candlesticks to spot reversals” or “Determine support and resistance” or “Learn proper profit-taking.” Stop. You can’t spot reversals until they happen. There is no way to define the concept of support and resistance as 100 people could have 100 different definitions. These directions all try to do the impossible—predict. Tom Basso slams profit objectives: “A new trader approaches an old trend follower and asks, ‘What’s your objective on this trade?’ The old trend follower replies that his objective is for the position to go to the moon.” Exiting a winning position can be a challenge because you have to be comfortable with letting a trend run as far as it can, crest, and then begin to decline before considering an exit with profits. Say you are up 100 percent in paper profits. If you cash in, those paper profits become real. But you have made a big mistake because you limited yourself in how much you could make. If you are long several positions, and there are huge open profits on the table, and the trend is still up—that is not the time to get out of a winner. Profit targets cap profits. For example, you enter at 100 and before you ever enter, you establish you will exit if the price reaches a  25 percent gain or 125. The idea of a profit target sounds wise at first blush. However, if you are riding a trend you have to let it go as far as it can go. You need to fully exploit the move. You don’t want to exit at 125 and watch the trend go to 225. Although profit targets keep you from getting to 225, they also play a damaging role in the overall trend following portfolio. Trend following needs those home runs to pay for its whipsaw losses. If you are artificially creating a profit target for no other reason than comfort, you are limiting potential for big trends. This, in turn, limits the ability to cover the small losses you’ve incurred. If you had used profit targets, there is no way you would have been around to win the huge profits from the events described in Chapter 4. Trend following profits come from the meat, or middle, of a trend (see Figure 10.1): ([Location 9834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9834))

- When you mechanize a trend following trading system, you take all discretionary judgments and build them into rules. For example, if you are uncomfortable with a high level of risk, you make a rule that sets a tolerable risk level. If you trade a currency-only portfolio, you make rules for that contingency from the outset. The logic is to hardwire all scenarios you could possibly see in advance across your portfolio. If a market rises 100 percent in short order you have rules that dictate the action to take. If a market loses 10 percent, follow the rules. You must have an unambiguous plan established in advance. It also helps to constantly be aware of the downside. Larry Hite gives that legendary stoic perspective: “We approach markets backwards. The first thing we ask is not what can we make, but how much can we lose. We play a defensive game.” ([Location 9857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=9857))

- Early in my trading career I found myself hung up on the “need” to be right rather than the “desire” to make money. I learned early that being “right,” of having a high percentage of winners, had very little to do with my overall trading success. Those who have a need to be right with a high percentage of winners will find themselves passing on their best trading opportunities, assuming they use some degree of discretion in their trade selections. One of my trading buddies enjoys a trading success rate annually of around 15 percent winners with 50 percent losers and 35 percent breakeven trades. In 2005, he made over 300 percent on his initial beginning of year trading capital [of] a seven-figure account. This is a risk-reward numbers game and most who think it is something else usually face a “forced awareness” at some point in their trading careers.

- Larry Hite paints the picture of that risk choice: Life is nothing more than a series of bets and bets are really nothing more than questions and their answers. There is no real difference between, “Should I take another hit on this Blackjack hand?” and “Should I get out of the way of that speeding and wildly careening bus?” Each shares two universal truths: a set of probabilities of potential outcomes and the singular outcome that takes place. Every day, we place hundreds, if not thousands, of bets—large and small, some seemingly well considered, and others made without a second thought. The vast majority of the latter, life’s little gambles made without any thought, might certainly be trivial. “Should I tie my shoes?” Seems to offer no big risk, nor any big reward. While others, such as the aforementioned speeding and wildly careening bus, would seem to have greater impact on our lives. However, if deciding not to tie your shoes that morning causes you to trip and fall down in the middle of the road when you finally decide to fold your hand and give that careening bus plenty of leeway, well then, in hindsight the trivial has suddenly become paramount.

- Michael: I know you look at trend following from not only a trading perspective, but a life perspective. Ed: I think if you’re going to really be a trend follower you’re going to have a lot of trouble limiting it to one area. Because let’s say you have a trend following system. You say, “I’m going to have a diversified portfolio, a trend following portfolio. I’m going to free myself up from emotions. Emotions have always been a big problem here, so I’m going to have a diversified trend following portfolio or I’m going to invest in somebody else’s portfolio and that’s going to fix this emotional problem.” Then what happens? Their investment or their portfolio goes up and down and they get emotional problems with that. You don’t really fix your emotions by having a system. What you do is you just move them up stream. You have constituents within the portfolio that used to bother you, and they went up or down, and then now you have a portfolio that goes up and down so you just move the problem upstream. Ultimately you have to say, “What is it that I’m feeling and what do I do when I feel these things and can I come up with better and more useful or productive ways of responding when the thing goes up and down?” Eventually, you’ve got to come to terms with that. The best trend followers are the ones that have made peace with themselves, “This is what I do in the case of things going up or down, with the value increasing and decreasing. This is how I behave and this is how I act,” and of course as you know, there are all kinds of things you can do when things go up. Some people, when something goes up, they sell. Some people when things go up, they buy and when they keep going up some people sell more and some people buy more. And if you go to extremes in either of those cases you’re counterproductive, self-destructive. You’ve got to know how to do that and you’ve got to do it consistently. You’ve got to do it in your personal life. If you do these things in your personal life as well it supports trend following. Because if you’re not in alignment between your overall philosophy, how you behave as a person, and you try to do trend following, there’s going to be conflicts. And so we in Trading Tribe hardly ever talk about actual trading or what the markets are doing. What we’re working with is the emotional reaction to volatility or emotional reaction to loss or to structure or authority or all these other issues. If people straighten these things out, their relationships with their significant others or their children get better. They report more satisfaction in all areas of life. And oh, incidentally, their trading is getting better. They don’t quite know how that happened, but they’ve turned into a person that now can cope with uncertainty and can cope with volatility, and they couldn’t do it before. You can’t take a system and use that to medicate your feelings.

- there’s commonalities with some of your work and the Eastern thought process. Do you see that? Ed: I believe every feeling has a positive intention. For instance, if you’re in the house and you smell smoke, you hear crackling sounds, and notice the temperature going up in the room and you conclude that maybe the house is on fire. That would be a really good time to feel anxiety, take some action and respond to it. I’m not so sure you want to medicate your mind, anesthetize yourself and put yourself into a meditative state where you don’t respond. That’s not really what I’m saying. You want to notice the feeling you’re having in the moment and act appropriately and you want to learn the difference between medicating a feeling and responding to it proactively. I’m not suggesting you always aim towards peacefulness; sometimes you want to get busy. You might want to get busy and put a trade on or you might want to get busy and take some corrective action, some risk control. Or you might want to take some action and get into some opportunity.

I try to learn and study my responses and say, “Can I change the response?” And that’s what we do in the Trading Tribe.

- the clients, but the problem was it made far less money for the brokerage house. Because they were used to day traders, they were used to people coming in and lasting a few months, losing their money, moving on and doing something else. That’s the way the brokerage house was set up. People would come in, try to trade, lose their money, and leave. They said, “The commissions are like a tenth of what they used to be. They’re just staying with positions and this is going to wreck our business model.” And so there were all kinds of pressures to get people to trade more often . . . like you pointed out in some of your letters to me. Well, they’ve got fancy names for it now like disposition effect. But in those days, people just didn’t want to hold on to something. It would go up a little a bit and they would want to take their profit. Went down a little bit, they wanted to add more and hope it’ll go back up. You had lots of pressures against following systems in those days and so I invented something that no one really wanted. Then I left and I went out on my own. Found clients and I found that some of the most important things was developing a relationship with the clients. So that they knew what to expect and they knew what was going on.

- The point here is that you do have to understand your client’s drivers. What is it they are looking for in their portfolio? What do they expect? It isn’t a question of us sort of sitting on one side of the table saying, “What do you want? We’ve got it. You just ask, we’ll give you that.” But understanding what drives the decision-making process, who their stake holders are. [For example], we have two products. We have our original quantitative fund which is higher volatility, it’s 20 percent, it’s high octane, it’s 2/20 fee, so it’s very much in that mold of high-octane very diversified systematic macro and micro trading. We also have another product which is lower volatility. It’s 10 percent volatility. It’s much more scalable. It’s got more basic trend and more basic value strategies in there, and it’s available to investors at a half and ten. Now, understanding your investor means that you can understand what their internal desires are: What do they need? Maybe they want low cost, very functional, but they want a low-cost system where it’s lower volatility and the headline numbers are smaller. We all know that investing in a 20 percent volatility product is too risky, then all you have to do is invest half your money in the  20 percent volatility product and keep half of it in ([Location 11765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=11765))

- your pocket, and you’ve got a 10 percent volatility investment. But somehow that doesn’t feel the same as a 10 percent volatility product, for reasons that I really don’t get. The pure mathematician in me says that’s nuts. But nonetheless it is true and I’m human, too, obviously, and I feel that. It is important to understand your investor, who their stake holders are, and by understanding that and communicating with investors at the right level. None of our investors need to know or cares about the deep statistical details which might be embedded in some non-linear Bayesian-regression portfolio algorithm. That sounds great but they kind of don’t care and they shouldn’t care about that. But they should care about things like culture, technology, people, the search processes, and these are all things that we can explain and want to explain in great detail. And if you can understand what your investor needs and wants, then maybe you can explain those things better. I always feel that I’m not really in that camp of—and our industry is quite bad at this—“If I told you about my models I’d have to shoot you.” That’s quite common, that sort of, “I have to be massively secret, can’t tell you about it,” thing.

Ewan: That’s the way it works. That’s an interesting thing for people. When people say, “Trend following hasn’t worked for three years.” I explain, if you take a simple trend following model and run it across 100 assets, when trend following’s working really well it’s maybe working on 60 assets and not working on 40, and when it’s not working it’s working on 45 assets and not working on 55 assets. There’s never really been a period in history where trend following hasn’t worked on something, it just hasn’t worked enough. And . . .

All these equity papers are dealing with this cross-sectional momentum where you compare one stock to another and things like that, and they get into the efficient markets of whether it should exist, doesn’t exist.

There’s no guarantee that things will work out that way in the future, but it’s performed that way. But what’s interesting about the last bunch of months, we really weren’t at a crisis period, but there’s still those trend following performances coming out from a fairly low-volatility, zero interest rates environment. If somebody was to couch trend following as only crisis alpha [also known as a black swan], that would be a mistake?

Because it tends to make money from whether it’s inflation shocks or downturns in equities or something else going on somewhere. Typically, volatility picks up during those periods and it makes money somewhere, but it’s not only that.

- We have all these things like adaptive market hypothesis and behavioral theory and things like that, but at the end of the day what I would tell people is the markets are some sort of a risk transfer mechanism. You cannot assume that just because you’re smart you will suck money out of the markets. If you think of it like a poker game, it could be a zero-sum game. You could be the best player, but then your profits will come down not because your skill goes down, but because the other people at the table will just leave the game. Is it a game of zero-sum kind of outsmarting people? Or is it a natural phenomenon in the markets, almost kind of like providing insurance? Larry talked about this in our last talk about relating trend following to insurance. I say there are natural occurring things in the markets.

- Value investing, right? It’s been scientifically, dare I say, proven or shown with data that value investing works because a lot of investors don’t want to hold those stocks when they go down, and you actually are in an economic rent-type of risk premium if you hold them. There are other examples in the markets where you’re actually providing value to the markets by doing a certain thing. That’s what makes it lasting. Because there’s no way for 800 years you could find some gimmick that makes money where you would only do that if nobody else knew about it. There’s no way you can get away with that for 800 years. Somebody from my class will figure it out and then it’ll be gone. This happens a lot with some high-frequency traders and those things like that. The science is the natural element that what we’re actually doing, what trend following is actually doing is providing liquidity to hedgers, and it’s creating an equilibrium in the markets, and we have to get paid for that. That’s why this has worked for 800 years. If the price of oil, for example, is going up, right now it’s going down, but if it’s going up, the airline companies will almost certainly need to sell oil to lock in the future price. They’re not in the business of counter-trend trading; they just need to sell it to lock in the future price. We at that point buy it—it gets just a little technical but it’s conceptually establishing the fact that it’s a natural occurring concept.

As you know Buffett is running Berkshire Hathaway, and one way to look at his performance is to follow that stock price. But you could also see the publicly traded stocks that he holds. Berkshire Hathaway has to make a filing to the SEC about the publicly traded stocks they own, so we can put together a portfolio and simulate that portfolio at the same time. The first thing we looked at is just how good is Warren Buffett? How good do you need to be to become one of the richest people in the world? And it turns out his Sharpe ratio is just over 0.7, between 0.7 and 0.8, which surprised a lot of people when we showed them this number, because a lot of people had assumed that he had a Sharpe ratio above 1 or even above 2, as a lot of hedge funds are bragging about numbers in that range.

- high returns, but he has also had quite significant risk, leaving him with a Sharpe ratio which is still incredibly impressive, because it’s about double the Sharpe ratio of the market. For the risk he’s taking, which has been substantial, he’s over the long haul been able to deliver double the return relative to that of the market. It’s really an astonishing performance. Our research doesn’t in any way try to diminish that incredible accomplishment, but when other researchers have looked at it, they have [simply] recognized he’s a value investor. He talks about being a value investor, and you can also regress his return on the returns of being a value investor which is called a value factor. That factor explains some of his performance, but only a small part, and it leaves [out] a huge alpha that’s a big unexplained part. What we then did is say, “Let’s also regress on the return to what we call a quality investor.” What he buys are not just cheap stocks but he also buys high-quality stocks. He talks about that in his speeches and his writings—that he really likes to buy high-quality companies at a reasonable price. When we actually regress him on both the standard factor, including value factor, as well as what we call quality minus junk, and also a factor that captures more safe stocks, called betting against beta, then it turns out we can actually explain a large part of his performance, and get us a strategy that looks very ([Location 12802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=12802))

Yes, he’s a value investor, he’s a quality investor, he likes to buy stable, profitable, high-quality companies at a reasonable price, and those types of stocks have done well in general. The interesting finding is it’s not just the quality firms that he has been buying that have done well and have been good investments, it’s quality firms in general. Those types of stocks in general have performed well, and he has benefited from being a very early investor to recognize that and exploit it. And he’s been able to leverage it through his insurance company in a very clever and very smart way and really perform extremely well as a result of those investment choices and that leverage strategy.

- How should we modify our beliefs in the light of additional information? Do we cling to old assumptions long after they’ve become untenable, or abandon them too readily at the first whisper of doubt? Bayesian reasoning promises to bring our views gradually into line with reality and sync up with the universe. The theorem itself can be stated simply. Beginning with a provisional hypothesis about the world (there are, of course, no other kinds), we assign to it an initial probability called the prior probability or simply the prior. After actively collecting or happening upon some potentially relevant evidence, we use Bayes’s theorem to recalculate the probability of the hypothesis in light of the new evidence. This revised probability is called the posterior probability or simply the posterior.5 Cross-Validation means assessing not only how well a model fits the data it’s given, but how well it generalizes to data it hasn’t seen.

- Academicians settled on volatility as the proxy for risk as a  matter of convenience. They needed a number for their calculations that was objective and could be ascertained historically and extrapolated into the future. Volatility fits the bill, and most of the other types of risk do not. The problem with all of this, however, is that I just don’t think volatility is the risk most investors care about. Rather than volatility, I think that people decline to make investments primarily because they’re worried about a loss of capital or an unacceptably low return. To me, “I need more upside potential because I’m afraid I could lose money” makes an awful lot more sense than “I need more upside potential because I’m afraid the price may fluctuate.” No, I’m sure “risk” is—first and foremost—the likelihood of losing money. —Howard Marks1 ([Location 13050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=13050))

- One common type of trend following strategy is a channel breakout strategy. A channel breakout signal takes a long (short) position when a signal breaks out of a certain upper (lower) boundary for a range of values. Using a simple channel breakout signal, a trend following investor might have entered a long position before November 25th, 1636 and would have exited the trade (by selling tulip bulbs and eventually short selling if that was even possible) around February 9th, 1637. A trend following investor simply “follows the trend” and cuts losses when the trend seems to disappear. In the case of tulips, a trend following investor might have ridden the bubble upward and sold when prices started to fall. This approach would have led to a sizeable return rather than a handful of flower bulbs and economic ruin. Although it is one rather esoteric example, the tulip bulb example demonstrates that there may be something robust or fundamental about the performance of a dynamic strategy like trend following over the long run. It is important to note that in this example, as in most financial markets, the exit decision seems to be more important than the entry. The importance of cutting your losses and taking profits seems to drive performance. This is a concept that is revisited often throughout the course of this book.

- Since around 1300 A.D., the median long-term bond yield has averaged around 5.8 percent. Despite the intuitive/fundamental importance of interest rate regimes, the correlation between the level of interest rates and trend following returns is only 0.14. To see if different regimes have an impact on trend following performance, interest rate levels can be divided into high and low. A high interest rate regime can be defined by a year where the average yield is above the median, and a low-interest rate regime can be defined by a year where the average yield is below the median.

- In practice, it is not only the level of interest rates but also the relative movements in interest rates that impacts markets. To evaluate the impact of changes in interest rate, the yield differential from year-end to year-end can be computed. If the change over a time period is positive (negative), the year is defined as a rising (falling) interest rate year. The correlation between the change in yield and trend following returns is close to zero, suggesting that the difference in trend following performance, during periods of either rising or falling interest rates, does not seem to be significant.

- The above results show that long-term trends exist across all asset classes and are stable in time. As mentioned in the Introduction, trending behavior is also observed in the idiosyncratic component of individual stocks (Barroso and Santa-Clara 2013; Kent and Moskowitz 2013; Narasimhan and Titman 1993, 2011; Geczy and Samonov, 2016). What can explain such universal, persistent behavior of prices? We can find two (possibly complementary) broad families of interpretation in the literature. One explanation assumes that agents underreact to news and only progressively include the available information in prices (Hong  and Stein 1999; Kent et al. 1998).

- this could be an announced sequence of rate increases by a central bank over several months, which is not immediately reflected in bond prices because market participants tend to only believe in what they see and are slow to change their previous expectations (“conservatism bias”). In general, changes of policy (for governments, central banks, or indeed companies) are slow and progressive. If correctly anticipated, prices should immediately reflect the end point of the policy change. Otherwise, prices will progressively follow the announced changes and this inertia leads to trends.

- Risk RISK is the possibility of loss. That is, if we own some stock, and there is a possibility of a price decline, we are at risk. The stock is not the risk, nor is the loss the risk. The possibility of loss is the risk. As long as we own the stock, we are at risk. The only way to control the risk is to buy or sell stock. In the matter of owning stocks, and aiming for profit, risk is fundamentally unavoidable and the best we can do is to manage the risk. Risk Management To manage is to direct and control.

- The Uncle Point From the standpoint of a diversified portfolio, the individual component instruments subsume into the overall performance.

- attitudes, and management approaches that investors apply to individual stocks. In particular, one of the most important and perhaps under-acknowledged dimensions of fund management is the UNCLE POINT, or the amount of drawdown that provokes a loss of confidence in either the investors or the fund management. If either the investors or the managers become demoralized and withdraw from the enterprise, then the fund dies. Since the circumstances surrounding the Uncle Point are generally disheartening, it seems to receive, unfortunately, little attention in the literature. In particular, at the initial point of sale of the fund, the Uncle Point typically receives little mention, aside from the requisite and rather obscure notice in associated regulatory documentation. This is unfortunate, since a mismatch in the understanding of the Uncle Point between the investors and the management can lead to one or the other giving up, just when the other most needs reassurance and reinforcement of commitment. In times of stress, investors and managers do not access obscure legal agreements, they access their primal gut feelings. This is particularly important in high-performance, high-volatility trading where drawdowns are a frequent aspect of the enterprise. Without conscious agreement on an Uncle Point, risk managers typically must assume, by default to safety, that the Uncle Point is rather close and so they seek ways to keep the volatility low. As we have seen above, safe, low-volatility systems rarely provide the highest returns. Still, the pressures and tensions from the default expectations of low-volatility performance create a demand for measurements to detect and penalize volatility.

- Skewness Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, lack of symmetry, of a random variable’s probability distribution of returns around the mean. Stated a different way, skewness compares the length of the two “tails” of the distribution curve. If the distribution is impacted more by negative outliers than positive outliers (or vice versa), the distribution will no longer be symmetrical. Therefore, skewness tells us how outlier events impact the shape of the distribution. A positive skew value indicates a tendency for values to fall below the mean with the “tail” of the distribution to the right (“a tendency for upside surprises”) A negative skew value indicates a greater chance that values will fall above the mean (“a propensity for downside volatility”) Kurtosis Kurtosis is a measure of whether a random variable’s probability distribution is “tall and skinny” or “short ([Location 16496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=16496))

- Afterword No good decision was ever made in a swivel chair. —General George S. Patton Jr. When I started trading in the commodity futures markets over 40 years ago, the industry didn’t even have a name. Today the business has grown to the point where there are myriad ways to describe the funds that operate and their many styles of investing. The particular discipline of trading that I practiced, even before the nomenclature existed, is now plainly and aptly termed “trend following.” In fact, while I have seen many strategies come and go, most of the other managers that I have known to survive and thrive over the past few decades in global futures markets are also trend followers. For having made my living as a trend follower, I’ve yet to come across a more compelling study, so clearly distilled, than has been offered by Michael Covel in Trend Following. I first met Michael Covel when he was working on this book. I was a little hesitant at first about sharing some of the rather simple secrets of my trade. And I didn’t make it easy on Covel. I started interviewing him on his investments and how he managed his risk. He quickly made me realize that he not only understood trend following, but that he embraced it much like ([Location 17892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=17892))

- me. We delved into the roots of trend following and my investment strategies to explore why they work rather than just accepting the results. In reading Trend Following, I now see how well he was able to translate his knowledge, and the perspectives of many of my colleagues, to paper. Back in the 1970s, most of the guys I knew traded individual markets. The ones who traded wheat did not talk to the guys who traded sugar. And the guys who invested stocks did not care to talk to either one, because commodities were for “speculators” and not “investors.” Further, the bond crowd thought the stock guys were cowboys. Each group had developed its own superiority complexes and fundamentally believed that only industry experts like them could understand the subtle dynamics of their markets. I guess that’s part of the reason that no one cared much for trend followers like me—I viewed every market the same way and each represented nothing more than a trade to me. Today, for all the different facets, I believe everyone has come to speak the same language. It’s the language of risk. In my early days, there was only one guy I knew who seemed to have a winning track record year after year. This fellow’s name was Jack Boyd. Jack was also the only guy I knew who traded lots of different markets. If you followed any one of Jack’s trades, you never really knew how you were going to do. But if you were like me and actually counted all of his trades, you would have made about 20 percent a year.

- little curious about the idea of trading futures markets “across the board.” Although each individual market seemed risky, when you put them together, they tended to balance each other out and you were left with a nice return with less volatility. I could always see, after I got to Wall Street, how, for all the confusion, markets were driven by people and their emotions. That was what all of these markets had in common—people—and people just don’t change. So, I set out to understand similarities in the way that markets moved. When I added up Jack’s trades, only a few big trades made him all the money. For each of these big winners, I was there when “experts” told Jack that these markets couldn’t go any higher, but they did. Then, when I looked at Jack’s losses, they tended to be relatively small. Although it took me many years to put it all together—remember, there were no books like this back then—these seemingly small observations became the foundation for me of two important, intertwined investment themes: trend following and risk management. Jack was not so much a trend follower, but he did practice the first rule of trend following: Cut your losers and let your winners run. Most of the guys that I… ([Location 17917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=17917))

- always being right. It gets back to people and emotions. Everyone is happy to take lots of little winners—it makes them feel good. When their trades go against them, on the other hand, they hold on because they don’t want to accept being wrong. Many times, these trades come back and they are able to capture their small profit. To me, that kind of trading is a little bit like picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. Thankfully, the markets don’t care about me or you or where we went to school. They don’t care if you’re short or tall. I was never very good in school and I wasn’t a good athlete, either. With my background, the way I saw it, I never had any problem with the idea that I could be wrong. So, I have always built in an assumption of wrongness to anything that I do. We now kindly refer to this practice as risk management, but I just wanted to answer the question: “What’s the worst thing that could happen to me?” I never wanted to do anything that could kill me. Knowing that I was not likely to be right that often, I had to trade in a way that would make me a lot of money when I was right and not lose me a lot of money when I was wrong. If that wasn’t enough, it also had to be simple enough for me to understand. After many… ([Location 17929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y63RDS2&location=17929))

Now, in reading Trend Following, the do-it-yourselfers might argue that having a book that illustrates these same basic principles takes some of the fun out of it. Actually, Covel, like any good trend follower, has not focused solely on the endpoint. He gives you a deep understanding of the most important part: the path. Unlike so many other books that have been written about investing, Trend Following goes beyond the results to explore the journey of this outstanding group of traders. For my staff, Covel’s Trend Following is required reading.
