- Or take Varlam Shalamov, a poet who spent fifteen years imprisoned in a gulag. He once wrote how quickly normal people can crack under stress and uncertainty. Take a good, honest, loving person and strip them of basic necessities and you’ll soon get an unrecognizable monster who’ll do anything to survive. Under high stress, “a man becomes a beast in three weeks,” Shalamov wrote. Historian Stephen Ambrose chronicled World War II soldiers who left basic training full of bravado and confidence, eager to fight when they joined the front lines. Then they get shot at, and everything changes. “There was no way training could prepare a man for combat,” Ambrose wrote. It could teach you how to fire a ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2306))

- to lie helpless under a shower of shrapnel in a field crisscrossed by machine-gun fire.” No one could understand it until they experienced it. These are some of the most extreme examples that exist. But the idea that people who are under stress quickly embrace ideas and goals they never would ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2312))

- The reason you may embrace ideas and goals you once thought unthinkable during a downturn is because more changes during downturns than just asset prices. If I, today, imagine how I’d respond to stocks falling 30 percent, I picture a world where everything is like it is today except stock valuations, which are 30 percent cheaper. But that’s not how the world works. Downturns don’t happen in isolation. The reason stocks might fall 30 percent is because big groups of people, companies, and politicians screwed something up, and their screwups might sap my confidence in our ability to recover. So my investment priorities might shift from growth to preservation. It’s difficult to contextualize this mental shift when the economy is booming. And even though Warren Buffett says to be greedy when others are fearful, far more people agree with that quote than actually act on it. The same idea holds true for companies, careers, and relationships. Hard times make people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm. Chris Rock once joked about who actually teaches kids in school: “Teachers do one half, bullies do the other,” he said. “And learning how to deal with bullies is the half you’ll actually use as a grown-up.” It’s real experience with risk and uncertainty, which is something you cannot fathom until you’ve experienced it firsthand.

- Saying “I’m in it for the long run” is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top, and saying, “That’s where I’m heading.” Well, that’s nice. Now comes the test. ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2358))

- A long time horizon with a firm end date can be as reliant on chance as a short time horizon. Far superior is flexibility. Time is compounding’s magic, and its importance can’t be minimized. But the odds of success fall deepest in your favor when you mix a long time horizon with a flexible end date—or an indefinite horizon. Benjamin Graham said, “The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.” The more flexibility you have, the less you need to know what happens next. And never forget John Maynard Keynes: “In the long run we’re all dead.” ([Location 2402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2402))

- Another point about long-term thinking is how it sways the information we consume. I try to ask when I’m reading: Will I care about this a year from now? Ten years from now? Eighty years from now? It’s fine if the answer is no, even a lot of the time. But if you’re honest with yourself you may begin to steer toward the more enduring bits of information. There are two types of information: permanent and expiring. Permanent information is: “How do people behave when they encounter a risk they hadn’t fathomed?” Expiring information is: “How much profit did Microsoft earn in the second quarter of 2005?” Expiring knowledge catches more attention than it should, for two reasons. One, there’s a lot of it, eager to keep our short attention spans occupied. Two, we chase it down, anxious to squeeze insight out of it before it loses relevance. Permanent information is harder to notice because it’s buried in books rather than blasted in headlines. But its benefit is huge. It’s not just that permanent information never expires, letting you accumulate it. It also compounds over time, leveraging off what you’ve already learned. Expiring information tells you what happened; ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2408))

- Let’s discuss an enduring quirk of human behavior: the allure of complexity, intellectual stimulation, and discounting things that are simple but very effective, in preference to things that are complex but less effective.

- That’s in spite of the fact, he says, that getting people to quit smoking can make a bigger impact in the war on cancer than anything he, as a biologist, can do in his lifetime. It’s astounding, isn’t it? Here you have one of the top cancer researchers in the world, and he’s saying he could make a bigger impact on cancer if he focused on getting people to quit smoking—but that’s not intellectually stimulating enough for him. Or for many scientists, for that matter. Now, I don’t blame him—and Weinberg has added enormous value to the war on cancer. But here we have an example of complexity being favored for its excitement, when simplicity may actually do a better job. And that, I’ll tell you, is a big lesson that applies to many things.

- Animals with hundreds of teeth often evolved to have a handful of specialized incisors, canines, and molars. Dozens of jawbones fused into two big ones. Skulls often made up of hundreds of tiny bones evolved into typically fewer than thirty. Evolution figured out its version of simplification. It (if you can imagine evolution talking) says, “Get all that useless crap out of the way. Just give me the few things I need and make them effective.” A trick to learning a complicated topic is realizing how many complex details are cousins of something simple. John Reed wrote in his book Succeeding: When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles—generally three to twelve of them—that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles. This is so vital. In finance, spending less than you make, saving the difference, and being patient is perhaps 90 percent of what you need to know to do well. But what’s taught in college? How to price derivatives and calculate net present value. In health it’s sleep eight hours, move a lot, eat real food, but not too much. But what’s popular? Supplements, hacks, and pills.

- Mark Twain said kids provide the most interesting information, “for they tell all they know and then they stop.” Adults tend to lose this skill. Or they learn a new skill: how to dazzle with nonsense. Stephen King explains in his book On Writing: This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. I figured the shorter the book, the less bullshit. Poetry. ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2477))

- Here’s a common theme in the way people think: Wounds heal, but scars last. There’s a long history of people adapting and rebuilding while the scars of their ordeal remain forever, changing how they think about risk, reward, opportunities, and goals for as long as they live. An important component of human behavior is that people who’ve had different experiences than you will think differently than you do. They’ll have different goals, outlooks, wishes, and values. So most debates are not actual disagreements; they’re people with different experiences talking over each other.

- Psychologist Ivan Pavlov trained his dogs to drool. He did this by ringing a bell before they were fed. The dogs learned to associate the sound of the bell with an imminent meal, which triggered a salivary response. Pavlov’s dogs became famous for teaching psychologists about the science of learned behavior. Less known is what happened to the poor dogs years later. A massive flood in 1924 swept through Leningrad, where Pavlov kept his lab and kennel. Flood water came ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2561))

- right up to the dogs’ cages. Several were killed. The surviving dogs were forced to swim a quarter mile to safety. Pavlov later called it the most traumatic thing the dogs had ever experienced, by far. Something fascinating then happened: The dogs seemingly forgot their learned behavior of drooling when the bell rang. Pavlov wrote about one dog eleven days after the floodwaters receded: After the application of the [bell] all the remaining conditioned reflexes almost completely disappeared, the animal again declined the food, became very restless and continuously stared at the door. Ever the curious scientist, Pavlov spent months studying how the flood changed his dogs’ behavior. Many were never the same—they had completely different personalities after the flood, and learned behavior that was previously ingrained vanished. He summed up what happened, and how it applies to humans: Different conditions productive of extreme excitation often lead to profound and prolonged loss of balance in nervous and psychic activity . . . neuroses and psychoses may develop as a result of extreme danger to oneself or to near friends, or even the spectacle of some frightful event not affecting one directly.

- People tend to have short memories. Most of the time they can forget about bad experiences and fail to heed lessons previously learned. But hard-core stress leaves a scar. Experiencing something that makes you stare ruin in the face and question whether you’ll survive can permanently reset your expectations and change behaviors that were previously ingrained. “A mind that is stretched by new experience can never go back to its old dimensions,” said Oliver Wendell Holmes. It’s why the generation who lived through the Great Depression never viewed money the same afterward. They saved more money, took on less debt, and were wary of risk—for the rest of their lives. This was obvious even before the Depression was over. Frederick Lewis Allen quotes a Fortune magazine article written in 1936: The present-day college generation is fatalistic . . . it will not stick its neck out. It keeps its pants buttoned, its chin up, and its mouth shut. If we take the mean average to be the truth, it is a cautious, subdued, unadventurous generation.

- And it’s why you can separate today’s tech entrepreneurs into two clearly different buckets—those who experienced the dot-com crash in the late 1990s, and those who didn’t because they were too young. Two things tend to happen after you get hit with something big and unexpected: • You assume what just happened will keep happening, but with greater force and consequence. • You forecast with great conviction, despite the original event being improbable and something few, if anyone, predicted. The more impactful the surprise, the more this is true. And, importantly, the more those who didn’t experience that big event will struggle to understand your point of view. The oldest story is that of two sides who don’t agree with each other. The question “Why don’t you agree with me?” can have infinite answers. Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed. But usually a better question is, “What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=2602))

- do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?” It’s the question that contains the most answers about why people don’t agree with one another. But it’s such a hard question to ask. It’s uncomfortable to think that what you haven’t experienced might change what you believe, because it’s admitting your own ignorance. It’s much easier to assume that those who disagree with you aren’t thinking as hard as you are. So people will disagree, even as access to information explodes. They may disagree more than ever because, as Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.” Disagreement has less to do with what people know and more to do with what they’ve experienced. And since experiences will always be different, disagreement will be constant. Same as it’s ever been. Same as it will always be. Same as it ever was.

- So rather than ending this book with a list of conclusions to implement in your own life, I’ll leave you with a list of questions, all related to the chapters you just read, to ask yourself. Who has the right answers but I ignore because they’re not articulate? Which of my current views would I disagree with if I were born in a different country or generation? What do I desperately want to be true so much that I think it’s true when it’s clearly not? What is a problem that I think applies only to other countries/industries/careers that will eventually hit me?
