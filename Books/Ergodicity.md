## Highlights
- In July 2021, I got diagnosed with malignant eye cancer. Thankfully, it was early stage, and it appears that the medical therapy worked well. The cliché is that this brief encounter with death would have led me to live every day as if it were the last. It didn’t. It never does. People who are reminded of their mortality are often shaken up from their routine, yes, but never really live their day as if it were the last one.[1] Because doing so would be suboptimal if there’s more than one day left.

- In fact, all our decisions are underpinned by an implicit assumption of a time horizon to optimize for. Whether to do unpaid work is influenced by how long we think a work relationship will last. Whether to marry our romantic partner is influenced by how long we believe our love will last.[2] Time horizons are the bases of our decisions – and of our regrets. Live as if you would die tomorrow, and you will regret not having pursued long-term engagements (such as fulfilling professional ambitions, building a family, and so on). But live as if you couldn’t die and you will regret not having done what you cannot do anymore. Getting the time horizon right is fundamental for a life with few regrets. Sadly, there’s too much variance and too many unknowns for us to get it reliably right. However, we can improve our outcomes by understanding the effect of time and variance on our choices – and taking choices that do not need our guess to be exact to work out.

- Ergodicity is the field of study that concerns itself with precisely that. And reading this book will help you take better decisions – decisions that don’t ignore time but leverage it, decisions that minimize regret and yet maximize long-term potential.

- Ever since a young age, we are taught that a cost-benefit analysis determines whether it is a good idea to do something. If the gains are larger than the losses, then go ahead. The real world begs to differ. There are cases in which it is a terrible idea to do something whose gains are larger than its losses.[3] ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=142))

- In skiing, and life in general, it is not the best ones who succeed. It is the best ones of those who survive. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=156))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In theory, performance determines success. The fastest skier wins the race, and the most performing employee becomes the most successful one. In practice, performance is subordinate to survival. It is the fastest racer of those who survive that wins races, it is the highest performing employee who doesn’t burn out that becomes the most successful, and so on. I’m not just making the banal point that survival matters. I’m saying it matters more than performance.[4] ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=159))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The point is, in a single instant of time, pure performance is all that matters. Instead, over a prolonged period of time, survival dwarfs performance. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=179))

- There is a difference between what matters when we consider narrow intervals and what does when we consider broader ones. Over the short term, consequences that apply beyond the short-term do not matter. Over the long term, they do. In my cousin’s case, the broken leg preventing him from competing in future races is a “phantom consequence” that is not observable in the short term but affects the long term. If we make decisions based on what happens over narrow intervals and forget about these “phantom consequences,” we will make bad decisions.[8] Ergodicity is the study of these phantom consequences.[9] ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=182))

- In general, we can say that in any repeated activity, irreversibility absorbs future gains. This means that you cannot extrapolate future outcomes from solely the expected outcomes of the activity performed once. You also need to consider the impact of irreversible consequences.

- Too often, we observe a snapshot of someone’s life and believe that we witnessed a piece of short-term performance. But if practice is required to get to a place where one can attempt that, then what we are really observing is long-term performance.

- More in general, in any endeavor in which success depends on you accumulating some kind of resource (money, skill, connections, trust[14], etc.), do not maximize growth regardless of survival. Instead, maximize growth that conserves survival. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=218))

- Rather, the above is an invitation to distinguish between calculated risks whose consequences you can recover from and recklessness whose consequences might permanently debilitate you. There is a sweet spot where you expose yourself to the former but not the latter[15], and that’s a good place to aim.

- The reason I’m telling you about Russian Roulette is that some people are terrible at judging its odds. They then apply the same mistake to other areas of their life, such as their relationships or careers, with disastrous consequences. Let’s see if you can guess better than them.

- Usually, the game is played with a six-holes cylinder. This means that when the player pulls the trigger, he has a one-in-six chance of dying and a five-in-six chance of winning. Let’s imagine that the prize for a win is $6,000. How much money are you expected to win if you play Russian Roulette once? The right answer is $5,000. That is the prize, $6,000, multiplied by the chances of winning, five-in-six. Now, a harder question. How much are you expected to win if you play Russian Roulette a hundred times? A back-of-the-napkin calculation would yield $500,000. That would be $5,000 (the expected winnings for a single play) multiplied by 100 (the number of plays). However, this answer is wrong. The correct answer is about $0. After 100 rounds of Russian Roulette, you’re almost certainly dead and unable to collect any winning.[16] ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=242))

- The previous thought experiment comes from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s “Skin In The Game” and clearly shows the link between ergodicity and irreversibility. People who replied “$500,000” to the previous question assumed that death in one round just means that no winnings are collected during that round, but future rounds are still winnable. In Russian Roulette, however, one loss means that you also forego all future gains. Losses are irreversible and extend in the future. Sadly, relationships, careers, investments, and sports often share this undesirable property. For example, relationships are like Russian Roulette – in the sense that they grow stronger over time, but only if you get to spend time with your partner. If, one day, you break their trust, they might decide not to see… ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=258))

- If you flip a coin, it will come out half of the time as heads, and half of the time as tails. This is true if you flip it infinite times. However, if you only flip it ten times, it may come up six times as heads and four times as tails – a different result than the five and five expected. The fewer the flips, the higher the chances that the tally differs from the expected 50%. And the more coin flips are tallied, the… ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=273))

- We generally assume the law of large numbers to be always relevant. In reality, it seldom is for individuals. It requires, well, a large number of trials. And in most real-life situations, we only have a limited number of them. For example, I cannot keep picking risky stocks until I get rich – a few bad results in a row, and I am broke.

- The presence of irreversibility doesn’t imply that you should not take any risk (after all, it’s risky not to take any risk). Instead, it means that you should acknowledge the non-ergodicity of the context at hand and take risks in a way that does not seriously impair your future if things go wrong. Prudence, not cowardice.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Let’s say that six people play Russian Roulette once each. The prize is $6,000. On average, one person will die and five will win $6,000. The group as a whole obtained one death and $30,000. Divided by the number of participants, 6, it makes 1/6 of a death and $5,000. That is the expected outcome. This expectation remains correct if we increase the number of gamblers. With 600 gamblers, you will have an average of 100 deaths and $3M. Divided by 600 people, it still makes 1/6 of a death and $5,000. Therefore, the expected outcome is also called the population outcome[22] Your individual expected outcome if you play Russian Roulette once is also 1/6 of a death and $5,000. However, if you play it more than… ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=323))

- The chart shows how your expected financial gains from playing Russian Roulette many times are roughly zero. I call this expectation, measured across one person and many repetitions, the lifetime outcome. Its technical name is time average or time probability.[23] I spent a few pages describing the difference between population and lifetime outcomes because they are the key to defining ergodicity. In particular, A system is ergodic[24] if… ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=333))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The practical implication The practical implication is that in ergodic systems, you can use the population outcome to make optimal decisions. In non-ergodic systems, you cannot.[25] For example, Russian Roulette is non-ergodic because the lifetime outcome differs from the population outcome. If you keep playing it because you fail to grasp its non-ergodicity and mistakenly believe that your lifetime outcome equals your population one, you will end up dead instead of rich. Hence the purpose of this book. By teaching you the implications of non-ergodic contexts and how to… ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=341))

- There is a common belief that people are irrationally risk averse. This belief is the result of experiments such as the following. “Here is a game. You flip a coin. If it’s heads, I give you $1000. If it’s tails, you give me $950. Do you want to participate?” From a logical-naïve point of view, the expected return of playing the bet is $1000 times 50% (the chances of winning) minus $950 times 50% (the chances of losing). That would be $500 - $475 = $25. On average, every time you play the game, you’re expected to win $25. This makes the gamble apparently desirable. And yet, if researchers go around… ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=351))

- If people had infinite cash, they could play the game as long as they want. The law of large numbers would kick in, their lifetime outcome would converge to their expected outcome, and they would realize the expected win of $25 per coin flipped. However, real people do not have infinite cash. They can only play this game a few times before emptying their bank accounts or having to quit the game. Some cannot even afford to lose once. For real people,… ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=360))

- After two iterations of the game, you have won an average of just ($2000 + $50 - $950 -$950) / 4 = $37.5 This is surprising! If you had infinite wealth, you would have won an average of $25 per bet times two equals $50. But because your wealth is finite, your average win is less: only $37.5 More importantly, you have a one-in-four chance to win a lot of money, one-in-four chances to win a modest amount, and one-in-two chances of losing a significant amount. This means that you have a one-in-two chance of being yelled at by your spouse and/or hurt in your self-esteem in exchange for a mere $37.5 expected winnings[27]. Not a choice that any rational person would take. Actually, it would be idiotic to volunteer to play a game with these odds. The behavioral economists who called for “irrational risk-aversion” are the irrational ones. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=377))

- Further readings: Ole Peters’ papers[28] discuss this problem and contain additional examples of how (non-)ergodicity explains the hidden rationality of some risk aversion and of other behaviors that would be irrational in an ideal ergodic world. As far as I know, he was the first to propose ergodicity as the solution to many otherwise puzzling behaviors. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=386))

- Entrepreneur and philosopher Naval Ravikant wisely noted that envy is most often an illusion. “The part of the person that we envy doesn’t exist without the rest of that person,” he writes. “If we aren’t willing to trade places with them completely – their life, their body, their thoughts – then there is nothing to be envious about.” ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=396))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I would add that it is also pointless to envy someone with whom you wouldn’t trade places in all parallel universes – including those in which his gambles didn’t pay off. For example, an entrepreneur whose venture had slim chances to succeed.[29] Do you desire to take his gambles, or do you only desire the winning outcome? Do not envy the survivors of ventures in which you don’t wish to participate, and do not envy successes that don’t reproduce well.[30] ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=399))

- Whenever we desire an outcome because we see those that benefited from it, it is good practice asking yourself, do you want the outcome, or do you want the opportunity to take the gamble that produced the outcome? If you only want the former but not the latter, you might be unprepared for what’s to come. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=415))

- What’s the take-away? That payoffs depend on time horizons. And what’s the practical implication? That you cannot base your decisions on a payoff computed on a time horizon that isn’t yours.

- Here are a few key points covered so far: – Irreversibility absorbs future gains. – We call “population outcome” the outcome of many people performing an action once, and “lifetime outcome” the outcome of one person performing an action many times. If they differ, the system that produces them is non-ergodic. – You can only rely on expected outcomes if you are guaranteed a large number of repetitions. Otherwise, they are misleading. (The law of large numbers requires a large number of repetitions). – Risk aversion is rational in the presence of non-ergodicity.

- We saw that, in non-ergodic contexts, irreversibility limits the number of trials over time, preventing the law of large numbers from applying. Similarly, we can extend the law of large numbers and its limitations not just through time but also through space and populations.[32] The law of large numbers expects that the larger a population of people performing an action, the closer the average outcome is to the expected average. For example, 75% heads is not a surprising outcome if four people flip a coin (three people flipped head and one flipped tails). However, if four hundred people flip a coin, the average outcome is much more likely to be 50%, or 51%, or some percentage around that. This happens because the coin results are independent. Your neighbor’s result does not influence yours. However, in most of real life, what occurs to your neighbors does influence what happens to you.

- For example, we can expect the victims of pandemics and natural disasters to be located near each other. Therefore, we cannot rely on national averages to assess whether the emergency systems are ready. Instead, we must consider local workload spikes. … On the news, we saw the pain of the families in the hardest-hit areas. People died because the overcrowded local hospitals couldn’t admit them.

- This tension between what happens on average and what happens locally is a core problem of centralization. Centralized organizations such as the WHO or the EU are not omniscient nor have illimited bandwidth. Their executives cannot read tons of data that describe every corner of the world. They must rely on averages. They cannot make thousands of micro-decisions, each appropriate for a given corner of the world. They must take a single, one-fits-all decision.[33] Even if these decisions work on average, they might have a terrible impact on some local populations.[34] As we saw previously, something working on average doesn’t imply it works. Let me repeat, something working on average doesn’t imply it works. Hospitals don’t work when they work on average, they work when they work for everyone, all the time. The same for schools, institutions, social services, public transportation, production lines, and much more. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=495))

- Be wary of centralization, especially when there is no skin in the game ensuring that the incentives of the center coincide with those of the peripheries. [36] [37] Good intentions and being part of the same country or organization are not enough. Even assuming good faith and competence, the center cannot possibly fathom all consequences of its actions on the periphery, nor has any good way to measure that in a non-superficial way.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The same happens in all large systems: change can only be driven by people who are close to those they want to change, and some information about problems and needs can only be collected by those who personally know those having them. Hence large countries and organizations should have a capillary structure where information isn’t collected nor pushed at scale, directly linking the center to the peripheries, but rather step-by-step, layer-by-layer, between people who know each other’s context well.

- Granularity A major problem of centralization is the lack of granularity. A central government cannot possibly review granular data and cannot enact policies that are granular enough to be effective everywhere. Instead, we get one-fits-all. Hence the importance of bringing down decision making closer to the people involved. For example, if a decision can be taken at the province or state level, it should be taken at the province level. A common critique is, “decisions taken at lower levels are inefficient for they lack economies of scale.” However, they more than make it up… ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=539))

- Irreversibility Averages are a meaningful metric only when future gains offset past losses. It is often not the case. Continuing the previous example, I do not care if, next time, the train arrives 30 minutes in advance. I do not get a free flight when the train arrives in advance. Arriving in advance doesn’t offset a delay if it doesn’t offset its consequences. As a rule of thumb, we cannot rely on averages whenever there is a possibility for irreversible damage[38]. This is because the possibility of irreversible damage makes a context non-ergodic. When we consider averages, the good offsets the bad.

Many would prefer a strategy where they are likely to end up in with a moderately successful company, rather than a lottery ticket to be the next Zuckerberg. Of course, it’s not so black and white. Many founders do make good money, live exciting years, and make experience and connections. The point is, the best strategy depends on whether you are the gambler or the gamble. If you are the gambler, you do not care about each gamble making money.

After all, each of your habits is a gamble in which you bet time and energy for a possible return. Similarly, any belief of yours is a gamble. Any job of yours, any relationship of yours, any idea, any decision – they are all investments of time and money in exchange for a future return.[40] You might be tempted to strive to win any single gamble of yours. Don’t. As long as your strategy involves investing in a portfolio of gambles, you can afford to let go of a few losing ones. Their survival is not necessary for yours.[41] In fact, letting natural selection act upon your gambles is how you… ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=587))

- This is not about ethics. The point is that a population doesn’t have, by default, an incentive for the survival of all its members. Even if the population means good for its members – especially so. A population must first and foremost ensure its survival to guarantee the survival of its members. And if the survival of the population doesn’t coincide with the survival of all its members – as is the case in non-ergodic conditions –, a well-meaning population won’t necessarily guarantee the survival of all its members, not when it comes at the cost of its own survival. For example, when facing external threats that put at risk the survival of the whole population, some sacrifices might become necessary. Or, as another example, when the survival of the most decadent… ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=624))

- Practical applications Do not trust advice about a non-ergodic context that assumes it ergodic. While evaluating advice, always ask yourself, is it assuming ergodicity? If so, how would things change removing that assumption? Fully relaying on averages and expected outcomes makes sense only in ergodic contexts. In non-ergodic ones, you want to ensure that you make decisions based on an estimate of your lifetime outcome.[52] Similarly, when we see a behavior that we deem illogical or irrational, it is often worth asking ourselves, “is it irrational for an ergodic world, but rational for a non-ergodic one?” ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=670))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Irreversibility The previous page’s concept can be generalized as follows. Irreversibility brings non-ergodicity. After a game-over, you cannot keep playing. Game-overs are a form of irreversibility, but they are not the only one. Below is another. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb noted, in some societies, if you’re poor, you’re likely to stay poor, and if you’re rich, you’re likely to stay rich. In these societies, one cannot assume that the lifetime outcome of a person born poor will coincide with the average of the population. They are likely to stay below average. Such a society in which wealth is at least partially irreversible is non-ergodic.[55] ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=702))

- There is a common misconception that ergodicity or non-ergodicity are properties of an activity. They are not. Take Russian Roulette, for example. It is non-ergodic for the gambler playing it but is rather ergodic for an imaginary company contracting gamblers to play. For this company, gamblers are replaceable. If enough time passes between rounds to have the time to recruit new gamblers to substitute dead ones, its lifetime outcome will match its population outcome. [57] Therefore, ergodicity is not just the property of an activity. Instead, ergodicity is a property of an activity, its participants, and the exposure of the latter to the former – in short, of a system. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=717))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Ergodicity – for Individual and for systems Nassim Nicholas Taleb made a similar point. In his words, “My death at Russian Roulette is not ergodic for me, but it is ergodic for the system.” Also, in his Antifragile he pointed out how, for a species to be antifragile (adapt and therefore resist change), its members must be fragile. Natural selection is a mechanism that benefits a species[58] but requires the death of some of its members. If the members were nearly invincible, then the species would lose the capacity to adapt. Ergodicity is scale-dependent. A system observed at some scale may show a different ergodicity than the same system observed at a different scale.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Formally, ergodicity is a binary property. A system is either ergodic or not – nothing in between. The lifetime outcomes of its participants either coincide with its population outcome or they don’t – nothing in between. In theory, this is a useful distinction. If you can choose between acting in an ergodic or non-ergodic context, choose the former. However, most practical contexts are non-ergodic. Work, sports, relationships, and real life are all non-ergodic. They all contain some degree of irreversibility. You cannot just refuse to engage in non-ergodic activities.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It becomes then useful to expand the concept of ergodicity from black and white to a scale of shades. This way, we can access more practical considerations such as “how can I make my business more ergodic?” In the example from the previous chapter, a company hiring Russian Roulette players is not a truly ergodic activity. There are still points of irreversibility. For example, a streak of bad luck in which all gamblers die might still bankrupt the company. However, for all practical purposes, the assertion “Russian Roulette is more ergodic if played by a company contracting gamblers rather than by a single gambler” makes a lot of sense. It means that, in the medium term, the lifetime outcome is closer to that of its population for a company than for a single player.

- Finite time horizons Real-life players do not care about infinite time horizons, they care about finite ones. Only mathematicians and philosophers care about infinite time frames; entrepreneurs and workers care about the time frame their job is supposed to last. For example, an investment banker might only care about whether his investments will produce ergodic returns in the time frame he is expected to remain at his job. This doesn’t mean that people don’t care about negative events with a mean-time-to-happen higher than their time horizon. A rational entrepreneur with a 10-years time horizon still cares about a risk that is expected to materialize every 11 years.… ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=759))

- Because of the human tendency to operate on finite time horizons, if you studied ergodicity to increase your chances of achieving your goals or to understand human behavior, a black-and-white definition of ergodicity that considers infinite timeframes does little good. It is more effective to study ergodicity on medium-term timeframes. To summarize the previous page, most people do not care if an activity has a source of irreversibility. Instead, they care whether irreversibility has a non-negligible chance of manifesting within the period they see themselves performing the activity. In other words, what matters is… ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=769))

- Moreover, as pointed out before, people cannot realistically avoid any non-ergodic activity. We all need to perform many of them in our lives. Therefore, people do not only care whether an activity is non-ergodic; they care how much it is. Hence, for most people, what matters is how much the lifetime outcome diverges from the population outcome in the medium term.  For example, if the time average of my wealth after 70 years is 90% of its expected value, then it is not meaningless to say that the investment is 90% ergodic. Or, if my investment’s time average equals its expected value in 90% of parallel worlds, it is not meaningless to say it is 90% ergodic. Of course, neither are fully correct, and are actually wrong in some important ways,… ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=782))

This is distinct from exposing all of yourself to safe activities[66] most of the time and seldomly to risky ones with high upside. Doing so puts you at risk of game-over while you perform the latter. Conversely, the point of the barbell strategy is to pursue risky activities in a way that caps downside (not by reducing its frequency but its impact).

- The barbell strategy and ergodicity One lesson from Taleb’s work is that risk management is not about prudence but about removing the risks of “game-over” so that you can be aggressive with other risks. Similarly, the barbell strategy is not about reducing risk in general. Instead, it is about limiting the part of your assets that are exposed to irreversibility. A balanced or medium-risk exposure does not do the trick. It would be like playing Russian Roulette with one-in-twelve bullets rather than one-in-six: it just means that the game-over is delayed but does not prevent it. Conversely, the barbell strategy is like playing Russian Roulette without pointing the gun to your skull but to a $100 banknote. If you’re unlucky (when you’re unlucky), you only lose the banknote, not your life. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=852))

- Ergodicity is not free[67] Ergodicity helps us survive and thus grab eventual future gains but also comes with opportunity costs. If you limit your exposure to risk, you often limit your exposure to upsides too. For example, if you limit your investment portfolio exposure to stocks, you also limit your gains from an eventual bull market and thus expose yourself to other negative events.[68] That’s okay. Hopefully, this book gave you the tools to justify to yourself and others that the long-term benefits of avoiding game-overs are well worth the opportunity costs.

- A summary of the first strategy The Barbell strategy is about limiting exposure so that the worst-case scenario doesn’t endanger your survival. It makes the non-ergodic ergodic, for most practical purposes. In practice, it consists of investing a large part of yourself in limited-downside activities and a small part in high-upside ones. In particular, an activity with a tiny chance of a ruinous outcome is not considered “limited-downside.” ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=878))

Instead, I allocate my time on a per-project basis. Usually, the larger the upside, the more time I spend on the project. However, I always make sure to never commit all of my time to a single project running for extended time. Too much to lose, both in case the project doesn’t go well or in terms of opportunity costs.

For example, consider two hunter-gatherers, Alice and Bob. They live in a territory where the main source of food is berries growing under bushes. Some bushes have no berries, whereas others are full of them.

Conversely, Bob would check the first bush, then the second one, then he might become discouraged (a mood) and walk for a bit before bending again to check the bush next to him. Once he finds some berries, he gets excited (another mood) and checks all the bushes nearby. This is advantageous because, in nature, resources tend to cluster together. If a bush is particularly fruitful, the chances are that the ones around it are too, because they grow on the same fertile soil. Moods are adaptations to environments with clustered resources.

Secondly, size your bets small enough so that by the time you lose $100, you know you have a losing strategy and can stop playing. This last step is critical!

- A summary so far We saw that non-ergodicity is a potentially dangerous condition. You want to make sure you know what you are doing. The first strategy to apply is to make sure that you never go all-in in any activity that might represent a game-over for you in case of misfortune.[74] As seen in the Barbell strategy, this is distinct from never taking any risks.

- The Precautionary Principle guides us in risk management decisions. It begins by acknowledging that there are two kinds of risks: those that endanger the whole (a population, an ecosystem, the planet) and those that do not. For example, if someone drives too fast and crashes, he might die, and he might also kill a few people, but the population in general is not affected. This is an example of a risk that can kill an individual without endangering the whole. These risks are safe to take for the population. In some cases, they even make it stronger. Conversely, some risks have the potential to destroy the whole population. We should avoid these risks at all costs. The Precautionary Principle holds that we should not take risks that endanger the whole,[76] no matter how unlikely.

- The lesson is: do not expose the whole to irreversibility, no matter how attractive the payoffs. For example, an epidemic so deadly that it endangers the human species is a possible systemic risk. Until we have a foolproof demonstration that no virus, no matter how deadly, can endanger humanity, we should take precautions, no matter how costly. The most common argument against precautions is that they are expensive. This is not a valid argument. Payoffs are subordinate to ergodicity, so we cannot use them until we can be sure that epidemics are not a systemic risk. You cannot compare apple to oranges, nor systemic risks to local ones. The only valid argument in contradiction of a precaution against a systemic risk could be that the precaution itself introduces a similar or larger systemic risk. (That said, hopefully, the 2020 pandemic showed us the costs of no prevention.)[79] ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1036))

- The first strategy to manage non-ergodicity is to reduce your exposure to irreversibility. In particular, we saw how: – You can only optimize in reversible domains. Otherwise, you should first think about avoiding irreversibility. – You can reduce exposure to irreversibility by exposing only part of yourself (or of your assets, reputation, etc.). This is safer and more effective than going all-in on a medium-risk activity. – It is safer to keep a bit of yourself exposed to risk (to grab some upside) than not doing it. Otherwise, we involuntarily expose ourselves to the risks of inaction and obsolescence. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1102))

- Irreversibility, for whom? Irreversibility is not always bad. In a previous chapter, we saw that when we talk about irreversibility, we must specify the layer at which it takes place. A dangerous criminal ending up in prison is bad for him but good for the upper layer: society. Similarly, a corrupt politician getting exposed and banned from public office is bad for him but good for society. Populations want their members to have skin in the game. This way, over time, they get rid of those that expose themselves and others to risks. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1156))

- In the previous pages, we saw how hospitals would not have trouble managing local surges in hospitalization if they could instantaneously redistribute patients across all hospitals. The faster a system can redistribute load the more ergodic it is, all other things equal.[92] This phenomenon applies to countries and large organizations, but also individuals. For example, the waiting room at my doctor’s was frequently overcrowded. He knew he had to do something. The expensive solution was to rent a larger studio with a larger waiting room. The smart solution was to take telephonic booking. A booking system helps to redistribute loads (in this case, patients) over time.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is important. Spikes in load can cause irreversibility – for example, patients changing doctors because of too long waiting time (forever lost customers) and patients getting illnesses from staying too long in a crowded waiting room. As another example, a good friend of mine recently purchased a car. He chose to pay it in monthly installments over five years. He did so even though he had the financial availability to pay it cash. He explained that the loan allowed him to keep a buffer of money in the bank, to manage unexpected problems. If he paid the car cash and lost his job next month, he would be in dire straits. This makes sense! He decided to prioritize survival over optimization, the unexpected over the expected. Conversely, a clueless economist might call irrational the choice to pay something more when there is an option to pay it less. But temporal distribution matters.

- Similarly, I’ve recently learned to appreciate actions that seem inefficient but increase my resilience to sudden spikes in load. For example, in the past, I tried to schedule all meetings in the city center on the same weekday, to minimize my travel time. Now, I try to spread them over two days. Yes, it means that I must commute twice. But it also allows me to benefit from unexpected events that would otherwise destroy my schedule, such as a client asking me to stay longer or a friend unexpectedly inviting me for lunch. Pre-emptive redistribution increases resilience and opens up opportunities. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1243))

- Many people believe that redistribution of resources is something that helps the worst performers but also harms the best ones. This is true in an ergodic world. However, in a non-ergodic world, you can often benefit from redistribution, even if you’re giving more than you’re receiving. This phenomenon is so counterintuitive that I had to make a real-world example with numbers to believe in it myself. Imagine that both you and your friend Aaron are offered the following game. You take turns shooting a basketball. If you make the basket, you double your money. If you fail, you halve it. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1294))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You are a better player than Aaron. Whenever you shoot, you have a 60% chance to make it. Aaron has only a 50% chance. What’s the best strategy to maximize your gains (without caring about Aaron’s)? Counterintuitively, if after both you and Aaron take a shot, the two of you decide to pool your money and take half each, you will end up with more money than if you decided to play by yourself – even if you are a better shooter than Aaron.[96] The next page explains why. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1300))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You both begin with $100. After your first shot (in), you double your money to $200. After Aaron’s first shot (out), he halves his money to $50. The two of you then pool your money, for a total of $250, and divide it half-half. Now, you both have $125. After your second shot (out), you half your money to $62.5. After Aaron’s second shot (in), he doubles his money to $250. The two of you then pool your money, for a total of $312.5, and divide it half-half: you both have $156.25. The second scenario is much better for you than the first one! You end up with an extra $56.25! (I know, it’s counterintuitive. I had to re-read the previous paragraph three times to convince me that it’s actually what’s going on.) This phenomenon occurs because, when wins and losses are reciprocal multiples of the bet, the absolute amount won is higher than the absolute amount loss. It pays to redistribute, so that for each step forward, you only make a partial step back. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1313))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Limitations and other considerations There are some limitations to the previous statement. If Aaron were a terrible player, missing all his shots, then you would be better off without redistributing with him. Moreover, the thought experiment assumes that you do not spend your wealth between games and that your two performances are not correlated. If it were the case, when you missed, he would also be likely to miss, reducing the benefits of redistribution. Another consideration could be that a 50-50 split is inefficient, and perhaps a 60-40 could be more efficient. Splitting 50-50 might induce laziness. Incentives matter. That said, in general, some redistribution is better than no redistribution. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1331))

- Redistribution increases ergodicity The previous example showed how the problem with losses is not just that, well, you lost something. It’s also that what you lost is not there anymore to generate returns for you. For example, imagine you invested $1000 and lost $900 in a market downturn. When stocks double in price again, you will only end up with $200. The $900 you lost are not there anymore to double their value to $1800.

- Sharing resources can be beneficial. In the basketball example contained in Chapter 6, I showed how some degree of redistribution benefits even top performers – i.e., those giving more than they receive. As a reminder, the example consisted of you and another person taking turns shooting a free throw. Making a free throw doubles your money, but missing it halves it. Suppose you are a better shooter and have a 60% chance of making the shot, whereas the other shooter has a 50% chance. I ran the numbers and showed that if players share part of their gains after each shot, not only do the worst shooters amass more money compared to the scenario in which there is no redistribution, but also the better ones end up better off. This is because, in multiplicative systems, even though the top performers share more than they give, smoothening their losses increases their wealth’s growth rate.

- In May 2022, one and a half years after the first edition of this book was published, Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou published a new paper (“The ergodicity solution of the cooperation puzzle”), further exploring resource redistribution.

- Why do people cooperate? Peter’s and Adamou’s paper begins with the question, “why do people cooperate by sharing resources?” Common answers include reciprocity (“I help you today, so you help me tomorrow”) and specialization (“I share my food, and you share your tools”). These are valid benefits of sharing. However, the paper adds that sharing is beneficial even in the absence of reciprocity and specialization. This is because, in a volatile world, cooperation increases growth by reducing the irreversible losses caused by volatility. It smoothens losses so that an adverse event… ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1441))

Not only do we become stronger than the sum of the parts, but each of the parts selfishly benefits too.

It also improves long-time performance.” I made this point in previous chapters of the book, but it’s worth repeating. Limiting losses is not just a strategy to decrease adverse risk; it is also a chance to increase opportunities and our ability to capitalize on them. Hence, risk management should be part of any organization and society’s core governance and not just be relegated to a side committee with limited influence. Each of the company’s top leaders should have, in their job description, a focus on managing risk to improve long-term growth by reducing irreversible losses – financial and non. For example, consider employee turnover. If an employee quits your company… ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1454))

- Natural selection Another critical point of Peters’ and Adamou’s paper regards evolution. Animals, including us, are multicellular organisms. The benefits of multicellularity are evident: it enables specialized organs, such as legs and brains. However, we didn’t directly evolve from single-cell to million-cells organisms. Before that, there have probably been two-cells organisms. And what’s the benefit of that? On the one hand, two cells are too few to enable specialization. On the other hand, it must have some benefit; otherwise, natural… ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1467))

- The same applies to societies: a tribe whose members share resources is more likely to survive a famine. But, and here is the paper’s key point, we do not need group selection to explain why we evolved the tendency to share resources. As explained at the beginning of this chapter, moderate sharing also benefits the individual. Individuals who participate in sharing are more likely to survive. Hence, individual selection is enough to explain why we evolved a tendency to share resources. In the words of the paper, “individuals poll and share resources because, over a temporal sequence of interactions, it is individually advantageous for them to do so […] group selection is not needed [to explain… ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1473))

- First of all, let me clarify that I agree both with Taleb (most of Musk’s wealth is due to luck) and with Musk’s fans (Musk is very skilled). In fact, the two are not at odds: Musk is probably both very skilled and very lucky. Skill is sufficient for becoming wealthy, but given that one is wealthy, how much wealthy depends a lot on luck. It is easy to imagine that in many parallel universes, Musk is also a very successful billionaire, but with how many billions? One, twenty, a hundred? It would still be less… ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1510))

- Similarly, skill is sufficient for becoming rich, but becoming the richest man on Earth also requires a lot of luck. Let me justify this statement with a thought experiment. Imagine taking a thousand entrepreneurs, all with the same starting conditions (cash, connections, etc.) and only differing in skill. Then, let’s observe how their wealth evolves in a few decades. As expected, we would notice that, in general, the more skilled a person, the wealthier they became. And yet, if you took the wealthiest one amongst them, the chances that they are also the most skilled one are slim. It’s more likely that the richest person is almost as skilled as the most skilled one but considerably luckier. My point is not about whether Musk deserves his wealth – I couldn’t care less. Instead, my point is about reproducibility… ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1515))

- Note that I wrote “more likely.” There may be someone so skilled that he ends up with the highest score. But he must be that much more skilled than everyone else. Otherwise, the chances are that one of the many “great-but-not-best” participants will get enough luckier than the best one to overcome the difference in skill. That said, my point is not “don’t imitate the best one” or “imitate the second-best one.” Instead, it’s “be critical about whose strategies you aim to imitate and why.” Ask yourself, how reproducible is that strategy? In ten parallel universes, in how many do they end up as successful as in this one, and in how… ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1524))

- Moreover, consider another point Taleb made. “You get to the tail by increasing the variance (or the scale) rather than raising the expectation.” In other words, to get extreme outcomes, you must reduce average outcomes. Do you really want to be the one with the highest score? It will come at a cost. Not just effort and opportunity costs but… ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BL8JFMT8&location=1532))
