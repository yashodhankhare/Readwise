## Highlights
- For instance, Magellan Fund's former manager, Peter Lynch, selects high B/M firms or high-growth firms with an earnings growth rate that is greater ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=153))
- than its P/E ratio.' ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=154))
- How does insider trading fit in with these investment styles? How does the information content of insider trading compare with the information contained in earnings' growth rates, book-to-market ratios, price-earnings ratios, and dividend yields? Does the availability of insider trading change the way we interpret value and growth styles? This book will provide answers to these interesting investment questions.First, this book will demonstrate that using insider-trading information can augment and strengthen other signals, since insider trading contains an independent signal of firm value and is forward-looking. In contrast, measures such as P/E ratios, B/M ratios, and dividend yields are linked to the current stock price by construction. For instance, the P/E ratio is computed as the current stock price divided by the earnings per share over the past year. Similarly the B/M… ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=154))
- the current stock price.All three indicators of value are constructed using the current stock price. Consequently the historical changes in stock price can affect these ratios mechanically. When the stock price falls, the P/E ratio will be low while the B/M ratio and dividend yield will be high by construction. A low P/E ratio, a high B/M ratio, and a high dividend yield may all signal greater future returns. If low stock prices also signal greater risk, then it is quite possible that all three of these predictor variables are simply capturing a risk premium and not necessarily identifying profit opportunities. It is difficult to distinguish whether these variables predict abnormal profit opportunities or simply a compensation for bearing additional risk. In contrast with the value or growth-based approaches, insider-trading activity (e.g., defined as number of shares bought or sold) does not depend… ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=160))
- provide only historical, statistical relations. In contrast, insider trading is the only indicator that may be based on expectations of future developments. Corporate insiders combine their knowledge about developments in their own firm, their own industry, and the economy in general and put their own money on the line. If they guess right, they stand to make money. If they guess wrong, they stand to lose money. The… ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=166))
- What exactly is insider trading?The term insider trading is poorly understood. To understand the economic implications of insider trading, we first need a working definition of insiders and insider trading. The terms insiders and insidertrading conjure up different images to different people, which causes confusion and miscommunication. A clear understanding of who insiders are, and what insider… ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=168))
- misperceptions about insider trading are the following: First, many investors erroneously believe that all insider trading is illegal. This confusion arises because some transactions by insiders are illegal while others are perfectly legal. To someone who is convinced of the illegality of all insider trading, the idea of imitating insiders is similar to committing an illegal activity. As we will see later in this book, this is a misconception. The law only prohibits certain specific kinds of transactions by insiders, while the overwhelming majority of insider trading falls within legal bounds.A second common misconception has to do with the usefulness of insider-trading information. Some observers erroneously believe that if insiders make money, then it must be illegal. These people also believe that to avoid prosecution, insiders only report their unprofitable transactions and that they camouflage any… ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=171))

She is… ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=190))
- In sum, insider trading can serve as a valuable guide in stock market investing. Potential stock market investors mostly worry about two issues: Is this a good time to go into the stock market? And, if yes, which stocks should I buy? This book will demonstrate that insider trading will ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=254))

- Our finding suggests that the average life of insider-trading sentiment lasts about four to five years which is similar in length to business ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=374))

- An important lesson suggested by our evidence is that insiders in large firms normally sell twice as frequently as they buy. Consequently, in large firms, an average sell-to-buy ratio of 2: 1 should be considered neutral. When selling exceeds buying by significantly more than 2: 1, then insiders should be considered bearish. To be considered bullish in large firms, ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=441))

- Our findings show that insider buying peaks in the last quarter of the year. October has the highest buying proportion of any calendar month, followed by the month of December. Buying activity is lowest during the summer months. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=462))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our evidence suggests that insiders take advantage of these seasonal variations in stock prices: They buy following price declines in September and October. Moreover buying is heaviest just before the large stock price increases in January. The seasonal insider-trading patterns suggest that insiders exploit the seasonal variations ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=468))

- Insider-trading activity is characterized by strong momentum.12 If insiders buy shares in the current month, the probability they will continue to buy next month is 38%. The probability of a reversal into a sale next month is only 11%. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=498))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our evidence indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between past insider trading and future insider trading. Reversals are more likely in ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=511))

- Conclusions ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=622))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- An interesting conclusion is that an ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=681))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- estimate of insiders' profits following a round-trip transaction is 8.9%, which is significant but not huge. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=681))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A second conclusion is that both purchases and sales seem to be informative. The future stock price movements following insider purchases exceed the average stock price movements. Also the future stock price movements following insider sales fall short of the average stock price movements. Hence we confirm the popular belief that, on average, insider purchases are good news while insider sales are bad news. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=684))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Another interesting observation is that stock prices do not actually ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=687))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- decline following insider sales. They only increase less than the average stock price increase. Consequently it would not be appropriate to short-sell firms reporting insider selling if the investors cannot earninterest on the proceeds of the short sale.' That is to say, if one does not already own shares in a firm with insider sales and does not have access to the proceeds of the short sale, there is nothing to do. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=687))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The preceding discussion suggests that there are two types of insider transactions that are designed to exploit information. The first type is active in the sense that insiders anticipate future stock price movements and take advantage of them. The second type is passive in the sense ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=703))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- that they close a previously opened position to bring the insider to the desired level of stock holdings. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=705))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We can draw a couple of important lessons based on our findings. First, it is useful to act on insider-trading information soon, though this is not a critical issue. Within six months of insider-trading month, about two-thirds of the stock price reaction is completed. Subsequent price reaction during the next six months is smaller, and it is not likely to exceed transactions costs (more about this in chapter 14). Second, there is no immediate, large price reaction following insiders' transactions. Instead, there is a gradual (albeit declining) reaction over time. This finding suggests that insiders base their trading not on immediate upcoming corporate announcements (which in fact could be illegal) but rather on a general assessment of the overall direction of their firms over the next two years or so. This second finding also suggests that any outside investors ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=795))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- who attempt to imitate insiders can afford to execute their transactions over a period of a few weeks. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=799))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our evidence also shows that that the relative stock price movements prior to insiders' transactions are not random (figure 2.1). Instead, relative stock prices decline before insiders' purchases, and they rise before insiders' sales. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=801))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Stock prices rise following both purchases and sales by insiders. However, stock prices rise more following insiders' purchases than they do following insiders' sales. Hence insiders earn significant profits from trading in their own firms. The stocks purchased by insiders outperform the ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=943))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- market by 4.5%, and the stocks sold by insiders underperform the market by 2.7%. Overall, insider purchases are good news, while insider sales are bad news for future stock price performance.2. The profitability of a typical insider trade is small. For a potential stock market investor, the finding of small profits implies that he/she should not take large positions based on a few transactions by insiders. In addition investors are advised not to short sell stocks following insiders' sales unless they can invest the proceeds of the short sale.3. Insider trading is profitable in most years. Moreover profitability of insider trading has not diminished over time. Insider trading in the 1990s is just about as profitable as it was in the 1980s and 1970s.4. There are risks to imitating insiders. Even if an outsider were to buy all stocks purchased by insiders in that year and sell all stocks sold by insiders in that year, there is still about a one in five chance of making mistakes. The magnitude of these mistakes does not appear to be large. Nevertheless, a typical outsider should diversify his/her transactions over a period of years and obtain additional information about ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=944))

- the stock before taking on significant exposure based on insider-trading information.5. Stock price reactions to insiders' transactions appear to occur rather slowly over a 12-month period. In fact stock prices continue to drift in the direction of insiders' transactions even after 12 months but at a slower rate. Also there is no immediate reaction to insiders' transactions. These findings suggest that insiders do not exploit the upcoming corporate announcements as a basis for their transactions. Instead, insiders appear to use their long-term expectations of the prospects for their firms. This finding suggests that immediate imitation of insider trading patterns should not be an overriding concern to outsiders.6. We have identified active and passive trading strategies. Active transactions tend to be forward-looking, and they open new positions. Passive transactions are backward-looking, and they close previously opened positions. Following large stock… ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=951))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- predictive power because they are backward-looking. Eliminating passive transactions increases the predictive power of the remaining transactions. Hence stocks actively purchased by insiders outperform the market by about 7% over the next 12 months, and stocks actively sold by insiders underperform the market by about 5% over the next 12months. Considering that the market portfolio has averaged about 12% return over the past 70 years, an investor following active insider trading can just about double the returns to a buy and hold strategy before transactions costs.8. It is possible to further improve the predictive ability of insider trading by focusing attention on a subsample of transactions that are not preceded by conflicting signals. For instance, firms exhibiting insider purchases that are not preceded by any sales over the past 12 months tend to appreciate 30.5% during the subsequent 12 months. Similarly firms exhibiting insider sales that are not preceded by any purchases over the past 12 months tend… ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=957))

- We first examine the profitability for different classes of insiders. Once again, insiders' profit is defined relative to the market returns. For purchases, insiders' profit equals the 12-month holding period return to the stock minus the 12-month holding period return to the market index. If the stock purchased by insiders outperforms the market, the difference constitutes insiders' profit. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1010))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For insiders' sales, profit is defined as the loss avoided again relative to the market. Hence profit equals the negative of the 12-month holding period return to the stock minus the 12-month holding period return to the market index. Following sales, if insiders' stock underperforms the market, this difference is the loss avoided and constitutes insiders' profit.

- Finally at the top of the hierarchy are the top executives. From the perspective of the outside market investor, this is the most informed group and the type of insider they should most closely imitate.' ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1039))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For an outside investor who is interested in imitating insiders, greater number of shares traded by insiders is an important signal of the quality of insiders' information. Second, there is a monotonically positive relation between volume and profitability. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1077))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Hence there is no critical threshold level where volume begins to signal more valuable information. Instead, there is a gradual positive relation. Third, the relation between volume and profitability is quite strong. Consequently the positive relation between the volume of trade and profitability comes through even before we control for other determinants of the value of insiders' ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1078))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The profitability of extremely large transactions follows an inverse-U shape (table 3.3). Profitability first increases and then decreases with trade volume. Profitability of insiders' transactions continues to increase up to 100,000 shares. For months involving between 20,000 and 100,000 net shares traded, ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1089))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the 12-month profitability reaches 4.8%.After 100,000 shares profitability begins to decline. For months involving between 100,000 shares and 1 million shares, the 12-month profitability declines to 3.8%. Most surprising are the extremely large transactions involving more than 1 million shares. The 12-month profitability equals a paltry 0.5%. As argued before, such large transactions are most visible and will invite increased regulatory scrutiny. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1091))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As a result these transactions are not motivated by nonpublic information. An additional rule of thumb suggested by these data is that at very high levels of volume (e.g., more than 100,000 shares), the information content of insider trading begins to fall and profitability almost completely disappears at about 1 million shares. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1093))

- whether insiders are buying or selling. Second, for all classes of trading volume, stock price changes agree with the direction of insider trade. Third, both large sales and large purchases by top executives are informative. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1175))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Our evidence suggests that top executives in small firms definitely base extra large transactions (over 100,000 shares) on nonpublic information. Following such trading months, top executives earn more than 10% profits in small firms. The main problem appears to be in large firms. Top executives in large firms make almost no profit at all (0.8%) from extra large transactions in large firms. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1178))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The above discussion suggests that the profitability of insider trading should be inversely related to firm size. Insider trading should be most profitable in small firms and least profitable in large firms. However, ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1196))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What are the implications for stock market investors? First, outside investors are best advised to follow insider trading in small firms, preferably those firms with equity less than $100 million. ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1213))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The first striking finding is that insiders' buy orders in smallest firms tend to be a lot more profitable than insiders' sell orders ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1248))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Before we leave this section, it is instructive to reflect on our evidence so far. Our indicators of quality exert pretty much independent and additive influence on the quality of insiders' ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1267))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- information. For instance, insiders' purchases are more profitable than insiders' sales. This conclusion is also true for all three classes of insiders as well as for different size firms. Similarly higher volume of trade indicates higher quality of insider information for all three classes of officers and directors. Third, insider trading in small firms is most profitable, holding trading volume and class of insiders constant. When we combine these four indicators of profitability, each of them retains and reinforces the information content of the other predictors. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1268))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In this chapter so far we have identified five important determinants of the quality of insiders' information. These are (1) identity of insiders, (2) trading volume, (3) buy versus sell transactions, (4) firm size, and (5) consensus. In chapter 2, we earlier identified two other variables that affect the quality of insiders' information: (6) active and passive transactions and (7) conflicting transactions. To the extent possible we have also explored the interaction between some of these variables. However, we have not explored all of the possible interactions between all the variables. With 7 quality variables ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1293))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the total possible combinations between these variables exceed 1, 700. Clearly we cannot examine all possible combinations of the quality variables. Such an undertaking would require the use of some statistical tools, which are beyond the scope of this book. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1297))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We have examined the determinants of the profitability of insiders' open market transactions in detail. We have defined profitability with respect to the market index. If the stock price of a firm purchased by insiders outperforms the market index, we declare the purchase to be profitable. Similarly, if a stock price of a firm sold by insiders underperforms the market index, we declare the sale to be again profitable. We have examined profitability of insider trading with respect to the class of insiders, buy-sell transactions, number of shares traded, firm size, and consensus among insiders. Our findings are as follows:1. Of the four different classes of insiders, top executives are most informed, followed by officers and directors. Large shareholders appear to be the least informed. These findings suggest that insiders' private information comes from the day-to-day contact with all operations of the firm, rather than changes in corporate strategies, potential acquisitions or dispositions, or changes in market volume.2. On average, all insiders trade a greater number of shares when they have more valuable information. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1338))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, at extremely high levels of trades, profitability falls. In fact profitability of trades exceeding 100,000 shares is less than the profitability of trades between 10,000 shares and 100,000 shares. At extremely high trade levels, greater regulatory scrutiny becomes an important concern. The concern about highly visible 100,000 plus-share trades are especially important in large firms. It is likely that all insiders and especially top executives in large firms feel that they are subject to greater public scrutiny.3. When examining only large trades by insiders, it is extremely important to focus only on transactions by officers, directors, and top executives. Large trades by large shareholders do not contain any information.4. Insiders' purchases are more profitable than insiders' sales. This conclusion holds regardless of the type of insiders or firm size.5. Insider trading is a lot more profitable in small firms than it is in large firms. Insiders earn an average of 6.2% in small firms as compared with 1.7% in large firms. For outside stock market investors who are interested in imitating insiders in large firms, selectivity is required. Outside investors are cautioned to restrict their attention ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1344))

- only to top executives who trade more than 1,000 trades.6. In small firms all classes of insiders appear to trade profitably. Hence distinguishing between different classes of insiders does not improve performance much. However, purchases in small firms appear to contain more information than sales. In particular, small sales volumes do not seem to have any predictive ability. Both large purchases and large sales are informative. A large purchase by a top executive in small firms outperforms the market index by 14.7% over 12 months. A large sale by a top executive is associated with 7.8% average profit.7. Consensus among insiders also plays an important role in determining the quality of insider-trading signals. As more insiders trade in a given direction, the value of insider-trading information increases.8. Insiders do appear to time the exercises of their stock options.

- While insider information does not pertain directly to the macroeconomy, the signals insiders observe are affected by macroeconomic developments. Consequently there should be some relation between insider trading and macroeconomic developments. For instance, changes in interest rates affect the firm's sales levels, profit margins, and the ability of the firm to borrow additional capital. While insiders do not know what will happen to future interest rates,… ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1390))

- Consequently the signals on which insiders base their trading decisions are affected by macroeconomic developments.Second and more important, insiders are best positioned to interpret the implications of macroeconomic developments for their own firms. It is difficult for outsiders to infer the implication of events such as interest rate changes or exchange rate changes on the profitability of a given firm without knowing specifically how the firm is financed. For instance, suppose that short-term interest rates have risen by 100 basis points over the past six months, while the long rates have remained constant. Also suppose that an auto manufacturer has recently taken a long-term bank loan and retired its short-term bank loan. In this case the increases in short-term interest rates may have less of an effect on the profitability of the firm. Consider the situation of an executive in our auto manufacturing firm.… ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1393))

- have access to this information will have a hard time understanding the implications of changes in short-term interest rates for the profitability of this firm. Hence an outsider and an insider can observe the same publiclyavailable information about changes in interest rates; yet she will understand what this means for her firm while the outsiders will be at a disadvantage.2The preceding discussion suggests that insiders are best positioned to observe the effects and understand the implications of macroeconomic developments for their own firm's stock price. Insider trading at a given point in time represents a forecast of how insider-firm's stock price is going to fare in the future. When we aggregate all individual stocks into a portfolio, we get the market portfolio. Hence aggregate insider trading across all firms should predict the aggregate market returns.

- Conclusions and investment implicationsIn this chapter we have examined the predictive ability of aggregate insider-trading signals. By aggregate insider trading we mean the net proportion of firms exhibiting insider buying. Our findings indicate that aggregate insider trading is a reliable predictor of the future market returns.1. Aggregate insider trading predicts aggregate stock returns. The overall stock market increases more if the past aggregate insider trading is positive than it does if the past aggregate insider-trading signal is negative. However, stock prices do not decline ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1644))

- following insider sell signals. They simply rise less than those following positive aggregate insider-trading signals.2. The strength of the aggregate insider-trading signals increases with the aggregation period. Hence aggregating insider-trading signals over the past 12-month period gives more reliable signals than aggregating insider-trading signals over the past month or the past 3 months.Table 4.12 Profitability of insider trading in Ford, GM, and Chrysler corporations One-year holding period Two-year holding period Direct 2.0% 2.0% Indirect 6.1 7.0 Industry 7.0 7.6Note: Direct method looks at the usual profitability of insider trading. Indirect method buys stock of Ford if insiders in GM and Chrysler are on net purchasers. Ford stock is sold if insiders in GM and Chrysler are on net sellers. We repeat the same approach for GM and Chrysler. Industry method sums up insider trading in all three firms. If there is net buying, all three stocks are purchased. If there is net selling, all three stocks are sold.3. Using 12-month aggregate insider trading and a 50%-50% rule to identify buy and sell signals, stock prices increase by 28.7% following the past 12-month aggregate insider buy signals. Moreover the market rises following each of the seven years when aggregate insider trading signal is positive.

- contrast, the market rises only by 12.9% following the 12 years when the past 12-month aggregate insider-trading signal is negative. Hence using aggregate insider trading predicts an additional 16-point extra return to the market portfolio.4. Using more extreme insider-trading signals further improves the predictive content of insider trading. Using 55%-45% rule to identify buy and sell signals, the difference in market returns following positive and negative aggregate insider-trading signals grows to almost 26 points.5. Combining firm-specific insider-trading signals with the aggregate signals leads to better forecasting of future stock returns.6. Aggregate insider trading predicts changes in future economic growth up to two years ahead. Other studies have also shown that stock returns are also a leading indicator of future real activity up to one year ahead. Consequently it should not be surprising that… ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1654))

- In this chapter we attempted to use insider trading to help us better understand the causes of the stock market crash of 1987. We have examined the subsequent performance of the stocks based on the amount of decline during the crash and trading behavior of all insiders as well as top executives. Our findings are as follows:1. Insiders responded to the crash by buying stocks in record numbers immediately following the crash. Similarly top executives boughtstocks in record numbers. The proportion of firms purchased by insiders reached almost 90%. The insider buying on October 20, 1987, exceeds that of any day between January ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1790))

Hence insiders regarded the crash returns as temporary, and they supported the market when few others were willing to.Table 5.5 Net stock returns (net of the market returns) during the 14 months following the crash grouped by the number of shares traded by insiders fro m October 19, 1987, to October 31, 1987 (number of firms in parentheses) Shares traded Insiders sell Insiders buy 1-100 -16.1% 3.8% (6) (69) 101-1,000 -4.7 5.6 (48) (463) 1,001-10,000 -13.5 5.2 (105) (659) 10,001 or more -12.6 4.7 (92) (368)2.

- view that the typical investor got spooked by the price declines during the two weeks that preceded the crash.3. The record amount of insider buying during and after the crash serves an important public interest by stabilizing stock prices. Not only did insiders provide liquidity to the market, but they also increased the confidence of individual investors in the stock market as insider purchases became publicly known. This finding suggests that extreme restrictions on insider trading can have some deleterious effects on the efficient functioning of… ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1798))

- months. Stocks sold by the insiders during the same window significantly underperformed the market index over the next 14 months. Hence subsequent developments proved insiders' evaluations of the crash events as accurate.5. Insiders did not rely too heavily on the amount of the stock price declines in their trading decisions. There is not much difference in the price declines of stocks purchased and sold by insiders. Instead, insiders brought additional information to make their trading decisions. Hence insiders did not act as naive, mean-reversion… ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002S0OBXW&location=1802))
