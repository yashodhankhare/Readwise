## Highlights
- - Keep matters in suspense. Successes that are novel win admiration. Being too obvious is neither useful nor tasteful. By not declaring yourself immat ately you will keep people guessing, especially it your position is important enough to awaken expectations. Mystery by its very arcaneness causes veneration. Even when revealing yourself, avoid total franknes, and don't let everyone look inside you. Cautious s-lence is where prudence takes refuge. Once decad resolutions are never esteemed, and they lie open to criticism. It they turn out badly, you will be trie untortunate. It you want people to watch and wait an you, imitate the divinity.
