## Highlights
- This book is about a curious legacy of that long-ago wire service. Twelve miles to the southwest of the West Orange, New Jersey, mansion that Zwillman bought with mob money, American Telephone and Telegraph built a scientific think tank with its own monopolistic riches. In 1956 a young scientist pondering his employer’s ambivalent relationship with bookmaking devised the most successful gambling system of all time.

- 1, and a wire without an impulse represents 0. This minimal code may convey words, pictures, audio, video, or any other information.

- In 1943 Alan Turing visited Bell Labs’ New York offices. Turing and Shannon spoke daily in the lab cafeteria. Shannon informed Turing that he was working on a way of measuring information. He used a unit called the bit. Shannon credited that name to another Bell Labs mathematician, John Tukey. Tukey’s bit was short for “binary digit.” Shannon put a subtly different spin on the idea. The bit, as Shannon defined it, was the amount of information needed to distinguish between two equally likely outcomes. Turing told Shannon that he had come up with an idea for a unit called the ban. This was the amount of evidence that made a guess ten times more likely to be true. The British cryptographers used that term, half seriously, in decrypting Enigma ciphers. The “ban” part ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SBTWNC&location=386))

- Relatively speaking, a 0.62 house edge is great. The house advantage in American roulette is usually 5.26 percent. For slot machines, it runs 10 to 20 percent.

The eighteenth-century journalist, gambler, and scoundrel Casanova used martingale in the Venetian casinos.

Flow of water through pipes is limited, not only by capacity but also by friction. The contact between the water and the inner wall of the pipe causes drag and turbulence, diminishing the flow. Communications channels are subject to noise ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SBTWNC&location=815))

- Samuelson’s crowd had tossed that notion in the dustbin of medieval superstition, Markowitz’s findings had special relevance. You may not be able to beat the market, but at least you can minimize risk, and that’s something. Markowitz used statistics to show, for instance, that by buying twenty ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SBTWNC&location=2773))

The more volatile the stock’s returns, the higher its ([Location 2779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SBTWNC&location=2779))

Risk and return are apples and oranges. Is higher return more important than lower risk? That is a matter of personal taste ([Location 2781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SBTWNC&location=2781))
