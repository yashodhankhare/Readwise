- An Einhorn short generates major headlines and can have the power to move a stock’s price. Companies on the receiving end of one of his short plays are said to be “Einhorned,” a term he joked about in a 2012 conference with the line, “Apparently now I’m a verb.” He was once investigated by the SEC for market manipulation after discussing his short position against finance firm ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01A3L1VEO&location=912))

- It is very simple to track holdings of institutional fund managers using the 13F filings submitted quarterly to the SEC. Following a subset of fund managers can lead to new investment ideas. Additionally, investment portfolios can be constructed tracking a hedge fund’s long portfolio performance without many of the traditional drawbacks of allocating to private funds.

- Because value managers have long-term holding periods and low turnover, the forty-five-day delay in reported holdings should not be a significant drawback. Case studies are presented examining twenty value investors. Backtested results are presented for the portfolios since 2000. Results indicate that by tracking and rebalancing portfolios quarterly, an investor can effectively replicate the long holdings of value hedge funds without paying the high hedge fund fees. Following the top value hedge funds can result in excess returns with in-line volatility compared with the equity and hedge fund indices. An investor could invest in multiple managers to create his or her own fund of funds. ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01A3L1VEO&location=1525))
