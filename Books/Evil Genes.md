- Yet, our unique flexibility has an implication that is only just dawning upon us. If we are more like an ecosystem than a single species, then human cultural and behavioral diversity can be understood in the same way as biological diversity. We have not escaped evolution, as is so commonly assumed. We experience evolution in hyperdrive. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=195))

- Some psychiatrists could quibble about the way in which borderline, antisocial, and bipolar disorders are treated herein, but these conditions are highly related and overlapping and not inaccurately treated here. However, I suspect there will indeed be screaming about this book. “You want to label people, even before they are born!” “This is the beginning of a slippery slope, which leads to genetic screening and sterilization; this is a return to eugenics!” True, there is a great risk that we will use genetic information wrongly, driven by our “us versus them” tendencies, our inclination to stereotype people who are not like us and make them “enemies.” You can almost see it coming: “evil genes” will be thought to be more common among groups whom we are inclined to hate and used as a justification for striking out at such peoples. As you know, this kind of thinking has even led to efforts to completely eradicate some ethnic groups. And yet, as Dr. Oakley shows in this book, such societal insanity is more likely when the leaders themselves possess antisocial traits. Perhaps the world will be safer if we watch for these traits among leaders and anticipate their behaviors (although trying to solve that problem by invading their country has not recently seemed to be the best way to approach things, one might argue).

- Compared to people like Mao, Stalin, and Milosevic, my sister's many devious manipulations and deceits were small potatoes indeed. But for my parents and the many people she affected through her mysteriously foreshortened life, the pain of her purposefully malign actions was real and devastating. I thought a lot about my sister as I grew older and learned more about her ability to deceive. I thought about her wit, her intelligence, and her uncanny ability to charm. While working as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers during the cold war of the early 1980s, I studied the avuncular picture of “Uncle Joe” Stalin on the captain's wall. I knew all about Stalin's loathsome policies and personality, yet I still couldn't help but speculate—would I have known what Stalin was really like if I'd naively met him at his wedding cake–shaped mansion, or at a well-lubricated Kremlin dinner party? After all, even Winston Churchill, a man who clearly had Hitler's number, was fooled. I read with interest how Churchill was ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=350))

- charmed and dazzled by Stalin, “that great man,” with whom he shared cheerful drinking bouts and similar paternal adoration of their redheaded daughters.4 Stalin was a gifted organizer who was capable of working prodigious hours. But, as Stalin's most perspicacious biographer, Simon Sebag Montefiore, discovered, the “archives confirm that his real genius was something different—and surprising: ‘he could charm people.’ He was what is now known as a ‘people person.’ While incapable of true empathy on the one hand, he was a master of friendships on the other. He constantly lost his temper, but when he set his mind to charming a man, he was irresistible.”5 ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=357))

- How about <Machiavellian>? It means charming on the surface, a genius at sucking up to power, but capable of mind-boggling acts of deceit for control or personal gain. Machiavellian, in fact, hits the jackpot for keywords. It turns out to describe an entire field of study—one that takes the ideas of Renaissance Florentine statesman Niccolo Machiavelli, author of The Prince, and builds them into a sweeping—and often unsavory—portrait of humankind.

- Under this well-intentioned ideology, “evil” people were believed to be created and shaped solely by their environment. The advantage of this belief is that it gives researchers the comfort of thinking that humans have direct control over evil—that by somehow reengineering the social environment, human evil can be eliminated. The disadvantage of this belief is that it is wrong—there are rafts of studies supporting the conclusion that human personalities are shaped as much by their genes as by their environment. But despite the overwhelming evidence, many academicians today have held so close the belief that people are naturally noble creatures who go astray only because of poor early nurturing that it is sometimes difficult for them to come to grips with the implications of modern research findings.e. All of this has meant that over the last decade, ever since neuroscience hit its stride and the human genome has been sequenced, there has been a gap in communicating the implications of scientific findings about the successfully sinister. People have been left largely unaware of how science is beginning to provide answers to some of their most compelling questions: Why are there evil people, and why are they sometimes so successful? Evil Genes was written to help answer those questions. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=476))

- Nobel Prize–winning biologist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi said: “Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.”1 In the conformist 1950s, it would take a special person to see that duplicitous, manipulative, yet not necessarily criminal individuals were an interesting problem, worth defining and studying. Psychologist Richard Christie was just such a person. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=519))

- What Christie wanted to work on was psychology's equivalent of Einstein's vision of a unified field theory. The problem was that unlike physics—where the equations themselves cried out for a unifying theory relating existing models of nuclear forces, electrical charge, and gravitational pull of the stars—psychology's science was a patchwork quilt of observations. What was important in psychology was often a matter of opinion. And opinion at the time was just beginning the long slide into the endorsement of behaviorism, where humans were thought to be capable of being shaped into anything—“doctor, lawyer, or Indian chief”—by simple reinforcement methods. The mind was a “black box”—the strict rules of behaviorism forbade hypothesizing neurological mechanisms for such psychological concepts as fear, desire, and consciousness. Only overt, observable behavior was thought to be the proper avenue for psychological inquiry. This type of black box thinking seems laughably wrong today, but it had an incalculably restrictive effect on a generation of psychological research.3 ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=536))

- Christie suggested that four sinister and manipulative, but not necessarily criminal, personality traits underpinned this new research area. In Christie's view then, Machiavellian personalities:5 View others as objects to be manipulated rather than as individuals with whom to empathize. Lack concern with conventional morality. Lying, cheating, and other forms of deceit are acceptable forms of behavior. Lack obvious psychopathology. Although perhaps not the epitome of mental health, contact with the more objective parts of reality would be within normal range. Have low ideological commitment. They are more concerned with tactics for achieving possible ends than in an inflexible striving for an ultimate idealistic goal.

- Surprisingly, this seemingly simple interview step was a brilliant idea that would shape the whole of research in the subject for the next half of the century. The key was that Christie had begun to suspect that Machiavellian leaders were not best ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=579))

- characterized by the rare Hitlers and Stalins and Maos that had all played such crucial and destructive roles in Christie's lifetime. Or, rather, they were not only those types of characters. Machiavellians might also appear as leaders in other areas, such as science, religion, business, or even charitable work. In fact, Machiavellian personalities might be present in small percentages of any group of people. In some sense, Christie was connecting the Punch cartoon characterization of the duplicitous Stalin and Hitler with equally devious everyday behavior, as depicted by cartoonist Matthew Henry Hall.

- There were no real answers for those who wanted to understand the Hitlers, Maos, and bin Ladens of their day, much less the two-timing cheat of a husband who dotes on his daughter even as he emotionally abuses his long-suffering wife; or the manipulative, domineering mother-in-law; or the duplicitous supervisor who takes credit for every good idea his subordinates devise. Those answers, and the connection between Machiavellianism and clinical studies, were to come from an unlikely source.

- But despite, or perhaps because, of his reclusiveness, John McHoskey is one of the world's leading experts on Machiavellianism—his research on the topic is world-class. Through nearly half a dozen meticulously researched journal papers, he has explored the relationship between Machiavellianism and such topics as narcissism, ethics, and sexuality. Perhaps his most significant paper, however, was one relating Machiavellianism to psychopathy—a tour de force of research that garnered its author an unofficial crown (princely, of course) in Machiavellian studies.1 This paper argued convincingly that Machiavellianism and psychopathy are one and the same—any apparent differences simply arose from flukes of history. Personality psychologists and social psychologists, McHoskey pointed out, had been studying the topic under the name “Machiavellianism,” while clinical psychologists had studied the same personality construct and called it “psychopathy.” ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=646))

- Nowadays, the official DSM-IV term for the broad category into which psychopathy fits is antisocial personality disorder, a syndrome in which people show a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring since the age of fifteen. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=659))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- First, a bit of background. As mentioned above, the DSM-IV presently lumps antisocial dysfunctional behavior under the general term “antisocial personality disorder,” and implies that the disorder is akin to psychopathy. But genetic and imaging research is beginning to provide compelling evidence that, if those with antisocial personality disorder were thought of as being at the bottom of the hole of the human race, psychopaths would form the subgroup that took out the shovel and kept digging. Psychopaths appear to be a special alien subset of humanity—glib, with shallow emotions, and completely lacking in the ability to feel guilt or remorse. They also indulge in classical antisocial behavior—stealing or violence. (Or, stealing and violence, as with the bank robber who shouted, “Nobody move!” and then, high on adrenaline, shot his still-moving partner.)

- But what causes some people to be antisocial, or psychopathic, or sadistic? Decades of research have shown that both genes and environment work together in a complex tango of cause. Intriguing research has shown, for example, that ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=716))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- abused boys who happen to have genes coding for low levels of an enzyme, MAO-A, which breaks down communication molecules in the brain, have a higher tendency to become violent or criminal than other abused boys. When these children are raised in a normal environment, however, the gene doesn't appear to affect behavior. The low-coding MAO-A genes provided only a predisposition for antisocial behavior—an example of how both nature and nurture might combine to form personality as well as personality disorders.

- Some genes lead more or less directly to changes in general health and personality. Inheritance of stuttering, redundant trinucleotides on chromosome 4, for example, can cause Huntington's disease—a disorder that leads to a dramatic transformation in personality followed by a devastatingly premature death. Susceptibility to schizophrenia is associated with specific genes on chromosomes 13 and 8. Bipolar disorder is affiliated with certain genes on (at a minimum) chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 10, 18, and 21. Discussion of all these chromosomes, genes, and inherited disorders raises the question—could there be a gene or set of genes that would lead directly to the behavior associated with at least some types of antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy?

- We already know that genes have dramatic effects on virtually every aspect of the human body—height, weight, skin color, and even the ability to process oxygen. But sometimes we forget how important genes are in shaping personality. As behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin has pointed out, the answer to the question “how much does heredity ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=786))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- affect behavior” is “a lot.”1 Indeed, as Plomin notes, genetic influence is so ubiquitous that we should not be asking what is heritable with regard to behavior. Instead, we should be asking what is not heritable. “So far,” he notes, “the only domain that shows little or no genetic influence involves beliefs such as religiosity and political values; another possibility is creativity independent of IQ.”a.2 Recent research has even undermined the long-held belief that troubled, argumentative marriages cause problematic behavior in the children brought up in those households. A recent study of adult twins and their offspring revealed that it is not the family discord that causes problematic behavior but rather the genes that troubled parents pass along. In fact, the parents’ own genes apparently determine how often they argue with each other.3 Ultimately, then, since genes are so crucially important to understanding personality—including its Machiavellian manifestations—it's a good idea to take a quick review of some fundamentals.

- A complex array of varying genes underlies the many different outward manifestations—phenotypes—of many different personality disorders. A person with an unlucky shake of the genetic dice can actually end up with full-blown versions of those disorders right out of the chute—these unfortunates often show their dysfunctional characteristics in early childhood, despite a loving and stress-free environment. However, a person with a lighter dose of the genetics for a personality disorder is not necessarily predestined to descend into a full-blown, clinical version. There are two routes such a person can follow. With a relatively stress-free environment, the person may simply grow into someone who is “normal” but who can sometimes be difficult to deal with emotionally. The other route involves succumbing to all-out traits of a personality disorder. How might this happen? The key, it appears, is often stress. When a person experiences bodily stress, for example, physical exercise, it can turn certain genes on or off—perhaps through the regulatory function of the junk DNA. In the case of exercise, this stress can turn on genes that cause muscle growth—you see the result in the form of bulging biceps. But a body can experience ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=857))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- stress in other ways—for example, by being beaten by a parent, working for a bullying boss, or drinking too much alcohol. All of these activities, amazingly, can switch different sections of one's genetic code from quiescence to an all-too-active state—or vice versa.7 The resultant proteins, which have different properties from the nonstressed versions, can, in turn, affect our personalities. Depending on the stress and our genetic predisposition, we can be pushed toward depression, eating disorders, drug abuse, or cancer.8 If a person already has a mild form of a personality disorder, he or she can be pushed into a full-blown version.

- When I spoke with him about this book, he reiterated his feelings that genes are about risk—not fate—and that no single gene by itself can predict personality.13 Most especially, we know that there is no single gene known to create a psychopath, or to cause someone to suffer from antisocial personality disorder, or to generate more sinisterly successful variants of either one of these disorders. But there are a number of genes and gene complexes that have been found to affect brain function—most importantly, for our purposes, regarding traits such ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=908))

- as impulsivity, mood, and anxiety. Through the use of such sophisticated new techniques and concepts as imaging genetics and intermediate phenotypes, researchers are discovering how alleles of particular genes can help underpin the dysfunctional behavior that can lead to a problematic personality or full-blown clinical pathology. In a sense, you might call these evil genes.b. Let's focus on a few of them. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=912))

- The HT3A receptor also affects how fast certain areas of the brain process information. Some versions of alleles related to this receptor appear to cause the extremes of neural activity seen in bipolar disorder.18 Overall, research about serotonin receptors and their associated alleles is just at the “tip of the ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=948))

- iceberg” stage—enough to hint that there may be something going on related to precisely the sorts of emotions and behavior that are seen in various subclinical and clinical personality disorders. On the other hand, if we switch our attention to serotonin transporters, as opposed to receptors, we will find that research is far more advanced.

- You can see the weakened “speech” between the amygdala and the cingulate in the illustrations on the next page. The picture on the left shows a normal control loop for fear—the kind of loop that would be seen in a person with long/long SERT genes. The amygdala sends a signal to the lower part of the cingulate, and then on to the upper, and finally, a “calm down” signal is sent back to the amygdala. In real life, this process might relate to something like the fear you feel—due to the amygdala's response—as your plane suddenly begins jouncing up and down. This fear would be communicated by the amygdala to the cingulate cortex, which would turn back around and control the amygdala's response by communicating something like: “Calm down, it's okay—it's just turbulence as we're flying over the Rockies.” The illustration on the right, however, shows the circuit response in people with at least one short ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=981))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- SERT allele. Although the amygdala is activated, it can't send a strong signal out to the cingulate cortex because of all the other chatter going on. (Remember those serotonin transporters? There are fewer of them, so they don't transport very well—like stagehands who haven't bothered to clear the stage for the next act in the play.) Consequently, the controlling “whoa—take it easy” signal from the cingulate cortex back down to the amygdala is also weaker. The resulting thought pattern might go like this: “Calm down—it's just turbulence. I mean, I think it's just turbulence. But…the people on Flight 587 thought it was just turbulence, too. My God, that plane shook itself apart midair. Every one of the 260 people on board was killed! I'm going to die!!!” As you might imagine, this kind of negative thinking can lead to all sorts of problems—depression not the least of them.

- Remember, it is a single gene, the gene that produces the serotonin transporter molecule, that has all these varied effects on the body's neural, cardiac, and even the immune systems. The concept that one gene can affect many different areas of the body is so crucial that it even has a name: pleiotropy, from the Greek pleio, meaning “many,” and tropo, meaning “turning toward.” ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1005))

- Trade-offs—there are always trade-offs. And nowhere is that more clear than with the COMT gene (short for the ungainly catechol-O-methyltransferase), which is a key gene underlying our general intelligence. This gene works by serving as the blueprint for an enzyme that breaks down dopamine and other neurotransmitters. It turns out that the more slowly you metabolize dopamine, the smarter you are, so if you have versions of the COMT gene that don't metabolize dopamine well, chances are you have a higher IQ (other genes and the environment also play a role here, of course). Like the BDNF gene, COMT also has val and met versions, with the met being a slow metabolizer, ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1048))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and the val fast.29 People with val/val versions of the COMT gene can be a bit less intelligent—they may also have a slightly increased risk for schizophrenia. Val/vals are also at increased risk for antisocial behavior and hyperactivity. None of these detrimental, fast-metabolizing val effects are particularly surprising—after all, amphetamines and cocaine, which increase the transmission of dopamine, cause the psychotic, aggressive behavior that is so familiar to emergency room physicians. Compared to val/vals, met/mets can be smarter, and have a markedly better memory.30 People with mixed val/met versions of the alleles seem to be halfway in between. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1053))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Conversely, the met allele is instead associated with more anxiety or, in research-speak: “lower emotional resilience against negative mood states.”34 It is more frequently seen in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder, which is characterized by distressing intrusive thoughts and the compulsive performance of rituals. Met is also associated with feeling pain more strongly and reacting more negatively to prolonged pain—people with met alleles simply don't get the same natural soothing opiates that vals get.35 Although met COMT enhances intelligence and memory, it can also add to the effects of a short SERT allele, making a person even more anxious and neurotic.36 You might think of this as the Woody Allen of genes—producing brilliance coupled with deep neuroticism.

- A number of other genes also affect mood, although our understanding of how is limited at present. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), for example, is an enzyme that helps in synthesizing serotonin. Various types of TPH and their associated genes appear to be associated with a number of different psychiatric and behavioral disorders—including those, as we shall see, which relate to Machiavellian behavior.

- And remember, there's also that, as yet barely understood, control information hidden in the junk DNA.

- your father were a Leonardo da Vinci–caliber genius, chances are you'd be pretty smart but no genius yourself. Inheritance of personality is particularly touchy because other, seemingly nonpersonality-related genes also factor into the equation. Even if a child is given nearly the identical personality underpinnings as the parent, her entire life might be different, for example, if she also happened to inherit a difficult-to-battle tendency toward obesity. Or perhaps she might have inherited genes that gave her a particular delight in music or skill at dancing, or predisposed her toward preternatural enjoyment of the buzz of alcohol, or gave her a low ability to maintain focus even on things that interest her.50 And of course environment can play a role too. Even within the same family, she might have been treated very differently than her older sister was. Or maybe her mother played with a cat and was infected with toxoplasma gondii before she even knew she was pregnant, setting up the conditions for her daughter to become schizophrenic.51 Or perhaps she was kidnapped and brutally raped as a nine-year-old ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1145))

All of these reasons, both genetic and environmental, are why virtually all parents with more than one child are amazed at how their children could be so very different.

And seeing the differences between psychopathic and normal neurological processes is a crucial step in allowing us to begin to understand the underpinnings of some types of Machiavellian behavior. As we shall discover, understanding the “why” of Machiavellian behavior will also help us to understand why there are Machiavellians at all—and why some of them are so successful.

In this technique, water molecules are tickled to cause them to burp out electromagnetic waves that are only slightly different in frequency from the electromagnetic waves our eyes see as light. Since different types of tissue have different amounts of water, we can use clever technical legerdemain to “see” the different tissue types on photographs that look very similar to x-ray images. A complete slice of the brain can be seen—“imaged”—in the same way that you are scanning your eyes across this page. Since an image can be produced very quickly (only twenty milliseconds—about one-fifth of the time it takes to blink your eye), it is possible to produce a number of MRI pictures one right after another as if filming a movie.

- “Why doesn't everyone assault others or act violently?” asks Raine. One reason is that most of us are good at fear conditioning and we've been punished in childhood for doing minor things like stealing or hitting friends. So we've learned the association between antisocial behavior and punishment and therefore feel fear when we even contemplate an antisocial act. But not everyone is able to form these conditioned responses with equal facility. While some people have biological systems that make it easy, others have biological systems that make it hard. If you are an individual whose right orbital cortex is not functioning well, you're biologically disadvantaged in developing a conscience.11 ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1287))

- The Disease of Too Much Trust—Williams Syndrome Williams syndrome—what might be termed “antipsychopathy”—is perhaps the most endearing of all diseases. Those afflicted are very polite and sociable, show great empathy, and are completely unafraid of strangers. A trained geneticist can instantly pick out the upturned nose, wide mouth, full lips, and the long distance between the nose and the upper lip of a William's syndrome child. Such children often have heart or blood vessel problems, as well as dental and kidney abnormalities. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1336))

- The disease is thought to be related to unusual functioning of a genetically controlled neural circuit that handles human social behavior. It is caused by the loss of a tiny snippet of roughly 21 genes on chromosome 7. In Williams syndrome patients, the amygdala, which sparks “fight-or-flight” responses, shows an unusually easygoing response to threatening faces. On the other hand, threatening scenes with no people, such as burning buildings or a plane crash, provoke overly powerful responses, meaning that Williams syndrome sufferers are uniquely “people persons” even as they are afflicted with unending phobias and worries about everything from spiders to heights. Another area, the medial prefrontal cortex, is perennially activated in Williams syndrome patients. This area, which is right behind the ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1342))

- center of the forehead, has been associated with empathy and knowledge of how to interact socially, which may explain the heightened capabilities of Williams syndrome patients in these areas.18 It appears that the missing snippet is composed of “patterning genes” that tell the brain how to grow. Normally, as a baby's brain develops, there is a push-pull between the dorsal and ventral areas. The dorsal areas relate to mathematics, space, and recognizing the intentions of others; while the ventral areas relate to language, emotion, and social drive. Even in normal people, one area usually grows larger than the other—which is why people are often better at either math, or language, but not both. In Williams patients, however, the ventral area goes into overdrive. The excessive growth in this area directs these patients towards hyper-sociability and rich ability to process emotion, even as they are left struggling with concepts of number and space.19 It is possible that research on Williams syndrome may provide a better understanding of the overly trusting behavior of some individuals in the presence of Machiavellian and duplicitous behavior in others.

- What is perhaps even more disquieting than ordinary criminal psychopaths are “successful” psychopaths, as portrayed in Adrian Raine's findings. By recruiting and questioning ninety-one men from a Los Angeles temporary employment pool, Raine was able to gather a small group of subjects who could be divided into two subgroups: successful psychopaths—those who admitted committing crimes but had never been caught, and “unsuccessful” psychopaths—those who had been caught. The hippocampus, which is important in memory and spatial navigation, played a key role in the study, because this walnut-sized organ is also crucial in the ability to learn both what to do and what not to do. Raine theorized that psychopaths with hippocampal impairments would have difficulty learning the obvious (at least to everyone else) cues that would keep them out of trouble.

- Robert Hare, who has studied psychopaths for more than a quarter of a century, has recently expanded his studies of criminal psychopaths to include what he calls corporate psychopaths, who are similar in concept to Raine's “successful psychopaths.” Hare and his collaborator, Paul Babiak, have developed a questionnaire to help identify these Snakes in Suits (the title of their book about their studies). Babiak points out: “The psychopath is the kind of individual that can give you the right impression, has a charming facade, can look and sound like the ideal leader, but behind this mask has a dark side. It's this dark side of the personality that lies, is deceitful, is manipulative, that bullies other people, that promotes fraud in the organization and steals the company's money.”35 Hare points out that knowing your boss is a psychopath can help you to survive: “The most important thing is to be aware,” Hare says. “Once you take that position you are in a better position to deal with them.”36 The upshot of all this, of course, is that there might be a number of unincarcerated psychopaths free among us—unfeeling monsters but with the intact intelligence to avoid detection. Might this help explain why some Machiavellian individuals, like Hitler, Father Geoghan, or Saddam Hussein, were able to pass unsuspected in human social structures? Perhaps.

- These are the heartfelt words of a deeply Machiavellian woman—private thoughts, shared with no one, reflecting her internal world. Did her use of the word “friend” carry a different meaning from ordinary usage? That didn't appear to be the case, judging from her final, nearly decade-long, on-off supportive relationship with Jack. Also, the worst psychopaths are typically coldly unemotional—so how could Carolyn be suffering from a panic attack? Maybe she was a lesser, “secondary” psychopath? But some of the details didn't quite jibe. Was McHoskey not entirely correct about Machiavellians being equivalent to psychopaths? Carolyn was definitely Machiavellian. But if she wasn't a psychopath, well, what was she? And where does that leave the understanding of a myriad of other sinister individuals—from the lowly accountant who embezzles his firm's funds, to the nurse who fakes credentials, to those who rise far higher in the socio-politico-economic food chain?

Thus, polio leaves higher-order cognitive processes intact, which is why polio survivors often attain “social, educational, and professional achievement as high or higher than those of the general population.”5 As far as I could determine then, polio could influence personality, if only in its effect on alertness and one's ability to pay attention.

- personality types were perfectly happy to induce guilt in others to manipulate them more easily. Despite the neat dovetailing, however, McHoskey was aware of one nagging detail. His seminal study had begun by simply assuming that the Machiavellians whom Christie had described were largely equivalent to psychopaths—the tests McHoskey had conducted as part of the study had merely confirmed that initial assumption. But a potential problem was that other personality disorders hadn't been checked. It seemed unlikely, but what if there was another syndrome that might even more closely match the characteristics of Machiavellianism? There was one relatively straightforward way to find out. McHoskey could give a large group of people Christie's Machiavellian test. He could also administer a second test—one that showed predispositions for common psychological disorders. The results from both tests could then be compared to see which psychological disorder correlated most strongly with Machiavellianism.

- important research contribution, it's helpful to have a little background in how psychology analyzes people with problems. The DSM-IV—that ever-handy diagnostic manual—segregates people's various dysfunctions into different categories, or axes. Axis I includes all mental health conditions except the personality disorders, while Axis II describes the personality disorders. (Another axis has recently been proposed to incorporate personality-related genetic information.)1 There is some controversy about why a disorder might be classified as Axis I instead of Axis II. Fundamentally, the two axes are thought to be the same, but a distinction was drawn between those disorders that were thought to be due to biological factors, which were put into Axis I—and other conditions which were thought to be due to psychosocial stresses, which were put into Axis II. Thus diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were classified as Axis I, while seemingly purely psychological conditions such as dependent and narcissistic personality disorders were classified as Axis II. Now, of course, it is recognized that many of both the Axis I and Axis II disorders are rooted in biology and genetics.2 The decision to use two separate axes was intended to draw attention to the more subtle disorders. But instead, the two axes had the unpleasant side effect of providing insurance companies an excuse to pay only for diagnoses involving the more florid—and thus seemingly more severe—Axis I disorders. This in turn meant that a person suffering from an Axis II disorder would often instead be diagnosed with an Axis I disorder so as to ensure insurance coverage. Thus, rather than drawing attention to personality disorders, the Axis I/Axis II distinction resulted in less interest in, and research on, personality disorders.3 Axis II is further broken down into three “clusters” of personality disorders that seem to share certain similarities. People with Cluster A disorders, for example, are often seen as odd or eccentric—they have difficulty relating to others. Cluster B sufferers tend to act in a dramatic, emotional, and erratic fashion.

- Indeed, borderline personality disorder, or BPD, is a disorder that can be so profoundly confusing that even today, despite thousands of studies, it remains little known and poorly understood. This is despite the fact that one to two percent of the population—some three to six million people in the United States alone—are thought to suffer from its most profound effects.6 A still higher percentage show symptoms of the disorder but are able to maintain conscious control of their impulses when necessary and are thus able to avoid diagnosis.7 Ten percent of psychiatric outpatients and twenty percent of psychiatric inpatients—hefty and expensive percentages!—have the disorder.8 Although women are three times more likely to have the disorder than men, preeminent borderline researcher Joel Paris has noted, “If it were not inconsistent with clinical tradition, we could have described a single gender-neutral disorder that covers the present ground traversed by the criteria for antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.”9 In other words, antisocial and borderline personality disorders shade into each other. Borderlines often show a variety of symptom complexes and coping characteristics, as shown in the sidebar.10 These characteristics can be perceived as being extremely manipulative and are often, in fact, malevolently Machiavellian in their effects. Underneath all of these behaviors is a tendency to make situations more explosive and emotional than the facts would warrant.

The central feature of the borderline condition is instability, affecting sufferers—and those around them—in many sectors of their lives. Additionally, borderlines have significant issues with boundaries. As psychiatrist Joel Paris writes: “[Borderlines] become quickly involved with people, and quickly disappointed with them. They make great demands on other people, and easily become frightened of being abandoned by them.

Well-known BPD expert Marsha Linehan, for example, particularly dislikes the word “manipulative” when referring to borderline patients. She feels that “this implies that they are skilled at managing other people when it is precisely the opposite that is true.”11 In fact, psychologists and psychiatrists commonly retrain themselves as well as their patients to view “manipulative” behavior from a different perspective to aid in therapy. As one treatment program states: “Rather than viewing themselves [individuals with borderline personality disorder] as someone who is attempting to manipulate, is attention-seeking, or is sabotaging treatment, the trainees [individuals with borderline personality disorder] learn to view themselves as driven by the disorder to seek relief from a painful illness through desperate behaviors which are reinforced by negative and distorted thinking.” These… ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=1874))

In fact, it is clear that part of the reason that Machiavellian researchers did not recognize the affiliation between borderline personality disorder and Machiavellianism earlier is the use of understandably empathetic terms by borderline specialists that obscured the nature of borderline symptoms. I would like to emphasize here, however, that although borderline traits can underpin some Machiavellian activities, many deeply dysfunctional, clinically diagnosed borderlines can be cognizant of and deeply remorseful regarding their problematic behavior. It's just that these borderlines often don't have the emotional toolkit they need to stop that behavior.

In other words, they feel controlled or taken advantage of through means such as threats, no-win situations, the ‘silent treatment,’ rages, and other methods they view as unfair.”15 Psychiatrist Larry J.

They're trying to meet their needs in the only way they know how…. They are trying to elicit a response to soothe them, to help them feel better.”16 Borderlines have rapid mood swings with a tendency to experience anxiety and depression; they also often show impulsive and self-damaging behaviors and suffer from chronic feelings of boredom and social isolation. Borderlines also have intense and unstable personal relationships, which they devalue and manipulate frequently. Coupled with these symptoms is a propensity to “self-medicate” with drugs or alcohol, or to have difficulties with food; they sometimes become bulimic or anorexic.

Another borderline trait, projection, happens when a characteristic possessed by the borderline is projected by the borderline onto someone or something else because the characteristic is just too painful for the borderline to accept. For example, Carolyn's cat, not Carolyn, was “agitated by the entire Christmas experience.” Those who deal with a significant other with borderline personality disorder often know instinctively not to try to tag their partner with the label of “borderline.” A true borderline's knee-jerk response would be: I don't have borderline personality disorder.

- As Mason and Kreger point out, nonborderlines base their feelings on facts, while borderlines change the facts to fit their feelings. Gaslighting denial can also occur because a borderline has been dissociating—the borderline does indeed remember the scene differently—and not accurately. Sometimes, however, it is very difficult not to conclude that the borderline is intentionally lying. As psychiatrist Theodore Dorpat writes in Gaslighting, the Double Whammy, Interrogation, and Other Methods of Covert Control in Psychotherapy and Analysis, “Gaslighting is probably the most commonly used and effective type of verbal communication individuals have for manipulating and controlling other persons.”27 One book on how to use gaslighting techniques on one's enemies suggests a succinct synonym: “mind-fucking.”28 ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2009))

(Interestingly, Milosevic's brother Borislav grew up with a very different personality—he “not only excelled in high school but thoroughly enjoyed life, and effortlessly went on to establish a prominent career.”)25 ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2202))

And there is yet another problem: the DSM-IV assumes that “all nine criteria are equally contributory, and allows for the seeming paradox that someone with the supposedly enduring diagnosis of BPD could suddenly be ‘cured’ of the illness by overcoming even one defining criterion.”34 ([Location 2254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2254))

- The ability to learn a language, any language, is related to innate “wiring” that's built in to nearly all human beings. As a language and surrounding culture is learned, however, it subtly shapes perception, often in ways in which people aren't consciously aware. Those who grow up speaking Chinese, for example, process mathematics in different areas of the brain than those who grow up speaking English as their first language. Both groups use the inferior parietal cortex, but Chinese speakers also use a visual processing area, while English speakers use a language processing area. Richard E. Nisbett, codirector of the University of Michigan's Culture and Cognition Program, notes that studies involving this type of phenomena are important because they tell us “something about the particular pathways in the brain that underlie some of the differences between Asians and Westerners in thought ([Location 2424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2424))

- patterns.”3 Other studies have shown that gyri in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes develop differently in Chinese speakers than in English speakers—acquisition of a different language appears to cause anatomical differences in the brain.4 Chinese speakers literally see the world differently than English speakers—eye-tracking studies show that English speakers tend to first focus on individual items in the foreground of the picture, while Chinese speakers tend to first take in the background and the picture as a whole.5 In some sense, then, language and culture might be thought of as helping to structure the neurologically based lenses that people use to perceive reality. But of course, language and culture aren't the only influences on our neurological lenses. Family upbringing, religion, political persuasion, educational background, work experience—all help create the different framing lenses people use.6 Practiced expertise with a musical instrument, for example, can change the structure of the musician's primary motor cortex; London's experienced taxi drivers develop enlarged back ends of their hippocampi as a result of the intricate mental map of the city that they develop and store.7 James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds drives home his counterintuitive thesis that multiple viewpoints from individuals with a wide range of backgrounds, rather than the restricted viewpoints of experts or specialists, are crucial in reaching informed decisions on complex topics. Such successful problem solving almost certainly reflects the value of using a wide variety of framing lenses. In some sense, getting input from a broad variety of people is like getting input from a wide variety of devices—microscopes, telescopes, litmus paper, tensile testors, ultrasound devices, and weighing scales. There is indeed a shared physical reality out there; but for complex problems, no single one of us—experts included—has the all-encompassing set of tools or ways of perceiving that are necessary to truly understand its every aspect.

- or the pathways connecting them may result in strange emotional behavior—impulsivity, moodiness, or the inability to weigh the soundness of a decision. But what precisely does each of those four areas do? The first of the four—the orbitofrontal cortex—is designed to inhibit inappropriate actions. This allows us to set aside our urges and put off immediate reward in favor of long-term advantage. When your stomach is growling but you wave away your favorite type of cookie, it's your orbitofrontal cortex that's helping you say no. (The term orbito-, incidentally, refers to the area right above the orbit of the eye.) As you might expect, the orbitofrontal cortex plays a significant role in controlling impulsivity. A dysfunctional orbitofrontal cortex doesn't “play nicely” with the rest of the brain—this may propel a person willy-nilly toward explosively impulsive behavior.

- Meanwhile, as you might expect, the connections between all the different areas we've just discussed are also critically important in handling emotion. Those connections are generally made through neurons—spidery cells that act like electronic wires to carry information in a syncopated rhythm. As the information travels down the neural wires, it leaps small gaps—synapses—between the neurons in the form of chemical flares known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters come in dozens of different flavors, but, as we've already seen, two of the most well-studied and significant are serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin, as we know, plays a critical role in disorders such as depression, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety; it is also thought to be involved in sexuality and appetite. Dopamine is thought to relate to control of the brain's reward mechanisms, as well as the control of movement. Problems related to the dopamine system have been strongly related to psychosis and schizophrenia. ([Location 2534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2534))

In just the same way, we can see how the different regions of the brain connect to each other by following a “brain map” like that shown above.

Interestingly, people who are against such birth control programs, based on the sanctity of human life, are often also firmly pro–death penalty. When I point out the inconsistency of being pro–death penalty but anti–birth control to these friends, they suddenly decide that not quite all human life is sacred. Then they change the subject.

Other studies have indicated similar problems with imbalances related to neurotransmitters with big-handled names like acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Indirect evidence also points to problems related to dopamine.27 These neurotransmitter imbalances may well be related to the mood imbalances we discussed in relationship with the amygdala.28 ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2725))

- But there is another important factor to consider. Why do some people show strong indications of borderline personality disorder and, as a result, become clinically diagnosed, whereas others show many of the same symptoms yet are never diagnosed? Oddly enough, the reason may lie beyond mere chance and instead may be related to the nature of their impulsivity. Impulsivity, if you'll remember, relates to “bottom-up” kicking of the brain into emotional gear by the limbic system. But it also relates to the ability ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2757))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- to exert “top-down” control over those emotions once they've been kicked into gear. Top-down control is a function of the conscious control over your sensory and emotional systems that you exert to stop yourself from, for example, swearing in front of your four-year-old after slamming your finger in the car door. The neurological pathways related to conscious control can be seen by looking back at the second flow chart a few pages back—the dotted lines with arrows indicate the top-down conscious control of the body from the prefrontal cortical areas (the anterior cingulate and orbital prefrontal cortices) back down to the thalamus, the amygdala, and the nucleus accumbens. Note that “top-down” executive control is separate from the “bottom-up” pathway. The capability to exert executive control over emotion may be one of the defining differences between a clinically diagnosed borderline and a person who shows many borderline traits. This ability to avoid emotional meltdown, at least when it is imprudent to melt, can allow a person to avoid personality disorder diagnosis, notwithstanding other ([Location 2761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2761))

- emotional dysfunction and cognitive-perceptual impairment. It can also allow for the borderline coping characteristic of “situational competence.” As noted psychiatrist Ken Silk has observed, when one of his borderline patients becomes upset, she becomes so swallowed by emotion that she is incapable of logic and is completely unable to assert emotional self control.a. This contrasts markedly with what some refer to as a “high-functioning,” subclinical borderline—a person with many borderline-like traits but who is able to exert executive control as needed. An example of a high-functioning, nonclinically diagnosed person with borderline-like symptoms might be the manipulative supervisor whose angry tirades, threats, and general malicious behavior toward his subordinates is legendary. Yet this same supervisor, even in the midst of a raging fit, is able to flip a mental switch and slip smoothly into a calm greeting if the company president were to pop in.

- Test results surprisingly revealed that there was a single, but very distinct, difference between borderlines and the temperamentally similar controls: clinically diagnosed borderlines had much more difficulty in quickly resolving conflicting information than the temperamentally matched controls and the normal controls. The ability to resolve conflicting information—an essential aspect of what is known as the executive attentional network—appears to be centered in the anterior cingulate cortex. This region undergoes substantial development relatively early in childhood, between the ages of two and seven years old. Posner and his colleagues hypothesized that “certain individuals possess a genetic propensity related to temperamental characteristics present prior to the disorder. Patients with borderline personality disorder often report incidents of abuse during childhood. These environmental events, together with the genetic propensity, may interfere with development of executive control, which in ([Location 2793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2793))

- turn influences the ability to develop clear ideas and empathy for the minds of others as well as the experience of diffusion of one's own identity.”36 In summary then, a very difficult childhood can take a predisposition for borderline personality disorder and turn it into a devastating reality. A decent upbringing, however, can mean that a person with the same predisposition will grow up only to be difficult to deal with, but not necessarily someone who comes to the attention of a clinician. Interestingly, Posner's work regarding the importance of the attentional network to borderline-like behavior ties neatly with Joseph Newman's work involving psychopathy. Newman, if you'll remember, proposed that psychopathy is actually a disorder related to the attentional network. In fact, just as diseases such as schizophrenia may be found in individuals with a wide variety of underlying personality traits, Newman has found evidence that psychopathy may be found in individuals with many different personalities. The underlying personality appears to shape the expression of the psychopathy. A nonviolent sort ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2800))

- Underlying all of these issues are the borderline's problems with identity, which, as psychiatrists Katherine Putnam and Ken Silk note, “may be the most profound and damaging result of a chronic state of emotional dysregulation.” Problems with identity would include the chameleon-like behavior so often seen in borderlines, as well as the paradoxical mixtures of inflexibility and malleability.49 (This is much like Milosevic's inability to be swayed by reason or facts, coupled with his utter dependence on his wife, Mira.) Putnam and Silk add: “As emotional experience constitutes the most fundamental part of our selves, it is impossible to ([Location 2876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=2876))

- Borderline personality disorder often shades in with other personality disorders. One study of fifty-nine borderline patients found that all but one was also suffering from an Axis I disorder—almost 70 percent had three or more.53 The overlap with disorders such as depression, narcissism, and antisocial personality disorder can often make diagnosing the borderline into a complex chess game. If you clear up the depression, for example, will the borderline symptoms go away? Is the patient primarily suffering from antisocial personality disorder with some borderline co-symptoms? Or is he suffering from borderline personality disorder with some symptoms of antisocial personality disorder? Or perhaps the apparent overlap of disorders is just a tool employed by a compassionate doctor to obtain much needed insurance coverage. But the traits of the different disorders overlap for good neurological reasons. Imaging studies of borderline patients as well as patients with antisocial personality, for example, show that both disorders, which share common attributes of impulsivity and cognitive dysfunction, have diminished regional cerebral blood flow in large areas of the right prefrontal and temporal cortex.54 Both disorders also show dysfunction in the frontal cortex and limbic systems, which do the heavy neural lifting involved in processing emotions. There are differences, however, which can be more or less distinct, depending on the symptoms of the patient. Borderlines possess general functional dysregulation, along with hair-trigger amygdalae that respond to even tiny emotional cues. Psychopaths, on the other hand, can sometimes show laid-back responses in the limbic system, including the amygdala, accompanied by revved-up prefrontal areas in response to emotional stimuli. Under fearful situations, however, the limbic and prefrontal areas in psychopaths swap their activation patterns.55 Notably, many of the “coping characteristics” of both disorders are precisely the same—projection, blame shifting, gaslighting, and narcissistic demands.

Not only is personality disorder associated with problematic and even sinister behavior, but it is also related to the naivete that can make relatively normal individuals such easy prey for Machiavellians. But what is perhaps worst of all is that a person can appear entirely normal, free of any consequential diagnosis of personality disorder, yet have sometimes extraordinary deficiencies in his ability to reason. We saw this with Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, who, it seems, fooled even himself into believing that the many wars he initiated and people killed were none of his own doing, or were trivial offenses, and that his destruction of the Serbian economy was beside the point.

- Mao was the most Machiavellian leader of the many Machiavellian leaders of the twentieth century. For three decades, he held absolute power over the lives of one-quarter of the world's population. As historian R. J. Rummel writes: “For perspective on Mao's most bloody rule, all wars [worldwide] 1900–1987 cost in combat dead 34,021,000—including WWI and II, Vietnam, Korea, and the Mexican and Russian Revolutions. Mao alone murdered over twice as many as were ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3008))

- killed in combat in all these wars.”4 He also killed nearly four times as many as are thought to have died in four hundred years of the African slave trade, from capture to sale in Arab, Oriental, or New World markets.5 Therefore it is perhaps surprising to find that psychologists, psychoanalysts, and psychiatrists of the time, and even today, rarely make serious efforts to address the possibility of serious mental illness in motivating Mao's behavior. But MIT political scientist Lucian Pye, who published an early biography of Mao in 1976, the year of Mao's death, provides a lucid explanation for the reticence: “[B]ecause I knew that I was already going out onto thin ice by psychologically interpreting the near-sacred Mao, I decided that it would not be prudent, indeed that it would be counter-productive, to use any technical terminology. Therefore, I did not go public in announcing that Mao Zedong was probably a narcissist with a borderline personality, a combination that is not rare.

As Mao biographer Ross Terrill writes: “The evidence…that Mao was a borderline personality mounts by the year. It includes his youthful loneliness and fascist ideas, the neurasthenia [nervous system exhaustion] to which his doctor testifies…his treatment of family members, his addiction to barbiturates, his lack of give-and-take with colleagues, and his suspiciousness.”7 ([Location 3019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3019))

- Although Mao's mother remained understanding, the problems with school became one more source of tension between father and son. His father would strike him when Mao would not comply—typical behavior for a Chinese paterfamilias of the time. As with Hitler and Stalin, Mao frequently fought with his father. Mao biographers Jung Chang and her husband, Jon Halliday, report: He would tell his father that the father, being older, should do more manual labour than he, the younger—which was an unthinkably insolent argument by Chinese standards. One day, according to Mao, father and son had a row in front of guests. “My father scolded me before them, calling me lazy and useless. This infuriated me. I called him names and left the house…. My father…pursued me, cursing me as well as commanding me to come back. I reached the edge of a pond and threatened to jump in if he came any nearer…. My father backed down.” Once, as Mao was retelling the story, he laughed and added an observation: “Old men like him didn't want to lose their sons. This is their weakness.

This can be comforting even when the ones we love are far away or no longer living.

On an emotional level, if that person is not physically present, they simply don't exist.16 ([Location 3088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3088))

Some borderlines suffer more mood swings in an average day than most people do in a month‥ Imagine trying to walk down the street blindfolded, never knowing if your next step was one step up, two steps up, one step down, two steps down, or level.

- Sexual addiction is a disorder that is thought to have similarities to both alcohol and drug addiction as well as to compulsive gambling. Sex addicts are believed to react strongly to the neurochemical changes that take place in the body during sexual behavior—somewhat like becoming hooked on heroin. One researcher in the area, Dr. Patrick Carnes, states, “Contrary to enjoying sex as a self-affirming source of physical pleasure, the sex addict has learned to rely on sex for comfort from pain, for nurturing or relief from stress. This is much like an alcoholic's use of alcohol.”50 Although sexual addiction is little understood, several studies have shown that it appears to be very commonly found in conjunction with substance abuse, anxiety, and general mood disorders.

Serotonin levels are also thought to play a key role.51 Mao's hypocrisy about sex was breathtaking. “Mao required his people to endure ultra-puritanical constraints. Married couples posted to different parts of China were given only twelve days a year to be together, so tens of millions were condemned to almost year-round sexual abstinence.”52 While ordinary citizens were being sent to labor camps for having had illicit sex, Mao was romping daily with beautiful women—the Chinese Communist equivalent of groupies. Even in his midseventies he was known to invite “three, four, even five of them simultaneously” to share his oversized bed.53 ([Location 3281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3281))

But the essential idea she reviewed and synthesized is unchanged—that is, congenitally deceptive individuals—cheaters—can thrive and reproduce in society. How much these cheaters succeed depends on how many of them there are. If their numbers are tiny, they can easily find victims to dupe, and so they thrive. If their numbers grow large, however, the surrounding population grows more wary. In this more savvy population, it's harder to find a gullible target, and so the duplicitous have a more difficult time being successful—and being able to reproduce successfully. Thus there are fewer cheaters in the subsequent generation. And so it goes in a seesaw of counterbalancing activities, much like a predator-prey relationship.

- But there is yet another reason that altruism may have arisen. It may be related to a strange, semi-kind, semi-vindictive strategy known as reciprocal altruism (first proposed by groundbreaking biologist Robert Trivers in the early 1970s). This strategy alternately cajoles and browbeats people into forming a win-win way of working together. A memorable set of competitions organized over a quarter century ago by political science professor Robert Axelrod showcased just how successful the strategy could be. A version of the game “Prisoner's Dilemma” was used as the basis for Axelrod's competition. In Prisoner's Dilemma, two suspects are jailed separately and given a choice as to whether or not to squeal on their partner. If one partner gives in to the temptation, that partner goes free, and the other—the sucker—is left with an extended jail sentence. If neither partner squeals, however, both serve short jail sentences and then are set free. Obviously the best mutual strategy is to both stay silent and take the significantly reduced jail time.

- a misjudgment of the partner's loyalty can prove devastating. What's a prisoner to do? Axelrod invited game theorists, computer scientists, psychologists, teenage game freaks, and the general public to submit strategies for winning an iterated version of Prisoner's Dilemma in a massive tournament. The submitted strategies were then played off against one another. One parameter that Axelrod was able to tweak in his simulations proved crucial—whether the players expected to meet again. (This was set up mathematically with a discount weighting factor, w, related to the relative importance of the next move.) Axelrod found that if the players did expect to meet again, they were much more likely to cooperate successfully than if they were dealing with an opponent they expected to meet only once. Long-term, the most consistent winning strategy turned out to be the simplest—“tit for tat.” Tit for tat starts out with a first move of cooperation. Then, after the other player makes a move, the strategy involves simply mimicking that move. If the other player defects, defection is in order; if the ([Location 3657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3657))

- other player remains loyal, then both stay loyal. Perhaps most importantly, Axelrod's study (which became one of the most cited articles ever published in the journal Science) showed that nice guys with a willingness to retaliate when necessary can finish first. The mechanism that reinforces this strategy is becoming apparent in medical imaging related to our ability to form moral judgments. It turns out that if we intentionally violate a social norm, our amygdala (the “fight-or-flight” processor deep in the limbic system) becomes activated. If we accidentally transgress a social norm, however, our amygdala isn't activated. It's believed that the amygdala activation occurs as part of a punishment system that is a consequence of one's own immoral behavior. The expectation of a reward, on the other hand, is thought… ([Location 3664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3664))

- One can also imagine variants of tit for tat that involve deceit—people who signal they will remain cooperative but who then defect. Such cheaters often have fine-tuned abilities to hide their intentions, almost as if they were bred with such abilities. Indeed, a number of researchers have posited that the presence of cheaters among human populations has led to a sort of evolutionary arms race over time, “in which potential cooperators evolve fine-tuned sensitivities to likely evidence or cues of deception, while potential cheaters evolve equally fine-tuned abilities to hide those cues.”6 But how applicable is the tit for tat strategy to real human dealings? As it turns out, very—it's just that we use our emotions to do our strategizing. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, was famous for the “Johnson treatment,” a mixture of flattery (that's the kind part of the tit for tat), pressure, and, when all… ([Location 3672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3672))

But a lazy nomadic hunter could, unless retaliated against, constantly mooch off the kills of others. Axelrod's study sparked evolutionary psychiatrist and psychologist Randolph Nesse to posit an evolutionary model focusing on the emotional behavior that underlies tit for tat. Nesse concluded that emotions such as those involved in kindness and retaliation strategies are “specialized modes of operation, shaped by natural selection, to adjust the physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters of the organism in ways that increase its capacity and tendency to respond to the threats and opportunities characteristic of specific kinds of… ([Location 3681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3681))

- The laws of genetics state that physical changes you make in your body, such as pumping iron to get a sculpted physique or lying in a tanning booth to get toasted skin, are not passed on to your children. But there are ways that physical changes you make in yourself and your environment can be passed down to your children. For example, some eight thousand years ago, a few groups of humans stumbled onto the trick of keeping cows, goats, and sheep around and drinking their rich, vitamin D–laden milk. This was terrific—except for one problem. Some humans suffer from ghastly, flatulent side effects when they drink milk because they have stopped producing the enzyme required to digest lactose once they become adults. This meant that those adults who had milk available and could drink it without side effects tended to be healthier—and have healthier kids. Thus people with milk-drinking genetics became far more common in societies where milk was an important food source. In Denmark, for example, a Neolithic dairy hotspot, 98 percent of all adults today can drink milk. In Zambia, however, where tsetse flies haven't allowed for widespread use of dairy cattle, virtually no one past infancy can drink milk.19 Thus, a change in people's behavior made changes in the environment. These environmental changes in turn made changes in people's genes. This type of indirect evolution is called Baldwinian evolution, after American psychologist Mark Baldwin, who first proposed this concept as a variant of Darwinian evolution.20 There are many other examples of Baldwinian evolution. For example, slash-and-burn agriculture, along with animal husbandry, has allowed malarial mosquitoes to flourish in the new ponds and puddles that replaced the forests. This in turn allowed for rapid spread of a number of different genetic mutations that help humans to cope more easily with malaria. These mutations aren't entirely beneficial, as attested to by their role in causing various sickle-cell anemias and thalassaemias. These mutations would never have spread (been “selected for”) if it hadn't been for their beneficial effects in warding off the side effects of malaria.

- Recent studies have shown that a remarkable sixteen million men, one in every two hundred men worldwide alive today, are direct male descendents of thirteenth-century Genghis Khan—a nomad who commandeered virtually all the many sedentary peoples within his long reach. From the Great Khan's six Mongolian wives, as well as the many daughters of foreign rulers that he also took on as wives, and the great numbers of beautiful women he demanded as his due from conquered territories, the Great Khan is thought to have sired an enormous number of children, although the exact number is unknown. Genghis also brought his relatives to the party: “It's likely that some brothers and male cousins of Genghis Khan who shared his Y-chromosome enjoyed heightened reproductive success in his enormous wake,” notes controversial writer Steve Sailer, “rather like how it is said that some of the sex appeal of the rock band Led Zeppelin rubbed off on its lucky roadies.”26 The fact that so many men are direct male descendents of either the Great Khan or one of his near paternal ancestors indicates that ([Location 3811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3811))

- virtually everyone on the Asian steppes is, through some line of descent, carrying the DNA of the Great Khan's family. Even Queen Elizabeth II is thought to be a descendent, through Mary of Teck and her Basarab dynasty ancestors. Physicist turned evolutionary theorist Gregory Cochran observes: “This disproves the theory of history promoted by Marx and Tolstoy that says only social forces matter, not individuals. This shows that one man can make a difference.”27 The difference, of course, lies not only in the virtually single-handed creation of a vast empire, but also in a genetic imprint that leaves competing males in the dust. Research on this type of genetic stamping is still in its infancy. Recently, for example, Giocangga, progenitor of China's Qing dynasty, has been found to be the probable ancestor of approximately 1.6 million men living today.28 The average man from Giocangga's era should have only about twenty living male descendents—which means that Giocangga has left a genetic imprint eighty thousand times larger than that of the typical man of his time. Geneticist Bryan Sykes notes, “Mini-Genghises were probably all over the place in medieval times.”29 Niall of the Nine Hostages, for example, an early medieval Irish king once thought to be apocryphal, is now understood to be a direct paternal ancestor of one in five men from northwest Ireland—and an ancestor to virtually every Irishman. These recent discoveries reinforce the findings of anthropologist Laura Betzig. Her 1986 Despotism and Differential Reproduction provides a cornucopia of evidence documenting the increased capacity of those with more power—and frequently, Machiavellian tendencies—to have offspring. The Guinness Book of World Records, for example, has long cited Ismail the Bloodthirsty as the most prolific man ever—siring 888 children. (In reality, the total was probably closer to three hundred.)30 In any case, Ismail was one of the greatest leaders in the history of Morocco. He was also a man of legendary cruelty who inflicted barbaric punishments on slaves and subjects alike, torturing and beheading on a whim. Ismail the Bloodthirsty's successfully sinister behavior was shared by despots across a broad range of agriculture-based societies. “Under complex preindustrial hierarchies, despotism appears clearly to have been a general phenomenon,” Betzig writes, defining despotism as “an exercised right to murder arbitrarily and with impunity.”31 As Machiavellian researcher Richard Christie and his colleague Florence Geis aptly note: “[H]igh population density and highly competitive environments have been found to increase the use of antisocial and Machiavellian strategies, and may in fact foster the ability of those who possess those strategies to reproduce.”32 ([Location 3819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3819))

- Betzig's ultimate point is not that the corrupt attain power but that those corrupted individuals who achieved power in preindustrial agricultural societies had far more opportunity to reproduce, generally through polygyny, and pass on their genes. The more Machiavellian, that is, despotic, a man might be, the more polygynous he tended to be—grabbing and keeping for himself as many beautiful women as he could.c.34 Some researchers have posited that envy is itself a useful, possibly genetically linked trait, “serving a key role in survival, motivating achievement, serving the conscience of self and other, and alerting us to inequities that, if fueled, can lead to escalated violence.”35 Thus, genes related to envy—not to ([Location 3849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3849))

- mention other more problematic temperaments—might have gradually found increased prevalence in such environments. Incan kings, for example, are recorded as keeping more than seven hundred women with whom to take their pleasure. Further thousands of women were sequestered throughout the kingdom for the king's sole use if he happened by. These women “lived in perpetual seclusion to the end of their lives, and preserved their virginity; and they were not permitted to converse, or have any intercourse with, or to see any man, nor any woman who was not one of themselves.”36 Below the rank of king, reproductive rights were precisely prescribed—caciques were given fifty women, vassal leaders thirty, provincial leaders twenty, and still lower leaders were allocated fifteen, twelve, eight, seven, five, or three, depending on their positions. The remaining women were given to whomever was left.37 Betzig's work provides example after example of similar societies.

- But it is not only despotic, Machiavellian men who might pass along more than their share of “evil” genes. Machiavellian women can also play that game. As it happens, there is enough documentation passed down surrounding the intrigues of the Ottoman Empire to make a good guess at how the game might have been played. In the early 1500s, a fifteen-year-old girl—probably captured in one of the many Tartar slave raids on the Ukraine—was purchased from the open-air market in Istanbul. The girl's buyer was Grand Vizier Ibrahim, the best friend of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent. The girl's name was Roxalena; her new home was to be the Ottoman sultan's harem. Much of what is now known about Roxalena comes from widespread gossip and hearsay—yet the compelling story that has come down to us parallels that of many other successfully sinister individuals. Arriving at the harem, the quick-witted Roxalena soon surpassed dozens of other concubines to become a favorite of the sultan—she was “so full of light that Suleyman seemed blind to her dark side. He named her Hurrem, ‘the laughing one,’ because of her crystalline laughter and freedom from inhibition.”41 Roxalena soon bore Suleyman a son, Mehmed, which elevated her to third-highest woman in the harem.

- Jerold Kreisman, a psychiatrist and leading expert on borderline personality disorder, uses a description of Princess Diana to introduce his most recent book on borderlines: Sometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorder. Kreisman writes: “The fractures in Diana's personality became more prominent during her adolescence. She could be charming, charitable, and remarkably empathic with friends at times, but on other occasions she exhibited an unpredictably cruel rage when these same friends disappointed her. Sometimes, during stressful periods, she appeared calm and stoic, but at other times she became irrationally emotional, alternating between inconsolable grief and ferocious anger.” Kreisman tellingly adds: “Typically, the borderline seeks partners who are in a position of power. The most common scenario involves the younger, attractive, borderline woman and the older, narcissistic man: the secretary embarks on an affair with her older, married boss; a student becomes involved with her professor; a patient with her doctor.”54 Marriage into the aristocracy or royalty, in times of old, or for Diana in modern times, offers the readiest route for borderlines to partners in positions of power. In short, it seems hereditary aristocracies—not to mention the decidedly wealthy—can attract mates with ambitious, manipulative, controlling, chameleon-like, semi-neurotic personalities, who in turn are more prone (although not guaranteed) to have children with a genetic predisposition for similarly idiosyncratic personalities. And indeed, there is a growing body of research literature that reveals how people selectively seat themselves into positions that suit their personalities.55 ([Location 3971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=3971))

- DEFINING “MACHIAVELLIAN” Earlier, I defined a Machiavellian—which I've used interchangeably with the term successfully sinister—as a person who is charming on the surface, a genius at sucking up to power but capable of mind-boggling acts of deceit for control or personal gain. I've also stated that Machiavellians are unscrupulous and self-serving and therefore are capable of deeply malign behavior. But, given the research ([Location 4029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4029))

- results we've covered, it's now possible to refine the definition. Ultimately, a Machiavellian, as I use the term throughout this book, is a person whose narcissism combines with subtle cognitive and emotional disturbances in such a fashion as to make him believe that achieving his own desires, and his alone, is a genuinely beneficial—even altruistic—activity. Since the Machiavellian gives more emotional weight to his own importance than to that of anyone or anything else, achieving the growth of his preeminence by any means possible is always justified in his own mind. The subtle cognitive and emotional disturbances of Machiavellians mean they can make judgments that dispassionate observers would regard as unfair or irrational. At the same time, however, the Macchiavellian's unusual ability to charm, manipulate, and threaten can coerce others into ignoring their conscience and treading a darker path. I recognize it's problematic to use a single term, Machiavellian (or my synonym, successfully sinister), for disturbed individuals who in all likelihood come by their disturbances from a variety of ([Location 4032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4032))

- neurological quirks and environmental influences and who vary significantly in their dysfunction. But psychologists use inherently vague terms like antisocial personality disorder, which has a similar nomenclature-related problem, all the time. The trouble is, it's difficult to conceive of an alternate, more refined shorthand that conveys the same sense of phenotype as Machiavellian. In point of fact, as with many personality types and disorders, there are almost certainly hundreds—perhaps thousands—of genotype configurations and resulting differences in brain function that could underlie Machiavellian behavior, all of which could vary further, depending on slight differences in how one might define the term Machiavellian. And the effect of the environment on those with a potentially Machiavellian genotype is not necessarily as straightforward as it might seem. For example, a talented boy with an underlying set of problematic genes might, as a result of abuse, descend by adulthood into obviously pathological behavior—borderline or psychopathic—that could result in his incarceration and removal from society.

Such individuals help form the backbone of society—the superb secretary whose adept business skills make her boss look good, or the guy who never even sees fit to mention to his family that he had won the Bronze Star for his cool heroism under fire. One such brilliantly talented, non-limelight-hogging person was Gregor Mendel, the man now known as the “Father of Genetics.” Mendel was an inordinately neurotic individual who spent his teenage years in bed with a mysterious illness that now appears to have been akin to acute anxiety.8 In keeping with his neuroticism, Mendel suffered so badly from test anxiety that he twice failed the examination to become a high school teacher. But Mendel, who loved both plants and mathematics, was a curious character. In his happy hideaway at the ([Location 4150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4150))

Mendel did attempt to communicate the results of his remarkable studies, but his pedantic lectures, paltry published study, and bashful attempts at correspondence with other scientists went ignored. Ultimately, although Mendel suspected his results were of supreme importance, his lack of confidence led him to give up and turn away from science altogether. If Mendel had had the ego, self-esteem, or sheer, untrammeled narcissisma. to repeatedly trumpet his findings to the world, researchers would have been clued in to the central ideas underpinning genetics some thirty-five years earlier than they did.

And when the rewards of the enterprise are large, competition by those visionaries can become ruthless—a veritable clash of egomaniacal titans.

- Washington wasn't alone in harboring a volatile side that he attempted to control even as he performed noble deeds. Spiritual master of nonviolence Mahatma Gandhi shared the same characteristic. (Beyond their shared temper, Gandhi, like Washington, wasn't above rewriting his own history to burnish his legend.)52 Biographer Louis Fischer, who knew Gandhi personally, reported, “He had a violent nature and his subsequent mahatma-calm was the product of long training in temperament-control.”53 Early on, it was Gandhi's wife who felt the brunt of his temper. “Once,” Fischer reports, “they quarreled so fiercely he packed her off from Rajkot to her parents in Porbandar.” But where Washington made a virtual religion of self-control, Gandhi made it an actual religion. He took the Hindu ascetic practice of brahmacharya to its broadest interpretation to include “restraint and control of all of the senses, including diet, emotions, speech, and actions.”54 It's enlightening to contrast Gandhi's combination of hot-blooded emotion and generally tight control with Hitler's emotional makeup, as described in a secret analysis written by Dr. Walter Langer in 1943 for US intelligence: [Hitler] shows an utter lack of emotional control. In the worst rages he undoubtedly acts like a spoiled child who cannot have his own way and bangs his fists on the tables and walls. He scolds and shouts and stammers, and on some occasions foaming saliva gathers in the corners of his mouth.

I feared that he would collapse or have a stroke.” It must not be supposed, however, that these rages occur only when he is crossed on major issues. On the contrary, very insignificant matters might call out this reaction. In general they are brought on whenever anyone contradicts him, when there is unpleasant news for which he might feel responsible, when there is any skepticism concerning his judgment, or when a situation arises in which his infallibility might be challenged or belittled.55 ([Location 4345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4345))

- In the end, impulsivity and temper may form part of Machiavellianism, but they also form a part of the broader spectrum of human behavior. If there is a difference between normal and sinister behavior, it is that the successfully sinister often appear to use their temper in a more consciously manipulative fashion for malevolent ends. As the perceptive Abigail Adams would write of George Washington, “[I]f he was really not one of the best-intentioned men in the world, he might be a very dangerous one.”59 ([Location 4363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4363))

- But temper and ego aren't the only double-edged traits. Perhaps surprisingly, cognitive dysfunction can also carry good as well as bad aspects. After all, it was the near-delusional idealism of another founding father, Thomas Jefferson, that lay behind the inspiring opening words to the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” Jefferson's flight of rhetorical hyperbole, and the well-intentioned mindset it sprang from, inspired a nation to recognize the principles of individual rights and freedom ([Location 4368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4368))

- that have since spread from “men” to women and people of all backgrounds. Indeed, Jefferson's extraordinary affinity for “idealized or idyllic visions, and the parallel capacity to deny evidence that exposed them as illusory [was] a central feature of [his] mature thought and character.”60 Jefferson declared, for example, that “all men are created equal,” even as he owned slaves and bedded at least one of them. But despite Jefferson's Mao-like tendencies for duplicitous behavior (George Washington endorsed a characterization of Jefferson as “one of the most artful, intriguing, industrious and double-faced politicians in America”),61 Jefferson retained a very un-Mao-like mental flexibility. He had a sincere aversion for conflict and carried a lifelong willingness to absorb advice from his many friends. As a consequence, most of Jefferson's more lunatic ideas—such as canceling all debts every nineteen years—were pruned before ever reaching public discourse. It is that ability to listen and, at least on occasion, to change one's views in response (perhaps echoes of the ability or inability to resolve conflicting information that Posner's group was studying), that appears to be the key difference between inflexible tyrants such as Hitler and Mao, and vastly more effective, although still tough, leaders such as Turkey's founder Kemal Ataturk; Britain's Winston Churchill, and, in other fields… ([Location 4372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4372))

- Research in delusional thinking is still in its infancy, but it seems clear that delusions must involve a fairly complex process. After all, it isn't just that the delusional person makes a mistake when perceiving something. Instead, a delusion can be adopted and maintained as a belief despite convincing contradictory evidence, and in the face of the fact that it is completely implausible. Delusions can be held with great conviction and defy rational counterargument. Such delusions often also involve jumping to conclusions: a negative bias in the way facts are absorbed; a way of processing information so that it becomes focused on the delusional individual herself; and biased recall that can actually seem emotionally richer to the delusional person than real memories. Indeed, one of the ([Location 4392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4392))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- strongest characteristics of delusional thinking is the unwillingness to admit to any evidence that would refute the belief. Such thinking is reminiscent of the inflexible thinking of many a nefarious dictator—or difficult college roommate. Researchers who have studied deluded patients have taken care to point out that these patients aren't delusional about everything. But such patients often do show a personalizing bias—a tendency to blame other people when things go wrong (in a word, projection). Interestingly, it seems that there is a separate neural circuit for threatening information that pertains directly to the “self” as opposed to anything else. Delusional patients, it seems, are not able to tone this circuit down, which means excessive attention is paid to “self-referential” information. This inclines the delusional person to think in a self-serving fashion. Research in delusions may help to provide a neurological-based understanding for the sometimes incomprehensibly self-centered behavior found in extreme narcissism.d.65 One hypothesis relates delusional thinking to defects in the regulation of dopamine and perhaps other neurotransmitters. This could lead to a person improperly assessing the importance of the information she is receiving, because dopamine helps a person figure out whether whatever she is perceiving is either good or bad. It's thought that there may be two very different types of delusional thinking—one that is driven by emotion, and one that seems to have no relation to emotion at all. Interestingly, treatment of mood disorders seems to reduce delusional thinking that is based on emotion. No one knows the cause of many of the nonemotion-related delusions.

- early psychoanalyst Walter Langer pointed out, Hitler was so clever at finding facts to prove his emotions correct that he appeared to be making rational judgments when that was actually far from the case. This was particularly true in discussions, where Hitler was “unable to match wits with another person in a straightforward argument. He [would] express his opinion at length, but he [would] not defend it on logical grounds.” One observer noted: “He is afraid of logic. Like a woman he evades the issue and ends by throwing in your face an argument entirely remote from what you were talking about.”69 Hitler's near-schizophrenic magical thinking led him to believe “that his ‘will’ could accomplish what others thought impossible, [he would thus] brook no contradiction from lesser souls. The absolute power he in fact obtained served then to reinforce his idea that his will was magical.”70 “No matter how impulsive, bizarre, destructive, or lawless his actions were, Hitler rationalized them as legitimate.”71 And, like each of the other dictators we've discussed, Hitler was ([Location 4416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4416))

- particularly gifted at the borderline trait of gaslighting—that supernal technique of denying reality that can so throw an opponent. Particularly disconcerting in light of Hitler's phenomenal memory (about which more will be said later) was his capacity for “forgetting.” He would say something one day and then, several days later, say something that would completely contradict the first statement. If the inconsistency was pointed out, Hitler would fly into a rage, demanding to know whether the other person thought he was a liar. Leading Nazis took to mirroring Hitler's trick (shades of the emotional contagion seen in Ceausescu's Romania—and in Skilling's Enron). As former Nazi leader Hermann Rauschning observed: “Most of the Nazis with Hitler at their head, literally forget, like hysterical women, anything they have no desire to remember.”72 He noted further that Hitler was “capable of entertaining the most incompatible ideas in association with one another.”73 ([Location 4424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4424))

- We've talked about the mixed advantages of narcissism, temper, and cockeyed cognition. But what about the desire for control and its often conjoined twin, ambition? Certainly we know that an obsession with power and control is one of the most common traits of tyrannical dictators. For example, after wrecking Zimbabwe's strong economy and relatively sound human rights record, tyrannical dictator Robert Mugabe “made no attempt to deal with any of the calamitous economic and social issues facing his government. All that mattered to him was the exercise of power…. Whatever the cost, his regime was dedicated towards that end.”78 Likewise, biographer Robert Waite summarizes apropos Hitler: “[T]he most basic single characteristic of both his personal life and his system of government can be reduced to one overriding need: to force others to do his will.”79 Attaining and maintaining control was also a central tenet of Stalin's existence. His closest circle and top generals had naturally devolved to those with a gift for acquiescing and brown-nosing.

- In general, people associate a steel-trap memory with high intelligence, although the two qualities don't appear to be necessarily linked (witness idiot savants). A sharp memory can easily be used as a manipulative tool by the less bright, but more Machiavellian among us. Thus, for example, Mussolini used his prodigious memory to fool people into thinking that he had an exceptionally wide knowledge of science and philosophy. In reality his knowledge was often limited to what he'd happened to skim a few pages of—but which he could recite practically verbatim.89 ([Location 4519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4519))

- A retentive memory also plays a surprisingly important role in such factors as charm and charisma. Who is not delighted to discover that he is important enough that his name is remembered, even after a meeting that lasted only seconds many years before? Teachers with extraordinary memories can hold students mesmerized with their ready command of facts and be endeared for their ability to remember student names. (As Philip Wankat notes in The Effective, Efficient Professor, “The most important single activity you can do to show students that you are interested in them is to learn and use their names.”) Famed Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, popular with his crew (and consequently disliked by fellow explorer Robert Falcon Scott), delighted everyone with his wonderful memory and “amazing treasure of most interesting anecdote.”93 Many top political leaders with good or great reputations—and remarkable memories—include Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher,g.94 and Chinese president Hu Jintau, ([Location 4530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4530))

Other top business leaders with a different sort of reputation—but no less remarkable a memory—include indicted Hollinger CEO Conrad Black, convicted former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, convicted CEO Martha Stewart, and (if you consider mob bosses to be business leaders), dreaded capo di tutti i capi Toto Riina.95 President Bill Clinton, with his marvelously retentive memory, could cover gaffes such as being given the wrong speech for his first State of the Union address through recollection and ad-libbing—no one ever guessed what was going on until later. And President Ronald Reagan was a near-professional raconteur, with ready quips always at hand to loosen tension; he could quote long passages from memory of books that had impressed him. It was Reagan's extraordinary memory that underpinned his moniker of “The Great Communicator” (which makes his later Alzheimer's all the more tragic).

- Buffett's success also shows the importance of recognizing the possibility of darker motives in others. Warren Buffett is widely acknowledged to be the greatest investor the world has ever known. As biographer Roger Lowenstein summarizes: “Starting from scratch, simply by picking stocks and companies for investment, Buffett amassed one of the epochal fortunes of the twentieth century. Over a period of four decades—more than enough to iron out the effects of fortuitous rolls of the dice—Buffett outperformed the stock market, by a stunning margin and without taking undue risks or suffering a single losing year. This is a feat that market savants, Main Street brokers, and academic scholars had long proclaimed to be impossible.”104 How does he do it? Buffett merges so many extraordinary abilities in one ebullient fireball that it's impossible to single any one trait out and say that's the key. He possesses an Einstein-like ability to focus (that is, a Lamborghini of an anterior cingulate cortex) and a photographic memory (making it easy to posit val/val BDNF with a deluxe option package of accompanying alleles). Buffett doesn't need a computer because, as he told one interviewer, “I am a computer.”105 Perhaps surprising in light of Buffett's extraordinary ability to discern patterns from numbers is his talent for intuiting people's ability and motives—an underappreciated tool in the investment toolkit. If a would-be manager is more interested in the money than the business, Buffett either settles on a different manager or pulls up financial stakes and instead invests elsewhere. One whiff of Enron-style leadership, one suspects, and Buffett would make a speedy getaway. ([Location 4606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4606))

- Buffett himself writes: I would agree that I have been pretty good at sizing up people. Not perfect, of course—I've certainly made a few mistakes in selecting managers at Berkshire. I would say that part of the reason for the success I've had is that I only take the easy cases. In other words, if you gave me 100 people to evaluate on a scale of 1–10 in terms of how they would work out at Berkshire, I would be pretty good at selecting a few 10s. I would also miss a few other 10s in my screening and I would be terrible at differentiating between the 3s and the 7s. This is similar to my method of selecting stocks where I only have to be right on a few decisions and can put most of the rest into the “too hard” pile.106 Buffett's practical ability to tell the difference between genuinely outstanding managers and their dark, chameleon-like doppelgängers has shaped his approach to business and propelled his efforts to steer Wall Street toward an ethical path. As Bill George at U.S. News & World Report points out: “[Buffett's] commitment to sound ethics and principles, his self-discipline and consistency, his transparency in disclosing mistakes, his criticism of Wall Street fees and compensation of underperforming CEOs, and his pleas for improving corporate governance—all have had a salutary influence on the corporate community.”107 In reality, no other businessman has applied such pressure to ensure that ethical practices are woven into the… ([Location 4619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4619))

- Thus the basic features of morality appear to be hardwired, and not a product of culture.116 Harvard biologist Marc Hauser, who has done extraordinary work in this area, has found that although there are some differences in morality between cultures, there are limits to those variations. There are some things, in other words, that religion or education can't easily instill in us, because it goes against our natural intuition—our built in moral compass. Ultimately then, religion, education, and even family may have less of an impact on our innate sense of morality than we may think.117 Ethics classes, in other words, really may just preach to the choir. Those few who are wired differently—and we are beginning to learn how the wiring's awry—march to their own moral tune, no matter what they are taught.

- Until January 2007. That's when an electronic prepublication version of a study popped up on one of my noodling, doodling, double-checking searches.1 My eyes widened as I read the abstract. This study—a massive one involving 4,660 Danish polio patients—was intended to discover whether polio could be associated with subsequent risk of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders. It turns out that medical data in Denmark is tracked in a particularly useful fashion, making it relatively straightforward to compare polio survival with demographically similar individuals. It should be remembered that many polio survivors, unlike Carolyn, develop compulsively goal-oriented, high-achieving personalities—and they do not lack for kindness.2 Even so, this study found that polio survivors appeared to have a 40 percent increased risk of being hospitalized for various psychiatric disorders. This sounds high, and is high, but still, in all, equates to only a small bump in the incidence of psychiatric disorders in polio survivors. For those who contracted polio before age seven, as Carolyn did, the risk of psychiatric hospitalization was even higher.

- Perhaps without polio, Carolyn would have had the creative, emotionally dynamic personality of so many in my family. But the polio left a tragic overlay on her character. Was this due to neural damage from the poliovirus itself? Or trauma related to the horrific experience of having polio? Or genetic predisposition? All of the above, it seems. Part of Carolyn's problem was that she skated ahead of the wave of research findings. When the full force of her disordered personality began to flower in her teens, it was still over a decade before borderline personality would become a diagnostic entity. No one knew the real significance of the fact that poliovirus could invade not only motor neurons, but the reticular activating system—that crucial section of our brain that maintains our attention and alertness.3 Carolyn's attentional system was dysfunctional. This would have meant that neurotransmitter systems throughout Carolyn's brain were also dysfunctional, perhaps causing her to have some of the same sweeping neurological differences we've seen in the brains of those who are clinically diagnosed with a personality disorder. The clues were all there, even from the beginning of my research. It's just that until prompted by this final, capstone study, I wasn't able to put those clues together. I knew that polio's invasion and partial destruction of the reticular activating system also affects the survivor's attention.4 But I hadn't associated this finding with those of Michael Posner's group, which indicated that minor differences in the attentional network appear to be vitally influential in the development of full-blown borderline personality disorder—for those with the genetic predisposition. And I also hadn't connected polio's damage to the attentional network with Joseph Newman's work. Newman, if you'll remember, had shown the importance of a dysfunctional attentional network in the development of psychopathy—a disorder he has also shown to not necessarily be related to violence. Despite her sometimes psychopathic-like behavior, Carolyn seemed so intelligent because, indeed, she was. Polio never invades the nonmotor neurons of the cortical areas; Carolyn's natural intelligence was left intact, floating on a surreal, dysfunctional emotional foundation. Through decade after decade of manipulation and deceit, no one could know that Carolyn's strange, uncaring attitude was not a conscious choice but was almost certainly due to shaky neural underpinnings, in all probability caused by a perfect storm of neural damage due to the poliovirus infection, extraordinary stress from the consequent social isolation and ostracization, and underneath it all, a genetic predisposition.

- Did Carolyn have free will in how she led her life? In some sense, the question is meaningless. Does a cat have a choice when she affectionately licks her kittens? Does a killer whale have a choice when it toys with a terrified seal pup? If I've learned anything through these many years of research, it's that Carolyn's choices were a bit like the choices a tree on a windy shoreline has in deciding how tall and how bent to grow. Sure, others, as for example, George Washington and Mahatma Gandhi, were probably able to produce real changes in their neurological makeup through their conscious choices—strengthening their top-down control even if they were unable to adjust their bottom-up passions. Research is in fact showing that extraordinary neural shifts can take place through long-term conscious efforts.7 ([Location 4836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4836))

- Already, for example, imaging techniques are being used to prove that emotional arousal to negative stimuli can be reduced in those suffering from borderline personality disorder by using dialectic-behavioral therapy.11 Someday—perhaps sooner than we think—the genes involved may even be reengineered by inserting a sly nucleotide here and a tandem sequence there, simultaneously repairing the coding that might have been altered by drugs such as alcohol. Perhaps even new growth can be encouraged in areas where neurons have been destroyed. It will be the brilliant researchers at the National Institutes of Health and at laboratories and universities worldwide—perhaps led by an ambitious, prickly narcissist or two—who will pioneer these new approaches.

- And, in a related issue, it is becoming apparent that America's high prison population compared to other countries may simply be a consequence of the fact that Americans have fewer involuntary patients in mental institutions.14 (Deinstitutionalization—a result of the political left's push for patients’ rights and the right's push for cost-savings—has had far-reaching, unanticipated consequences.) Certainly the debate surrounding free will and responsibility, which has occupied philosophers for centuries, is not likely to end soon.a.15 ([Location 4881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=4881))

- So many years chasing Carolyn. I understand better now how my sister's life was spent tracing the skewed patterns of her neurons. Did she have a deep-seated genetic predisposition for her sinister behavior? Quite possibly. Did the polio exacerbate her instability? Almost certainly. Did she drink to fill the emptiness of her ephemeral, underperforming neurotransmitters, and did that contribute to her behavioral problems and her anorexia? Absolutely.

- Carolyn's ultimate psychiatric diagnosis? Perhaps it doesn't matter. After all, borderline, psychopath, and any number of other diagnoses are all just words we clumsily apply to the complex processes that can be associated with both nature and nurture as a dysfunctional brain develops. Do I forgive Carolyn? Certainly writing this book has given me a compassion I never felt before. I can understand now some of the neurological and genetic quirks that spun Carolyn in directions she had little control over, whatever her conscious feelings to the contrary. But I also know that if, through some cosmic trick, Carolyn were to suddenly be alive again, smiling in my living room as she played with one of my children, something visceral would still rise in me, as if I'd just found my children toying with a snake. Perhaps surprisingly, I think this means I'm “at a good place” now. Reason has given me an understanding and peace that might be called forgiveness. But emotions remain, serving as a shield that helps protect both my loved ones and myself from Carolyn and people like Carolyn. Researching this book hasn't saddened me, or at least not too much, about the things that can't be changed in people like Carolyn. It has just given me a gentle reminder that in the end, we should perhaps not worry so much about changing others. Rather, we might think instead about changing ourselves. Still, when all is said and done, I can't but wonder—did Carolyn have the capacity for love? Not cheaply expressed “love” for an easily manipulated paramour or for an obedient and at least temporarily useful caretaker, but real love that included the idea of sacrifice and sorrow and joy for another? Did she love, for example, our father—the person who, through all the years, loved her most unwaveringly, most loyally, most honestly? A journal entry tells me: May 6th: Penny watered the artichokes and fed the birds; also, cleaned up the dried parsley I accidentally spilled. Barb called—Dad died. My request for help with periodontal care seemed self-serving; but apparently this will be handled through a trust fund. I page onward through the entries. The diary continues on routinely through May, June, and July: she changed sheets, read cookbooks, pulled a muscle while inebriated, went shopping, watched television. One Thursday she presciently notes: “There is absolutely no reason to keep a journal. Actually self-indulgent! My hubris will catch up with me.” Actually, it wasn't hubris. It was her boyfriend, Jack. Jack himself had apparently called 911 to report Carolyn's death, but when the police arrived at the apartment, Jack had proved curiously evasive. When asked if Carolyn drank, after much prodding, Jack confessed she drank a third of a bottle of alcohol a day. As Officer Crispin related in his subsequent phone call to me, this amount of booze was unimpressive: “Most alcoholics drink about a half gallon a day,” he told me. “A third of a bottle shouldn't have killed her.” Crispin… ([Location 5038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=5038))

- Carolyn's last written words reverberate: “Back to the real world after panic attack. Must ease Jack out. Can't tolerate the smoke or the late night ‘sloppies.’ He is still a good friend to have.” I rifle through her diaries. Nothing more. Nothing of interest. Except one day. August 9th—three months after my father died. Two years before her own death. Nancy did nice lady visitation to thank me for goodies. I fell very much in like with her. I was too talky—I had lost last night's supper and had swollen eyes from tears shed over that actor Charlton Heston's announcement of… ([Location 5070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=5070))

- The question people ask most often is, “How do I make my family member go to a therapist?” The answer is, “you can't.” You may be able to threaten the person into going, but all you get is a warm body, not an engaged or open mind. Rather than focus on what your family member thinks, which you can't control, focus on his behavior toward you, and think about what you will and will not accept.

- You will hear over and over again that a person can only receive a diagnosis of BPD after the age of eighteen. This is an old and entrenched way of thinking. Today, experienced clinicians believe it's crucial to address borderline-like behavior as soon as possible. The longer the disorder goes untreated, the more entrenched it can become.

- The first rule of communication is knowing when not to attempt it. When someone with symptoms of borderline personality disorder has intense feelings, the emotional centers of his brain “hijack” the logical centers. Asking your family member to process factual information is like asking a baby to drive a car. It's not that he doesn't want to, it's that he can't.

- Metaphorically, people who express sympathy are like people who drive by the scene of an accident, slow down, give an encouraging expression to the driver of the banged-up car, then speed up and go along their merry way. On the other hand, people who express empathy pull over, get out of their car, clasp the shoulder of the driver, and say, “Oh wow, I bet this is the last thing you needed to happen right now.” ([Location 5190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003F8S77W&location=5190))
