## Highlights
- one granular bit of wisdom, something that is both applicable and memorable. Anyone can deliver a speech filled with sweeping generalities. Most people are capable of offering old chestnuts and choice proverbs. The great commencement speakers manage to lodge a small, original, useful, and memorable idea in the minds of the graduates. It’s the offer of one final lesson — a bit of compelling wisdom and insight that the graduates will remember long after they have tossed their caps and moved into the greater world.

- The situation is becoming precarious. I need this boy to pee, but it turns out that you can’t make a human being pee, even if you’re forty years older, 150 pounds heavier, and his father. There are just some things that can’t be done without consent. Peeing is one of these things. ([Location 4351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4351))

- One of my favorites is by humorist Evan Esar: “The only way to cure an egotist from bragging is by surgery — amputation at the neck.” Avoiding bragging can make storytelling difficult, because we all have moments of true accomplishment that we want to share, and, in some cases, we are almost required to share: Job interviews College applications Meeting the in-laws for the first time There is nothing wrong with sharing your success stories, but they are hard stories to tell well. The truth is this: failure is more engaging than success. ([Location 4538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4538))

- I continue to blog daily, but I still don’t swear or speak profanely on my blog. I don’t criticize my school district or my colleagues. You’ll never find a photograph of my holding a beer or drinking wine. I knew what to write and what not to write to preserve my reputation in my community. I knew where the line was, and I often stepped on it but never over it. It saved me. As a storyteller, you need to do the same. Whether you are telling a story to a coworker, conducting a presentation in a boardroom, toasting your brother at a wedding, or performing onstage, the words you choose will in part determine how your audience perceives you. It will impact the opinions that they form about you. Here is my advice in these matters. ([Location 4797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4797))

- In truth, I’ve been talking about my parents’ failures for a long time. There is very little that I don’t share with the world, but this is me. It might not be you. I’m a big believer in the words of novelist Anne Lamott: “You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.” For this reason, I also name my former stepfather by both his first and last name in my stories. I believe in naming the villains in our lives. Neil McKenna destroyed ([Location 4856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4856))

- my mother’s life, and in many ways he seriously damaged the lives of his stepchildren in the process. He was a despicable human being, so I say his name with enthusiasm. In the end, you make the choice over what names you want to use. Just be sure to consider the possible long-term effects of using the name.

- Instead of memorizing your story word-for-word, memorize three parts to a story: 1.    The first few sentences. Always start strong. 2.    The last few sentences. Always end strong. 3.    The scenes of your story. ([Location 4996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=4996))

- I don’t memorize my stories. I memorize the places where my story takes me, so even if I can’t remember how I want to tell it, I can still do so. I may lose some ([Location 5011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=5011))

- laugh lines, clever transitions, and “golden sentences,” but I’m still telling my story. It may not sound as good as it could, but I’m not trapping my audience in awkward, story-killing silence. ([Location 5013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CV2PFYJ&location=5013))
