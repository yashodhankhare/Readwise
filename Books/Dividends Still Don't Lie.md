- in the stock market. This investment concept first was published in 1966 in what then was a new investment advisory service, Investment Quality Trends. Forty-three years and three books later, the service is still helping investors master the stock market by investing in high quality, dividend paying, blue chip stocks. It helps them know when stocks are undervalued, when they can be bought, and overvalued, when they should be sold.

- The importance of dividends in determining value in the stock market cannot be overstated. The main reason investors are willing to risk their capital in anything is to get a return on their investment. In the real estate market, that return is rent. In the money market, it is interest. And in the stock market, it is a cash dividend. Folks who ignore the… ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=179))

- Speculators hope that the price of a stock will go up and reward them with profits. Investors know that stocks that pay dividends go up too. Meanwhile, they are getting a return on their capital. They believe the old adage: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

- It is undeniable that many stock market investors are attracted to companies that pay dividends. Unconsciously, investors have established profiles of value for each dividend-paying stock based on historic extremes of high and low dividend yield. Those extremes of yield provide profitable buying and selling areas. A stock is undervalued when the… ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=186))

- historically low. Let us examine how and why dividends create value in the stock market. When the price of a stock declines far enough to produce a high dividend yield, value-minded investors who seek income begin to buy. The further the price falls, the higher the yield becomes and the more investors are drawn to the stock. Eventually the stock becomes irresistibly… ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=189))

- The higher the price rises, the lower the dividend yield becomes and fewer investors are attracted to the stock. Meanwhile, investors who purchased the stock at lower levels are inclined to sell and take their profits. Eventually the price becomes so high and the dividend yield is so low, sellers outnumber buyers and the price of the stock begins to decline.

It should be noted that each dividend-paying stock etches its own individual profile of value. These profiles of high and low dividend yield are established over long periods of time.

Some growth stocks are undervalued when the dividend yield is as low as 2.0 percent or 3.0 percent. The yields at overvalue are similarly distinctive and individual.

- Now, here is the best part. Every time a dividend is increased, the prices at undervalue and overvalue move higher to reflect the historically established high and low dividend yields. Therefore, a company that has a long history of consistent dividend increases is most desirable. It promises steady growth of capital as well as continuous growth of dividend… ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=204))

- temporary solution to what could be a serious financial problem. It is akin to putting a Band-Aid on a deep laceration before a doctor can attend to it. For this reason we look at a company’s payout ratio. The payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend by the trailing 12-month earnings and then multiplying by 100. By example, if the dividend is $1.60 per share and the trailing 12 months earnings are $3.43 per share, the formula would look like this: ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=2532))

As a general rule of thumb we prefer the payout ratio to be 50 percent or less for an industrial company, and because of its different capital structure, 75 percent for a utility company. When the payout ratio is too high, it can limit a company’s ability to invest in future ([Location 2536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00371V7DS&location=2536))
