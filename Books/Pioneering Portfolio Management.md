## Highlights
- As innovative and successful as Yale’s many investment initiatives have been—and Yale’s extraordinary achievement in superior long-term results quite naturally attracts all the attention—close observers know that the real secret in Yale’s investment success is not the profoundly pleasing performance produced over the past five, ten, and twenty years. Just as the secret of real estate is location, location, location, the real secret to Yale’s remarkable continuing success is defense, defense, defense. But how, you might ask, can defense be so important to Yale’s remarkably positive results? Starting with those great truisms of long-term success in investing—“If you lose 50 percent, it will ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=65))

- take a 100 percent win just to get even,” or “If investors could just delete their few large losses, the good results would take care of themselves”—all experienced investors will gladly remind us of the great advantages of staying out of trouble. Delete a few disasters and compounding takes care of everything. (The equivalent in driving is simple: No serious accidents.) Consistency of strong results over many years—plus indications that even as competition gets stronger, Yale’s results are still improving comparatively—provides evidence of the advantages of Swensen’s giving first priority to a strong and assertive defense. On a strong “defense first” foundation, he and his team conduct a repetitively active search for better ways to manage the total portfolio—from individual manager selection and manager creation to pioneering concepts of asset classes. Yale continues to demonstrate that the best defense in free and dynamic markets is neither fixed nor cautious, but rather, is resourceful, bold, and active on every level.

- When I wrote my second book, Unconventional Success, I characterized its message as “a sensible investment framework for individuals,” in contrast to the institutional focus of Pioneering Portfolio Management. I erred in describing my target audiences. In fact, I have come to believe that the most important distinction in the investment world does not separate individuals and institutions; the most important distinction divides those investors with the ability to make high quality active management decisions from those investors without active management expertise. Few institutions and even fewer individuals exhibit the ability and commit the resources to produce risk-adjusted excess returns.

- The knowledge base that provides useful support for investment decisions knows no bounds. A rich understanding of human psychology, a reasonable appreciation of financial theory, a deep awareness of history, and a broad exposure to current events all contribute to development of well-informed portfolio strategies. Many top-notch practitioners confess they would work without pay in the endlessly fascinating money management business.

- Even though the investment lessons in this book focus on the challenges and rewards of investing educational endowment funds, the ideas described in these pages address issues of value to all participants in financial markets. Perhaps most important, readers might develop an understanding of the extraordinary requirements for successful pursuit of active management strategies. Rigorous self-assessment leads to segregation of those with active management ability from those without, increasing chances for investment success by understanding which activities to avoid and which activities to pursue. Beyond the pragmatic possibility of improving investment outcomes, students of finance might enjoy exploring the thought process underlying the ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=397))

- While endowment size clearly correlates with institutional quality, the direction of causality remains unclear. Do higher quality institutions attract higher levels of endowment support, creating a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle? Or do larger endowments provide the resources required to build superior institutions, facilitating the creation of a margin of excellence? Regardless of the direction of causation, greater financial resources correlate with superior educational environments.

- Understanding the purposes that drive endowment accumulation represents an important first step in structuring an investment portfolio. By defining the reasons endowments exist, fiduciaries lay the groundwork for articulation of specific investment goals, shaping in a fundamental manner the investment policy and process.

- Benjamin Franklin observed that death and taxes represent life’s only certainties. Managers of endowment assets suspend those certainties, as educational institutions aspire to exist in perpetuity and endowment assets enjoy exemption from taxes. The perpetual nature of colleges and universities makes endowment management one of the investment world’s most fascinating endeavors. Balancing the tension between preserving long-run asset purchasing power and providing substantial current operating support provides a rich set of challenges, posing problems unique to endowed educational institutions. Purchasing power preservation represents a long-term goal, spanning generations. Successfully managed endowments retain forever the ability to provide a particular level of institutional support, justifying the classification of endowment funds as permanent assets. Pursuit of long-term asset preservation requires seeking high returns, accepting the accompanying fundamental risk and associated market volatility. Stable operating support constitutes an intermediate-term goal, reflecting the demands of a shorter-term budgetary planning cycle. Since academic programs contract only with great difficulty, institutions rely on reasonably predictable flows of funds from endowment to support operations. Supplying stable distributions for current operations requires dampening portfolio volatility, suggesting lower levels of fundamental risk with the accompanying lower levels of expected returns.

- The late Yale economist James Tobin captured the essence of the investment problem facing fiduciaries: The trustees of an endowed institution are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task is to preserve equity among generations. The trustees of an endowed university like my own assume the institution to be immortal. They want to know, therefore, the rate of consumption from endowment which can be sustained indefinitely. . . . In formal terms, the trustees are supposed to have a zero subjective rate of time preference. Consuming endowment income so defined means in principle that the existing endowment can continue to support the same set of activities that it is now supporting. This rule says that the current consumption should not benefit from the prospects of future gifts to endowment. Sustained consumption rises to encompass and enlarge the scope of activities when, but not before, capital gifts enlarge the endowment.1 ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=770))

- FOUNDATION INVESTMENT GOALS Foundations share some characteristics with educational endowments. Along with their counterparts at colleges and universities, trustees of foundation assets often ignore Ben Franklin’s certainties of life, enjoying favorable tax status and operating with a perpetual horizon. For many foundations, however, permanency constitutes a choice, not an ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1030))

- obligation. If a foundation pursues a mission with a particular sense of urgency, for example, funding research to cure a terribly virulent disease, the trustees may decide to expend all available resources in an attempt to reach the goal with deliberate speed. Even without a time-sensitive mission, spending at rates designed to extinguish foundation assets constitutes a legitimate option for trustees. A number of characteristics separate academic institutions from foundations. College and university endowment managers control both the management of assets, by determining the portfolio allocation, and the specification of liabilities, by defining the spending policy. The lack of constraints on investment and spending strategies provides great flexibility for fiduciaries, increasing the likelihood of meeting institutional goals. Foundations exercise complete control over asset-allocation policies, similar to the flexibility enjoyed by educational institutions. On the spending side, however, foundations must achieve a minimum payout of five percent of assets to support charitable purposes, or face tax penalties. The mandated distribution level causes foundations to face an investment problem materially different from the challenge facing educational endowment managers. While academic institutions benefit enormously from high levels of endowment distributions, in the event of a serious disruption in endowment support other revenue sources play a compensating role in the budgetary base. Endowment distributions generally support only a modest portion of educational institution operating budgets, with ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1033))

- major research universities relying on endowment payout to fund an average of 12.5 percent of expenditures.7 For most such institutions, a significant decrease in spending from endowment poses difficult problems, but fails to threaten institutional viability. Foundations rely almost exclusively on investment income to support operations. In 2006, eight of the ten largest grant-making foundations received essentially 100 percent of total revenues from investment portfolios. Even though grant programs grow and shrink somewhat more readily than academic operations, foundations require reasonably stable flows of funds to avoid disruption, particularly when activities involve multiyear commitments. The great reliance of foundations on distributions from investment assets calls for structuring portfolios with lower risk profiles. Colleges and universities benefit from the generosity of alumni and friends, with gifts providing an important source of support for academic programs. In difficult times, inflows from donors serve… ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1044))

- In spite of superficial similarities, endowments and foundations differ in important ways, including the amount of control over spending streams, the degree of programmatic reliance on portfolio distributions, and the availability of continuing external support. While endowments and foundations share some important characteristics, dissimilarities between the two types of funds lead to articulation of meaningfully different purposes and goals. That investment objectives of such closely related organizations differ so significantly highlights the importance of careful consideration of the relationship between investment funds and institutional objectives. Understanding the raison d’etre of a fund and expressing the related institutional aspirations serve as an important starting point in the fund’s management process.

- Henry Hansmann, the Augustus E. Lines Professor of Law at Yale Law School, questions the advisability of any endowment accumulation, raising issues that go far beyond the question of appropriate payout rates. In an August 2, 1998 New York Times interview, Hansmann suggests that “a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.”8 Hansmann suggests that trustees pursue a “real objective” of accumulating a large and growing endowment, viewing the educational operations as a constraint to unfettered financial asset accumulation. Administrators and faculty seek endowments to provide job security, a light workload, and a pleasant physical environment, while alumni focus on reputational capital, hoping to bask in the reflected glory of a wealthy educational institution. In a paper entitled “Why Do Universities Have Endowments?” Hansmann uses the experience of the 1960s and 1970s to bolster his argument. He notes the “financial crisis of the 1970s” damaged higher education as “private demand declined, government support abruptly stopped its former upward trajectory, and energy costs increased dramatically.”9 Recognizing that universities found themselves squeezed between costs that were continuing to rise and income sources that were shrinking, Hansmann observes “little affirmative evidence that universities have viewed their endowments principally as buffers for their ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1078))

- operating budgets.”10 Yale’s Endowment Buffer An analysis of the behavior of Hansmann’s own institution belies his claims. His employer, Yale University, used endowment spending policy to dampen growth in the boom times of the 1960s and to cushion the financial trauma of the 1970s. During the decade of the 1960s, Yale released an average of 4.4 percent of the endowment to support the academic enterprise. Strong budgetary results and superior investment performance accompanied endowment distributions that provided support at levels consistent with long-term sustainability. In contrast, during the 1970s, spending from endowment averaged 6.3 percent, as Yale sought to offset, at least in part, the impact of hostile economic forces. Despite following a policy that released support for the operating budget at unsustainable rates, Yale posted deficits in every year of the decade. The policy of “leaning against the wind” cost the endowment dearly, as the purchasing power of assets declined by more than 60 percent between 1968 and 1982, in spite of the infusion of substantial amounts of new gifts. The historical record indicates that Yale uses… ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1090))

- 1970s saw spending peak at the stunning rate of 7.4 percent in 1971. Without extraordinary endowment support in the 1970s, Yale’s operational troubles would have been magnified, perhaps causing long-term damage to the institution. Not only does historical experience suggest that Yale employed endowment assets to insulate academic programs from economic stress, but the very nature of the university’s spending policy places budgetary stability in a prominent place. Each year Yale spends 80 percent of last year’s spending adjusted for inflation plus 20 percent of the targeted long-term spending rate applied to the previous year’s endowment market value… ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1101))

- Spending Policy Extremes Examining Yale’s spending decisions in the context of policy extremes favoring, on the one hand, spending stability and, on the other hand, endowment preservation, highlights the university’s substantial bias toward providing reliable support for operations. If universities treat academic operations as a sideshow to endowment accumulation, spending distributions would correspond to levels consistent with maintenance of asset purchasing power. In the extreme case, institutions would distribute only returns in excess of inflation, placing preservation of investment assets above even a modicum of stability in supporting academic programs. At the other end of the spectrum, if… ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1108))

- Yale’s policies, as reflected in spending flows and endowment levels depicted in the bottom panel of the figures, track the stable spending policy much more closely than the stable endowment policy. Similar to other endowed institutions, in the 1970s Yale experienced an extraordinary decline in endowment purchasing power as the institution sought to supply flows of funds to support the university’s academic mission. By spending at unsustainably high rates, purchasing power of assets declined dramatically, dropping more than 40 percent during the 1970s. Yale’s actions belie Hansmann’s suggestion that endowment preservation dominates institutional thinking. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1145))

- The Role of Asset Allocation Many investors believe that a law of finance dictates that policy allocation decisions dominate portfolio returns, relegating market timing and security selection actions to secondary status. In a 2000 study, Roger Ibbotson and Paul Kaplan survey a number of articles on the contribution of asset allocation to investment returns. The authors note that “[o]n average, policy accounted for a little more than all of total return,” implying that security selection and market timing make no material contribution to returns.1 In another nod to the centrality of the asset-allocation decision, Ibbotson and Kaplan conclude that “. . . approximately 90 percent of the variability of a fund’s return across time is explained by the variability of policy returns.”2 Investors often treat asset allocation’s central role in determining portfolio returns as a truism. It is not. The Ibbotson and Kaplan study describes investor behavior, not finance theory. Imagine a buy-and-hold portfolio consisting of one (particularly idiosyncratic) stock—portfolio returns follow largely from security selection. Or, consider the strategy of aggressively day trading bond futures—market timing dominates returns. Obviously, institutional portfolio managers usually buy more than one stock and rarely pursue aggressive day trading strategies. Instead, investors hold broadly diversified portfolios and avoid market timing,… ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1203))

- returns. Recognizing that decisions regarding the relative importance of asset allocation, market timing, and security selection lie within an investor’s purview serves as an important starting point for policymakers. Instead of passively accepting the overwhelming importance of asset allocation, knowledgeable investors consider each source of return as a significant independent factor. Ultimately, in articulating a philosophy regarding the respective roles of asset allocation, market timing, and security selection, investors determine the fundamental character of the investment management process. By choosing to place asset allocation at the center of the investment process, investors ground the decision-making framework on the stable foundation of long-term policy actions. Focus on asset allocation relegates market timing and security selection decisions to the background, reducing the degree to which investment results depend on mercurial, unreliable factors. Selecting the asset classes for a portfolio constitutes a critically important set of decisions, contributing in large measure to a portfolio’s success or failure. Identifying appropriate asset classes requires focus on functional characteristics,… ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1217))

- Market timing, according to Charles Ellis, represents a losing strategy. “There is no evidence of any large institutions having anything like consistent ability to get in when the market is low and get out when the market is high. Attempts to switch between stocks and bonds, or between stocks and cash, in anticipation of market moves have been unsuccessful much more often than they have been successful.”3 Market timing causes portfolio characteristics to deviate from those embodied in the policy portfolio, producing inevitable differences in risk and return attributes. If market timers bet against the stock market by reducing equity holdings and increasing cash positions, long-run expected portfolio returns decline as the market timer’s position decreases risk levels. Because such activity lowers anticipated returns, market timers must succeed substantially more than 50 percent of the time to post a winning record. The wind in the speculator’s face, combined with transactions costs and market impact, provide a high hurdle for those who would beat the market by holding abnormally high cash positions. If market timers increase the risk profile of a portfolio by overweighting a risky asset at the expense of lower-risk positions, fiduciaries must consider the advisability of moving risk beyond policy portfolio… ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1233))

- The Role of Security Selection In efficient markets, active portfolio management, like market timing, tends to detract from aggregate investment performance. In the context of relative performance, security selection constitutes a zero-sum game. Since IBM (and every other tradeable stock) represents a finite, measurable proportion of the market value of the U.S. equity market, an investor can only hold an overweight position in IBM when other investors hold a corresponding underweight position in IBM. The active manager who overweights IBM creates market impact and incurs transaction costs in establishing the position; on the other side of the trade are other active managers who underweight IBM, incurring those same transactions costs and creating that same market impact. Only one of those positions can be right in light of IBM’s subsequent performance. Measured by the change in IBM’s price relative to the market, the amount by which the winners win equals the amount by which the losers lose. Since active managers pay a high price to play the game, in the aggregate active investors will lose by the amount of manager fees, transactions costs, and market impact. In less efficient markets, active management produces potentially sizable rewards. In fact, passive replication of benchmark returns proves impossible in private markets, such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, timber, and oil and gas. Even were the market return obtainable, investors would almost certainly prefer to pursue more selective approaches. When examined over reasonably long periods of time, in aggregate, illiquid asset classes generally produce mediocre returns relative to less risky marketable security alternatives. An inverse relationship exists between efficiency in asset pricing and appropriate degree of… ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1245))

- a significant edge in seeking high risk-adjusted returns. Because market players routinely overpay for liquidity, serious investors benefit by avoiding overpriced liquid securities and by embracing less liquid alternatives. Pursuit of value-oriented strategies enhances opportunities to achieve security selection success. Value can either be purchased, by identifying assets trading at below fair value, or created, by bringing unusual skills to improve corporate operations. Value investors operate with a margin of safety unavailable to less conservative investors. The degree of active management opportunity in various asset classes provides important input into the portfolio management process. Emphasizing inefficiently priced asset classes with interesting active management opportunities increases the odds of investment success. Intelligent acceptance of illiquidity and a value orientation constitute a sensible, conservative approach to portfolio management. In structuring portfolios, investors make choices, either explicitly or implicitly, regarding the respective roles of asset allocation, market timing, and security selection. A strong portfolio management framework rests on asset allocation decisions and incorporates a bias toward equity assets with an appropriate level of diversification. Since market timing actions generally prove unrewarding and always cause portfolios to deviate from desired characteristics, serious investors avoid market… ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1261))

- Ultimately, the argument for an equity bias in a long-term investment portfolio rests on more than historical experience. Finance theory sensibly teaches that acceptance of greater risk accompanies an expectation of greater return. While future stock market returns might not be as robust as they have been for U.S. equity investors, long-term investors will be well served with an equity bias. Diversification Even though market return studies indicate that high levels of equity market exposure benefit long-term investors, the associated risks come through less clearly. Significant concentration in a single asset class poses extraordinary risk to portfolio assets. Fortunately, diversification provides investors with a powerful risk management tool. By combining assets that vary in response to forces that drive markets, investors create more efficient portfolios. At a given risk level, properly diversified portfolios provide higher returns than less well diversified portfolios. Conversely, through appropriate diversification, a given level of returns can be achieved at lower risk. Harry Markowitz, pioneer of modern portfolio theory, maintains that portfolio diversification provides investors with a “free lunch,” since risk can be reduced without sacrificing expected return.

- Even when investors make good faith efforts to diversify, results sometimes disappoint. In the early 1970s, trustees of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation decided to reduce exposure to Avon Products, the company that provided the wherewithal to establish the institution. By selling shares of Avon to fund a diversified external equity manager, the trustees hoped to reduce heavy dependence on the fortunes of a single security. The timing of the decision made exquisite sense, as prices of Avon and other members of the “Nifty Fifty” had climbed to unprecedented heights in an extraordinary bull market for large-capitalization growth stocks.III The trustees chose J.P. Morgan to manage the portfolio, selecting the era’s dominant money management firm. Pursuing a strategy that had served the firm and its clients well, Morgan promptly diversified the foundation’s assets into other high quality growth stocks. By exchanging one member of the “Nifty Fifty” for others of the same cohort, the Clark Foundation’s portfolio received little protection from the subsequent dramatic collapse in quality growth stocks. Yale’s experience with a single security—shares of the Eagle Bank—and the Clark Foundation’s ill-fated investments in the Nifty Fifty provide cautionary tales regarding portfolio concentration. True diversification requires owning assets that respond differently to fundamental forces that drive markets.

- The sense of the skepticism with which investors viewed stocks in the 1930s runs through Robert Lovett’s “Gilt-Edged Insecurity,” which appeared in the April 3, 1937 edition of The Saturday Evening Post. Lovett begins his examination of historical market returns by suggesting that his readers “[c]onsider the absurdity of applying the word security to a bond or a stock.” Lovett’s analysis showed that an investor buying “100 shares of each of the more popular stocks” at the turn of the century would have turned nearly $295,000 into just $180,000 by the end of 1936. He concludes by warning his readers to remember: “(1) that corporations . . . die easily and frequently; (2) to be extra careful when everything begins to look good; (3) that you are buying risks and not securities; (4) that governments break promises just as businesses do; and (5) that no investments worth having are permanent.”6 Lovett’s commentary vividly illustrates why so few investors came up with the dime to invest in small stocks in June of 1932.

- The outsized exposure of more than 80 percent to securities of the U.S. market, with fully half of assets invested in domestic equities, violates sensible diversification principles. Committing more than fifty percent of a portfolio to a single asset type—domestic stocks—exposes investors to unnecessary asset-concentration risk. The significant correlation between domestic stocks and bonds further exacerbates the consequences of overreliance on domestic equities. Interest rates play an important role in markets. Increasing rates definitely cause bond prices to decline and may cause stock prices to decline, eliminating or reducing the hoped for diversification effects.

- applies. Under many circumstances, the average educational institution has more than four-fifths of the portfolio driven in the same direction by the same economic factor. By identifying high-return asset classes that show little correlation with domestic marketable securities, investors achieve diversification without the opportunity costs of investing in fixed income. The most common high-return diversifying strategy for a U.S. investor involves adding foreign equities to the portfolio. Other possibilities include venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, timber, oil and gas, and absolute return. If these asset classes provide high equity-like returns in a pattern that differs from the return pattern of the core asset (U.S. domestic equities), investors create portfolios that offer both high returns and diversification. Although on an asset-specific basis, higher expected returns apparently come with the price of higher expected volatility, the lack of correlation between individually risky asset classes actually reduces overall portfolio risk. Diversification represents “a free lunch” that allows investors to reduce risk without sacrificing expected returns.

- MARKET TIMING Explicit market timing lies on the opposite end of the spectrum from disciplined portfolio management. John Maynard Keynes, in a Kings College Investment Committee memo, wrote that “the idea of wholesale shifts is for various reasons impracticable and indeed undesirable. Most of those who attempt to, sell too late and buy too late, and do both too often, incurring heavy expenses and developing too unsettled and speculative a state of mind.”8 Deliberate short-term deviations from long-term policy targets introduce substantial risks to the investment process. On the surface, arguments used to attack market timing sound uncomfortably similar to those advanced when making asset allocation decisions. For example, investors might reject market timing because it requires making a few focused, undiversifiable bets. Or, investors might avoid market timing because of the insurmountable challenges in identifying and predicting the multitude of variables that influence asset prices. While similar factors influence both market timing and policy asset allocation, differences in time frame clearly separate one from the other. Market timing, defined as a short-term bet against long-term ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1454))

- term policy targets, requires being right in the short run about factors that are impossible to predict in the short run. Yet investors can reasonably deal with the important drivers of returns in the long run as short-term anomalies disappear into predictable long-term patterns. Sensible investors avoid concentrated bets against the institution’s adopted asset allocation, thereby eliminating the risk of inflicting serious damage by holding a portfolio inconsistent with long-term objectives.

- As a matter of course, at the beginning of every trading day Yale estimates the value of each of the components of the endowment. When marketable securities asset classes (domestic equity, foreign developed equity, emerging market equity, and fixed income) deviate from target allocation levels, the university’s investments office takes steps to restore allocations to target levels. In fiscal year 2003, Yale executed approximately $3.8 billion in domestic equity rebalancing trades, roughly evenly split between purchases and sales. Net profits from rebalancing amounted to approximately $26 million, representing a 1.6 percent incremental return on the $1.6 billion domestic equity portfolio. Even though rebalancing profits produce a nice bonus ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1575))

- for investors, the fundamental motivation for rebalancing concerns adherence to long-term policy targets. In the context of a carefully considered policy portfolio, rebalancing maintains the desired risk level. Generating profit while controlling risk represents an unbeatable combination. Few institutions and even fewer individuals possess the resources to conduct daily rebalancing of investment portfolios. Yet regardless of the frequency of rebalancing, fidelity to asset allocation targets proves important as a means of risk control and valuable as a tool for return enhancement. Thoughtful investors employ rebalancing strategies to maintain policy asset allocation targets. Investors hoping to profit in the short run from rebalancing trades face nearly certain long-run disappointment. Over long periods of time, portfolios allowed to drift with capital markets returns tend to contain ever increasing allocations to risky assets, as higher returns cause riskier positions to crowd out other holdings. The fundamental purpose of rebalancing lies in controlling risk, not enhancing return. Rebalancing trades keep portfolios at long-term policy targets by reversing deviations resulting from asset class performance differentials. Disciplined rebalancing activity requires a strong stomach and serious staying power. Conducted in a significant bear market, rebalancing appears to be a losing strategy as investors commit funds to assets showing continuing relative price weakness. Contrast the positive rebalancing experience of investors in 1987 or Yale’s rebalancing experience in 2003 with the fate suffered by investors in the bear market of 1973 ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1581))

- and 1974. Price declines required purchases of equities, followed by further declines that impaired asset values, which in turn led to further purchases. Losses incurred on rebalancing trades proved particularly painful as investors second-guessed the wisdom of buying into a bear market. For investors seeking to maintain long-term targets in the early 1970s, two years of nearly uninterrupted price deterioration produced seemingly relentless incremental losses. Rising equity prices provide a similar set of challenges. In a sustained bull market, rebalancing appears to be a losing strategy, as investors constantly sell assets showing relative price strength. Years go by without reward, other than the knowledge that the portfolio embodies the desired risk/reward characteristics. The alternative of not rebalancing to policy targets causes portfolio managers to engage in a peculiar trend-following market timing strategy.

- Although comparisons of active management returns to benchmark results already paint a bleak picture, managers hoping to beat the market face a challenge even greater than suggested by a first reading of the data. Survivorship bias causes active managers as a group to appear more successful than would be indicated by a true picture of reality, since current data on manager returns contain only the results of the strong (survivors), having purged the returns of the weak (failures). Errors of underinclusion and overinclusion bias manager performance data, limiting the usefulness of consultant reports in understanding active management results. Underinclusion occurs when managers disappear without a trace, while overinclusion occurs when new entrants contribute historical results to the database. Compilations of return data generally include only results of managers active at the time of the study. Discontinued products and discredited managers disappear, coloring the return data with an optimistic tint. Were the generally poor results of nonsurvivors included in the database, the challenge of beating the market would appear even more daunting. Even if the data gatherer undertakes to include results of failed managers, the figures provide reasonable guidance only when considering returns on a year-by-year basis. The shortest time frame produces the highest quality data, because the number of dropouts tends to be smaller for the shorter time periods. More serious problems arise when examining results spanning several years, since more ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1724))

- managers disappear during any given multiple-year period. Because managers tend to disappear after posting poor relative results, multiple-year comparisons suffer from return inflation driven by the superior results of survivors. Errors of overinclusion arise when data gatherers add new firms to the database and incorporate the new additions’ historical records. Since the new entrants necessarily produced superior results to attract the attention of the institutional investment community, the addition of the new entrants’ historical track record (a.k.a. backfill bias) provides an artificial boost to reported active management returns.

- Active portfolio managers face high hurdles, which require that investors approach purported market-beating strategies with great skepticism. Issues of survivorship bias cloud understanding of historical records, causing general problems in evaluating the efficacy of active management strategies and specific problems in assessing individual manager performance. After adjusting for fees and survivorship bias, investors face long odds on winning the domestic marketable securities active management game. In the world of marketable securities, passive management provides the obvious low-cost alternative to high-cost active management. If investors undertake active approaches, focusing on less efficient markets increases the chance of realizing substantial gains. In the least efficient private markets, no passive alternative exists. Even were a passive alternative available, market-like results would likely disappoint. In sum, sensible investors engage in active management with reasonable caution and realistic expectations. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1816))

- Serious managers who attempt to identify inefficiencies frequently gravitate toward relatively illiquid markets, since rewarding investments tend to reside in dark corners, not in the glare of floodlights. Such out-of-the-way, undiscovered opportunities receive little attention from Wall Street, which thrives on markets that generate large trading volumes. Market players seek liquid positions, allowing immediate disposition of yesterday’s loser and rapid acquisition of today’s hot prospect. Speculators and asset gatherers pay a premium price for liquid assets, expecting markets to accommodate reversal of a trade with immediacy and with little or no impact on price. Illiquidity induces appropriate, long-term behavior. Rather than relying on liquid markets to trade out of mistakes, investors in illiquid securities enter into long-term arrangements, purchasing part ownership in a business with which they have to live. As a consequence, increased care, thoroughness, and discipline represent hallmarks of successful investors in less liquid assets. By avoiding the highly liquid securities favored by market players, serious active investors focus on much more interesting investments. In embracing less liquid assets, investors often identify opportunities to establish positions at meaningful discounts to fair value.

- Investors prize liquidity because it allows trading in and out of securities. Unfortunately, liquidity tends to evaporate when most needed. The crash of October 1987, described in the Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, provides a case in point: “as the rate of decline accelerated on October 19, the efficiency with which the equity market functioned deteriorated markedly. By the late afternoon of October 19, market makers on the major stock exchanges appear to have largely abandoned serious attempts to stem the downward movement in prices. In the futures and options markets, market makers were not a significant factor during that time. . . . Price changes and trading activity were highly erratic from late Monday afternoon through most of the day on Tuesday, October 20, as market makers were overwhelmed by selling. . . . Realistically, in the face of October’s violent shifts in selling demand for equity-related securities, a rational downward transition in stock prices was not possible. Market makers possessed neither the resources nor the willingness to absorb the extraordinary volume of selling demand that materialized.”15 Just when investors most needed liquidity, it disappeared. John Maynard Keynes argues in The General Theory that “[o]f the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity, the doctrine that it is ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=1975))

- a positive virtue on the part of investment institutions to concentrate their resources upon the holding of “liquid” securities. It forgets that there is no such thing as liquidity of investment for the community as a whole.”16 Keynes toyed with the idea of reducing market liquidity to increase the prevalence of long-term investing. He writes “[t]he spectacle of modern investment markets has sometimes moved me towards the conclusion that to make the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble, like marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause, might be a useful remedy for our contemporary evils. For this would force the investor to direct his mind to the long-term prospects and to those only.”17 Success matters, not liquidity. If private, illiquid investments succeed, liquidity follows as investors clamor for shares of the hot initial public offering. In public markets, as once-illiquid stocks produce strong results, liquidity increases as Wall Street recognizes progress. In contrast, if public, liquid investments fail, illiquidity follows as investor interest wanes. Portfolio managers should fear failure, not illiquidity.

- Tobin’s “q” John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory articulated this concept of value: “. . . there is no sense in building up a new enterprise at a cost greater than that at which a similar existing enterprise can be purchased; whilst there is an inducement to spend on a new project what may seem an extravagant sum, if it can be floated off . . . at an immediate profit.”18 James Tobin and William Brainard formalized this concept as “q,” the ratio of market value to replacement cost. In equilibrium, under a reasonable set of conditions, Tobin-Brainard “q” equals one as the market value of assets equals replacement cost. If market value exceeds replacement cost, a “q” greater than one encourages entrepreneurs to create companies, offering them for sale at an immediate profit in the public markets. If replacement cost exceeds market value, a “q” of less than one leads entrepreneurs to acquire corporate assets in the public market instead of building enterprises from the ground up. Value investors thrive in environments where “q” measures less than one. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=2000))

- of the initial acquisition decision. Because of the difficulty of proving the efficacy of value-investing strategies, investors accept the approach almost as an article of faith. Perhaps the most compelling argument for value-based investment approaches rests on contrarian principles. Markets frequently move to extremes, with high valuations for the popular and low valuations for the out-of-favor. By looking for opportunity in neglected securities, contrarian investors increase the likelihood of identifying profitable investments. Yet mindless contrarian investing poses dangers to portfolios. Sometimes popular companies deserve premium valuations. Sometimes out-of-favor companies deserve discounted valuations. Identifying out-of-favor assets serves as a starting point for serious investors, leading to further analysis. Only if careful analysis confirms expectations of superior future performance should investors purchase securities. Purchasing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios represents a naïve strategy. Simply selecting the cheapest stocks, measured relative to current earnings or book value, neglects important factors such as the quality of a business’s management and future earnings prospects. Historically, naïve value strategies have delivered superior rates of return, while exposing investors to relatively high levels of fundamental risk.20 Jeremy Grantham of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo warns of the “sixty year flood” that may wipe out years of gains garnered by simply purchasing the cheapest stocks. True value can be acquired by purchasing assets at prices below fair value, a forward-looking concept that considers anticipated cash flows with adjustment for the level of risk.

- Far from exhibiting the courage required to take contrarian stands, most investors follow the crowd down the path to comfortable mediocrity. Investor cash flows into and out of actively managed funds provide a case in point. Ideally, serious investors would provide funds to managers after a period of understandable underperformance and before a period of expected outperformance. In fact, investors consistently do the opposite.

Adding the effects of persistently perverse cash flows to the costs of active management leaves little room for individual investor success.

GMO’s rational, valuation-oriented systematic style failed to keep pace with the late 1990s’ manic markets. Investors panicked. Between 1998 and 1999 GMO’s asset base declined from $30 billion to $20 billion even as stock markets raced ahead.23 Departing investors lost thrice: once, by selling GMO at a low point; once, by redeploying assets to momentum-driven managers destined to fail; and once, by failing to participate in GMO’s recovery. In a stunning indictment of active management, investors intelligent enough to choose GMO in the first place exhibited the stupidity to abandon the firm’s disciplined approach at the point of maximum opportunity. Consider the specific story of GMO’s quantitatively driven International Intrinsic Value Strategy. From inception in early 1987 to the end of 2006, the fund produced returns of 11.1 percent per annum, generating a significant excess return relative to the EAFE index result of 7.0 percent per annum. Long-term investors in International Intrinsic Value fared extremely well. Yet, in the aggregate, investor behavior managed to turn success into failure. Superb returns in the early 1990s attracted investor interest, as shown in Table 4.11. Average annual excess returns of 8.7 percent from 1990 to 1993 boosted assets in the strategy from $378 million to $2.6 billion! As long as trailing three-year performance showed market-beating returns, inflows continued, increasing assets under management to a peak of $2.8 billion at the end of 1996. Supposedly rational institutions chased GMO’s performance. In 1997, after the trailing three-year performance numbers turned negative, the exodus began. Client withdrawals took assets in International Intrinsic Value from the 1996 peak of $2.8 billion to the 2002 low point of $578 million. GMO’s poor relative returns from 1994 to 1999 caused fickle clients to abandon a sensible active strategy. Of course, exiting clients failed to benefit from GMO’s dramatic recovery. As rationality returned to markets after the early 2000 collapse of the Internet bubble, GMO posted average excess returns of 9.5 percent per annum in the ensuing five years. Buying high and selling low, as practiced by so many of GMO’s clients, produced permanent damage to portfolios.

Poorly considered commitments to and withdrawals from GMO’s International Intrinsic Value Strategy transformed a winning investment vehicle into a losing investment alternative. In the closed world of marketable security investing, simple logic dictates that a majority of assets fail to beat the market, as the impact of management fees and transaction costs guarantee poor results for most participants. Widespread active management failure makes the unusual success all the more valuable.

Committing more than 25 percent or 30 percent to an asset class poses the danger of overconcentration. Most portfolios work well with around a half a dozen asset classes. Functional attributes play the dominant role in defining asset classes, with structural and legal characteristics taking secondary positions. Asset class distinctions rest on broad sweeping differences in fundamental character: debt versus equity, domestic versus foreign, inflation sensitive versus deflation sensitive, private versus public, liquid versus illiquid. Ultimately investors attempt to group like with like, creating relatively homogeneous groups of investments that provide fundamental building blocks for the portfolio construction process.

- Traditional fixed income assets respond to unanticipated inflation by declining in price, as the future stream of fixed payments becomes worth less. In contrast, inflation-indexed bonds respond to unexpected price increases by providing a higher return. When two assets respond in opposite fashion to the same critically important variable, those assets belong in different asset classes.

- combining asset classes that respond differently to forces that drive returns. Correlation supplies a third means through which asset class characteristics influence portfolio construction, supplementing the return and risk factors. After specifying expected returns, risks, and correlations for the set of investable asset classes, the search for efficient portfolios begins. Starting with a given risk level, the model examines portfolio after portfolio, ultimately leading to identification of a combination of assets that produces the highest return. The superior portfolio takes a place on the efficient frontier. The process then continues by identifying the highest return portfolio for a range of risk levels, with the resulting combination of superior portfolios defining the efficient frontier.

- t]he unintuitive character of many ‘optimized’ portfolios can be traced to the fact that mean-variance optimizers are, in a fundamental sense, ‘estimation-error maximizers.’ . . . Mean-variance optimization significantly overweights (underweights) those securities that have large (small) estimated returns, negative (positive) correlations and small (large) variances. These securities are, of course, the ones most likely to have large estimation errors.”2 Although Michaud’s comments pertain to a portfolio of securities, his critique applies equally to a portfolio of asset classes. Several fundamental problems limit the usefulness of mean-variance analysis. Evidence suggests that security returns do not correspond to a normal distribution, with markets exhibiting more extreme events than would be consistent with a bell curve distribution. Richard Bookstaber, author of A Demon of Our Own Design, states that a “general rule of thumb is that every financial market experiences one or more daily price moves of four standard deviations or more each year. And in any year, there is usually at least one market that has a daily move that is greater than ten standard deviations.”3I If extreme price changes occur substantially more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution, then mean-variance analysis fails to consider some extremely important information. In fact, investors care more about extraordinary situations in the tails of the distribution, such as the 1987 stock market crash, than about ordinary outcomes represented by the heart of the distribution. The way in which asset classes relate to one another may not be stable. For example, market crises often cause otherwise distinct markets to behave in a similar fashion. In October 1987, equity markets all over the world collapsed, disappointing those portfolio managers who expected foreign diversification to cushion a drop in domestic equity prices. Although correlations among individual country stock markets before and after October 1987 measured substantially less than one, the highly correlated behavior of markets in the period immediately following the 1987 crash caused many investors to wonder what happened to the hoped-for diversification. Most investors rely heavily on historical experience in estimating quantitative inputs; yet continuous structural evolution reduces the predictive value of… ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=2347))

- Mean-reverting behavior in security prices implies that periods of abnormally high returns follow periods of abnormally low returns, and vice versa. Jeremy Grantham, a prominent money manager, believes reversion to the mean constitutes the most powerful force in financial markets.5 If prices tend to revert to the mean, then return expectations must be adjusted to dampen expectations for recent high fliers and boost forecasts for recent poor performers. Period-specific data frequently suggest counterintuitive conclusions. Relatively risky asset classes may show returns below those of obviously less risky investments. Assets that have little in common may move together for no apparent reason. Adjusting assumptions to reflect appropriate risk and return relationships proves critical to sensible quantitative analysis. Structural changes in markets force analysts to weight recent data more heavily, deemphasizing numbers posted in previous, sometimes dramatically different, environments. Introduction of new classes of securities, such as the U.S. Treasury issuance of thirty-year bonds beginning in February 1977, may alter asset class characteristics in so fundamental a manner as to render earlier data far less relevant in reaching conclusions regarding future asset class behavior.

- Discussion of the difference in expected returns for bonds and stocks, more succinctly described as the risk premium, fills many volumes of finance journals. Even while recognizing the complexities surrounding estimation of the risk premium, asset allocators must deal with the issue explicitly or implicitly. The historical risk premium of 8.1 percent appears to be excessive, resulting in large part from the extraordinary performance of U.S. equities over the past twenty-five years. Moreover, the time series of equity and bond returns suggests that the risk premium has declined through time. Combining the tendency of a high risk premium to mean revert with the observation that the equity risk premium seems to decline secularly, justifies an assumption for U.S. equity returns of 6 percent real with standard deviation of 20 percent.

Such diversification within real assets helps to produce steady returns through a variety of economic environments. Real estate constitutes the core of Yale’s real assets portfolio with a weight of 50 percent. Real estate markets provide dramatically cyclical returns. Looking in the rearview mirror in the late 1980s, investors rushed into real estate lured by returns that dominated those for traditional stocks and bonds. A few years later, after the market collapse, those same investors saw nothing other than dismal prospects for real estate. Poor returns nearly eliminated interest in real estate as an institutional investment asset. Reality lay somewhere between the extremes of wild enthusiasm and deep despair.

- Oil and gas reserves generate extraordinary cash flows as production depletes reservoirs, causing investors to receive a combination of return on capital and return of capital. The reserve cash flows exhibit extremely high correlation to published energy prices, although variations in geography and quality produce differentials. Timber investments round out the real assets trio. Although timber shares the characteristic of inflation sensitivity with real estate and oil and gas, because timber plays less of a role in the general economy, timber prices exhibit less correlation with general price levels. Financially astute timber owners manage holdings on a sustainable basis, cutting the amount of wood produced each year through biological growth. When managed on a sustainable basis, the productive capacity of the forest remains intact, preserving value across generations.

- Considering the relationship between bond and stock returns in various economic scenarios highlights the difficulties in specifying correlations. Under normal circumstances, bond returns exhibit high positive correlation to stock returns. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise as a result of the inverse relationship between prices and yields. When interest rates decline, stock prices tend to rise as investors subject future earnings streams to lower discount rates. Strong positive correlations between stocks and bonds in normal environments produce little diversifying power. In the case of unanticipated inflation, bonds suffer. Inflationary price increases erode purchasing power of fixed nominal bond payments, causing investors to push bond prices down. While inflation may have negative short-term consequences for stocks, in the long run stocks react positively to inflation.III With unexpected inflation, the long-term correlation between stocks and bonds proves to be low, providing substantial diversification to the portfolio.

- In a deflationary environment stocks perform poorly as economic woes cause earnings to suffer. In contrast, bonds generate handsome returns since fixed payments appear increasingly attractive as price levels decline. During periods of deflation, low or negative correlation between stocks and bonds provides strong diversification. The fundamentally different behavior of stock returns and bond returns in environments of met and unmet inflationary expectations poses a conundrum to the financial modeler. Should the expected nondiversifying correlation apply or should the unexpected diversifying correlation apply? The fact that investors care more about the diversifying role of bonds in unexpected (particularly deflationary) circumstances magnifies the dilemma.

- The fundamental objective of portfolio management is faithful implementation of long-term asset allocation targets.

- The Greek author Palladas may have had portfolio management in mind when he wrote that “there be many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.” Asset allocation drift and active management risk contain the potential to create outcomes measurably different from expectations based on the policy asset allocation portfolio. Moreover, exposure to implicit and explicit leverage moves portfolios to risk levels materially different from baseline expectations, dramatically altering expected investment outcomes. Disciplined implementation of asset allocation policies avoids altering the risk and return profile of an investment portfolio, allowing investors to accept only those active management risks expected to add value. Concern about risk represents an integral part of the portfolio management process, requiring careful monitoring at the overall portfolio, asset class, and manager levels. Understanding investment and implementation risks increases the chances that an investment program will achieve its goals.

- Contrarian behavior lies at the heart of many successful investment strategies. Unfortunately for investors, human nature craves the positive reinforcement that comes from running with the crowd. The conventional attitude comes through loud and clear in the words of Cabaret’s Sally Bowles: “Everybody loves a winner, so nobody loved me.” Contrarian investment behavior requires shunning the loved and embracing the unloved. Most people prefer the opposite. In fact, the world of commerce (as opposed to the world of investment) generally rewards following the trend. Feeding winners and killing losers leads to commercial successes. Executives who hyper-charge winners produce attractive results. Managers who starve losers conserve scarce resources. In the Darwinian world of business, success breeds success. In the world of investments, failure sows the seeds of future success. The attractively priced, out-of-favor strategy provides much better prospective returns than the highly valued, of-the-moment alternative. The discount applied to unloved assets enhances expected returns, even as the premium assigned to favored assets reduces anticipated results. Most investors find mainstream positions comfortable, in part because of the feeling of safety in numbers. The attitudes and activities of the majority create the consensus. By definition, only a minority of investors find themselves in the uncomfortable position of operating outside of the mainstream. Once a majority of players adopts a heretofore contrarian position, the minority view becomes the widely held perspective. Only an unusual few consistently take positions truly at odds with conventional wisdom. Initiating and maintaining out-of-the-mainstream positions requires great conviction and substantial fortitude. Friends and acquaintances describe fundamentally different investment programs. The media push a dramatically divergent world view. Brokers urge the sale of yesterday’s losers and the purchase of today’s hot prospects. Advertisements proclaim a new paradigm. In the face of a seemingly overwhelming consensus, successful contrarian investors turn a deaf ear to the blandishments of the multitudes. Establishing a contrarian position constitutes only half of the battle. Failure awaits the contrarian investor who loses nerve. Suppose an investor initially avoids the flavor of the month. Months become quarters and quarters become years. Ultimately, the weak-kneed contrarian capitulates, buying into the new-era reasoning.

- the realization of pain without the offset of gain. Taking a contrarian tack in the absence of the ability to persevere leads to poor results. Rebalancing represents supremely rational behavior. Maintaining portfolio targets in the face of market moves dictates sale of strong relative performers and purchase of poor relative performers. Stated differently, disciplined rebalancers sell what’s hot and buy what’s not. Under normal circumstances, rebalancing asks for modest degrees of fortitude. When markets make extreme moves, rebalancing requires substantial amounts of courage. Rebalancing Frequency Investors debate the frequency with which portfolios should be rebalanced. Some follow the calendar, transacting monthly, quarterly, or annually. Others attempt to control transactions costs, setting broad limits and trading only when allocations exceed specified ranges. A small number pursue continuous rebalancing, a strategy that provides greater risk control with potentially lower costs than either the calendar or trading range approaches. Continuous rebalancing requires daily valuation of portfolio assets. If asset class values deviate by as much as one or two tenths of a percent from target values, managers trade securities to achieve targeted levels. Trades tend to be small and accommodating to the market. Since rebalancing requires sale of assets experiencing relative price strength and purchase of assets experiencing relative price weakness, the immediacy of continuous rebalancing causes managers to sell what others are buying and buy what others are selling, thereby providing liquidity to the market. In contrast, rebalancing strategies not as responsive to the market require larger and less accommodating transactions, increasing market impact and transactions costs. To the extent that markets exhibit excess volatility, continuous rebalancing generates excess returns. Market activity on October 27 and 28, 1997 provides a dramatic example. On October 27, a 6.9 percent drop in stock prices accompanied a rally in the bond market. The following day’s reversal saw stocks rebound by 5.1 percent with bonds suffering from selling pressure. Rebalancing a 60 percent equity and a 40 percent bond portfolio on those two October days added ten basis points to returns, providing a bonus for an activity dedicated fundamentally to risk control. Even though rebalancing profits represent a nice bonus for investors, the fundamental motivation for rebalancing concerns adherence to long-term policy targets. In the context of a carefully considered policy portfolio, rebalancing maintains the desired risk level. Thoughtful investors employ rebalancing strategies to meet policy asset allocation targets.

- In the final analysis, private assets constitute separate asset classes because they behave in a fundamentally different fashion from marketable securities, making dependence on high short-run correlation between private and public markets an internally inconsistent, potentially dangerous strategy. When private allocations exceed target levels, as might be the case when marketable securities prices decline relative to private asset values, investors face a difficult problem. Reducing allocations to higher risk marketable securities and relying on correlations between marketable and private assets poses substantial risks. Yet, reducing allocations to lower risk assets to accommodate excessive levels of private equity further increases an already elevated portfolio risk level. Choosing the least bad alternative, investors should fund overallocations to private assets by reducing holdings of risky marketable assets, thereby controlling overall portfolio risk levels. Using short duration, lower risk assets to substitute for generally higher return private assets decreases expected portfolio return and risk levels, while the opposite result occurs when reducing marketable security positions to accommodate a private equity overweighting. Because differences may be substantial between characteristics of target and actual portfolios, investors must analyze thoroughly the investment and spending implications of both target asset allocations and actual portfolio allocations. The potential for material differences between actual and target asset allocation argues for gradualism in altering targets for illiquid asset classes. Keeping the reality close to the goal facilitates analysis of appropriate spending and asset management possibilities. Avoiding large differences between actual and target allocations reduces the size of the mismatch requiring temporary placement in an alternative investment vehicle, limiting the impact of a decision fraught with problems.

- In any event, deviations from benchmark returns represent an important source of portfolio risk. Investors embarking on active management strategies introduce portfolio biases, either purposeful or inadvertent. Among the powerful ways in which asset classes might differ from benchmarks are with respect to size, sector, and style. Size refers to market capitalization of securities holdings, sector concerns the nature of corporate business activities, and style relates to the general approach taken by an active manager (value vs. growth). Deliberate portfolio biases create potential for significant value added. For instance, an investor might believe that value strategies dominate growth strategies, consciously choosing only managers with a value orientation. Others believe that small-capitalization stocks provide superior stock picking opportunities, moving portfolios toward an explicit overweighting in securities of smaller companies. Purposeful, thoughtful strategic bets might generate risk-adjusted excess returns for the portfolio. ([Location 3043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=3043))

- Leverage appears in portfolios explicitly and implicitly. Explicit leverage involves the use of borrowed funds for pursuit of investment opportunities, magnifying portfolio results, good and bad.

- Implicit leverage stems from holding positions that embody greater risk than contemplated by the asset class within which they are categorized. Simply holding riskier-than-market equity securities leverages the portfolio. Unless risk levels of securities within an asset class match asset allocation risk assumptions, the portfolio either becomes leveraged from holding riskier assets or deleveraged from holding less risky assets. For example, the common practice of holding cash in portfolios of common stocks causes the equity portfolio to exhibit less risk than the market, effectively deleveraging returns. Derivatives provide a common source of implicit leverage. Suppose an S&P 500 futures contract requires a margin deposit of 10 percent of the value ([Location 3076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=3076))

- of the position. If an investor holds a futures position in the domestic equity portfolio, complementing every dollar of futures with nine dollars of cash creates a position equivalent to holding the underlying equity securities directly. If, however, the investor holds five dollars of futures and five dollars of cash, the resulting implicit leverage causes the position to be five times as sensitive to market fluctuations. Derivatives do not create risk per se, as they can be used to reduce risk, simply replicate cash positions, or increase risk. To continue with the S&P 500 futures example, selling futures against a portfolio of equity securities reduces risks associated with equity market exposure. Alternatively, using appropriate combinations of cash and futures creates a risk-neutral replication of the underlying securities. Finally, holding futures without risk-neutralizing cash positions increases market exposure. Responsible fiduciaries understand and control the use of derivatives in investment activity. Leverage magnifies portfolio outcomes, containing the potential to benefit or to harm portfolio assets. In extreme cases, inconsistency between the risk profile of asset class characteristics and investment activity leads to significant losses. In less extreme cases, differences in risk profile cause portfolio attributes to vary meaningfully from targeted levels, leading to deviations from policy goals. Sensible investors employ leverage with great care, guarding against introducing material excess risk into portfolio characteristics.

- LTCM produced a portfolio of generally sensible investment positions. The fatal flaw in the firm’s strategy came from a nearly unimaginable degree of leverage; massive leverage magnified the positive experience on the upside and similarly exaggerated the negative experience on the downside. In contrast to LTCM, sensible investors employ leverage with great care, guarding against a degree of risk that could threaten the viability of an investment program. Security Lending Some types of leverage, such as negative cash positions and explicit borrowing to increase positions, exhibit themselves openly. Investment staffs prepare papers that investment committees discuss, creating awareness of the general nature and magnitude of the borrowing. Other forms of leverage remain hidden until trouble arises, causing damage to the portfolio too late for corrective action. Most large institutional investors conduct security loan programs, which involve lending equity and debt securities to third parties, providing modest incremental income to the investor. Security borrowers, generally Wall Street financial concerns, require the loans to create short positions or cover failed trades. The security lender receives cash collateral to secure the asset on loan, making that aspect of the transaction quite safe. The lender pays a below market rate of interest on the cash collateral, expecting to reinvest the cash at a higher rate. The act of reinvestment places the entire amount of the security lending transaction at risk in an effort to generate the hoped-for spread between the below-market-rate borrowing and at-market-rate lending. Because the security lender retains ownership of securities on loan, along with the attendant economic consequences, security lending activity produces little disruption to the portfolio. Investors find it easy to forget about security lending, relegating it to back-office status. Security lending rarely appears on investment committee agendas, treated like other functions performed by custodian banks. If considered at all, committees likely view the process as a low risk method of offsetting a portion of the bank custody fee.

According to Ahrens, in early 1992 he lost $250,000 on an equity index “arbitrage” trade. Instead of closing out the position, he tried to offset the loss with speculative trading. After more than three years of deception and fraud, Ahrens’s cumulative losses reached a staggering level.

- Security lending activity at its best involves “make a little, make a little, make a little . . .” as investors earn small positive spreads on security loans. Unfortunately, to “make a little” an investor exposes a lot creating the possibility of “make a little, make a little, make a little, lose a lot.” This negatively skewed return pattern exhibits limited upside (make a little) with substantial downside (lose a lot), representing an unattractive distribution of outcomes for investors. Decades ago, security lending exhibited more favorable characteristics. In the 1970s, when security lenders paid no interest on cash collateral, extremely handsome returns resulted from the activity. Since cash collateral secured the value of the asset on loan and the collateral could be reinvested in U.S. Treasury bills, security lending participants faced essentially no risk. “Make something, make something, make something” described the activity, while “lose a lot” failed to register.

- Stock Prices and Inflation Stocks tend to offer long-term protection against generalized price inflation. A simple, yet elegant, means of understanding stock prices developed by Nobel laureate James Tobin compares the replacement cost of corporate assets to the market value of those assets. In equilibrium, Tobin argued that the ratio of replacement-cost-to-market value, which he named “q,” should equal one. If replacement cost exceeds market value, economic actors find it cheaper to buy assets on the stock exchange than in the real economy. Conversely, if market value exceeds replacement cost, economic actors generate profits by building companies and floating shares on the stock exchange. Clearly, in rational markets, the value of corporate assets on a stock exchange should equal the real world replacement cost of those selfsame assets.

- Jeremy Siegel observes that stock prices “provide excellent long-run hedges against inflation” and weak short-term protection against rising prices.6 Presumably, the positive long-term relationship between inflation and stock prices stems from rational behavior, as market participants weigh the costs of acquiring assets in the real economy against the costs of acquiring similar assets on the financial exchanges. Possibly, the negative short-term relationship between inflation and stock prices results from irrational behavior, as investors respond to unanticipated inflation by increasing the discount rate applied to future cash flows without adjusting those future flows for the increases in inflation. While capital markets history supports Siegel’s observation, the difference in short-run and long-run responses by equity prices to inflation creates a paradox. Because the long run consists of a series of short runs, no theory explains both the poor short-term record and the strong long-term record of stock price protection against price increases. In any event, investors seeking short-term shelter from inflation need to look beyond holdings of marketable equities.

- Stock Options The use of stock options to reward corporate management produces a subtle disconnect between the interests of management and shareholders. Options-based compensation schemes work effectively when company share prices increase, as both management and shareholders gain. The alignment of interests breaks down when share prices decrease, as management loses only the opportunity to benefit from stock price increases. In fact, management fails to suffer at all when corporate boards reset option prices to reflect the newly diminished stock price. In sharp contrast to management’s loss of a mere opportunity, when share prices decrease shareholders lose cold, hard cash. Options-based compensation schemes represent a no-lose game for management of publicly traded companies. Microsoft provides a textbook example of using option grants to insulate employees from share price declines. In April 2000, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer faced a problem of low morale among employees concerned about the consequences of the Justice Department’s antitrust activity and a four-month, 44 percent stock price decline. To boost spirits, Ballmer awarded more than 34,000 Microsoft employees stock options priced at the then current stock price. The chief executive wrote in an email to employees that “we know stock options are an important part of our compensation.” Even while asserting that preexisting options “will have value long run,” Ballmer expressed his hope that “these new grants will let people see returns much sooner.”10 By setting the option strike price near the stock’s fifty-two week low, the company effectively ([Location 3435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=3435))

- insulated employees from the dramatic decline in Microsoft’s shares. The company provided no such succor to shareholders. In response to the all-too-numerous abuses of trust in the late 1990s, many corporations began to review options-based compensation. In a particularly notable move, in July 2003, Microsoft announced plans to eliminate its options program and substitute a program of restricted stock awards. Unlike the asymmetric option payoff, restricted stock produces a congruence of outcomes in which management and shareholders profit and suffer together. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer remarked, “whether it’s dividend policy or how much risk to take, it’s always good to have the employees thinking as much like the shareholders as possible.”11 If substantial numbers of corporations follow Microsoft’s lead, corporate management will likely better serve shareholder interests in the future.

By increasing a portfolio’s duration, investors gain greater exposure to interest rate moves, creating a roughly equivalent choice between more assets with lower duration and fewer assets with higher duration. Portfolio managers wishing to reduce the opportunity costs of holding fixed income assets might rely on a small allocation to a long duration portfolio, in essence buying the diversifying power of bonds on the cheap.

- Management of the short side of the portfolio poses several challenges peculiar to selling securities short. First, investors frequently underestimate the resilience of corporate management. Even when the facts and figures indicate that a company deserves classification as one of the “living dead,” managers frequently find a way to escape the seemingly inevitable consequences of their circumstances. Second, the portfolio management implications of adverse price movements require greater diversification of short positions. If a stock moves against a short seller by increasing in price, the position increases in size. To take advantage of the now more attractively priced short opportunity the investor faces the uncomfortable prospect of further increasing the position. Starting with a modest allocation to a particular short idea allows an increase in position size without creating an uncomfortable concentration in a single stock. Contrast the dynamics of a losing short position with the behavior of a losing long position. As the long’s price declines it becomes a smaller portion of the portfolio, reducing its impact on returns and facilitating new purchases at the newly discounted, relatively more attractive price. The simple math of price behavior argues for running reasonably diversified portfolios of short positions. Short sellers face challenges from success, as well as from failure. When the stock price of a fundamentally troubled company crashes, the short seller benefits, but the size of the short position declines dramatically, ([Location 3951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=3951))

- requiring identification of attractive replacement candidates. While long managers often run with successful investments for years, short managers hope to operate on a treadmill, with frequent turnover of holdings caused by the exit of winning positions from the portfolio. The price dynamics of short selling cause successful short managers to follow and hold a large number of securities. Aside from a peculiar set of investment challenges, short sellers face some unusual technical problems in managing portfolio positions. To execute trades, short sellers borrow securities to deliver to the buyer on the other side of the transaction. (Buyers purchasing shares, whether from a short seller or a natural seller, expect to receive securities on the trade’s settlement date.) As long as short sellers maintain the borrow, the position remains intact. If the short seller loses the borrow because the security lender recalls the security, the short seller must replace the borrow or lose the position. When the market for borrowing a particular security becomes tight, short sellers face a short squeeze. Security borrowers tend to have most trouble with small, less liquid companies, exactly the type of security likely to present interesting short opportunities.

- Consider the record of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the infamous hedge fund that nearly brought down the world’s financial system. According to the New York Times, the database of Tremont Capital Management, a leading purveyor of hedge fund data, contains LTCM’s performance only through October 1997, nearly a year prior to the firm’s collapse. Inception-to-date-of-reporting-cessation performance (March 1994 through October 1997) for LTCM stood at 32.4 percent per year net to investors, representing an impressive return on a large amount of capital. Obviously, Long-Term Capital’s early record inflated the hedge fund industry’s aggregate results. From the point in October 1997 when Long-Term Capital stopped reporting results to the point of the firm’s October 1998 demise, returns (if they can be called returns) amounted to -91.8 percent. The staggering loss appears nowhere in Tremont’s treasure trove of data. The yawning chasm between Tremont’s reported 32.4 percent per annum and LTCM’s actual -27.0 percent per annum produces a staggering gap between perception and reality. The statistical omission of the implosion of LTCM inflates history in a manner that fundamentally misleads investors regarding the true character of hedge fund investing. Statistical descriptions of hedge fund returns frequently suffer not only from survivorship bias, but also from backfill bias. As hedge funds became popular in the 1990s, only those funds with successful track records rose above the fray, attracting attention from market observers and money from investors. Funds with mediocre records languished in obscurity. Funds with strong returns garnered assets and acclaim, entering the consultants’ manager universes and generating a substantial positive spin on the reported returns. In many instances, the keepers of the numbers added the past results of newly found strong performers to the ranks of the reporting managers, providing an unrepresentative boost to past performance data. Backfill bias causes data on hedge fund performance to overstate the realities of the hedge fund marketplace.

- Academic studies that analyze the impact of survivorship bias and backfill bias come to some stunning conclusions. In a study of 3,500 hedge funds over more than ten years, Roger Ibbotson of the Yale School of Management concluded that survivorship bias added 2.9 percent annually to returns and backfill bias added an additional 4.6 percent annually to returns.2 In aggregate, data-gathering errors inflated reported returns by fully 7.5 percent per annum, an enormous increment in a world where the difference between success and failure often depends on a few tenths of a percentage point. Burton Malkiel of Princeton University, in examining a well-known database, observed that of 331 hedge funds that reported results in 1996, more than 75 percent disappeared by 2004.3 As expected, the returns of the live funds exceeded the returns of the dead funds. Perhaps not so expected was the 7.4 percent annual return differential between the two groups of funds. For the eight-year period, Malkiel estimates survivorship bias inflated returns by an average of 4.4 percent per annum and backfill bias boosted results by an average of 7.3 percent per annum. Ibbotson and Malkiel’s studies call into question the usefulness of hedge fund databases. Survivorship bias and backfill bias matter.

- A comparison of a traditional U.S. Treasury note and a TIPS security illustrates critical differences in the two instruments. Consider the U.S. Treasury 4.25 percent Note due January 15, 2011 and the U.S. Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security 3.5 percent Note due January 15, 2011. At year-end 2006, the straight bond and the inflation-protected bond boasted yields to maturity of 4.7 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. Because the bonds share identical credit characteristics and identical maturity dates, the difference in yields stems solely from inflation expectations. The 2.3 percent difference between the straight bond yield and the inflation-protected bond yield represents the market’s best estimate of inflation over the bonds’ term. If inflation exceeds 2.3 percent, the TIPS holder wins. If inflation falls short of 2.3 percent, the straight bond owner wins. At maturity, TIPS investors receive a possible bonus, as the bonds pay the greater of the inflation-adjusted principal or the original face value.

- In fact, the real estate market provides a powerful example of the efficacy of Tobin’s “q,” the ratio between market value and replacement cost of an asset. If the market value of a particular real estate asset exceeds replacement cost, nearby real estate development of a similar product type makes economic sense. Clearly, under such circumstances, the income yield expressed as a percentage of cost of a newly constructed building would exceed the income yield on the more highly valued existing asset, creating incentives to build new, high-yielding buildings. Conversely, if replacement cost exceeds market value, real estate development makes no economic sense. In such a situation, the income yield on cost falls short of the income yield on less highly valued existing assets. Instead of building new buildings, rational market participants buy existing properties, thereby driving market values toward replacement cost. Tobin’s “q” proves particularly useful in the real estate market, because replacement cost constitutes a readily determinable, easily observable variable. While in the stock market Tobin’s “q” produces insight into valuation of individual companies, broad market sectors, and even the entire equity market, the challenges of determining replacement cost of today’s complex, far-flung corporate entities proves daunting. In contrast, assessing the cost of constructing a suburban retail mall or a downtown office building proves far more manageable.

- The strong relationship between replacement cost and market value leads to one of real estate’s most attractive investment attributes, a high correlation with inflation.

- of changes in market value to inflationary pressures. For example, a property subject to long-term, fixed-rate leases shows little near-term correlation to inflation. Only as lease expiration nears will inflation influence asset valuation. Alternatively, properties with shorter-term leases exhibit much greater inflation sensitivity. Moreover, some leases explicitly allow landlords to pass through inflationary increases in expenses or, in the case of retail properties, contractually entitle landlords to receive a percentage of sales. Such inflation-responsive lease structures cause asset values to reflect inflationary moves. The importance of replacement cost both in valuation analysis and in inflation sensitivity relies on markets reflecting reasonable equilibrium between supply and demand. In cases where supply of real estate space fails to match demand, prices respond to the disequilibrium, not to the expected relationship with replacement cost or with inflation.

Investment returns stem from several sources, the most important being the value of timber harvested and changes in the value of residual timber and land. Timber values, which relate to the biological growth of trees and changes in timber prices, can be influenced by sound silvicultural practices. The sale of conservation easements and land parcels for “higher and better use” (HBU) provide the potential to boost returns. Finally, incremental revenue can be generated through other activities, including leasing of land for the exploitation of mineral deposits, recreational pastimes, and alternative energy uses.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In recent years, ownership of timberland in the United States shifted from forest products companies to institutional investors. At one time, companies viewed timberland ownership as essential, providing mills with a captive, dependable source of raw materials. Over time, the inefficiencies in ownership and management of forestry assets became apparent as trees were cut without regard to economic value to keep a steady supply of wood arriving at the mill. Several large companies that separated the mill operations and timber operations into independent entities saw dramatic bottom-line improvements in both segments. Once companies viewed timberland assets as distinct from the core wood processing business, companies became less attached to holding massive wood inventories and more focused on the benefits of selling timberlands. First, timberland sales offered a means of raising capital to modernize mills, streamline operations, or pay down debt. Second, timberland sales offered the opportunity to boost stock prices through the realization of hidden value and by raising returns on capital. Finally, some companies divested U.S. holdings to move into lower cost, higher productivity timberlands in other regions of the world. Over the past decade, approximately 33 million acres of timber-land traded in the United States with annual sales averaging 2.6 percent of the investable timberland universe. Most timberland on the selling block ended up in the hands of newly created timberland REITs or newly interested institutional investors. The new owners often did not own mill assets, allowing them to focus exclusively on maximizing the value of the timberlands. As a result, the new owners adopted more sophisticated financially driven silvicultural techniques, more extensive merchandising operations, and more aggressive monetization strategies for nontimber values.

- When an independent investment management firm files to go public, the offering documents contain clues regarding the consequences for owners of the firm, their clients, and the public shareholders-to-be. But, offering documents frequently fail to address head-on the fundamental conflict that arises from introducing public shareholders into the mix. In the context of a private firm, the investment manager accepts the responsibility to provide superior investment results to clients that entrust assets to the investment manager’s care. In the context of a public firm, the investment manager retains the responsibility to serve the clients’ interests and adds a responsibility to public shareholders. The interests of the clients and the public shareholders often conflict.

- Fortress Investment Group, a $26 billion manager of private equity partnerships, hedge funds, and publicly traded alternative investment vehicles, highlights the issues confronting a publicly traded firm’s clients. Take the case of dividends. The November 2006 registration statement proudly notes that “unlike many publicly traded asset managers, we intend to pay out a significant portion . . . of our annual distributable earnings in the form of quarterly dividends.”18 Substantial dividends clearly benefit shareholders. In contrast, investors in Fortress’s asset management products suffer from the firm’s dividend policy. Consider the source of funds for dividend payments. The most reliable income stream comes from the management fees that Fortress charges for asset management services. Higher fees and increased assets under management benefit the public shareholder. Neither higher fees nor increased assets benefit the clients of the Fortress funds. In fact, both factors produce lower investment returns. To add insult to injury, some portion of the fees paid by Fortress’s clients go not to the principals making the investment decisions, but to faceless public shareholders. The issue of dividend payments highlights… ([Location 5307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5307))

- shares would “increase our ability to provide financial incentives to our existing and future employees.”19 The Fortress statement ignores the obvious fact that public shareholders claim a portion of the funds that otherwise would have been available for distribution to the firm’s investment professionals. A public offering diminishes the size of the compensation pool, making Fortress’s claim disingenuous at best. Regarding “Permanence,” Fortress expects to benefit from an increase in the proportion of capital that institutions and individuals allocate to the firm. No evidence exists that capital providers prefer publicly traded firms to privately held firms. In fact, if capital providers seek high risk-adjusted returns, the fundamentals support the opposite conclusion. As to “Capital” and “Currency”, Fortress suggests that publicly traded shares facilitate the firm’s ability to grow, create new investment products, and finance future strategic acquisitions. Increases in assets and numbers of products may well benefit Fortress principals and public shareholders, but do nothing to serve the interests of the clients of Fortress funds. Strangely absent from the list of reasons to… ([Location 5318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5318))

- the consummation of the IPO, the Fortress S-1 registration statement noted that “we distributed $528.5 million to our principals.”21 In addition, careful readers who make it to page 80 of the offering circular note that shortly prior to the initial public offering, the principals of Fortress entered into a $750 million credit agreement, which provided funds for refinancing a prior $175 million credit facility and for “investment in various existing and new Fortress Funds, and to make a one-time $250 million distribution of capital to our principals.”22 Finally, in a tangle of complexity that only a lawyer could love, the registration statement describes a “tax receivable agreement,” which might produce payments to the principals that “could be material in amount.”23 Between the $888 million Nomura windfall, the $528.5 million of pre-IPO distributions, and the $250 million loan distribution, the five principals of Fortress cashed in to the tune of $1,666.5 million. Finding the three elements of the Fortress principals’ paydays required careful reading of pages and pages of legalistic prose in the company’s disclosure documents. In a straightforward world, the section entitled “Why We Are Going Public”… ([Location 5330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5330))

- Pursuit of investment excellence in the context of a conglomerate of investment managers proves futile, as the goals of external owners fail to coincide with the aspirations of investors.

- profit participations focus manager attention on the investor goal of generating handsome investment returns, a profit sharing arrangement in which managers share only in gains creates an option that encourages risk-seeking behavior. By making a substantial co-investment, managers participate directly in gains and losses, leading to more balanced assessment of investment opportunities. To realize the hoped-for behavioral outcome, the co-investment commitment must be large relative to the manager’s net worth, even though the amount might be modest in absolute terms. When writing a check representing a material portion of personal assets, the investment manager steps into the role of a principal. While co-investment generally improves the investor’s position by aligning investment interests, differences in goals bear careful scrutiny. Taxpaying fund managers in partnership with tax-exempt institutional investors face different after-tax return scenarios. Mortal decision makers operate with shorter time horizons than appropriate for an enduring organization’s permanent funds. Individuals with large fund investments frequently desire greater diversification than required by most institutions, which hold an already well-diversified collection of assets. Even though differences in tax status, time horizon, and risk tolerance drive wedges between the interests of individual fund managers and the goals of institutional investors, the benefits of substantial co-investment far outweigh the likely ([Location 5511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5511))

- Passive asset management differs fundamentally from active asset management. Size, the enemy of active investors, works in favor of index fund managers. For example, passive funds with large numbers of investors and sizable pools of assets frequently offer crossing opportunities, in which some portion of exiting investor demand for funds matches entering investor supply of funds, allowing nearly costless exit from and entrance to the investment pool.II Scale improves tracking of ([Location 5529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5529))

- While strong arguments support passive management for all marketable securities, two factors argue strongly for passive management of bond portfolios in particular. First, to satisfy the deflation hedging role of fixed income, investors must hold long-term, high quality, non-callable bonds, suggesting the creation of stable duration government bond portfolios. Second, the extraordinary efficiency in the pricing of government bonds makes active security selection decisions a costly exercise in futility. The need for a stable maturity structure and the futility of individual security bets require that investors manage bond portfolios passively. While domestic equity investors enjoy more flexibility in structuring portfolios than bond investors, the difficulty of identifying material mispricings in the stock market, particularly among large-capitalization securities, leads many investors to index common stocks. By avoiding high fees and substantial transactions costs, index funds provide long-term results that represent a formidable hurdle for investors hoping to outperform. Yet, in spite of the clear difficulties in producing risk-adjusted excess returns, most investors pursue active management strategies.

- Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of marketable security managers employ asset-based fee schemes, causing market gains or losses and portfolio inflows or outflows to overwhelm the impact of manager skill. Even though a number of managers offer superficially attractive incentive compensation arrangements, three factors diminish the appeal of most schemes. First, the vast bulk of marketable security funds generate profits primarily from asset-based fees, encouraging managers to emphasize increasing asset totals. In other words, even when firms offer incentive arrangements, those incentive arrangements fail to influence fund manager behavior because investment firms continue to rely on fee income expressed as a percentage of assets under management. Second, investment managers tend to offer terms on incentive schemes that involve modest levels of risk to the firm’s existing income flows. Instead of taking a “blank slate” approach that sets baseline fees at ([Location 5568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000WJSB50&location=5568))

- a level that covers reasonable overhead, money managers try to structure incentive arrangements that ensure continued income flows even with mediocre performance, protecting the profit margins implicit in existing fee structures. Finally, investors choosing between a traditional asset-based fee and an alternative incentive-oriented structure encounter cognitive dissonance, as the performance expectations implicit in hiring an active manager cause expected costs of incentive compensation to exceed anticipated payments from a traditional asset-based fee arrangement. While the concept of incentive compensation structures for active managers of marketable securities carries a great deal of theoretical appeal, the limitations of real-world arrangements reduce the effectiveness of incentive schemes in causing fund managers to behave as principals. Investment management fees, whether asset-based or incentive-oriented, represent a heavily scrutinized term in most contract negotiations, with investors seeking the lowest possible fee burden along with a “most-favored-client” clause ensuring advantageous treatment in the future. Beneath the open, honest discussion concerning marketable equity fee arrangements lie hidden soft dollar payments, representing old-fashioned kickbacks designed to increase investment advisor cash flow at the direct expense of investor clients.

- Structuring a portfolio consistent with fundamental investment tenets requires a governance process that produces an appropriate policy portfolio, avoids counterproductive market timing, and identifies effective investment management relationships. One of the most critical portfolio management decisions concerns the choice between (a) developing an organization with the capability of selecting high quality active managers, and (b) deploying a strategy with an emphasis on bare bones passive vehicles. While choosing an active approach broadens the asset class opportunity set and holds the promise of market-beating returns, active strategies demand a significant commitment of resources. Those institutions that engage in active management without proper support face the unpalatable prospect of generating disappointing results for themselves and creating opportunities for better prepared investors. Two important tenets of investment management—contrarian thinking and long-term orientation—pose challenges for governance of endowment funds. Because large bureaucratic organizations invariably use groups of people (investment committees) to oversee other groups of people (investment staff), consensus-building behavior permeates the investment process. Unless carefully managed, group dynamics frequently thwart contrarian activities and impose shorter than optimal time horizons. Creating a governance process that encourages long-term, independent, contrarian thinking represents a critical undertaking for endowed institutions. John Maynard Keynes, in The General Theory, describes the difficulties inherent in group investment decision making: “Finally it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is the essence of his behavior that he should be eccentric, unconventional, and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”1 The challenges facing an institution attempting to structure effective governance processes center on exercising appropriate fiduciary oversight, while encouraging “eccentric, unconventional, and rash” behavior.
