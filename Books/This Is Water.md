## Metadata

- Full Title: This Is Water
- Category: #books

## Highlights
- There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” ([Location 26](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=26))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?” ([Location 28](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=28))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The immediate point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=38))

- Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude — but the fact is that, in the day-to-day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life-or-death importance. ([Location 40](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=40))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If your complete freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time talking about, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket, for just a few minutes, your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to food-shop, because my natural default setting is that situations like this are really all about me, about my hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, and it’s going to seem, for all the world, like everybody else is just in my way, and who the fuck are all these people in my way? ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=222))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And look at how repulsive most of them are and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem here in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line, and look at how deeply unfair this is: I’ve worked really hard all day and I’m starved and tired and I can’t even get home to eat and unwind because of all these stupid goddamn people.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Look, if I choose to think this way, fine, lots of us do — except that thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic it doesn’t have to be a choice. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=239))
    - Tags: [[pink]]

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It’s the automatic, unconscious way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I’m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The thing is that there are obviously different ways to think about these kinds of situations. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=247))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Again, please don’t think that I’m giving you moral advice, or that I’m saying you are “supposed to” think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it, because it’s hard, it takes will and mental effort, and if you’re like me, some days you won’t be able to do it, or else you just flat-out won’t want to. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0023SDQZS&location=259))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But most days, if you’re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line — maybe she’s not usually like this; maybe she’s been up three straight nights holding the hand of her husband, who’s dying of bone cancer, or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicles department who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a nightmarish red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness.
