## Highlights
- As you are undoubtedly aware, a sacred cow (lowercase) is an idea that society does not allow to be questioned or criticized. The sacred cow is considered to be important for social stability, and challenges to the sacred cow threaten society’s sense of security and cohesion. Often the sacred cow is so well established in people’s minds that nobody even thinks to question its validity. For example, the “fact” that the sun went around the earth (instead of the other way around) was a sacred cow for a long, long time despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. Most people didn’t question this particular sacred cow any more than you would question the structure of the solar system you learned about in school. Anyone impertinent enough to raise doubt was discouraged with ridicule, ostracism, or threats of torture and imprisonment. Now really, if an idea is a good one, it should be able to stand up for itself, right? If you tell me that your idea is true, but I’m not allowed to question it, I wonder how much confidence you have in the truth of your idea.

- The Sacred Cows we address in this book are false cultural assumptions that raise the emotional cost of divorce or cause unnecessary fear and shame about the consequences of divorce. These Sacred Cows have infiltrated our societal subconscious, and many of us are unaware of the influence these assumptions have over our thoughts and words. If you have ever counseled an unhappy friend to stay married, however, you have probably trotted out a few of these Cows yourself. Here is a list of the Cows and the beliefs they represent: The Holy Cow: Marriage is always good and divorce is always bad (absent faith-based arguments).

- The Expert Cow: All marital problems can be fixed with the right self-help book or marriage counselor. The Selfish Cow: Everyone who gets divorced is selfish, and everyone who stays married is selfless. The Defective Cow: If you cannot make your marriage happy, or if you choose to divorce, you must be defective in some way. The Innocent Victim Cow: Children’s lives are ruined by divorce. The One True Cow: Finding true love should be your highest goal in life unless you are married, in which case you should stop believing in true love. The Other Cow: Nobody should be allowed to leave a marriage in order to be with a new partner. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=191))

- When asked why all of her marriages had failed, anthropologist Margaret Mead is said to have replied, “I beg your pardon; I have had three marriages and none of them was a failure.” This statement (apocryphal or not) highlights our social tendency to equate divorce with failure.

- we believe that divorce reflects weakness and selfishness, and the “failure” label applies not only to marriages, but also to the people who divorce. Our society does not like quitters, and divorce is seen as a form of quitting. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=324))

- Laurie Essig, a professor of sociology at Middlebury College, says that among the relatively affluent, “divorce has become a source of shame, a mark of failure, a sign that you just aren’t working hard enough.” ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=327))

- Doubtless there are couples who stay in love for a lifetime, and there are also couples for whom loyalty and security are enough to sustain happiness, even if love doesn’t last. Some couples grow apart, however, and become unhappy. Individuals in this circumstance are told by the Holy Cow that they should stay married, because this Cow believes that commitment trumps happiness. The Holy Cow has only one definition of a successful marriage, which is that one spouse gets to bury the other. She doesn’t really care what happens along the way (though she would probably object that murder would be cheating) as long as the couple gets to the ultimate finish line, death.

- The Bible condemns divorce, but as the United States remains primarily a Christian nation, it is worth pointing out that Jesus was not much of a family man himself. He pushed his mother away, and he never married. He asked his followers to abandon their families to be with him. In fact, Jesus said, “Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.” Jesus had his reasons, probably, and we do not presume to question them. In fact, we will leave you with these words from Jesus himself to end our Holy Cow discussion: “Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.” ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=617))

- The Selfish Cow is the most straightforward and the boldest of all of the Cows. She wants to tell you that staying married is unselfish and getting divorced is selfish. She shows up everywhere, sometimes hiding in plain sight (a neat trick for a gal who weighs 1000 pounds!). You will find her skulking behind comments your family and friends make, in popular media, even grazing in the back of your mind. You may not yet recognize her, but after you read this chapter you won’t be able to stop noticing her all around you. Caveat: Tipping over this Cow is not a defense of selfishness. It only involves recognizing that divorcing is not inherently a more selfish choice than staying married. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=1033))

- Before leaving the tarmac, passengers are instructed by the airplane crew to “put on your oxygen mask before assisting anyone else.” We have to listen to this every single time we get on a plane because most people will put the safety of their loved ones ahead of their own safety. Humans are wired to sacrifice themselves for their families. The Federal Aviation Administration understands the danger of this instinct, because in the case of a depressurized cabin, nobody ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=1138))

- can be of use to his or her loved ones after losing consciousness. Many marriage self-help books acknowledge that this danger occurs in marriage as well, in the sense that people who allow themselves to drown in unhappiness will drag their spouses and children into misery with them. The self-help mantra is that you must take responsibility for your own happiness and let your spouse do the same for him or herself. Strangely, the notion that “taking care of your own happiness” while leaving others to fend for themselves bears more than a passing resemblance to “selfishness” doesn’t come up. Maybe that’s because these books only suggest that you take responsibility for your happiness within your marriage, but they don’t consider that you might follow your happiness all the way out of your marriage. It seems that if you stand up for yourself and can get your spouse to give you what you think you need, then you are being brave. But if your spouse can’t give you what you need, and you decide to leave your marriage, then you are being selfish. Moooo.

- Before we move on to the question about children’s lives being ruined by divorce, let’s first address the issue of happiness. Are children made unhappy by their parents’ divorcing? We don’t think that any of us need scientific studies to answer that question. The answer is yes, usually, at least for the short term. Most children are made unhappy to some degree and for some length of time when their parents divorce. Divorce is a difficult life change. If two people are unhappily married but want to prevent their children from feeling at least temporarily sad about the breakup of their marriage, they shouldn’t get divorced. Of course they may be bringing other future unhappiness to their children by remaining married, and they may also be depriving their children of opportunities that could have come to them through a different family structure. Life is full of joys and sadness, and each couple has to decide for themselves whether staying married would on balance bring their children the most long-term happiness. Short-term happiness can be easily predicted (If I kick you hard in the shins, you will be unhappy), but long-term happiness is sufficiently difficult to measure and predict that even the boldest social scientists rarely offer formulae for ensuring lifelong happiness for children. We would venture that nobody knows with certainty whether their children’s long-term happiness will be greater if their parents stay married or divorce.

- While the Innocent Victim Cow deserves to be tipped, the idea that divorce causes pain cannot be entirely disregarded. Divorce is upsetting to children, and some children grow up to feel that they are emotionally crippled because of their parents’ divorce. (Of course, some children also grow up to feel that they are emotionally crippled because their parents stayed married too long.) Even children who view the changes resulting from divorce as positive still have to suffer through the upheaval of changing family structure. The effects of divorce on children should be taken seriously, and parents should make every effort to mitigate the pain for their children. That said, parents should not be told that their children’s long-term happiness and success will be jeopardized if they divorce. There is no respectable evidence that (all other things being equal) divorce meaningfully impacts the ([Location 1879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NF49498&location=1879))

- sort of adult a child will become. Moreover, even if good quality studies existed, decisions about divorce need to be made based upon the individual details of each situation, not based on some faulty notion of the law of averages.
