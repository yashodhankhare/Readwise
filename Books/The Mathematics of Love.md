## Highlights
- Because mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns—predicting phenomena from the weather to the growth of cities, revealing everything from the laws of the universe to the behavior of subatomic particles. And if we consider them honestly, none of those things is neatly ordered or easily predictable, either. Thankfully, love—as with most of life—is full of patterns: from the number of sexual partners we have in our lifetime to how we choose who to message on an internet dating website. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as love does, and are all patterns which mathematics is uniquely placed to describe.

- But all the same, being able to estimate quantities that you have no hope of verifying is an important skill for any scientist. And the technique—known as Fermi estimation—applies to everything from quantum mechanics to the brain-teaser interview questions used by companies like Google.

- Some people believe that we’ve already arrived at the definitive answer to what makes a person beautiful, and claim that it lies in a mathematical concept called the “golden ratio.” If you haven’t heard of the golden ratio, it’s an irrational number approximately equal to 1.61803399 . . . and usually denoted by the Greek letter phi, or Φ. Its definition comes from geometry, but it has been found ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=166))

- to apply in everything from the number of petals on a flower to the population growth of rabbits. It has also repeatedly been linked to human beauty. You may have heard it said that the perfect face should have a mouth that is 1.618 . . . times larger than the base of the nose, eyebrows that are 1.618 . . . times wider than the eyes, and so on. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=169))

- Linking beauty to the golden ratio is a neat theory that you’ll find espoused in numerous beauty blogs and YouTube videos. There’s just one problem—it isn’t good science. Real science is about trying as hard as you can to disprove your own theories. The more you try, and fail, ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=176))

- to prove yourself wrong, the more evidence there is to suggest that what you’re saying is right. As much as I’d like beauty to be defined by a single number, I’m afraid that trawling through thousands of faces and measuring every possible ratio until you find something that fits your theory just isn’t science. The problem with using the golden ratio to define human beauty is that if you’re looking hard enough for a pattern, you’ll almost certainly find one, especially if you’re prepared to be a little loose with your definitions. How do you decide where the “start” of your ear is, or the point at which your nose definitively “ends”? And how do you do this to a degree of accuracy of five or more decimal places in your golden ratio measurement? Perhaps there will come a time when somebody does find a good reason why the human body has a thing for this number. But until then, as Stanford University mathematician Keith Devlin puts it, the golden ratio as a definition for beauty really does seem to be “the myth that won’t go away.” ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=179))

- So, perhaps it’s not possible to change your face to make it more universally attractive. But when it comes to picking a partner, the role of human choice comes into play. Choice means probability, and probability means mathematicians can get to work. When someone decides to approach you in a bar, or to accept your advances at a party, they’re not judging your beauty against every other face in the world. Nobody minds that you don’t look like George Clooney or Heidi Klum. They’re making a decision based on the options available to them at the time, and this is perhaps where there’s room to use a mathematical idea to your advantage. By defining these options in equations, we can create a language to explain why we all make the choices we do, in what has become known as “discrete choice theory.” Despite our illusions of free will, there are some simple rules that people will often follow when coming to a decision. These rules mean that people’s choices are surprisingly easy to manipulate. As the economist Dan Ariely puts it, we’re all just a little bit “predictably irrational.” ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=233))

- This is known in economics as the “decoy effect.” What it demonstrates is that the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices. It has been exploited by marketing experts for decades. But it also has the potential to help make you seem more attractive.

- When going to a party to talk to potential partners, choose a friend to go with you who is as similar-looking to you as possible, except slightly less attractive. Having them there will make you seem like a better option. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=259))

- The mathematics hidden behind this problem is game theory—a way to formalize strategies and find the best tactic in a situation. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=290))

- All the men would then be doing what’s right for themselves (this is called a “Nash equilibrium”), and at the same time doing what’s best for the group (making this also a “Pareto equilibrium”). Sadly, it’s rather rare to find such a neat real-world situation, with four opinion-free brunette clones and one standout blond babe whom everyone is madly in love with. In real life, people have different preferences in a group, and generally it’s difficult to persuade people to ignore those preferences for the greater good. So maybe we have to leave game theory behind for the time being. But that doesn’t mean that math doesn’t have any tips to help you on your night out. To give us a more realistic view, we can turn our attention to a rather neat theory that sheds light on how forward you should be on a night out.

- This setup is known as the “stable marriage problem,” and the process through which the friends picked their partners is called the Gale-Shapley algorithm. If we look into the math behind these couplings, some extraordinary results appear. Regardless of how many boys and girls there are, it turns out that whenever the boys do ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=349))

- the approaching, there are four outcomes which will always be true: 1. Everyone will find a partner. 2. Once all partners are determined, no man and woman in different couples could both improve their happiness by running off together (for example, Phoebe might still have eyes for Ross, but he’s happy with Rachel). 3. Once all partners are determined, every man will have the best partner available to him. 4. Once all partners are determined, every woman will end up with the least bad of all the men who approach her. The last two points demonstrate a particularly surprising result: In short, the group who do the asking and risk continual rejection actually end up far better off than the group who sit back and accept a suitor’s advances. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=351))

- This result does make some intuitive sense. If you put yourself out there, start at the top of the list, and work your way down, you’ll always end up with the best possible person who’ll have you. If you sit around and wait for people to talk to you, you’ll end up with the least bad person who approaches you. Regardless of the type of relationship you’re after, it pays to take the initiative. The difference in outcomes between those who do the asking and those who wait to be asked is particularly important when the stable marriage problem is applied beyond imaginary couples at a party: something the US government found out the hard way.

- The math in these special cases can get quite heavy in places (although there are lots of lovely references at the end of this book if you’re interested in finding out more). But for all the extensions and examples, the message remains the same: If you can handle the occasional cringe-inducing rejection, ultimately, taking the initiative will see you rewarded. It is always better to do the approaching than to sit back and wait for people to come to you. So aim high, and aim frequently: The math says so.

- To summarize, as long as some people think you’re beautiful, you’re much better off having some other people think that you’re ugly than having everyone think you’re just quite cute. People who are unbelievably good-looking and score straight 5 out of 5s will always do well, of course, but the rest of us would do better to divide opinion than to aim for being the cute guy or girl next door. It seems like quite a counterintuitive result, but maybe what’s going on here is that the users sending the messages are also thinking about their own chances: If they think you’re beautiful, but suspect that others might be uninterested, there’s less competition and therefore an extra incentive to get in touch. But if they think you’re beautiful and feel sure that everyone else will, too, they might imagine you’ll be getting lots of ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=558))

- messages and decide not to bother humiliating themselves. And here is the really interesting part, because when most people choose their online dating profile pictures, they tend to try and hide the things that make them unattractive. Classic examples include overweight people choosing a really cropped photo, or bald men choosing pictures of themselves wearing hats. But this is the exact opposite of what you should do. When choosing a profile picture, you should play up to whatever makes you different—including the things that some people might not like. The people who fancy you will still fancy you. And the unimportant people who don’t will only play to your advantage. So be proud of that bald patch, show off that ill-advised tattoo, and get that belly out. Because standing out online just means being yourself. Who would have thought? ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=564))

- Because if men are only after sex, of course we women are constantly trying to trick men into marrying us. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=614))

- When framed in this way, the game of dating is mathematically equivalent to what happens in a particular kind of auction where bidders submit sealed bids and no one knows the bid of any other participant. The theory starts with two bidders who are both vying for the same lot. One is a strong bidder with access to a lot of cash, the other a weak bidder with a limited budget. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=623))

- When a weak bidder comes across a man that she likes, she is likely to pull out all the stops to compete for his attention. A strong bidder, on the other hand, confident that she presents a good match for any man, is less likely to go all-out, knowing that another, better man is probably waiting for her just around the corner. Seeing disinterest from the more attractive woman, the man will then settle down with the woman who shows him the most attention, taking him out of the dating pool. This is all fine at the beginning, but as the auction (i.e., life) continues and the lots are won by the weaker bidders, a situation arises with only a few decent men left and a much larger number of beautiful and intelligent women all fishing in the same shrinking pool. The result is the eligible bachelor paradox, and it comes with a clear, if slightly harsh, take-home message: No matter how hot you are, if your goal is partnership, don’t get complacent. But before we consign ourselves to dying alone and rush out to buy a houseful of cats, it’s worth pausing and looking at these examples objectively. As neat an application of game theory as they are mathematically, ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=633))

- they have one flawed assumption at their core: that men are trying to trick women into having sex with them and women are desperate for commitment. In reality, don’t both sexes want both? Crazily enough, I suspect there may even be some women who want sex and some men who want commitment. And thus this particular game theory house of cards comes tumbling down. Thankfully, there are ways to use game theory that don’t require men and women to conform to stereotypes, and in particular, a formulation that can apply to many of the most common dating conundrums for every type of relationship. We’ll come to that shortly, but first, let me describe the background theory in a simple example: two people deciding whether or not to cheat on their partner in a relationship.

- The numbers here are arbitrary, but the order of the rewards is important. Being the sole cheater results in a higher score than being in a faithful relationship, but it’s bad news if someone cheats on you, and bad for everyone if both partners betray each other. Using this setup makes the game of being faithful equivalent to one of the most famous and well-studied problems in game theory: the prisoner’s dilemma.

- These ideas were first presented in Robert Axelrod’s groundbreaking 1984 book on game theory, The Evolution of Cooperation. In it, Axelrod explains how and why cooperation can occur in human and animal societies despite how stark things in Don and Betty’s payoff matrix above can at first appear. He also gives a strategy to use whenever you find yourself repeatedly playing this kind of game against the same person.3 But Axelrod’s strategy doesn’t just apply to cheating. It can be used to give you a set of rules to apply in a whole host of dating conundrums. Has your date failed to call you when they promised they would? Has your boyfriend missed your birthday? Should you keep quiet and let things go or flip out over any sign of bad behavior? Axelrod’s “tit for tat” strategy gives you the answer. Despite the name, tit for tat isn’t about playground squabbling. It’s a strategy that encourages cooperation but punishes exploitation. The mathematical version ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=677))

- involves cooperating at first, and then simply copying the previous move of your opponent. They stay cooperative, you stay cooperative. They cheat and defect on you, you cheat and defect on them. They go back to being nice, you go back to being nice. Taking the strategy out of the textbook and into the dating world, your rules to follow can be broken down into four simple steps: 1. Be clear. Don’t play games within the game. Being manipulative or tricky in dating won’t work out in the long run. A straightforward strategy will give you the best chance of success. 2. Be nice. Start off by being cooperative and continue to be so unless given reason to act otherwise. 3. Be provokable. Don’t allow yourself to be exploited by bad behavior. If someone treats you badly, you should retaliate with a measured response. But don’t go overboard. As soon as a bad deed has been dealt with you should then: 4. Be forgiving. Move on from bad behavior quickly and return to being cooperative. You have nothing to gain from continually punishing someone for a single mistake. Going too far with your reaction will only prompt a bad reaction from your partner and find you in a spiral of negativity that can be difficult ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=685))

- Instead, the formula suggests that the number of sexual partners follows what’s known as a “power-law” distribution. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NZWJE70&location=761))

- When dating is framed in this way, an area of mathematics called “optimal stopping theory” can offer the best possible strategy in your hunt for The One. And the conclusion is surprisingly sensible: Spend a bit of time playing the field when you’re young, rejecting everyone you meet as serious life-partner material until you’ve got a feel for the marketplace. Then, once that phase has passed, pick the next person who comes along who’s better than everyone you met before.

- I know I’m a mathematician and therefore biased, but this result literally blows my mind. If you chose not to follow this strategy and instead opted to settle down with a partner at random from your destiny, you’d only have a 1/n chance of finding your true love: just 5 percent if you are fated to date twenty people in your lifetime. But, just by rejecting the first 37 percent of your lovers and following this strategy, you can dramatically change your fortunes, to a whopping 38.42 percent for a destiny with twenty potential lovers.

- These ideas still aren’t perfect. Life partners aren’t like houses or assistants, which are yours if you can afford them. But nonetheless, I think this neat and simple problem offers some nice insight into the real-world scenario, even if you can’t totally take it at face value.

- To address these questions, I wanted to show you one of my favorite applications of mathematics to the story of love—one that is firmly anchored in reality. It comes from a wonderfully impressive collaboration between mathematicians and psychologists and ends with a powerful message about how the mathematical patterns in our real-world relationships tell us to treat one another on the path to living happily ever after.

- The most successful relationships are the ones with a really low negativity threshold.4 In those relationships, couples allow each other to complain, and work together to constantly repair the tiny issues between them. In such a case, couples don’t bottle up their feelings, and little things don’t end up being blown completely out of proportion.
