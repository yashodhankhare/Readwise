## Highlights
- When people ask me the secret of my success, I often say it comes down to three things I’ve been able to do: Tell the truth. Know what matters. Get the job done. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=211))

- Unless you can execute and bring what matters to life, no amount of experience or learning will translate into real-world impact. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=224))

- I cannot tell you whether there is a judgment day “up there.” But after watching my father during his last few months, I can tell you this: there is one down here, if we have time to face it. Barring sudden death or mental incapacitation, the impending final deadline forces each of us to judge the life we have lived. Regardless of whether we believe in a God, most of us, in our last months on this Earth, will give ourselves the ultimate performance review. We will ask ourselves some variation of the inevitable questions: Did I live the life I wanted to live? Did I fulfill my potential? Did I live a life I respect?

- In his last year, my father had time to confront the choices he had made and not made and the opportunities he missed. By the time the end came, he had reached a difficult, but honest, conclusion—in his own words, “I screwed up. And I can’t fix it now.” There was nothing that I or anyone else could say to soften this truth. The father I had idolized as a kid was a broken man in those final months, and there was no putting him back together.

- now, while you still have a runway into the future, to determine whether you are living a life you will respect. Don’t wait until the end. A judgment day is coming for all of us, but it’s up to us to decide when it comes, and whether it comes too late, as it did for my father.

- You can’t rewrite your past. But if you have the courage to challenge yourself now, you can write your future. Each of us can choose to use the knowledge of our mortality as a forcing mechanism to create a life we respect. This universal reality, far from being morbid or depressing, is in fact a powerful tool for accomplishing everything that we want in life and business. I learned from my parents’ passing how to live from the future, back. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=271))

- What I will truly value can be categorized into four areas: my relationships with my family and friends; my relationship with my own body and its health and vitality; my relationship with my work and what gives it meaning; and my relationship with my God, my spirituality.

- In life and in business, intent is everything. And intent is rooted in the future. Without clear intent, we live and work by default and in reaction. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=308))

- Our lives are on autopilot, based on how we have done things in the past rather than how we want them to be done in the future. To create anything of value—whether it’s a product, a company, a society, or a life—we must push through our default settings. And we do so by living consciously and deliberately, by making the hard choices, and by using tools like pre-mortems and future-back planning to discover what will really matter, again and again.

- *The cognitive psychologist and author Gary Klein conceived the mental simulation called the “pre-mortem.” He suggests that you look into the future, think about what you want to achieve, and imagine that your efforts have failed. Because you’re contemplating the reasons for why things ran off the rails before (rather than after) the fact, you’re far more willing to confront your worst fears. The exercise pushes you to take an unflinching look at the obstacles you’ll likely encounter and honestly reckon with the challenge of figuring out how best to accomplish your goals. See Gary Klein, The Power of Intuition: How to Use Your Gut Feelings to Make Better Decisions at Work (New York: Crown Business, 2004).

- Or, as the late Harvard Business School professor Clay Christensen put it, to do a better job for someone. This is the essence of successful innovation: recognizing the “job” that a customer is trying to accomplish and helping them get it done better.1 People aren’t just buying your product or service; they’re “hiring” you to solve a problem. Theodore Levitt famously put it this way: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.”2 ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=346))

- Whether they’re Amazon or the General Store, what successful businesses have in common is that they know the jobs they’re doing for their customers, and they’ve figured out how to do those jobs better than anyone else. They keep asking, “What matters?” and are disciplined in bringing the answers to life. And I’m not just talking about what matters today; I’m talking about what will matter tomorrow. They think future back. They’re able to look down the road and see where the market is going. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=398))

- I knew my passion in life revolved around the process of figuring out what worked, whether opening cookie stores, creating a robust revenue stream for a progressive nonprofit, or working with those trying to take political polling to a new level. What I didn’t realize then, but see clearly now, was that the question I was agonizing over—What kind of job do I want?—was the wrong one. The right question was: What do I truly want my life to be about? I was focused on the means—business or politics—rather than the end, which was my desire to make an impact in the world. And I didn’t yet understand the most important thing of all: that if I pursued that end with purpose and intention, its by-product would be the thing I ultimately sought—a sense of self-respect. Means, ends, and by-products. A profound distinction is concealed among those prosaic terms, one that unlocks the code to designing a business and a life of enduring value, created from the future back. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=422))

- I like to explain this distinction by talking about a friend of mine who suffers from type 1 diabetes. He wants to live a long and healthy life, like the rest of us, but he knows that simply focusing on that desire won’t get him there. For him, longevity is not an end he can pursue directly but, rather, a by-product. The critical end he must focus on is keeping his blood glucose levels between 80 and 180. And he accomplishes that through specific means: management of insulin, sensible exercise, and eating right. The by-product of his efforts—living longer—takes care of itself. Some things in life can be pursued directly—these are the ends, or goals we set for ourselves: landing a great job, getting a PhD, owning a house, running a marathon, publishing a book. We attain those ends by choosing the right means and following through with discipline. Other things in life—often the most important ones—are more elusive: being in love, finding happiness and contentment, feeling a sense of integrity or self-respect. These are by-products. By its very nature, a by-product is a secondary result; you can’t generate a by-product by focusing on it. This is a core paradox of being human: that most of the things we deeply yearn for cannot be grasped directly. It’s what the great psychiatrist and philosopher Viktor Frankl meant when he wrote that “happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.”1 ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=430))

- Frankl understood that making happiness a target only leads one to miss it. He saw happiness as an “unintended side-effect” of a life dedicated to a greater purpose.

- The means, ends, and by-products framework is a powerful tool when building a business. You’ll find that it helps clarify the path forward—from launching a company to innovating new products to staying relevant in a fast-changing market. When applying this concept to business, here’s the most game-changing insight I’ve discovered: profits are not an end; they are a by-product. If you focus on profit as the end, you fail. You can’t really “make” profit. Value creation, in the form of profit or stock price appreciation, is the by-product of your efforts. And when you fully appreciate that value creation is the by-product, the end you can focus on is delivering a better and more differentiated experience than your competitors. Sometimes people take this sentiment to mean that profits don’t matter. No. They do. They are important. But they can’t be created as an end in and of themselves,… ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=446))

- To succeed, we’d have to come up with a concept that was magnetic enough to pull people in—to convince more customers to leave more money behind. The best way to do this would be to detect a pervasive customer need—something that customers themselves hadn’t even articulated. That meant getting inside the heads of our customers, watching through their eyes as they went about their day, and discovering a need that was unfulfilled—a job that we could complete better than anyone else. I learned in creating the General Store and the Cookie Jar that opportunity grows out of observation. I’m a naturally curious guy, I like people, and I love figuring things out. And given the fact that I was always interacting with customers, I was in a good position to discover that innate, unspoken customer need. When it came, it took me by surprise—as true opportunities often do. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=514))

- Customers were telling us that we could take on a far bigger job for them. They weren’t telling us in words. No one was walking in and saying, “Damn, I wish you sold sandwiches.” They were telling us with their behavior. IDEO design expert Jane Fulton Suri calls this a “thoughtless act”—one of countless ways in which human beings naturally modify and rearrange the world to make it work better for them.1 Our customers had already found a solution to the job they needed done, and in watching them improvise that solution, I could see the opportunity for Au Bon Pain to better meet their needs.

- In the years it took to transform Au Bon Pain from a French bakery to a robust bakery café, I began to understand that an entrepreneur’s most important resource is not capital. Sure, capital matters. But I don’t share the mindset of the classic venture capitalist, with their focus on leveraging capital for maximum return on investment over the shortest period of time. To me, entrepreneurs are opportunists, not capitalists. In this paradigm, value is created through the ability to see opportunity—to recognize a need and a possible solution before anyone else sees it and then have the courage and creativity to perform that job for a customer. That’s what it means to be an opportunist. For some, that word carries negative connotations—evoking the specter of the unscrupulous speculator taking advantage of circumstances to make a fast buck, regardless of the consequences. But I use the term in a more visionary sense. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=548))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Capital is an accessible and renewable resource. It’s not that hard to obtain capital at a relatively low cost (provided you have good use for it and a distinctive enough view of the world that people are willing to invest in you). For entrepreneurs, the asset that’s nonrenewable—and therefore far more valuable than capital—is our unique capacity to identify customers’ unspoken needs, to see and seize white spaces in the market that others have missed. We capitalize on opportunities. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=555))

- This points to another misunderstood fact about successful entrepreneurs and creators. We’re not risk-takers. In fact, we’re risk-averse. The swashbuckling entrepreneur of popular imagination is just a myth and rarely succeeds. Real-life entrepreneurs develop the skill of seeing patterns to the point where they’re so confident in the opportunity they see that the greatest risk would be to miss it. Venture capitalists see risks as financial. Opportunistic entrepreneurs see risk as missing out on an opportunity to meet a need. Another pervasive myth is that the entrepreneur is some kind of novelty-producing genius. In fact, opportunistic entrepreneurs have a sensibility that leans more toward the editorial than the inventive. We don’t create new things so much as we take a wide-angle view of all the ideas and possibilities that we come across; edit out 99 percent of them; focus on one bright, promising possibility; and execute against it better than anyone else. At the outset, we may not really know what we are looking for. But we recognize it when we see it. I knew when I saw that customer making a sandwich that it was significant. Entrepreneurs are always on the lookout for moments like that. It’s a never-ending search. Even as we are engaged in some other task or responsibility, we try to ensure that at least a part of our attention remains alert to the first faint signs of an emerging opportunity.

- But amid all this, you neglect to do what’s necessary to maintain competitive advantage. That’s the risk. Because what you accomplished yesterday won’t help you succeed tomorrow. Yesterday is over. If you don’t make the right choices today, tomorrow will find you without competitive advantage and with shrinking market share, just as my inner skeptic feared would happen to us—and sooner than anyone expected. And yet acting today is so difficult, especially when you’re on top of the world and you’re winning. It’s hard to relate to, but that is the moment when, in fact, you are at the greatest risk. To avoid falling into this common trap—to escape the shackles of yesterday’s success—you must continually be willing to innovate anew well before you really feel like you need to. As I always say, the time to worry about a heart attack is not when you’re in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

- Put simply, I’d given up control of my company. “Control means that if you get in a pissing match, you stay and they go,” a friend once told me. Control is the ideal for any entrepreneur. But it’s hard to maintain when you’re bootstrapping a business and you can see how much more would be possible . . . if only you had more capital. When you have big visions but limited funds, when Wall Street comes courting, when the buzz around your impending IPO reaches a fever pitch, it’s easy to forget that for every dollar of investment capital you receive, you pay a very high price: you give up one more slice of your ability to steer and control your vision. The capacity to exert control over the company’s destiny should be of utmost importance to all entrepreneurs and business builders.

- I’ll never forget the tears in Steve Jobs’s eyes when he was fired from his own company. For all his success, he’d lost control. If it hadn’t been for the new leaders’ abject failure over the next decade, he’d never have come back. Most leaders in his position never get a second chance.

- Another option, if you decide to take the enterprise public and you have maintained control up to that point, is to do what Au Bon Pain did, and what other companies including the New York Times, Facebook, and Google have done: create dual classes of stock. Class A common stock, with limited voting rights, is sold in the public markets through Nasdaq or NYSE. Class B shares are offered to founders, executives, and their families. They come with proportionately more voting power and therefore the potential for more control over the company. (At Au Bon Pain, we gave our Class B shares three times more voting power than Class A—a decision I would later come to realize was not enough. I’ll tell that story in chapter 20.) Sure, you may hear from investors that they don’t like dual classes of stock. And they don’t. But they will accept it, I promise, if your company is strong enough and worthy of going public and you remained the controlling shareholder up until the IPO.

- Based on what I saw, heard, smelled, and tasted that day, I sensed an opportunity. It wasn’t the product of boardroom brainstorming or exhaustive market research, but rather the product of empathy: making the effort to feel what other people were feeling—their needs and desires, and why they were satisfied or disappointed. Empathy is the key to innovation and the root of all learning because it’s the key to human relationships. It’s what allows us to connect to each other and bridge the divide between our subjective worlds. It pulls us out of our own mental models, our well-worn habits, to see the world through others’ perspectives. And it’s what enables us to understand the jobs we can do for our customers.

- The truth is, I’ve never understood why companies acquire other companies at high prices and then immediately try to change them. I want to know what I’ve got before I try to make it into something else. I knew we had limited time, but we had to take some time to learn what magic needed to be respected and protected. So I put walls around the company and elected to study it. My initial instinct was that St. Louis Bread Company could give us a path into the suburban market, while Au Bon Pain could go on serving the urban market. I imagined growing it to perhaps three hundred to five hundred stores across the Midwest, taking the pressure off Au Bon Pain to adapt to territory that wasn’t its natural habitat. But I wasn’t yet sure, and I couldn’t see much further than taking that first step. And I was okay with that—at least for a while.

- Another way I think about this approach is, be rigid in vision but flexible in execution. Sometimes we can’t see all the steps that will get us where we want to go. But if we keep the vision clear in our minds, we can allow opportunity to unfold and adapt along the way. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=848))

- in psychology. He made a critical leap of empathy, looking at the beer bottle in his hand. “People don’t just want a special product. They want to feel special in a world in which they no longer are.” We called this phenomenon “a drive for specialness.” Ultimately, it became one of the most powerful trends that defined the consumer marketplace in the late nineties and into the new millennium. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=898))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We began our brainstorming by giving voice to what we observed. We recognized that a growing number of consumers wanted that feeling of specialness. And fast food made them feel anything but special. They didn’t want to look too closely at the Formica tables, plastic seats, or paper hats on employees. They held their noses and went to fast-food restaurants even if they didn’t want to because it was their only option to get food quickly—like a self-service gasoline station for the human body. These consumers felt bad about that choice, and it made them feel bad about themselves. They had a hunger that went beyond food. They wanted experiences that they respected and that respected them—indeed, elevated them and their sense of self rather than depleting their sense of self. In a society where real meaning felt hard to come by, they craved small, everyday experiences that added up to something bigger, including in the meals they ate. Their choice of food was not just a way to fill their stomachs; it was an opportunity to assert their individuality and feel good about themselves.

- We didn’t have a name for what we hoped to create, but in the years to come, as our vision began to turn into a reality and the trends we’d observed solidified, the term “fast casual” would come to define this experience. My colleagues and I, along with Howard Schultz at Starbucks and later Steve Ells at Chipotle, were among the first to see where things were going. We all connected the dots and intuited that they represented a broader trend in society and in our industry—a trend that would eventually be labeled the fast-casual sector.

- Dwight’s insight at the bar was the culmination of a long and focused learning journey, driven by questions such as: Who are our customers? How do we understand the structure and niches of the market? What matters to the target consumers in each niche? What do they want? What jobs do they need us to complete? And what do we have to do better than our competitors to win their loyalty? ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=953))

- Most of our learning on those trips was built on developing deep empathy with customers. Empathy requires that you pull away from your own concerns and obsessions and extend yourself—emotionally and mentally—into another person’s mind and experiences. This is not surface level. You need to get in customers’ heads and feel the world as they feel it. It won’t always make sense to you, as we tend to be stuck in our own mental models, assuming that the rest of the world thinks the same way. We are so often unwitting prisoners of our own paradigms and quick to assume we understand before we’ve taken the time to do so. It’s little wonder so many businesspeople come up with innovations that look good on paper but fail in practice. It’s because they aren’t rooted in empathy.

- People don’t always know what they really want or need, which is why focus groups often fail to provide useful insights. A well-developed sense of empathy gets to the roots of the customer’s problems. It’s based on all the observation I’ve talked about in these past few chapters: taking note of physical details, reading body language, asking questions, listening and most importantly, watching what people do. Then, once you start to connect to something that matters, you need to be patient, step back, and look to extract the generalization—the broader patterns that might confirm ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=971))

How do you capture your vision and communicate it such that thousands (and, soon enough, tens of thousands) of designers, chefs, bakers, vendors, franchisees, and frontline associates, not to mention senior management, can not only get it but make it happen just as you imagine it? In short, how do you get alignment? Our first step was to create a document we called Concept Essence. A Concept Essence isn’t a business plan. It doesn’t contain financial projections, market analysis, or sales strategies. All that comes later. This document answers the essential question: What ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=993))

Not only does it guide the initial creation process; it’s a touchstone they can refer to again and again in decision-making as the company grows and evolves. Done well, a Concept Essence should have a long life—remaining essentially unchanged for many years, maybe decades. That’s not to say a Concept Essence should never be questioned or revised—sometimes a company reaches an inflection point where such a fundamental reinvention is necessary. But it’s not something to do lightly. Just as your personality may change and evolve over time, so too can a brand’s, but it’s a process that happens gradually over decades, not overnight on a whim.

To this day, I’m certain there are folks who roll their eyes when I sit down to work on yet another version of a company’s Concept Essence statement, or when I spend hours debating a particular word or phrase. But I know that getting it right is the difference between that vision coming to life as a fully differentiated concept and it becoming another copycat.

- At the height of Panera’s success, we had thousands of bakery cafés. But what we really had was one bakery café, done correctly, replicated thousands of times. If we hadn’t gotten that one right—in its essence—we would never have had the opportunity to build thousands. So many times, I’ve seen smart, talented people jump to action without truly understanding what it is that they are trying to create. And as a result, they fail. The outcome is clichéd or irrelevant. The power behind lasting innovations comes from the willingness to continue to ask what matters—to stay with that question a little longer than it feels comfortable. If you want to create something of enduring relevance in this world—whether it be a business or even public policy—don’t skip this step. Don’t be afraid to subject it to the test of putting it down on paper. Take the time to truly define the solution you are imagining.

- To veterans of the fast-food business, where restaurants are intentionally designed to be slightly uncomfortable to encourage table turnover, inviting customers to linger was heresy. But we were looking to reinvent the status quo, not validate it. And I began to see an opportunity to build sales in the so-called shoulder hours between meals, a time when the cafés had plenty of excess capacity. Indeed, we could become more than a place for meals; we could become a venue to connect, study, conduct interviews, meet with Bible study groups, gossip with friends, write the Great American Novel, or simply catch a breath. Once again, observing our customers’ behavior with empathy allowed us to see an emerging trend. There was a need in our culture for a place that is not home and not work—a “gathering place” as we began to call it. People hungered for a place to come together.

That luck is the result of another important principle of my approach to innovation: get it right before you replicate. It’s an approach that can seem at odds with today’s “fail fast,” minimum-viable-everything innovation culture. Any innovator must be willing to experiment and to fail, but I’m a firm believer in taking the time to think things through, test them, and do everything possible to short-circuit problems before they arise—especially in a large, asset-heavy business like restaurants, where each new unit can cost a million dollars or more.

In fact, “Panera” is a made-up word—a mash-up of Latin and Spanish that we translated roughly into “time of bread.” We bought into the name, intellectually and emotionally, through our logo, which personified the nourishing warmth of our brand in the form of a woman we named Mother Bread. All of these key brand assets were born out of our original Concept Essence. And we had a three-word shorthand that summed up all of it and became a touchstone for our vision: Share the warmth. Warmth. That was what I felt when I first set foot in the Wheat Store—the kind of warmth that makes you feel nurtured and special. To this day, I look back on that moment as probably the most gratifying in my business career. It far outshines the more typical highlights, such as going public or selling the company.

Most people who build businesses can neither turn off nor throttle down their commitment to their pursuit. For me, it’s an addiction of sorts.

And I’d move down to St. Louis myself and make it happen!” The choice was clear—if I had the courage to make it.

- Leadership—and life—is all about choices. You can be a victim to circumstances and other people’s agendas, or you can make a choice. The choice may not always be clear at first, and once it becomes clear, the choice may not be easy to make. But it’s still yours to make. And the quality of your business and your life depends on you doing so. When you reach that deathbed moment and you’re reviewing your life, you’ll realize that everything comes down to the choices you made and the will and skill you brought to the path you chose. The pertinent adage here is, you can do anything, but you can’t do everything. Most people can only do a handful of things well in a lifetime. So, if you’re going to do things well, you need to do less. You need to pick the things that matter and let go of the things that don’t. Fewer things done well: that’s the recipe for a successful business and an impactful life. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=1305))

That’s true. But saying no in and of itself isn’t a recipe for success. I believe the harder, and more important, task is figuring out what to say yes to. As leaders, it’s incumbent on us to discover the one, two, or three things that will make the most difference in vaulting the company into the future and then do everything in our power to execute on those few initiatives.

- Dealing with the reality of choice is powerful because it forces us to come back to that all-important question: What really matters? As you think about what to say yes to, it’s helpful to prioritize against what I call the three Ts—Time, Talent, and Treasury. In other words, how are you going to spend the hours, days, weeks, months, or years of your precious time or your company’s? How are you going to allocate the company’s human capital—its people and their energy, creativity, emotional commitment, and intellectual engagement? And how are you going to allocate the company’s financial capital? Each of these resources is limited. So make sure you’re spending them on what truly matters to the long-term health of your enterprise. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=1371))

- As I shared earlier, I see growth as a by-product of achieving the true end that a business should aim for: competitive advantage. The means to that end is establishing your authority in your chosen niche and then leveraging that authority through smart bets that serve your target customer in ways your competitors find hard to match, thus creating barriers to entry (topics I’ll unpack in detail in coming chapters). The challenge that would consume my every waking minute for the decade to come was how to lead Panera in such a way that growth would be the natural, almost inevitable outcome of our continuing triumph in the race for competitive advantage. Growth is a by-product, not a means. I hit this point again because it is such a contrary mindset to most conventional business thinking and practice. In the common model, a high stock price is the end, and growth is a means to that end.

- Franchising goes in and out of fashion in the food service industry (and others). For a long time, back in the sixties and seventies, the prevailing thinking was that company operations were the way to go. And then, perhaps driven in part by the focus on short-term return on investment and stable royalties, the trend shifted yet again, and people wanted “asset-light” models, where they owned few if any stores. Indeed, companies like Applebee’s decided to franchise almost every unit and live off the royalties, while stripping the overhead down to almost nothing. These days, the pendulum has swung back, and popular concepts like Chipotle are all company owned. In my mind, it doesn’t have to be one way or another; it’s really a question of finding the right balance. I think of it as being like asset allocation in investing financial resources. When the great recession hit in 2008, everyone wished they had all debt and no equity. But when the market goes on a great run, as it did over the last decade, everyone wishes they had all equity and no debt. Neither strategy alone makes a lot of sense, because your strategy needs to work long term over the entire business cycle. The same principle applies to franchising. When a business is doing well, it’s great to operate all company stores and get the leverage from same-store sales, but when sales weaken in a public company, it’s great to have the stability of royalties. If you don’t have both, it is harder to weather the ups and downs. I’m opposed to an all-franchised (asset-light) model because it inhibits your ability to effectively guide the brand. You have no skin in the game, no units to experiment with, and limited resources to figure out what makes sense.

- significant business transformation, you have neither the credibility nor the capabilities to do so. Conversely, an all-company-store model is no panacea. It requires tremendous capital in the growth phase. And franchisees, which are the longest owners of the brand, do make corporate management teams think. So having some franchisees is a wise strategy. Yes, you give up some control, but you get so much back in return from franchisees. They bring local real estate knowledge, capital, and local operating skills, and they put a little tension in the system. At Panera, we ultimately ended up with a balanced system: half franchise, half company, and it worked very well for us.

- It had never been clearer to me why billion-dollar companies end up in trouble. They had lost the ability to know what matters to their customers, and to use that as a North Star for innovation. They were stuck in the past as the world moved forward. Or, to put it another way, they’d lost their connection to discovery while becoming experts in delivery. Discovery and delivery.* Those two essential activities must be kept in balance if a company is to remain relevant as it grows. Discovery is the leap of faith that brings an innovation to life—the creative work of understanding customers’ needs, seeing what matters, and seizing opportunity. Delivery is the work of running the company—making it operational, sustainable, scalable. Both activities are critical. Discovery is the lifeblood of the company; delivery is the circulation system that keeps it flowing. Discovery is what’s effective; delivery is what’s efficient.

- They are hired. I call them delivery people. Short- and medium-term results get better. Margins and profits go up. The business grows. You’re rewarded for this, so you pour more resources into making delivery even better. Along the way, you keep bulking up your delivery muscle while your discovery muscle atrophies. You devote resources and attention to getting work done on time and on budget. You believe you’ve gotten good at understanding the customer, but in fact you’ve sealed yourself off from new learning and, above all, new opportunities. The language of delivery dominates every conversation. Discovery people and delivery people think differently and talk differently. The language of discovery is “Imagine if . . .” The language of delivery is “Prove it to me!” Discovery is poetry; delivery is prose. Discovery is about a dream; delivery, a spreadsheet. Ultimately, discovery people find themselves feeling uncomfortable and diminished in a company in which the focus is on delivery. Over many years, delivery effectively pushes out discovery. That’s what I saw so clearly as I sat in the boardroom that day. If you’re at this point, you’re already trapped—like those executives at McDonald’s. Without knowing it, you have become a highly efficient deliverer of something customers wanted yesterday. You see your delivery juggernaut as a competitive advantage even as your real competitive advantage weakens.

- Of course, delivery matters. That’s one reason why McDonald’s had gotten to be the number one food service company in America. A company that busts its budgets and misses its sales targets won’t endure for long. But every successful company runs the risk of getting muscle-bound by delivery. It’s an easy trap to fall into. You keep optimizing and growing and getting more efficient, and before you know it, you have a bunch of people running your company who have no real connection to the customers, their needs, or what matters tomorrow. Most importantly, you have no ability to discover anew, as the discovery people have fled. Delivery feels safe. It’s predictable; its processes are rational. It’s measurable. Discovery, on the other hand, feels risky. It requires leaps of faith and is based more on instinct than research, more on patterns than data. The tension between discovery and delivery exists in every company and, if kept in balance, is healthy. I took this lesson to heart as I left the McDonald’s meeting and headed back to St. Louis and our still relatively young company. It felt like a timely reminder. We were at a stage in our growth when getting more efficient was important. Improving our delivery capabilities was necessary as we scaled.

It’s a process I now use for any innovation, large or small, in companies I work with. Note that ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=1658))

- although the process’s steps are quite distinct, they are not discrete. In practice, each step is fluid and often spills into the next step. 1.Discover what matters: Determine what job you need to complete for whom Observe. Using all your senses, tune into the everyday human behaviors that signal people’s frustrations, unfulfilled needs, and desires, and thereby reveal a promising opportunity to innovate. Use focus groups and studies of competitors, as well as other industries, business models, and broader cultural trends. Look for patterns and draw generalizations. Once you’ve gathered this data from raw observation, you can start to look for patterns and generalize from one industry to another. Brainstorm. Explore the meaning of the patterns you’re noticing. Compare notes and wrestle with what you have seen. Generate hypotheses on what will matter to people in the future. Research. Confirm your hypotheses through formal research and by looking to other industries for models. Research is the final part of the observation process, not the starting point. It serves only to confirm what you’ve seen directly. Research can only tell you what people did yesterday. And if you just take whatever happened yesterday, extrapolate it, and expect that world to be there tomorrow, don’t be surprised when you find yourself irrelevant.

Rendering. Develop a two-dimensional vision of the solution for the future you see, something equivalent to a watercolor sketch. You can see it and describe it and discuss it, but you haven’t built it. You can test in your mind and discuss with others how it might serve guests, operators, investors, and so on. Continue to play with it, challenge it, and stay open. Are there secondary unforeseen consequences to certain choices? Keep discussing it until you feel confident it’s at least 80 percent solid. It might take the form of a written document like our Concept Essence. It might include visuals. Lab test. Once your rendering is so vivid that you can see it, taste it, touch it, hear it, smell it, it’s time to move into three dimensions and lab test the various parts or subsystems of the solution, internally, before it faces customers.

- Unsurprisingly, my free Wi-Fi proposal didn’t seem like a smart bet at all to those around me. The doubters told me that not only was it a risk to sales and the bottom line, but it was damn near impossible to pull off. And all so we could give something away for free? But my vision for Wi-Fi wasn’t about giving something away. I recognized an opportunity to enhance our core competitive advantage by anticipating what would matter in the future—the essence of a smart bet. It was a way to fulfill our Concept Essence and build energy in our cafés—and execute a jujitsu move on our competitors in the process.

And a key element of that original vision was for Panera to be part of the revolution in how people were working. In those cafés in Portland and San Francisco, I’d seen guys in suits with big clunky laptops and pagers. I was one of them myself. I loved getting out of the office and finding new spaces to help me think afresh. Inspired by these observations, the original Concept Essence document included a section on making the cafés computer friendly. Back then, that mostly meant lots of power outlets. When Wi-Fi arrived, I understood that the concept still applied, but it needed to mean something different. ([Location 1759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=1759))

- Starbucks recognized it, too. But Starbucks, like most of our competitors, didn’t have our seating capacity. Its cafés had maybe fifteen or twenty seats compared to our hundred-plus. They were like a fleet of small planes that were always full; we had bigger planes with plenty of open seating. We were only full for a couple hours a day, during lunch. By offering free Wi-Fi, we could entice customers into our cafés during the quiet periods, while at the same time undercutting a competitor, Starbucks, which was making customers pay for it. That was not a bad strategy for Starbucks at the time; it served both as a profit stream and a way to discourage people from staying too long in its limited number of seats (something we didn’t need to worry about). I had a hunch Wi-Fi was the future. It was going to become a commodity. By giving it away before anyone else did, we’d establish ourselves as the go-to place for the new tribe of nomadic workers. And we’d put intense pressure on Starbucks, which, if it chose to match our free offering, would overwhelm its cafés and compress its profits, and if it failed to match us would appear greedy. In either case, it would be bad for Starbucks. That was the smart bet. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=1764))

It turned out that the installation of broadband in all our cafés to enable the Wi-Fi led to faster and more enhanced credit card processing, which led to a surge in sales. Suddenly, paying with a card, which had been cumbersome and slow, became easy. And when customers pay with credit, they buy more.

- organization and its stakeholders? In most enterprises, the answer should be some variation of maintaining competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is the end; everything else is the means. Good decisions are those that lead to greater competitive advantage. To define the filters on your lens, you need to consider your key points of authority and differentiation: the ways in which you’ve decided to compete. For example, perhaps what differentiates you is the guest experience. Or perhaps you’re competing on value. Or you might set yourself apart with a focus on quality. Your decision-making lens should reflect the concept’s points of differentiation and core personality, placed in a distinct order of importance. For example, if the customer experience is your key point of differentiation, you should filter decisions through the question, “How will this affect our customers?” before you filter it through questions about cost. That doesn’t mean you avoid the financial perspective, but that a filter is less important than the customer-experience perspective.

By having the capabilities to do the tough stuff and then successfully taking it on, you build a moat around the business—a barrier to entry that will buy you time. Barriers to entry are everything. When you make it harder for your competitors to copy what you are doing, you give yourself more space to discover the next growth opportunity. You create a mini-oligarchy, which gives you greater control over margins. By the time your competitors start bridging the moat, you will already be building a new one—working on a new and more difficult challenge.

Find ways to give them what they want (a boost in the stock price) without compromising what matters. Count your votes. If you don’t have the backing of your board and institutional investors, you can’t win against activists. Make sure you’ve got the votes. Visit the portfolio managers of your largest institutional investors in their offices personally, not just when the activists are attacking, but regularly. I’d suggest doing so at least once a year.

Describe the by-product. This is where you want the organization to be in two to five years, your long-term vision for the impact you want to have.

These might happen once a month or more frequently if the relationship requires it. Functional meetings, such as marketing department meetings, are not on this list, because I don’t believe they’re central to an organization’s work.

A leader’s responsibility is to set the expectations and provide the opportunity for individuals to step up and perform, should they choose to do so.

It’s because I’m trying to live into the future when everyone else is fixated on the present moment. I’m not focused on what is happening today; I’m trying to discover what will matter tomorrow. I’m thinking future back. A company will always perform better or worse than its expectations. I know what’s happening behind the scenes, so I know, at least to some extent, what the future will look like. And that knowledge gives me the confidence to make decisions against the grain. This future-back perspective, as I’ve already shared, is fundamental to my approach to both life and business. But its importance is heightened during more extreme circumstances, positive or negative. From a future-back perspective, it’s wise to be cautious when everyone else is investing like crazy, and to make smart investments when everyone else is pulling cash out of the market. This is an underlying principle of value investing, espoused by leaders like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. But it’s wisdom that rarely seems to make it into business operations. I believe it works there as well. Conserve in a boom; build in a bust. And nowhere was that advice more dramatically relevant than in the boom years of the early 2000s and the bust of the Great Recession.

- In retrospect, the wisdom of this contrarian approach seems obvious. But in the moment, it is neither obvious nor easy. In the midst of a bust, it’s hard not to retreat into a risk-averse mindset. And it’s even harder, in the midst of a boom, not to get caught up in the party. When lenders are throwing interest-free money at anyone who asks, it’s tough to stay disciplined. One of the keys to successfully keeping your head is to focus forward, on the future that is yours to seize, and resist the temptation to look sideways at your competitors and mimic their tactical decisions. “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s concept” is a good rule of thumb for the restaurateur, or any business owner for that matter. We lose competitive advantage not just because we’re reacting to the economic climate, but because we’re simply mimicking other companies.

Now, I’d written a vision for Panera that would put technology at the very heart of our efforts to compete—positioning Panera as “the Amazon of the food industry.” Previously, I’d seen technology as a cost to be reduced, an enabler of operations at best; now I was seeing its potential to transform the guest experience. I’m not afraid to change my mind, and I believe it’s okay to learn and evolve. However, I was aware of the dissonance many would hear between this vision and my former stance, so I opened the memo with these words: “Don’t use my words to argue with me.

Those ideas still mattered—but by 2013, people expected those things and even took them for granted. And as society had grown more educated and informed about nutrition and health, the bar had been raised (in part by us) for what it took to make customers feel the way we wanted them to feel.

But we needed to add yet another new initiative to our already overflowing plates of transformation. It was likely the most important one of all. In January 2014, I gathered the best minds I knew to embark on a yearlong Concept Essence reinvention. Strategic consultant Dwight Jewson and I had a sense of where it would take us, but intellectual integrity required that we do the hard research. It began where every innovation begins: observing customers, practicing empathy, and looking for patterns and generalizations we could extract. The process yielded a fascinating insight: our guests were in conflict about their diets. They wanted to eat well, but they also wanted to enjoy their food. They wanted food that was good—and good for them. Our research indicated that this customer represented about 20 percent of the market—a huge slice of the population. Anyone who could own that niche was going to win. And I knew these people well because I was one of them. Having recently turned sixty, I’d come to the realization that I needed to eat more consciously and thoughtfully if I were to continue to live the long, vital, and healthy life I hoped to. I learned that I was close to being prediabetic, a discovery that prompted a radical reevaluation of my own diet. In the process, Panera’s medical adviser, Dr. David Eisenberg, put me on a continuous glucose monitor and told me to eat at Panera every day for a week. He wanted me to understand how Panera food drove up my blood sugar. I was shocked at what I found. I wanted Panera to be somewhere I felt good about eating. But if so, it was going to need to evolve.

- In 2014, as we reworked our Concept Essence, two words came to the forefront: craveable wellness. The intersection of desire with health. I wanted our cafés to feel like they were brimming with an abundance of beautiful food that was also good for you. If we could pull that off, we’d deliver on the promise of our original vision—to elevate our guests’ self-esteem. As we worked to bring our new Concept Essence into focus, I couldn’t yet see what it would take to pull it off. But once I understood our vision for transformation, I knew we had no choice but to get it done. ([Location 3162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3162))

- I knew we wouldn’t see results right away, but I also knew shareholders wouldn’t wait forever. My commitment never wavered, even as the task ballooned. I often thought about one of my favorite quotes, from the legendary football coach Vince Lombardi: “We didn’t lose, we just ran out of time.” ([Location 3188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3188))

- In the end, it was all worth it because I was able to look back and say that I had integrity. Integrity is about getting the job done—whether that means getting a guest the sandwich she ordered or completing a massive, multiyear organizational transformation. And you do it not just so your customers or stakeholders will be happy—you do it so you’ll be able to respect yourself.

- yourself, for your stakeholders, and for the company—is never easy. I’d toyed with the idea of selling a couple of times over the years, but it had been decades since I received a serious offer. Offers for billion-dollar companies are rare and should never be treated casually. You’ll respond emotionally, but the decision on selling must be made rationally, taking into consideration where the company is at, how it’s valued at that moment, the interests of all your stakeholders, and where you’re at in your own life’s journey.

- For Panera, the timing wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t bad. I’d started seriously considering a sale the previous summer as our epic transformation neared completion. Our stock price was climbing; analysts could see and feel what was coming. If we could get an offer that was priced substantially above the market, it would mean we could deliver value to our shareholders and team members that would otherwise take three or four more years to attain and in any case wouldn’t be guaranteed. They’d been patient and generous during the long years of upheaval while we remade the company, and I wanted to reward them. On the other hand, I was torn. If I sold now, I knew I’d be cheating myself out of a victory lap. ([Location 3359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3359))

- We were wrapping up this final transformation when I began seriously considering a sale. There were many compelling reasons to sell. At sixty-two, I still had living to do outside the office, and I couldn’t imagine living through the agony of yet another company reinvention—the stress, uncertainty, expectations, and loneliness, wondering if it would ever be done. In fact, I’d informed the ([Location 3396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3396))

- When I’d written my reunion speech, I hadn’t been thinking about an impending sale. But I wouldn’t have written it any differently if I had. Its theme—keeping the promise of Panera—would have made sense if I’d planned to stay there forever, but it also resonated powerfully now that the possibility of a serious offer was on the table. What I was telling our assembled Panera family was this: the transformation that we have been working on for more than half a decade is now in full rollout and its ultimate success is now in your hands. It’s up to you to keep the promise of Panera, to our customers and all of our stakeholders, including yourselves. I used my own kids as an example—how Nancy and I had dreams for them when they were young, but they grew up and we had come to realize that their lives were now in their hands.

- When the announcement was done and released, I felt strangely empty. I went through the motions, taking congratulatory calls, but it wasn’t until I went on CNBC the next morning that my mood lifted. The anchors, David Faber, Sara Eisen, and Jim Cramer, with whom I’d done dozens of shows over the years, came to the studio to greet me. I was soon feeling more celebratory—especially when they seemed perplexed by my decision to take the company private at this moment when Panera was doing so well. Their questions reminded me of why I was doing the deal at all—I was tired of being a slave to the short term. “It’s an opportunity to do even better work,” I told them. “Well, yes,” Faber challenged me, “but you’re not going to have a stock price to judge that work by any longer. How are you going to measure yourself?” That comment said it all. “We’ve never judged ourselves by the stock price,” I retorted. “The stock price is a by-product of the work we’ve done. We’re going to measure ourselves the way we’ve always measured ourselves—by our ability to make a difference and take market share.” I used the moment to deliver a message that I would share many more times in the years to come: that our economy—and our politics—are not served by this focus on the short term. My old friend Jim Cramer got the message. “You’ve got a soul, Ron!” he declared. Their final question: “How does it feel to have the biggest restaurant deal in US history?” My answer: “This deal is simply a by-product of our good work.” ([Location 3510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3510))

- What felt great, I explained, was to have led a company that figured out what mattered and delivered for its shareholders as the best-performing restaurant stock over its last two decades as a public entity, to have a company that was really taking care of its associates, to have a company that was genuinely serving its customers. That’s how we valued ourselves, not in dollars per share. ([Location 3524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTMSSL4R&location=3524))
