- Both those who won the Powerball lottery and Marion Tinsley enjoyed great success. But it's easy to see that the causes of the two types of success differed markedly. The lottery outcome that day was a matter of pure good luck for the 110 winners and pure bad luck for Powerball. But Tinsley's success was almost entirely the result of skill. With all the luck in the world, you would have almost no chance of winning if Tinsley were across the table from you. For practical purposes, we can regard Tinsley's success as all skill. Unfortunately, most things in life and business are not that clear. Most of the successes and failures we see are a ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=134))

- combination of skill and luck that can prove maddeningly difficult to tease apart. The purpose of this book is to show you how you can understand the relative contributions of skill and luck and how to use that understanding in interpreting past results as well as making better decisions in the future. Ultimately, untangling skill and luck helps with the challenging task of prediction, and better predictions lead to greater success.

The paper argues that intuitive judgments are often unreliable because people base predictions on how well an event seems to fit a story. They fail to consider either how reliable the story is or what happened before in similar situations. More formally, Kahneman and Tversky argue that three types of information are relevant to… ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=143))

For the patients who were evaluating the treatment, the story of success swamped the statistics. The key to statistical prediction is to figure out how much weight you should assign to the base rate and specific case. If the expected accuracy of the prediction is low, you should place most of the weight on the base rate. If the expected accuracy is high, you can rely more on the specific case. In this example, the doctor gave the… ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=154))

- Unfortunately, we don't usually think this way. When we make predictions, we often fail to recognize the existence of luck, and as a consequence we dwell too much on the specific evidence, especially recent evidence.

- Part of the fun and challenge of analyzing skill and luck is that it's a multidisciplinary endeavor. Statisticians, philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, corporate strategists, professors of finance, economists, and sabermetricians (those who apply statistical methods to the study of sports) all have something to contribute to the discussion.

- Untangling skill and luck is an inherently tricky exercise, and there are plenty of limitations, including the quality of the data, the sizes of samples, and the fluidity of the activities under study. The argument here is not that you can precisely measure the contributions of skill and luck to any success or failure. But if you take concrete steps toward attempting to measure those relative contributions, you will make better decisions than people who think improperly about those issues or who don't think about them at all. That will give you an enormous advantage over them. Some statisticians, especially in the world of sports, come across as know-it-alls who ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=206))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- are out of touch with the human side of things. This characterization is unfair. Statisticians who are serious about their craft are acutely aware of the limitations of analysis. Knowing what you can know and knowing what you can't know are both essential ingredients of deciding well. Not everything that matters can be measured, and not everything that can be measured matters. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=211))

- In his book The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Richard Epstein, a game theorist trained in physics, notes that there is no way to assure that you'll succeed if you participate in an activity that combines skill and luck. But he does say, “It is gratifying to rationalize that we would rather lose intelligently than win ignorantly.”8 Luck may or may not smile on us, but if we stick to a good process for making ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=218))

- The first step in untangling skill and luck is to define the terms. This is not a simple task and can quickly devolve into heated philosophical debates.5 We can avoid those, since pragmatic definitions are all that we need to think clearly about the past, present, and future results of our actions and to improve the way we make the decisions that lead to those actions. But first things first. Before we can speak of skill and luck, we have to settle on the specific activity we're talking about. We can analyze what athletes, executives, or investors do. We just have to be clear ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=255))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- on what elements of performance we are considering. Next, we want to agree on the measures of performance. For athletes, it is winning games. For executives, it is developing strategies that create value. The benefit of measurement is that it allows us to assign specific values to skill and luck. Now we can turn to definitions. Luck Let's start with luck. We can probably do a bit better than the average dictionary that defines luck as “events or ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=260))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- circumstances that work for or against an individual.”6 This is a good starting point, but we can be a little more specific. Luck is a chance occurrence that affects a person or a group (e.g., a sports team or a company). Luck can be good or bad. Furthermore, if it is reasonable to assume that another outcome was possible, then a certain amount of luck is involved. In this sense, luck is out of one's control and unpredictable.

- My definition suggests that it is useful to develop an attitude of equanimity toward luck. The consequences of our efforts, both good and bad, reflect an element within our control—skill—and an element outside of our control—luck.

- luck is a residual: it's what is left over after you've subtracted skill from an outcome. Realizing good or bad luck says nothing about you as a person. If you've benefited from good luck, be happy about it and prepare for the day when your luck runs out. And don't feel affronted when you suffer from bad luck. Provided that you have approached the activity in the correct fashion, you want to shrug off the poor results and go about your business in the same fashion in the future. Most people have a general sense that luck evens out over time. That may be true in the grand scheme of things. But the observation doesn't hold for any ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=303))

- Making Your Own Luck Since luck is intimately intertwined in all of our lives, it comes as no surprise that there are plenty of aphorisms that address luck: “You make your own luck.” “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=314))

- “I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.”11 Preparation and hard work are essential elements of skill. They often lead to good outcomes. But the aphorisms don't really address what's happening. If you prepare and work hard, you are successful not because your luck improves. Luck doesn't change at all. Only your skill improves.

- Now let's turn to skill. The dictionary defines skill as the “ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance.”14 It's hard to discuss skill in a particular activity without recognizing the role of luck. Some activities allow little luck, such as running races and playing the violin or chess. In these cases, you acquire skill through deliberate practice of physical or cognitive tasks. Other activities incorporate a large dose of luck. Examples include poker and investing. In these cases, skill is best defined as a process of making decisions. So here's the distinction between activities in which luck plays a small role and ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=349))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- activities in which luck plays a large role: when luck has little influence, a good process will always have a good outcome. When a measure of luck is involved, a good process will have a good outcome but only over time. When skill exerts the greater influence, cause and effect are intimately connected. When luck exerts the greater influence, cause and effect are only loosely linked in the short run. There's a quick and easy way to test whether an activity involves skill: ask whether you can lose on purpose.… ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=354))

- Most people attain an acceptable level of skill in day-to-day activities after about fifty hours of training and practice. Examples include driving a car, learning to type, or playing a sport with basic proficiency.

In this stage, your performance improves noticeably and you make fewer errors that are more easily corrected.

Finally, there is the autonomous stage, where the skill becomes habitual and fluid. Now the golfer can… ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=365))

If you become skilled in a physical or cognitive task, your body knows what to do better than your mind, and thinking too much about what you're doing can actually lead to degradation in performance. In these activities, intuition is powerful and valuable.17 Most of us hit a plateau in our skills and are perfectly content to stay there. Once at that plateau, additional experience does not lead to improved results (as my play in a recreational hockey… ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=370))

It involves hours of concentrated and dedicated repetition. Deliberate practice also requires timely and accurate feedback, usually from a coach or teacher, in order to detect and correct errors. Deliberate practice is laborious, time-consuming, and not much fun, which is why so few people become true experts or true champions.18 In activities where luck plays a larger role,… ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=375))

- increasing your speed at typing, the number of words you can type each minute will increase and the number of errors you make will decline. With tasks that depend on luck, making proper decisions using good skill can produce poor results over the short term. To use Ma's example, whether his team won or lost was not a reliable form of feedback in assessing skill unless and until they played enough games. The lack of quality feedback wreaks psychological havoc, too, creating false doubt in skillful people who are making good decisions and creating false confidence in those who are doing well simply because they're experiencing a streak of good luck. In considering skill, it is also ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=396))

- important to distinguish between experience and expertise. There is an unspoken assumption that someone doing something for a long time is an expert. In activities that depend largely on skill, though, expertise comes only through deliberate practice, and very few individuals are willing to commit the time and effort to go beyond a plateau of performance that's good enough. The fact is, most of us generally don't need performance that's better than good enough. An experienced auto mechanic, plumber, or architect, for instance, is often all you need. On the other hand, deliberate practice is essential to reach the pinnacle as a musician or an athlete. The confusion between experience ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=400))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and expertise is particularly acute in fields that are complex and where luck plays a big role. One of the signatures of expertise is an ability to make accurate predictions: an expert's model effectively ties cause to effect. By this measure, experts who deal with complex systems fare poorly.

- The Luck-Skill Continuum and Three Lessons To visualize the mix of skill and luck we can draw a continuum. On the far right are activities that rely purely on skill and are not influenced by luck. Physical activities such as running or swimming races would be on this side, ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=418))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- as would cognitive activities such as chess or checkers. On the far left are activities that depend on luck and involve no skill. These include the game of roulette or the lottery. Most of the interesting stuff in life happens between these extremes. To provide a sense of where some popular activities belong on this continuum, I have ranked professional sports leagues on the average results of their last five seasons (see figure 1-1).23 FIGURE 1-1 Sports on the luck-skill continuum (one season based on an average of the last five seasons) ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=421))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Where an activity lies on the continuum has important implications for making decisions. So our initial goal is to place activities properly on the continuum between skill and luck. Naturally, there are variables that make this an elusive task. For example, the skills of athletes shift as they age, and most companies lose their competitive advantages as new technologies emerge. But having some sense of where an activity falls on the continuum is of great value. Here are some ways that untangling skill and ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=427))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Take Sample Size into Account To assess past events properly, consider the relationship between where the activity is on the luck-skill continuum and the size of the sample you are measuring. One common mistake is to read more into an outcome than is justified. Howard Wainer, a distinguished research scientist for the National Board of Medical Examiners and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Pennsylvania, makes this point by identifying what ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=432))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- he calls, “the most dangerous equation.” Derived by Abraham de Moivre, a renowned French mathematician, the equation states that the variation of the mean (average) is inversely proportional to the size of the sample. This says that small samples display much larger variation (measured by standard deviation) than large samples in activities that involve a large dose of luck. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=435))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 24 You can visualize the mean and standard deviation with the bell curve, the shape that traces the distribution. The largest number of observations is close to the top of the bell, near the mean, or average. From the top of the bell, the curve slopes ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=438))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- down the sides symmetrically with an equal number of observations on each side. Standard deviation is a measure of how far the sides of the bell curve are from the average. A skinny bell curve has a small standard deviation, and a fat bell curve has a large standard deviation. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=440))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A small number of results tell you very little about what's going on when luck dominates, because the bell curve will look fatter for the small sample than it will for the overall population. Wainer deems this the most dangerous equation because ignorance of its lessons has misled people in a wide range of fields for a long time and has had serious consequences.

He provides a map showing that the counties in the United States with the lowest rates tend to be rural, small, and in the Midwest, South, and West. He then shows a map of the counties with the highest rates. They tend to be rural, small, and in the Midwest, South, and West. This is simply de Moivre's equation at work: if you're closer to the luck side of the luck-skill continuum, small sample sizes will exhibit large variations and will lead to unreliable conclusions. Wainer then shows the rate at which people contract cancer of the kidney as a function of the population of any given county, and it is visually clear that small counties ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=445))

- Here's the main point: if you have an activity where the results are nearly all skill, you don't need a large sample to draw reasonable conclusions. A world-class sprinter will beat an amateur every time, and it doesn't take a long time to figure that out. But as you move left on the continuum between skill and luck, you need an ever-larger sample to understand the contributions of skill (the causal factors) and luck.

- An understanding of where an activity is on the luck-skill continuum also allows you to estimate the likely rate of reversion to the mean. Any activity that combines skill and luck will eventually revert to the mean. This means that you should expect a result that is above or below average to be followed by one that is closer to the average.

A batter can put a ball into play and a slight difference in trajectory will determine whether it's a hit or an out. Over a long, 162-game season, the best teams in baseball rarely win more than 60 percent of their games, as reversion to the mean powerfully drives the outcomes back toward the average. In sharp contrast to tennis, baseball has a lot of randomness. Only the New York Yankees were one of the top four teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011 (based on wins), and they made it by a slim margin in 2010.

He introduces a 2×2 matrix, where the rows distinguish between activities that can have extreme variation and those that have a narrower range of possibilities.30 The narrow distributions are the ones that de Moivre's equation handles superbly. The distribution of stature is a classic example, as the ratio between the tallest and shortest human on record is only 5:1. But extreme variation is a lot more difficult to deal with. For example, the distribution of wealth has extreme outcomes. The net worth of Bill Gates, in excess of $50 billion, is more than 500,000 times more than the median net worth of all Americans.

While those factors may have had some influence on the results, none are sufficient to explain the failure to achieve a .400 average.

- greater role in how well they do. For activities where little or no luck is involved, the paradox of skill leads to a specific and testable prediction: over time, absolute performance will steadily approach the point of physical limits, such as the speed with which one can run a mile. And as the best competitors confront those limits, the relative performance of the participants will converge. Figure 3-5 shows this idea graphically. As time goes on, the picture evolves from one that looks like the left side to one that looks more like the right side. The average of the distribution of skill creeps toward peak performance and the slope of the right tail gets steeper as the variance shrinks, implying results that are more and more alike. We can test this prediction to see if it is true. Consider running foot races, especially the marathon, one of the oldest and most popular sports events in history.

Stable means that the basic structure of the activity doesn't change over time, and linear means that a particular action leads to the same reaction every time. If you can easily identify the cause of a given effect, you're most likely on the skill side of the continuum.

It is also true that the number of opportunities a team has to score will greatly determine the influence of luck on the outcome of the game. Basketball players take possession of the ball at eight or nine times the rate of football players. The more chances they have to score, the more influence skill has.

Bernstein surmised that as markets continued their march toward efficiency, the pattern of declining variance in excess returns should be evident for money managers. The data backed him up: the standard deviation of excess returns for mutual funds slowly and steadily declined from 1960 through 1997. In 2004, though, Bernstein reran the numbers and found that the standard deviation had exploded from roughly 10 percent in the late 1990s to almost 20 percent in 1999.

- Intelligence tests measure certain cognitive capabilities, but it is also clear that they fail to assess other important mental faculties that reflect cognitive skill. Perhaps the most important among these is the ability to make good decisions. Keith Stanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, distinguishes between an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) and rationality quotient (RQ). While many people assume that intelligence and rationality are related, Stanovich shows that these are distinct abilities. This is why we see objectively intelligent people make poor decisions. If we are considering cognitive skill, RQ is primarily what we are after. The trouble is, we haven't made very much progress in learning how to test RQ. The attributes of RQ, as Stanovich lists them, include “adaptive behavioral acts, judicious decision making, efficient behavioral regulation, sensible goal prioritization, reflectivity, [and] the proper calibration of evidence.”22 He argues that plenty of people have adequate intelligence but an inability to think and behave rationally. The gap between IQ and... RQ is the result of trouble with mental processing and limits to what we know.

Streaks that result solely from luck tell us little about a player's skill, while streaks caused by variation in skill tell us little about luck. If the observed outcomes are consistent with what a simple model of luck predicts, then the perception of hot hands is more of a matter of psychology than of performance.3 ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1706))

And as time goes on, they matter more and more. A number of mechanisms are responsible for this phenomenon. A simple one is known as preferential attachment. Let's say you launch a new website and want to make it as popular as possible. A logical step would be to link your site to sites that already have lots of connections to other sites, including Google or Wikipedia, rather than sites that only have a few connections.

- preference for attaching to sites that are already well known and frequently visited. This behavior causes positive feedback: the more connections you already have, the more new connections you get. Through the process of preferential attachment, some sites gain more links and others fade into obscurity as new sites join the network. Initial differences, even modest ones, are amplified over time.13 Here's a very simple model of this process.

On the other hand, we readily attribute failure to external causes, including bad luck.28 In a paper called “Heads I Win, Tails It's Chance,” Ellen Langer and Jane Roth describe an experiment in which they asked subjects to call heads or tails for ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1996))

In all trials, the participants were “successful” 50 percent of the time, but some were told that they were correct frequently at the beginning of the sequence while others started with more wrong answers. Subjects who were told they were right seven out of the first eight tosses estimated their own ability to predict heads or tails as 5.7 (0 = very bad and 10 = pretty good), well above those who were told they were wrong at the beginning. In this case, initial success with random events persuaded those people to think that they had ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2001))

- some sort of skill at predicting the way a coin would land.29 Likewise, when we observe the success of others, we fall victim to the fundamental attribution error. In this context, the error is the tendency to base our explanation of what happens on an individual's skill rather than the situation. Once we create a narrative that explains success, we tend to suppress other explanations and see what happened as inevitable.

People who work in businesses where social influence operates are often paid for good luck, although they generally don't suffer symmetrically from bad luck. This issue, of course, is central to the outrage about the financial crisis that occurred from 2007–2009.

First, they are persistent, which means what happens in the present is similar to what happened in the past. If the job you do is predominantly a matter of skill, you can expect to be able to repeat your performance reliably. If you measured the performance of a trained sprinter on two consecutive days, you would expect to see similar times. In statistics, this persistence is called reliability. If luck is more important, then you would expect the reliability to be low. The test for ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2049))

In many cases, these rules of thumb are consistent with what the statistics say—great hitters and pitchers stand out in both cases.

The star system is not really a measure that leads to making money; it tells you what the past performance of the fund looks like.24 I examined the correlation between the Morningstar rating at the end of 2007 and the end of 2010 for more than four hundred mutual funds to determine how much the ratings change over time.

Investing involves a great deal of luck, which we know from the low degree of persistence in the results and from the absence of experts who can consistently forecast where markets are going. Investing is a field with low validity and unclear feedback. While there is evidence that a small… ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2347))

- almost two-thirds of them agree with the statement, “As a forecasting/recommendation task becomes more complex and difficult, I tend to rely more on judgment and less on formal, quantitative analysis.”5 In the face of complexity, investors default to a simpler and more intuitive mode. Daniel Kahneman calls this substitution. He explains, “The target question is the assessment you intend to produce. The heuristic question is the simpler question that you answer instead.”6 We fight complexity with simplicity. So to… ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2356))

- Kahneman explains how the two systems typically interact: Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever you are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2368))

- smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually.7 ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2372))

- Here's where deliberate practice comes in. You can become an expert by using deliberate practice to train your System 1. You become an expert when you learn to perform unconsciously and free your attention for higher-level thinking. This is why a chess master can effortlessly assess the relative strength of positions on the board. It is also how a champion tennis player knows how to… ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2374))

- Deliberate practice and the concept of expertise apply only near the skill side of the luck-skill continuum. You can train System 1 only for activities that are stable and linear. As noted in chapter 4, stable means the rules of the game don't change, and linear means that cause and effect are clear and consistent. A chessboard, for instance, always has 64 squares arranged in 8 columns and… ([Location 2380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2380))

- when you make a mistake, you lose pieces. In a linear system, a particular cause always has the same effect. The interaction of balls on a billiards table is a good example. If you know the basics of the cause, including the velocity of the ball that's in motion, the mass of the ball that it hits, and the angle of the collision between the two, you can predict the effect with great accuracy. Contrast that with the stock market. Some of the moves the market makes are clearly the result of important information. For example, the S&P… ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2383))

- of the big moves appear unrelated to new information. The press always likes to point to some clear cause on days when the market makes big moves. But as economists studying the issue have found, those causes don't really have any significance. They just make good copy.9 Because cause and effect are not linear in markets, there's no reliable way to train your System 1 to anticipate prices. Deliberate practice is powerful in domains where it applies, including chess, music, and sports. But acknowledging its limits is crucial. A number of the popular… ([Location 2388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2388))

- coach or teacher who designs the curriculum specifically to improve performance.11 A teacher can identify the skills that are essential for a particular pursuit, allowing the student to concentrate on mastering those skills in order to improve performance. Most of us do not practice according to a deliberately designed curriculum. If you attend a practice for a youth sports team, for instance, you will frequently see a lack of structure. The children do drills that have little or no connection to the skills required to excel during a real game. They practice casually… ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2394))

- that there's a constant sense of being challenged without feeling overwhelmed. Once you have an appropriate routine, deliberate practice requires an enormous amount of time and effort. Consider the case of Apollo Robbins, who is one of the world's greatest pickpockets. During his show, Robbins invites a guest on stage, tells him that he's going to take various items from him, and then does so in front of a large audience. (He gives everything back, which is why he's known as “the gentleman thief.”) He is a master at managing… ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2399))

- Vegas, where he entertained people waiting in line to see the main show. By his estimate, Robbins stole from about 25 guests each hour, for 5 hours a night, 5 nights a week, for 5 consecutive years. He worked for more than 6,000 hours refining his skills. He'll tell you that most of his moves are now automatic. Key to his expertise is this: he doesn't even have to think about it. He trained his System 1 through years of repetition. He'll also tell you that his best moves were really hard to learn and took hours of dedicated practice to master.… ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2404))

- writes that it “is not inherently enjoyable,” and that individuals do it because of “its instrumental value in improving performance.”12 Progress requires a great deal of focus and concentration, which is difficult to achieve and sustain. Indeed, individuals who practice more than one thousand hours a year run the risk of exhaustion. One reason that deliberate practice is so taxing is that it compels you to stay in the cognitive stage, constantly thinking about and improving your results, rather than allowing you to slip into the automatic… ([Location 2409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2409))
