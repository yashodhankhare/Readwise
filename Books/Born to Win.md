## Highlights
- Zig told me there are three things you simply can’t do: you can’t push a rope, you can’t put toothpaste back in a tube, and you can’t saw sawdust. The first thing I had to learn was a willingness to let go of the past. Zig taught me that the key to success was centered in the pursuit of action-oriented goals, and I totally ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=149))
- bought into Zig’s goal-setting philosophy. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=152))
- I read this book as it was a work in progress, and I’ve lived and breathed Zig’s philosophy: “You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” This process works! This philosophy is true! ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=160))

- The Born to Win philosophy is both “profoundly simple” and “simply profound.” The concept that you have to plan to win and prepare to win before you can expect to win is simple, but simple doesn’t mean it’s necessarily easy, and when you dig a little deeper, you understand just how profound it really is.

- “You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond to what happens to you.” ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=210))

- “I have had problems when I have had money, and I have had problems when I haven’t had money, and I have discovered that if you are going to have problems, it’s better if you have money!” ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=225))
- “You are who you are and what you are because of what has gone into your mind. You can change who you are and what you are by changing what goes into your mind.” ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=230))

- “You were born to win, but to be the winner you were born to be, you have to plan to win and prepare to win. Then and only then can you expect to win.” ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=287))
- More often than not, too many people give up when they get more resistance than they bargained for. Things just seem to get a lot tougher and more difficult than they are willing to deal with. If they fail to persevere through those times, they will fail permanently! If you don’t finish something, it ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=466))
- won’t be complete, and until something is completed, it isn’t finished. Much about success is just the result of simply the ability to follow up, follow through, and finish what we started. You’re not beaten by being knocked down. You’re only beaten if you stay down. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=468))
- they become words. • Watch your words; they become actions. • Watch your actions; they become habits. • Watch your habits; they become character. • Watch your character; for it becomes your destiny! ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=631))
- Integrity has been described as “doing the right thing when nobody is looking.” ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ZG5THW&location=684))
