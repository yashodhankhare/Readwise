## Highlights
- Out of 112 there must be a technique – more than one; one is absolutely certain, but my experience is that more than one will be applicable to every human being. And the easiest way is just to go through, read them, and any technique that suddenly strikes you “This is it!” – give it a try, at least for twenty-one days. If it starts working, then forget everything, other techniques. Go on working on it. It does not matter how many techniques you try. What matters is that you try one technique to its very end, to its ultimate depth. And if you succeed in one technique, then every other technique becomes very easy.

- The word tantra means technique, the method, the path. So it is not philosophical – note this. It is not concerned with intellectual problems and inquiries. It is not concerned with the “why” of things, it is concerned with “how”; not with what is truth, but how the truth can be attained. Tantra means technique. So this treatise is a scientific one. Science is not concerned with why, science is concerned with how. That is the basic difference between philosophy and science. Philosophy asks, “Why this existence?” Science asks, “How this existence?” The moment you ask the question, how?, method, technique, become important. Theories become meaningless; experience becomes the center. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=369))

- For Tantra, doing is knowing, and there is no other knowing. Unless you do something, unless you change, unless you have a different perspective to look at, to look with, unless you move in an altogether different dimension than the intellect, there is no answer. Answers can be given – they are all lies. All philosophies are lies. You ask a question and the philosophy gives you an answer. It satisfies you or doesn’t satisfy you. If it satisfies you, you become a convert to the philosophy, but you remain the same. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=400))

- If it doesn’t satisfy you, you go on searching for some other philosophy to be converted to. But you remain the same; you are not touched at all, you are not changed. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=403))

- Tantra will not give you the answer; Tantra will give you the technique to attain the answer. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=414))

- A disciple needs a womb-like receptivity. Whatsoever is received is not to be gathered as dead knowledge. It must grow in you; it must become blood and bones in you. It must become a part, now. It must grow! This growth will change you, will transform you – the receiver. That is why Tantra uses this device. Every treatise starts with Devi asking a question and Shiva replying to it. Devi is Shiva’s consort, his feminine part. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=433))

- That is why Tantra is written in love language. Something must also be understood about love language. There are two types of language: logical language and love language. There are basic differences between the two. Logical language is aggressive, argumentative, violent. If I use logical language I become aggressive upon your mind. I try to convince you, to convert you, to make a puppet of you. My argument is “right” and you are “wrong.” Logical language is egocentric: “I am right and you are wrong, so I must prove that I am right and you are wrong.” I am not concerned with you, I am concerned with my ego. My ego is always “right.” Love language is totally different. I am not concerned with my ego; I am concerned with you. I am not concerned to prove something, to strengthen my ego. I am concerned to help you. It is a compassion to help you to grow, to help you to transform, to help you to be reborn. Secondly, logic will always be intellectual. Concepts and principles will be significant, arguments will be significant. With love language what is said is not so significant; rather, it is the way it is said. The container, the word is not important; the content, the message is more important. It is a heart-to-heart talk, not a mind-to-mind discussion. It is not a debate, it is a communion.

- Thirdly, the very words Vigyan Bhairav Tantra mean the technique of going beyond consciousness. Vigyan means consciousness, bhairav means the state which is beyond consciousness, and tantra means the method: the method of going beyond consciousness. This is the supreme doctrine – without any doctrine. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=468))

- We know ourselves only through others, and the others can only know the outer form. That is why we become identified with it. Another Zen mystic, Hui-Hai used to say to his disciples, “When you have lost your head meditating, come immediately to me. When you lose your head, come immediately to me. When you begin to feel there is no head, do not be afraid; come immediately to me. This is the right moment. Now something can be taught to you.” With a head, no teaching is possible. The head always comes in between. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=526))

- But how can the doubts be cleared? Will any answer do? Is there any answer which will clear your doubts? Mind IS the doubt. It is not that the mind doubts, mind is the doubt! Unless the mind dissolves, doubts cannot be cleared. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=591))

- Encounter these methods with a fresh mind – with alertness, of course, but not with argumentation. And do not create the fallacy that an argumentative mind is an alert mind. It is not, because the moment you move into arguments you have lost the awareness, you have lost the alertness. Then you are not here. These methods do not belong to any religion. Remember, they are not Hindu, just as the theory of relativity is not Jewish because Einstein conceived it. And radio and television are not Christian. No one says, “Why are you using electricity? This is Christian, because a Christian mind conceived it.” Science does not belong to races and religions – and Tantra is a science. So remember, this is not Hindu at all. These techniques were conceived by Hindus, but these techniques are not Hindu. That is why these techniques will not mention any religious ritual. No temple is needed. You are quite enough of a temple yourself. You are the lab; the whole experiment is to go on within you. No belief is needed. This is not religion, this is science. No belief is needed. It is not required to believe in the Koran or the Vedas or in Buddha or in Mahavira. No, no belief is needed. Only a daringness to experiment is enough, courage to experiment is enough; that is the beauty. A Mohammedan can practice and he will reach to the deeper meanings of the Koran. A Hindu can practice and he will for the first time know what the Vedas are. And a Jaina can practice and a Buddhist can practice; they need not leave their religion. Tantra will fulfill them, wherever they are. Tantra will be helpful, whatsoever their chosen path. So remember this, Tantra is pure science. You may be a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Parsi or whatsoever – Tantra doesn’t touch your religion at all. Tantra says that religion is a social affair. So belong to any religion; it is irrelevant. But you can transform yourself, and that transformation needs a scientific methodology. When you are ill, when you have fallen ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=602))

- ill or you have caught tuberculosis or anything, then whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan makes no difference. The tuberculosis remains indifferent to your Hinduism, to your Mohammedanism, to your beliefs – political, social or religious. Tuberculosis has to be treated scientifically. There is no Hindu tuberculosis, no Mohammedan tuberculosis. You are ignorant, you are in conflict, you are asleep. This is a disease, a spiritual disease. This disease has to be treated by the Tantra. You are irrelevant, your beliefs are irrelevant. It is just a coincidence that you are born somewhere and someone else is born somewhere else. This is just a coincidence. Your religion is a coincidence, so do not cling to it. Use some scientific methods to transform yourself.

- So Tantra was not understood; Tantra was misunderstood. It was so deep and so high that this was natural. Secondly, because Tantra moves beyond duality, the very standpoint is amoral. Please understand this word: moral, immoral, amoral. We understand morality, we understand immorality, but it becomes difficult if something is amoral – beyond both. Tantra is amoral. Look at it in this way…. A medicine is amoral; it is neither moral nor immoral. If you give it to a thief it will help; if you give it to a saint it will help. It will make no differentiation between a thief and a saint. The medicine cannot say, “This is a thief so I am going to kill him, and this is a saint so I am going to help him.” A medicine is a scientific thing. Your being a thief or being a saint is irrelevant. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=631))

- Tantra is amoral. Tantra says, no morality is needed – no particular morality is needed. On the contrary, you are immoral because you have a very disturbed mind. So Tantra cannot make a precondition, that first you become moral and then you can practice Tantra. Tantra says, this is absurd. Someone is ill, feverish, and the doctor comes and says, “First bring down your fever; first be quite healthy. Only then can I give you the medicine.” This is what is happening. One thief comes to a saint and he says, “I am a thief. Tell me how to meditate.” The saint says, “First leave your profession. How can you meditate if you remain a thief?” One alcoholic comes and he says, “I am an alcoholic. How can I meditate?” The saint says, “The first condition is, leave alcohol, only then can you meditate.” The conditions become suicidal. The man is alcoholic or a thief or immoral because he has a disturbed mind, an ill mind. These are the effects, the consequences of the diseased mind, and he is told, “First be well and then you can meditate.” But then who needs meditation? Meditation is medicinal. It is a medicine. Tantra is amoral. It doesn’t ask you who you are. Your being a man is enough. Wherever you are, whatsoever you are, you are accepted. Choose a technique which fits you, put your total energy into it, and you will not be the same again. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=637))

- Tantra gives you scientific techniques for changing the mind, and once the mind is different your character will be different. Once the basis of your structure changes, your whole edifice will be different. Because of this amoral attitude, Tantra could not be tolerated by your so-called saints, they all went against it – because if Tantra succeeds, then all this nonsense which goes on in the name of religion will have to stop. See this: Christianity fought very much against scientific progress. Why? Only because if scientific progress is there in the material world, then the time is not very far off when in the psychological and in the spiritual world also science will penetrate. So Christianity started fighting scientific progress, because once you know that you can change matter through technique, the time is not very far off when you will come to know that you can change mind through techniques – because mind is nothing but subtle matter. This is Tantra’s proposition, that mind is nothing but subtle matter; it can be changed. And once you have a different mind you have a different world, because you look through the mind. The world you are seeing, you are seeing because of a particular mind. Change the mind, and when you look there is a different world. And if there is no mind… that is the ultimate for Tantra, to bring about a state where there is no mind. Then look at the world without a mediator. When the mediator is not, you are encountering the real, because now no one is between you and the real. Then nothing can be distorted. So Tantra says that when there is no mind, that is the state of a Bhairava – a no-mind state. For the first time you look at the world, at that which is. If you have a mind, you go on creating a world; you go on imposing, projecting. So first change the mind, then change from mind to no-mind. And these one hundred and twelve methods can help each and everyone. Any particular method may not be of use to you. That is why Shiva goes on relating many methods. Choose any one method which suits you. It is not difficult to know which suits you. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=674))

- Really, when you try the right method it clicks immediately. So I will go on talking about methods here every day. You try them. Just play with them – go home and try. The right method, whenever you happen upon it, just clicks. Something explodes in you, and you know that “This is the right method for me.” But effort is needed, and you may be surprised that suddenly one day one method has gripped you. So while I am talking here, parallel to it go on playing with these methods. I say playing because you should not be too serious. Just play! Something may fit you. If it fits you, then be serious, and then go deep into it – intensely, honestly, with all your energy, with all your mind. But before that just play. I have found that while you are playing your mind is more open. While you are serious your mind is not so open; it is closed. So just play. Do not be too serious, ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=691))

- just play. And these methods are simple, you can just play with them. Take one method and play with it for at least three days. If it gives you a certain feeling of affinity, if it gives you a certain feeling of well-being, if it gives you a certain feeling that this is for you, then be serious about it. Then forget the others, do not play with other methods. Stick to it – at least for three months. Miracles are possible. The only thing is that the technique must be for you. If the technique is not for you, then nothing happens. Then you may go on with it for lives together, but nothing will happen. If the method is for you then even three minutes are enough. So these one hundred and twelve methods can be a miraculous experience for you, or they may just be a listening – it depends on you. I will go on describing each method from as many angles as possible. If you feel any affinity with it, play with it for three days. If you feel that it fits, that something clicks in you, continue it for three months. Life is a miracle. If you have not known its mystery, that only… ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=697))

- Then forget spirituality and be happy. Then it is not for you. But these one hundred and twelve methods are for the whole humanity – for all the ages that have passed and for all the ages that have yet to come. In no time has there ever been a single man, and there will never be one, who can say, “These one hundred and twelve methods are all useless for me.” Impossible! This is impossible! Every type of mind has been taken into account. Every possible type of mind has been given a technique in Tantra. There are many techniques for which no man exists yet; they are for the future. There are many techniques for… ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008258U6G&location=707))
