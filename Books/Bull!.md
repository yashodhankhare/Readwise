- As the market slithered south, Henry Blodget became the poster boy for all that had gone wrong. “Even 60 Minutes did a story about me,” Blodget recalled in a 2001 interview. “I couldn’t watch. I hid in the next room, and my wife would come in during the commercials and tell me what they were saying about me.” ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=193))

- Blodget shook his head. “If only I had read that book at the beginning of 2000. It would have been worth a million dollars to me then.” For in his history of financial manias, Galbraith had predicted Blodget’s fate: “The [public’s] anger will fix upon the individuals who were previously most admired for their financial imagination and acuity.”9 ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=228))

- term gyrations. Instead, it focuses on longer trends—cycles that can last for years. Each cycle is the peculiar product of a particular moment in economic and political history, but in Dow’s view the force behind each go-round was the same: human nature. Most descriptions of investor psychology reduce human behavior to a series of simple knee-jerk reactions: rampant greed followed by blind fear. Charles Dow sketched something subtler in The Wall Street Journal editorials that he wrote between 1899 and 1902. He recognized that investors do not rush into a bull market, and when it ends they do not swoon in surrender to the bear. Both bull and bear cycles begin slowly, he observed, because “[t]here is always a disposition in people’s minds to think the existing conditions will be permanent. When the market is down and dull, it is hard to make people believe that this is the prelude to a period of activity and advance. When prices are up and the country is prosperous,” Dow added, “it is always said that while preceding booms have not lasted…[this time there are] ‘unique circumstances’ [which will make prosperity permanent].”3 Because human beings are slow to embrace change, these cycles can run a decade, or longer. In fact, as Gail Dudack, chief market strategist at SunGard Institutional Brokerage, shows in the table below, the history of the S&P 500 from 1882 through 1999 can be broken down into alternating “strong” and “weak” cycles that average nearly 15 years. During the booms, investors who plowed their dividends back into their portfolios reaped returns averaging nearly 18 percent a year—even after adjusting for inflation. During the dry spells, by contrast, average “real” (inflation-adjusted) total returns dropped to less than 2 percent. Without dividends, investors lost nearly 3 percent a year. In the final third of the twentieth century, the market’s returns fit the pattern with ruthless precision: from January 1967 through December 1982, investors averaged 0.2 percent annually—and that was if they reinvested their dividends. Those who became discouraged and stopped plowing their dividends back into the market lost an average of nearly 4 percent a year—year after year, for 16 years. Finally, in 1982, the cycle turned: from January 1983 through December 1999, real returns averaged 12.1 percent. If an investor reinvested his dividends, he was rewarded with annual returns of 15.7 percent. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=260))

- “Few investors realize how much dividends have contributed to the stock market’s performance,” Dudack observed. “Nor does the public realize that in this century, there have been three separate periods, ranging from 16 to 20 years, when inflation-adjusted capital gains on the S&P have been negative.”4 Inevitably, any attempt to break the past down into cycles involves choosing beginning and ending points that are, to some degree, arbitrary. Others might well divide the market’s cycles somewhat differently. But virtually every market historian agrees on the larger picture: the history of the market is a story of bull… ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=279))

- In other words, as James Grant, editor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, put it in 1996, “The stock market is not the kind of game in which one party loses what another wins. It is the kind of game in which, over certain periods of time, nearly everyone may win, or nearly everyone may lose.”5 The story of the Great Bull Market of 1982–99 needs to be understood in this context.

- What Acampora had learned is that when a strong cycle is peaking, skeptics are shunned. This is part of the process John Kenneth Galbraith outlined in A Short History of Financial Euphoria—the book that Henry Blodget finally read in 2001. A bubble, Galbraith observed, is always supported by the belief that there is something new in the world. The history of past cycles is dismissed as irrelevant. “For practical purposes,” Galbraith wrote, “the financial memory should be assumed to last, at a maximum, no more than twenty years. This is normally the time it takes for the recollection of one disaster to be erased and for some variant on previous dementia to come forward to capture the financial mind. It is also the time generally required for a new generation to come on the scene, impressed, as had been its predecessors, with its own innovative genius.”22 During the period of delirious forgetfulness, no one wishes to think that his good fortune is fortuitous or undeserved. Everyone prefers to believe that it is the result of his own superior insight into the market. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=404))

- So, even after it became clear to the vast majority of investors that the Great Bull Market of 1982–99 had ended, mutual fund investors stood firm. The mass redemptions from equity funds that many had predicted never took place. As late as March 2003, Gail Dudack observed: “Net redemptions since the beginning of 2002 have been tiny compared with total stock fund assets. The net cash outflow in the 12 months ending March 30, 2003, amounted to 3.6 percent of the sector’s assets. Usually, before a new cycle begins, outflows are much greater—as high as 8 percent a year. You need cash to fuel a new cycle,” Dudack explained. “Until you get the sell-off that creates liquidity, a new cycle can’t begin.”28 (See chart “Mutual Fund Investors Hang On,” Appendix, page 462.) “People have talked about how steadfast the individual investor has been. But I think it’s been more paralysis than steadfastness,” added Don Phillips, managing director of Morningstar Inc., the Chicago firm that tracks mutual funds.29 Investors offered various reasons for holding on: “Everything I own has gone down too much—I can’t sell now,” confided one 401(k) investor. “The market is coming back—this is a buying opportunity,” said another. Ironically, these are the very responses that fuel bear market rallies, making it dangerously difficult to tell when a market has finally scraped bottom. If investors simply bowed their heads and accepted defeat, bear markets would last no more than a few months. Everyone would sell, and that would be that. But human nature, once again, intervenes. Men resist disaster. This is why even the “Great Crash” of 1929 did not happen in a day, a month, or a year. True, in the fall of 1929, the Dow plunged from a September peak of 381 to a low, on November 13, of 199. But the following spring the market seemed to recover. By April of 1930, the Dow had climbed to 294—up 48 percent. The bear was playing possum. The low of November 1929 was a false bottom, the rally of 1930 a sucker rally. In 1930 the bear trap sprang shut. From April of 1930 through July of 1932, the market lost 86 percent of its value. What is commonly called the “Crash of ’29” was in fact the crash of 1930–32: that is when the wealth of Gatsby’s gilded world was destroyed. It seems that a new market cannot begin until the last bull’s heart has been broken, and typically, it takes more than one crash to do the job. The pattern was repeated at the end of the sixties, when the Dow fell to 631 in May of 1970, rallied to over 1050 in January of 1973, and then took a final, fatal nosedive that ended with the crash of 1973–74. Only then did investors learn not to buy on dips. It would be another eight years before a new bull market began. What precisely does this mean for the years ahead? No one knows. But since both human nature and the laws of supply and demand remain more or less constant, there is good reason to expect that past cycles might forecast, at least in broad brush strokes, the shape… ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=467))

- Newsweek’s Jane Bryant Quinn was one of a handful of observers who paused to examine the idea of “the long term,” pointing out that the much-touted 11 percent average did not predict what would happen during a specific 10-year period. Rather, it reflected the average annual return if you averaged together all of the 10-year periods from 1926 to 1998. Since few investors buy and hold for 72 years, the truism had little practical meaning. During any particular 10-year period from 1926 to 1998, it turns out that an investor’s chance of averaging more than 10 percent a year was only about 50/50. Contrary to the popular wisdom, he stood a 4 percent chance of making nothing over 10 years—and losing some of his principal to boot. Everything depended on when he got in. And when he got out.

- Yet the mutual fund industry was inclined to embrace the “buy and hold” philosophy without complication in part because many in the industry believed it, in part because the strategy dovetailed so nicely with its own business plan. By the early nineties, “asset accumulation” was fast becoming the industry’s rallying cry. From Boston to San Francisco, marketing a fund became just as important as managing the money. “Suddenly, at many institutions, you started hearing about ‘asset gathering’—bringing new money into the company. Hell, I thought we were in the business of making money for our existing clients,” said Clyde McGregor, manager of The Oakmark Equity & Income Fund.9 But Oakmark, an independent, old-fashioned firm that emphasized value investing, was out of step. The mutual fund business was exploding, and most fees were based on a percentage of the assets a company had under management, or the number of funds that it distributed, not how well it did in protecting those assets. Once a company had an investor’s money, it quite naturally wanted to keep it. Besides, if customers withdrew their money every time a fund floundered, it would become all the more difficult to give new funds and new fund managers enough time to prove their mettle. “Buy and hold” made sense for everyone. Or so it seemed. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=603))

- The received wisdom has it that Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett built his fortune by buying good companies and holding them long term. If it were that simple, there would have been many more beatified, balding billionaires residing on the Western Plains at the end of the 20th century. In truth, patience was only half of Buffett’s secret. An ace market timer, Buffett knew when to hold and when to fold. Granted, he usually held stocks for long periods of time, but he also realized that the stock market was not always the safest place for an investor to stash his savings. Like Richard Russell or Charles Dow, the Sage of Omaha understood that equity markets, like all other markets, are cyclical, and there can be long stretches of time when a prudent investor should get out—and stay out. And in May of 1969, that is exactly what Warren Buffett did. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=808))

- BUFFETT TAP-DANCES (1973–74) Warren Buffett had not been seduced by the rallies that followed his exit in May of 1969. From 1969 through 1973, while the bear played with investors’ hopes, Buffett hibernated. Nor was he tempted by the Nifty Fifty. As a value investor, committed to “buying low and selling high,” Buffett understood that everything depends on the price you pay when you get in. In that sense, any value investor is a market timer: at the end of a cycle, when prices are highest, he stops buying. And in Buffett’s view, in the early seventies prices still were exorbitant.

- It was not until 1973, when the Dow went into free-fall, that the market once again commanded Buffett’s attention. As he told Forbes late in 1974: “All day you wait for the pitch you like; then when the fielders are asleep, you step up and hit it.”19 Buffett’s timing was all but perfect. Of course, one could say that when Buffett abandoned the market in 1969, he was “early.” After all, if he had hung on, he could have ridden the Dow to the very top: 1071 in January of 1973. But Warren Buffett was not concerned about catching the top of the wave. He was far more interested in not wiping out. While most investors are motivated by a desire to make money, Buffett focused first on not losing money. In that way, Buffett behaved like Old Money. The majority of investors agonize over the prospect of getting out too early and missing out on the profits that would have made them rich. But the very rich don’t fret so much about making money. They have money. Their greatest fear is losing it. This explains why, when the bidding escalates—whether in a stock market, a “hot” real estate market, or at a Sotheby’s auction—Old Money tends to step aside, letting New Money carry the day.

- From his perch at Merrill Lynch, Bob Farrell watched investors gradually give up. “A downturn normally has two stages, and investor sentiment goes through two fairly predictable phases,” said Farrell. “First there’s the guillotine stage—the sharp decline. That creates fear. That’s what happened in 1974. Then, the second stage goes more slowly—there’s the feeling of being sandpapered to death. The investor is whipsawed by a choppy market, and then worn down gradually. In place of fear come feelings of apathy, lack of interest, and finally, hopelessness. That is what happened for the rest of the seventies.” A few nimble stock-pickers made money. “But, except for a very few stocks that benefited from inflation—oil service companies, for example—it was not a buy-and-hold market,” said Farrell. “You learned to take your profits when you had them.”24 Most investors who succeeded in the seventies did it by abandoning U.S. stocks and bonds for other types of investments. Gold, for instance, rose by an astounding 19.4 percent a year from 1968 to 1979; diamonds climbed 11.8 percent annually, while real estate became the favorite inflation hedge among small investors, with the price of single-family homes rising 9.6 percent. Shrewd investors who were in the right place at the right time made money in oil stocks—over the course of the decade oil rose 34.7 percent a year. Foreign shares also offered double-digit returns, with the European Australian and Far East Index (EAFE) averaging more than 12 percent a year from the fall of 1970 through the fall of 1980.25 ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=992))

The August rally caught everyone’s attention—still, many asked, “Is it just another bear trap?” Some labeled the flurry “panic buying” by fund managers afraid of being sacked if they missed the summer surge.

After defeating Rommel in the Battle of Alamein, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was ready to go on the offensive. “But first,” Biggs recalled, “he had to replace his most senior officers: the officers who for so many long years had fought so bravely in rear-guard actions, retreating, containing the damage, conserving their force against…a superior enemy, by 1943 they had the wrong instincts trained into them for successful offensive action.

- Ironically, it was inflation—the bête noire of the seventies—that inspired the takeover boom of the eighties. While share prices stagnated, inflation boosted the replacement cost of many a corporation’s real assets. The land it sat on, the factories it owned, the machinery it used all became more valuable. But at the end of a 16-year bear market, share prices did not reflect the hidden value of corporate America’s underlying assets. As early as the late seventies, shrewd investors spied a gap between what the market was willing to pay for a company’s shares, and the value of its assets if that same corporation was acquired and dismembered, its assets sold off one by one. At the same time, corporations interested in expanding recognized that it would be cheaper to acquire a competitor rather than to buy the real estate and equipment needed to enlarge its own operation.12 ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=1113))

- In order to raise the cash for mergers, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts, corporations issued debt. But interest rates were still steep—even in 1985, 30-year government bonds continued to pay 10 percent. In order to tempt investors, corporations had to offer high yields. Drexel Burnham Lambert’s Michael Milken, king of the high-yield “junk” bond, was happy to be of service, and by the mid-eighties, junk bonds were driving the takeover market.13 Junk bonds offered investors of the late eighties what they craved: double-digit returns. In return, investors accepted a higher risk that the borrower would default on the loan. Typically, junk bonds were rated “BB” or below, and offered little or no real collateral to back up the loan—no real estate, no equipment, no land. Instead, the borrower pledged to pay junk bond investors dividends as high as 14 percent out of future cash flow. Junk bonds were used to raise the cash needed for leveraged buyouts—or LBOs. In a classic LBO, insiders, rather than outsiders, took over a corporation. Top executives found a small group of investors with deep pockets, and together they borrowed heavily to buy up the company’s shares. When the deal was done, the company’s stock had disappeared from the public market: this is what it meant to say that the company had “gone private.” The process transformed the capital structure of corporate America. In the past, just about the only respectable mission for a CEO was to expand. The 1980s introduced a new and radically different goal: shrinking equity while increasing debt. As the new management sold assets and repurchased shares, the equity portion of the total might shrink from 50 percent to a closely held 5 percent (owned by the manager/owners and a select cadre of investors who had helped finance the LBO). Meanwhile, debt exploded.14 In theory the debt would serve as a spur, goading the managers to slash costs and generate cash in order to keep up with steep interest payments. In other words, they would be motivated by fear. (In the nineties stock options would be hailed as the new “incentive” needed to motivate top management. Why handsomely paid executives needed an incentive to persuade them to do their jobs—in either decade—was never explained.)

But behind the deals stood the insatiable egos of the dealmakers. “Hoisted onto the auction block, the company became a vast prism through which scores of Wall Streeters beheld their reflected glories,” wrote Bryan Burrough and John Helyar in Barbarians at the Gate, a narrative that captures the grandiose madness of the era.16 ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=1142))

For Wall Street’s masters of the universe, the period from 1982 to 1987 marked an era of getting and spending, but relatively few shared in the bounty. From 1981 through the end of 1985, the New York Stock Exchange estimated, the number of individual investors increased by just 6 million.29 Over the same span, some 10.8 million Americans lost their jobs in plant closings and layoffs while corporate restructuring and mergers eliminated an estimated 600,000 management positions.30 ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=1249))

- In many ways, Wall Street’s surge seemed strangely self-contained. Although share prices rose by more than 200 percent, national output increased barely 40 percent before inflation—and only 20 percent after inflation was taken into account. And while companies used their cash and credit to buy back stock, capital spending, adjusted for inflation, increased only modestly. “The stock market strikes me as being all by itself,” said Charles P. Kindleberger, who was then emeritus professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “There is no real industrial investment boom behind it.

- Granted, mutual fund ownership grew fivefold in the eighties, but for the majority of investors, “mutual funds” were not yet synonymous with equities. Most preferred fixed-income funds that invested in money markets or bonds. In 1983, Peter Lynch’s Fidelity Magellan fund returned 39 percent, sealing its 10-year record as the best fund in America, but despite Fidelity’s best efforts, mutual fund investors continued to choose dividends over capital gains. In 1986, Americans bought only $28 billion of equity funds—roughly one-fourth of the $120 billion that they poured into bond funds.33 In fact, from the middle of 1983 through October of 1987, there were just two months when more money flowed into stock funds than into bond funds—April 1987 and August 1987.34 Unfortunately, those two banner months came on the eve of the bloodiest one-day crash in U.S. stock market history.

- Greenspan won the job first and foremost because he was a Republican. His predecessor, Paul Volcker, was “a known Democrat” in the words of James Baker III, the Texas lawyer who served first as President Reagan’s chief of staff, then as secretary of the Treasury. Baker lobbied hard to replace Volcker. He wanted a Fed chairman who shared the administration’s politics, but even more he wanted a Fed chairman who would cut interest rates. Volcker would go down in history as the Fed chairman who finally broke the back of the double-digit inflation that strangled the seventies, but he had done it in the only, painful, way it could be done: by raising interest rates. Finally, in 1987, Baker managed to engineer Volcker’s retirement. “We got the son of a bitch,” he told a friend in New York. “Baker was convinced that Greenspan was the person they needed at the Fed—a team player,” political reporter Bob Woodward observed.34 On August 18, 1987, Alan Greenspan chaired his first Federal Reserve meeting. After several hours of roundtable discussion, Greenspan addressed the board: “We spent all morning, and no one even mentioned the stock market—which I find interesting in itself,” he remarked.35 With that one statement, Greenspan, however unwittingly, set the tone for Fed policy in the nineties. Wall Street, not Main Street, was now the center of the economy. Greenspan, after all, was from New York, not Washington. From his perspective, the seat of the nation’s prosperity lay in lower Manhattan. And during his tenure as Fed chairman, a roaring bull market would convert much of the nation to a New Yorker’s view of the world. But in August of 1987, Greenspan was concerned that the center would not hold. Like many experienced observers, he realized that the stock market was overvalued. Worried that financial euphoria would lead to inflation, he persuaded the Fed board to do exactly the opposite of what Baker had envisioned. One month before the October 1987 crash, the Federal Reserve voted to boost the discount rate—the rate that the Fed charges banks for overnight loans—a full half percent, to 6 percent. By making it more expensive to borrow, Greenspan hoped to slow the economy. But central bankers have ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=1812))

- limited powers: he could not forestall Black Monday. Still, he did his best to restore confidence. The day after the crash, the Federal Reserve flooded the markets with liquidity—though, in retrospect, some observers would suggest that the Fed’s response may have set investors up for the high-stakes game of the nineties. “The lingering effect of the Fed’s timely intervention was to leave investors believing that the markets were less risky than [they really are],” observed Leon Levy, cofounder of the Oppenheimer Funds. “The crash itself was written off as the result of a one-time and unforeseen catastrophe caused by computer selling.”36 The efficient market theory remained intact. But if Greenspan helped sweep the lessons of ’87 under the rug, he did not stop worrying about inflation. As part of his campaign to make sure that inflation was truly dead, he continued to jack up short-term rates, lifting them from 6.5 percent in March 1988 and to almost 10 percent a year later. When the Fed chairman had finished the task, inflation was no longer a threat—if it ever had been. Some economists would say that although the memory of a rising consumer price index still haunted the economy, an era of disinflation already had begun. Over the next decade, consumers could no longer assume that the price of a new car would rise every year. Prices of many items would fall. But it would be a long time before Americans would stop looking over their shoulders for the ghost of inflation—another example of how long it takes human beings to realize that they are in a new economic cycle. What is certain is that by 1989, the economy was no longer in danger of pirouetting out of control. To the contrary, when George Bush came to the White House in January, he inherited an economy on the verge of a swoon. Greenspan recognized the need for stimulus, and in the spring of 1989, he reversed direction and began cutting interest rates, making it cheaper to borrow money. From 1989 to 1992, the Fed chairman trimmed short-term rates as if he were slicing sushi: swiftly, neatly, methodically—some 24 consecutive times. In the space of three years, overnight rates fell from 8 percent to 3 percent, the lowest rate since the sixties.37 Was 24 rate cuts overdoing it? During this time Greenspan pumped cash into the economy, buying Treasuries with Federal Reserve money. Before long the market was awash in cash. As the Fed poured money into the system, it raised the nation’s immediate cash supply by over 12 percent in one year—the fastest one-year growth in history. It was Greenspan’s great good luck, observed Fed watcher Martin Mayer, that the people with that extra cash bought stock rather than goods and services. If they had poured the money into new cars, furniture, and clothes, inflation might have heated up. But “instead of consumer price inflation, the United States got asset price inflation”: stock prices rose.38 Asset inflation seemed, to many, benign—at least at the time.

- As for Greenspan himself, he had set a precedent for his tenure as Fed chairman: from now on, he would be the guy who rode to the rescue. So much for his laissez-faire philosophy. When he cut rates 24 times from 1989 to 1992, Greenspan established a pattern. In times of financial crisis, he could be counted on to pump liquidity into the financial system, providing enough cash—and, more important, enough confidence—to assure those who ran the system that they could backstroke their way out of almost any fiscal problem. At least that is what many believed. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=1887))

It was like playing the horses. As a result, she was humble before the market: “If a stock goes up, it’s not because I’m a whiz,” she said, “and if it goes against me, I don’t stick around. I tried to follow the advice given by Investor Business Daily’s editor—‘sell when it’s down 7 percent.’ The Wall Street Journal never told you that,” she added. In general, Sauerwein learned to take the advice served up by financial journalists with a grain of salt: “Whenever I bought anything that Money magazine recommended, I lost money.” ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2109))

- Of course, in the nineties, the small investor had far more information at his fingertips than his counterpart in the twenties. But bits and bytes of information can be more dangerous than ignorance. Or, as Malcolm “Steve” Forbes Jr., heir to the Forbes publishing dynasty, once confessed, “My grandfather told me you make more selling information than you do following it. So let that be a warning.”16 Later in the decade, 401(k) investors who had been burned by bad information would realize that the traditional pension had offered one major advantage: no matter how well or how badly the market did, the pension promised a check for life. Still, the guaranteed pension checks were usually quite small. And while a small paycheck is certainly better than no paycheck, inflation could easily turn a fixed payment into a pittance, as so many retirees learned in the seventies. Unlike Social Security benefits, pension payments were not adjusted for inflation. By contrast, if a 401(k) investor stashed his savings in stocks, he could keep up with inflation—or at least that was what he was told.

- That this had not been the case in the seventies was largely ignored. From 1971 to 1981, inflation averaged 8.3 percent a year, while the total return from equities, even after reinvesting dividends, was just 5.8 percent: in other words, an investor who had entrusted his nest egg to stocks lost an average of 2.5 percent a year, year after year. Over the next 10 years, however, the S&P 500 whipped inflation. By 1991, real (inflation-adjusted) total returns had averaged 13.7 percent a year for a decade.17 Understandably, small investors wanted a piece of the action—and they were beginning to suspect that the pros running their pension funds lacked the nerve to ride a bull.

- Still, by 2003 it was apparent old-fashioned pensions offered many employees better protection than a 401(k). For one, under the traditional pension system, an investor’s exposure to his own company’s stock was limited. Federal law made it illegal for an employer to invest more than one-tenth of the pension’s assets in company stock on the grounds that if both an employee’s livelihood and his savings pivoted on his company’s financial health, he would be carrying too many eggs in one basket. But the law did not shield 401(k) investors—by 2001, the average 401(k) would have nearly 40 percent of its assets tangled in company stock.21 Moreover, 401(k)s were not insured. By contrast, in 2003 the federal government guaranteed old-fashioned pensions up to $3,600 a month.22 In 1991, the advantages of the 401(k) for both employer and employee had seemed clear. Twelve years later, observers began to ask: Was the 401(k) really such a boon for employees? The answer would vary widely, depending on who you were, how much your employer contributed to your account, whether he made his contribution in cash or stock, whether you took profits as stocks spiraled—and, above all, how early you got into the bull market of 1982–99.

- But in the early nineties neither Wall Street nor the mutual fund industry had much incentive to urge investors to discover the peace of mind that might come with owning Treasuries. “Wall Street makes far more money if people buy stocks rather than bonds,” said Bill Gross, chairman of Pimco, a fund company that specializes in bond funds. For one, an investor who is holding a bond to maturity is not trading in and out of the market. To generate fees, Wall Street needs trades. Secondly, “To sell a product profitably, you need glamour and you need sizzle,” added Gross, who, by the late nineties, was generally recognized as the Peter Lynch of bonds. “There is glamour and sizzle in a stock with a potential growth story that bonds simply lack. That is what allows the equity people to charge more.

- In recent years, stock options packages had become an increasingly popular component of executive pay. These options gave insiders the opportunity (literally the option) to buy their companies’ stocks at a fixed price—usually the current market price—over a fixed period of time. For example, if a company’s shares were trading at $10, a chief executive officer might be given the right to purchase 100,000 shares at $10 sometime over the next 10 years. Typically, he would be required to wait a few years before exercising his options, but in a bull market the delay would work to his advantage: he could expect the stock to be trading well above $10 by the time he exercised his right to buy the shares. By then, the stock might well have climbed to $30, and after making the purchase at $10, he could turn around and sell the shares at $30, pocketing the difference. Senator Levin’s research told him that at the nation’s largest corporations, stock options were becoming the preferred form of executive compensation. A year earlier, a Fortune magazine survey of 200 of the nation’s largest corporations revealed that in 1991, newly granted options accounted for roughly half of the $2.4 million that the average CEO earned.2 Nevertheless, the cost of stock options remained hidden. Unlike cash bonuses, options did not have to be shown as an expense, and subtracted from corporate profits. After all, corporate lobbyists liked to explain, when a company gave an executive stock options, no cash changed hands. The options were free. Yet—and this was a contradiction no one seemed able to explain—corporations were allowed to deduct the “cost” of these options as an “expense” on their corporate income taxes.3 In other words, when the company reported to shareholders, it claimed that options cost nothing; but when the same company talked to the tax man, it subtracted the cost of those supposedly “free” options from its earnings. Levin knew that the IRS was getting the true story: options did carry a very real cost, and it came directly from shareholders’ pockets. Unlike many investors, Senator Levin understood that when insiders exercise their stock options, the new stock issued adds to the number of shares outstanding, undermining the value of the ordinary stockholders’ shares. Imagine, for example, that a company has 9 million shares outstanding: a shareholder who owns 1 million shares owns one-ninth of the company. Then consider what happens if the company decides to give each of its top five executives 200,000 options. When they exercise those options, the company will have to issue 1 million new shares, bringing the total shares outstanding to 10 million. The companies’ profits now have to be split among 10 million shares—and the shareholder who owns 1 million shares will find that his or her slice of the earnings pie has been cut from one-ninth to one-tenth.

- F. Frist Jr., CEO and chairman of HCA (Hospital Corporation of America), hauled home $127 million, with the bulk of his compensation coming in the form of options. At Primerica, CEO Sandy Weill earned $67.6 million. Options accounted for 96 percent of the total. Meanwhile, Mirage Resorts’ casino king, Steve Wynn, cashed in 1 million stock options, raking in a profit of $23.3 million. Million-dollar windfalls had become the rule, not the exception. By 1993, Fortune’s survey of 200 of the nation’s largest corporations showed that average CEO compensation had jumped to $4.1 million, with options representing an ever-larger share of the total. In the even more elite group of Fortune 100 companies, 29 percent of CEO pay now came from options—up from 17 percent in 1987.4 As CEO salaries mounted, so did public outrage. In the early nineties, many questioned whether CEOs deserved such largesse. In 1991, for example, chief executives’ pay at the country’s 350 largest corporations climbed by 3.9 percent—even while corporate profits at the companies surveyed slid by about 15 percent.5 National Medical Enterprises (NME) CEO Richard K. Eamer stood out on the 1991 list. Eamer earned the bulk of the $17 million that he took home that year by exercising stock options. A year later, he resigned in the wake of a scandal involving allegedly fraudulent activity at NME’s psychiatric hospitals. Meanwhile, shareholders who, unlike Eamer, had not cashed out watched NME’s share price plummet by 60 percent.6 In ’92, U.S. Surgical’s Leon C. Hirsch followed Eamer’s example, turning a neat profit even while his company turned south. That year Hirsch netted $60.4 million by exercising options to buy his company’s stock for as little as $12.25 a share. He then bailed out, selling the shares at prices ranging from $65 to $120. Ordinary shareholders might well have envied Hirsch his good fortune: first, he was able to buy the shares well below market price, and then he managed to get out while U.S. Surgical was still riding high. By 1993, the company’s shares had tumbled to $30.7 PERVERSE INCENTIVES Eamer and Hirsch were able to scoop up their profits before their companies tanked because, although there is normally a waiting period before an executive is allowed to exercise his option to buy stock at a fixed price, there is no waiting period before he sells. An insider can exercise his option to buy, and then dump the shares the next day at the current market price, reaping huge gains. As a result, once the window has opened, an insider sitting on a pile of options has a perverse incentive to do whatever might be necessary to goose his company’s share price over the short term—even if that means sending it to unsustainable heights. A well-timed press release announcing a new acquisition can do the trick—even if the acquisition turns out to be a lemon. The stock needs to stay aloft just long enough for him to cash in—and cash out.

- But this was only one way that options programs could undermine the value of a long-term investor’s stake. As options grants grew, companies would try to offset the dilution by buying back their own shares: Award 10 million options to insiders, buy back 10 million shares, and the cost of options disappeared—or so it seemed. As the bull market spiraled, companies found themselves paying exorbitant prices for their own stock, using capital that could have been used to pay off debt, finance research—or pay dividends to shareholders. Normally, responsible management buys back its company’s stock only when it is a bargain. But as share prices climbed, fewer and fewer stocks were undervalued. Many were overvalued—particularly in the technology sector, where options were widely used. Yet to counter the effects of dilution, companies issuing generous stock options packages had no choice but to buy back shares, whatever the price.

- WARREN BUFFETT WEIGHS IN Levin began bravely: “I am not alone,” he declared. “There are many in the Senate as a matter of fact that concur with my view that we should not be reversing FASB.” As Levin knew, this was not quite true. When it came to options reform, he had few allies among his colleagues. Yet he did have one very strong ally outside of Congress: Warren Buffett. The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway stood foursquare in favor of FASB’s proposal. By 1993, Buffett was seen by many, not merely as a brilliant investor, but as one of the most ethical voices in the business community. Two years earlier, when Salomon Brothers was caught red-handed in a bond-trading scandal, and John Gutfreund, Salomon’s chairman, was driven out of the firm, Buffett was chosen to come in and clean house. Wall Street’s cynics called him “St. Warren of Omaha.” Nevertheless, when Buffett had finished, the battered bank was once again profitable. As for Buffett’s own company, Berkshire Hathaway, his style of value investing was flourishing: the previous year, investors lucky enough to own Berkshire watched the stock soar 70 percent. Meanwhile, Buffett’s own personal wealth had doubled. Three days before the subcommittee hearing, Forbes announced that Buffett was now the wealthiest person in the United States—unseating Microsoft’s Bill Gates. Admittedly, Buffett’s stand on options invited that special resentment reserved for billionaire preachers: just because he didn’t need options, why should he begrudge other CEOs the opportunity to make an extra million or two? But Buffett would demonstrate that he practiced what he preached. Four years later, when he bought General RE Corp., Buffett replaced the company’s options plan with a cash-based incentive program—which meant taking a $36 million charge against earnings. In making acquisitions, Buffett almost always chose to cancel the options plan—a costly decision, because it meant taking a hit to earnings. Sometimes the cost was so high it killed the deal.35 Unquestionably, Buffett was, as Levin observed, “a pretty powerful voice” on FASB’s side. But unfortunately, that voice would not be heard that morning. “He wanted to be here,” Levin noted, “but [the subcommittee hearing] couldn’t be arranged at a time when he was able to make it.” No one explained why the meeting could not be scheduled at a time when Buffett, one of the nation’s most respected and successful CEOs, could appear. Certainly, this leading capitalist’s opinion as to whether or not FASB’s reforms could “destroy capitalism” would be worth hearing. His reckoning as to how much stock options were costing shareholders would be of considerable interest. And without question, Buffett’s colorful presence and witty voice would have drawn the media, focusing public attention on what most viewed as a dry and dreary accounting issue. Perhaps those arranging the committee meeting were reluctant to let such a popular figure weigh in on FASB’s side of the fight.… ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2651))

- different from “call” options, which trade in the open market. Like employee stock options, these options give the investor the right to buy shares at a fixed price at some point in the future. The major difference, as Mary Barth, a Harvard accounting professor who supported FASB’s proposal, pointed out in her testimony, is that while the investor who buys a call option pays cash to acquire it, employees acquire options by providing services to their company. The options, then, are part of the employee’s compensation for those services. And companies routinely calculate the value of those options in order to explain total compensation to their executives.36 When an executive accepts stock options in place of a cash bonus, he knows that there is always the risk that the options will expire worthless. This is the same risk that an investor faces when he buys a call option. He does not know how much—or how little—it will be worth in the end. But he does know that even though a profit is not guaranteed, the chance to buy the stock at a fixed price has value. That is why he pays for it. To underline his point, Buffett issued a challenge “to any CEO who says that his newly issued options have little or no value…. I’ll make [him]an offer. On the day of issue, Berkshire will pay him or her a substantial sum for the right to any future gain he or she realizes on the option…. Intruth we have far more confidence in our ability to determine an appropriate price to pay for an option than we have in our ability to determine the proper depreciation for our corporate jet.” ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2698))

- Senator Carl Levin continued to stand his ground, but now Arthur Levitt backed down. Privately, Levitt remained convinced that FASB was correct. “Arguments otherwise did not sway me.” But “politics did,” he admitted eight years later. Levitt went to FASB and, behind closed doors, urged the private-sector accounting board to back off. “I warned them that, if they adopted the new standards, the SEC would not enforce it.” Levitt had pulled the rug out from under FASB. Without the SEC to implement the rule, there was no point in pressing forward. Not long after, FASB agreed to a toothless compromise that required only that companies disclose stock options grants in the footnotes to their financial statements. As long as executives were paid in options, and not in cash, the cost would not be shown as an expense. In a 2002 interview, Levitt explained his actions. “I was afraid that if FASB continued to fight, Congress might override their authority—and put FASB out of business. In restrospect, I was wrong,” he added. “In fact the country had begun to swing back to the center. I don’t believe that Congress could have overridden FASB. I misread the political climate.” ([Location 2785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2785))

- Nine years later, Levitt apologized to FASB. “In retrospect, I was wrong. I know the FASB would have stuck to its guns had I not pushed it to surrender. Out of a misguided belief that I was acting in the FASB’s best interests, I failed to support this courageous and beleaguered organization in its time of need, and may have opened the door to more meddling by powerful corporations and Congress. The last thing I wanted was to politicize FASB,” he added, “which can’t function if it must please every last CEO and deal with the whims of Washington lawmakers.”41 In the years that followed, Levitt would take a more proactive role in battles over corporate accounting. But as early as 1993, Wall Street needed to be reined in. Major corporations were already concealing expenses in order to inflate earnings. And everyone knew it. This is not to say that most congressmen at the hearing understood how the illusion that options cost nothing would corrupt both corporate management and corporate accounting. But just about everyone at that subcommittee hearing did understand—or should have—that options cost someone something, that the cost was not being reported on earnings statements—and that if it was, investors might not be willing to pay as much for shares. That was their greatest fear: if the expense was shown, earnings would fall. And share prices would follow. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2811))

- THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISION A year later, the corporate lobby that beat FASB won yet another beltway battle that would encourage “creative accounting.” In December of 1995 Congress passed the Safe Harbor Act, a bill designed to shield both corporations and their accountants against shareholder suits if they misled investors about their earnings. Opponents called it “The Pirate’s Cove Act.” Part of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Safe Harbor provision was designed to curtail frivolous lawsuits by offering corporate management “safe harbor” when making predictions about a company’s products, future revenue, and earnings. “The bill is important,” The Wall Street Journal explained to its readers, “because class action lawyers often hold companies’ forecasts against them, asserting they have defrauded investors by lying to them or misleading them with unrealistically optimistic predictions.”43 Seven years later, the idea of holding companies responsible for their forecasts would not seem so frivolous. When short seller Jim Chanos testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s hearing on the Enron scandal in February of 2002, he pointed to the Safe Harbor Act as a law that “emboldened dishonest managements to lie with impunity by relieving them of concern that those to whom they lie will have legal recourse.” Indeed, Chanos declared, “the statute has probably harmed more investors than any other piece of recent legislation.”44 But in 1995 the Journal was expressing the consensus on Wall Street that in an increasingly litigious society, companies needed to be protected against shareholders inclined to believe that life’s disappointments are best addressed by calling a lawyer. With that goal in mind, the new law made it much more difficult for shareholders to bring a class-action suit in federal court if a company’s forecasts did not pan out—as long as the company’s executives surrounded their predictions with “meaningful cautionary statements,” identifying “important factors” that might skew results. “From that point forward,” Chanos recalled in a 2001 interview, “at the beginning of every corporate conference call, they read a few sentences of legal boilerplate [to the effect that] any projections about earnings, revenues, or products [contain] forward-looking statements, which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors… “What they were really saying,” Chanos observed, “was, ‘Now we’re going to lie to you. But remember, you can’t sue us!’ After that, the whole system could be gamed.”45 ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2840))

- The bill raised the bar for what investors needed to prove before launching a suit. In the past, plaintiffs only had to prove that there was good reason to suspect wrongdoing might have taken place before proceeding to the “discovery” stage of a case, where the plaintiff’s lawyers would be allowed to interview senior executives. But under the Safe Harbor Act, the plaintiff would have to provide specific facts suggesting that corporate insiders knew they were committing fraud before the plaintiff’s attorneys could interview them. Finally, the law protected not only corporate officers but accounting firms that might be inclined to look the other way when corporate clients fudged their books. “The change could save the firms staggering sums in the event of a major calamity such as the savings-and-loan crisis, which forced the Big Six accounting firms to pay more than $1.6 billion in damages and settlements to investors,” supporters noted.46 State securities regulators, consumer groups, the American Association of Retired Persons, the Mayors’ Conference, and class-action lawyers all fought the legislation. “If the bill becomes law, investors will be taken back to a world of caveat emptor,” declared Michael Calabrese, who ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2862))

But by 1995, Congress was making it clear to Levitt that he was on a very short leash. That year the House and Senate froze the SEC’s budget. David Ruder, a Republican who had served as SEC chairman from 1987 to 1989, understood what was happening: “The Republican Congress is dealing with the SEC as though it is the enemy instead of the policeman on the beat.”48 Still hoping to regulate through compromise, Levitt tried to find common ground with the Safe Harbor Act’s supporters. Senator Alfonse D’Amato, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was one of the bill’s biggest backers, and Levitt instructed SEC staffers to sit down with Banking Committee staff to work out language that would be acceptable to both sides.… ([Location 2871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2871))

- Clinton, too, was now on board. Confident of the president’s support, the Senate passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 on December 5, with the Safe Harbor provision intact, by a vote of 65–30. The next day the House sent the bill to the White House with strong bipartisan support, voting 302 to 102 in favor of passage. But then President Clinton threw Congress a curve. At the 11th hour—just before a midnight deadline on December 19, 1995—Clinton vetoed the legislation. The bill’s backers were fit to be tied. Congressman Christopher Cox, a Republican from Newport Beach, was the bill’s principal supporter in the House, and he denounced the presidential veto: “President Clinton has turned his back on everyone who owns a mutual fund, participates in a pension plan or has a job at a public company.”49 It might seem curious to suggest that Clinton had betrayed investors by scotching a law… ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2880))

At the time, few stopped to consider the crucial difference between insiders and outsiders: insiders were in a much better position to know if earnings projections were over the top, and so better positioned to bail out, before the balloon popped. Following the veto, Clinton tried to defend himself: “I just didn’t want innocent people to be shafted.” Although he acknowledged that dubious lawsuits posed a threat to business (“There have been examples of frivolous lawsuits filed which really have been unfair to people in California and elsewhere”), Clinton argued that the Safe Harbor provision of the Reform Act went too far in the other direction. “I would ask the American people to remember there have been a lot of examples in the last 15 years of people who have been ripped off to a fare-thee-well, who didn’t get all their money back but at least got some of their money back because… ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=2889))

But the fact is that the tide of the market is always either coming in (a bull market) or going out (a bear market). It’s the determination of the major trend which is so difficult.

- By 1996, however, Sloan was not feeling hot and trendy. He was feeling old and a little cranky—or, at least, alarmed. In May, he directed his readers’ attention to a recent stock offering by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s company. For weeks before the offering, Buffett had warned investors that the stock was overpriced, and that they should not buy it. “He practically put a skull and crossbones on his prospectus,” Sloan wrote. “So what happened? The more Buffett bad-mouthed his stock, the more people lusted after it. Investors bought $500 million worth—five times what Berkshire originally offered to sell.”59 Perhaps Warren Buffett was using a little reverse psychology to drum up interest in his offering? No, in fact, by March of 1996 Buffett believed that the market as a whole was rising without rhyme or reason: “This was a year in which any fool could make a bundle in the stock market,” he noted in his annual letter to investors. “And we did. To paraphrase President Kennedy,” he added slyly, “a rising tide lifts all yachts.”60 Buffett made it clear that, in his view, Hathaway’s shares were overvalued, along with everything else: “Though the per-share intrinsic value of our stock has grown at an excellent rate during the past five years, its market price has grown still faster. The stock, in other words, has outperformed the business. “That kind of market overperformance cannot persist indefinitely, neither for Berkshire nor any other stock,” he added. “Inevitably, there will be periods of underperformance as well. The price volatility that results, though endemic to public markets, is not to our liking. What we would prefer instead is to have the market price of Berkshire precisely track its intrinsic value.”61 Why, then, was he offering new shares of Berkshire? Buffett had been backed into a corner by two promoters who had devised a scheme to peddle Berkshire stock to individual investors. Since Berkshire was trading at $35,000 a share, few small investors could afford to buy it directly. Enter the promoters who created “Affordable Access Trust.” They planned to sell units to individual investors for $1,000, charge a fee, and use the money that was left over (after they took their fee off the top) to buy Berkshire stock. When Buffett heard of their plans, “he went ballistic,” Sloan reported. “Buffett felt the trust would gouge small investors [with its fees] and hurt Berkshire’s good name. Buffett resents people poaching on his fame and expertise and he was clearly worried that the trust’s buying would [further] artificially inflate the price of Berkshire’s stock.” When the promoters refused to abandon their project, Buffett resolved to sell Berkshire shares to small investors himself. He did this by creating B shares of Berkshire equal to one-thirtieth of a regular share, which he sold at $1,100 apiece in May of 1996. Sloan understood why Buffett issued the shares, but he did not understand why investors bought them, flying in the face… ([Location 3280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=3280))

- In Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Risk in the Market and in Life, Taleb offered a wonderfully ghoulish example to illustrate his point: “Imagine an eccentric and bored billionaire who offers you $10 million to play Russian roulette. He gives you a revolver with six chambers, a bullet in only one of those chambers, and challenges you to hold it to your head and pull the trigger. Chances are five in six that you’ll come away with $10 million; chances are one in six that you won’t come away at all. In other words, there are six possible paths that your story will take—but after the fact, we’ll see only one of them.” And if you survive, Taleb observed, “you may be used as a role model by family, friends and neighbors.” Indeed, if the Russian roulette player was a mutual fund manager, some journalist might well put him on the cover of a magazine (“Savvy Risk-Taker Beats Index”).33 Of course, Taleb conceded, if the roulette-betting fool kept on playing the game, the alternative story lines would be likely to catch up with him: “Chances are, he wouldn’t survive to his 50th birthday. But when we look at the stock market’s stars we’re looking at the survivors from a very large pool of players. Imagine that there are thousands of 25-year-olds willing to play Russian roulette, playing each year, on their birthdays. At the end of say, twenty years, we can expect to see a handful of extremely rich survivors—and a very large cemetery.

- He also understood that if you give the American consumer something for free, he might be so pleased that he would spend money to use it. Thus, in 1994, AOL began its campaign to win its way into the wallets of America’s Great Unwired by giving away hundreds of millions of free floppy disks.5 AOL carpet-bombed America with the disks needed to use its service: flight attendants handed them out on American Airlines. They came packaged with flash-frozen Omaha steaks. You could find them on your seat at a football game. Yet the cost of the marketing extravaganza was not subtracted from profits on AOL’s annual earnings statement. Instead, it was labeled an “investment”—as if AOL had invested in new equipment. AOL justified postponing showing the expense: the company argued that the new subscribers would be with the company for 41 months. Sloan asked the obvious question: Of AOL’s current customers, “How many have been around for 41 months?” ([Location 3729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=3729))

- “Almost none,” conceded Lennert Leader, AOL’s chief financial officer. “AOL had signed up most of its customers in the previous 36 months,” Sloan explained. “Leader said the 41-month average life number comes from projections.”6 AOL’s projections were, to say the least, rosy: at the time Jupiter Communications, an Internet research and consulting firm based in New York, reported that commercial online services usually lost 40 percent of their customers each year. Before long, AOL’s “churn” rate would be even higher.7 The short sellers were onto the accounting scam: David Tice was among those known to be shorting the stock. But the shorts were taking a drubbing: in the six months ending in November of ’95, investments representing a bet against America Online had lost around $400 million, according to Laszlo Birinyi, who tracked money flows for Birinyi Associates. Small wonder. While the shorts sold AOL, mutual fund managers were scooping up the shares. “No one came close to forecasting how fast America Online would grow,” Lise Buyer, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price Associates, said in the fall of ’95. “What the shorts can’t understand is that Wall Street, witnessing such growth, is willing to overlook the company’s losses and well-known aggressive accounting methods.”8 But the “growth” she was talking about was a growth in the number of subscribers, not a growth in earnings. The cost of acquiring those customers was so high that AOL had not, in fact, yet turned a profit—though thanks to its creative accounting, it was reporting profits. Sloan continued to track the stock. By May of 1996, it was clear that AOL had a new and formidable rival: the Internet. In the past, the company’s promoters claimed that the key to AOL was content, pointing to websites such as “The Motley Fool,” an online forum for financial news and gossip available only to AOL customers. But those days were gone. Now, anyone could access The Motley Fool on the Net.9 In the seven months since Sloan had last reported on the company, AOL’s books had deteriorated. “By my math, AOL ran through $185 million in the nine months that ended on March 31,” Sloan observed. Yet it was still sweeping promotional costs under the carpet—putting off the day when it would have to subtract them from profits. Sloan calculated that the hidden pot of deferred expenses now totaled $315 million. Meanwhile, the customers AOL paid so dearly to acquire were whirling through a revolving door.

- March quarter, AOL added 2.2 million new customers—but lost 1.3 million old customers. And now AOL was succumbing to the rate war, announcing that in July, it would begin offering 20 hours for $19.95—cutting a 20-hour user’s bill by almost 60 percent.10 Nevertheless, when Sloan interviewed AOL’s Steve Case that spring, Case appeared unperturbed. It was not, after all, Case’s style to emote. Calm, even placid, and always dressed for his Gap ad—khakis, polo shirt, and sneakers—the moonfaced Case appeared unflappable. He had no edge—or so it seemed. One colleague described him as “catlike…always sitting in the back of the room, and watching everything going on. But you couldn’t draw him out. Thoughtful? Yes. Charismatic? No. There was no output.”11 True to form, in the interview Case could not be drawn into argument. He brushed aside questions about profits: “Only 11 percent of U.S. households are on-line,” he pointed out. “Why aren’t the other 89 percent? They think it’s too hard and too complicated, and they’re right.” Without AOL, he seemed to suggest, Americans would never be able to figure out how to log on to the Net. When Sloan wrote about AOL in May, the stock had just lost 25 percent of its value, down from an all-time high of $71 earlier in the month. Long-term buy-and-hold investors had reason to worry. Meanwhile, Sloan reported, Case himself already had cashed in $19.7 million of AOL options. This is not to say that Case was unconcerned about the slide. He still had the company’s future to think about—plus options and stock worth another $100 million. That summer, the pressure was mounting. In June, William Razzouk, a veteran FedEx executive who had been brought in to help steady the ship, quit as president and COO after only four flabbergasted months on the job. (A southern gentleman with a penchant for order, Razzouk had not fit into the company’s freewheeling culture.) Razzouk might also have been perturbed that the Federal… ([Location 3756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=3756))

- As AOL redefined its business model in the third quarter of 1998, Case finally responded to pressure from critics who questioned the company’s bookkeeping. From that point forward, he announced, AOL would deduct its promotion expenses from earnings as it spent the money—“the way a normal company does,” Sloan remarked. It also would take a charge of $385 million to write off a portion of the marketing investments it had already made. The $385 million, Sloan explained, was “the money AOL had spent but hadn’t charged against profits, and [instead] counted as an asset.” In the same press release, AOL announced that it was introducing flat-rate pricing.21 Incredibly, AOL’s admission that for years it had been, in effect, lying to investors about its profits did not seem to chill their enthusiasm. On the news of the accounting changes, the stock jumped 12 percent in two days. After all, AOL explained to its many admirers, “it’s just bookkeeping.” Back at Newsweek, Allan Sloan was rubbing his eyes. He could not quite believe investors’ willingness to forgive and forget the $385 million. That special charge “wiped out most of AOL’s net worth, plus all the profits it claimed to have made in its entire 11-year history,” he wrote. “But guess what? Wall Street loved it. This despite the fact that neither the financial rebooting nor AOL’s hiring of the highly touted Bob Pittman, a cofounder of MTV, solves AOL’s crucial business problem: how to make money online when the Internet offers so much free stuff.”22 Eventually, Sloan was worn down. It was not just that his bosses objected to his constant carping about AOL’s numbers. In the nineties, few readers appreciated a Woodward and Bernstein approach to financial reporting. Indeed, a year later, Time magazine would be lauding Steve Case’s “visionary” skills in an article headlined “How AOL Lost the Battles but Won the War.”23 “I knew I was right, but whenever I published one of these stories, everyone would carry on,” Sloan recalled. “Finally I just gave up. I shouldn’t have, but I did. There are only a limited number of swings you can take—eventually you look like a crank.”24 Nevertheless, Sloan’s view of AOL would prove prophetic: “The bottom line: I think AOL’s stock market value of $6.8 billion is way too high,” he wrote in May of 1996. “Then again, I thought its $4 billion valuation seven months ago was too high. Even Steve Case’s best scrambling can’t prop up AOL’s stock forever. Someday, he’s going to have to score by showing real profits or pull off a financial Hail Mary miracle play by selling AOL. Know a good, hungry phone company?”25 No, but four years later, Case would find a good, hungry media giant. And in January of 2000 he would pull off his Hail Mary by announcing that he was passing the ball to Time Warner’s shareholders just minutes before the clock ran out. (Actually, he was three months ahead of the clock: the technology meltdown would not begin until March.)

In 2002, Lise Buyer, the mutual fund manager who had explained that the shorts “just didn’t understand that Wall Street was willing to overlook AOL’s aggressive accounting,” looked back on AOL’s rise. By then, Buyer herself had become disillusioned with Wall Street and had gone west to become a venture capitalist. Yet, she still tried to rationalize the way AOL conjured up profits in the mid-nineties: “Maybe you could say that, by cooking the books, they saved the company?”26 The question mark in her voice belied her words. It seemed that Buyer herself did not truly believe her own halfhearted explanation. What some liked to refer to as AOL’s “accounting shenanigans” had represented more than a onetime attempt to paper over an earnings gap until the fledgling company could get on its feet. People who cheat once cheat again. And again—and again. The saga of AOL’s bookkeeping would prove another example of how, in a market driven by momentum rather than value, the more you lie, the more you have to lie, to keep the merry-go-round turning.

- after supposedly cleaning up the questions about those marketing expenses, AOL reported that now, at last, it could report true profits. It seemed a key turning point for an embattled company. But within months, AOL had to retroactively erase that quarterly profit. The SEC told AOL that it had prematurely booked millions of dollars of revenue from a major deal.27 As the next century began, AOL would still be restating its revenues. In 2000, the company agreed to pay a $3.5 million fine to settle charges that it used improper accounting during the mid-1990s to report profits when it was actually losing money. Two years later, AOL Time Warner found itself in the embarrassing position of restating its financial results for the past two years, reducing revenues by $190 million, as the company disclosed it had uncovered more “questionable advertising transactions” at its troubled America Online unit.28 In 2003, the SEC reported that not only had AOL been… ([Location 3854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=3854))

- Momentum investors, by contrast, are surfers: they ride a stock while it is rising, buying it all the way up, then jumping, just as it crests, to catch the next wave. Or, at least, that is their goal. In its own way, momentum investing (aka “chasing a stock”) is a little like falling hopelessly in love. The further the object of desire recedes into the distance, the faster the momentum investor runs. In the normal course of things, higher prices dampen desire. When lamb becomes too dear, consumers eat chicken; when the price of gasoline soars, people take fewer vacations. Conversely, lower prices usually whet our interest: color TVs, VCRs, and cell phones became more popular as they became more affordable. But when a stock market soars, investors do not behave like consumers. Rather, they are consumed by stocks. Equities seem to appeal to the perversity of human desire. The more costly the prize, the greater the allure. So, at the height of a bull market, investors lust after the market’s leaders. (Conversely, when the prize is too ready at hand, investors lose interest. At the bottom of a bear market, when equities are bargains, they go begging, like overly earnest, suitable suitors.)

He just knew that he wanted no part of an overvalued market. “There is the historical knowledge that, at some point, the bubble will burst. If I participate in what I think is a bubble, I would expose the shareholders in my fund to undue risk. At some point,” he added, “you have to decide in your own mind whether you see yourself as the steward of the customer’s savings or whether you see yourself as an asset-gathering machine.

- The fund companies’ marketers began to take over the industry. Questions about either market fundamentals or corporate balance sheets gave way to more urgent queries: What sector is hot? What’s moving? What can we sell today? “When a company opened a new fund, the idea came from the marketing guys, not from the portfolio managers,” confided a manager chosen to start an Internet fund at a large Wall Street firm. “I thought Internet stocks were overvalued by then, and that an Internet fund was a bad idea. But that didn’t matter. They knew they could sell the fund.”3 ([Location 4160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4160))

- Morningstar’s critics suggested that when a new manager came on board, the slate should be wiped clean. The rating service should wait and see how the new manager performed before awarding stars. But in the nineties, fund managers came and went with such regularity that if Morningstar waited until a manager had even two years’ experience under his belt, the rating system would cover fewer funds. A huge number of five-and ten-year rankings would have disappeared altogether: managers seldom stayed with a fund that long. So when a new manager took charge, Morningstar let the fund keep its stars, leaving it to the investor reading Morningstar’s report to click on “fees and management” in order to discover that the stars said nothing about the current manager’s talent. Once again, the burden was on the individual investor. “Before making a decision, an investor also should look at the fund’s year-by-year returns,” Phillips added. After all, a five-star fund’s performance could turn on just one or two outstanding years—something that an investor would see only if he went beyond the first page of the online report to look at the year-by-year breakdown of the fund’s total returns. “That is what I look at. I want to see consistent returns,” says Phillips. “But,” he acknowledged, “people do gravitate to shortcuts.” In other words, they count the stars.8 ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4201))

- The mutual fund industry also counted the stars—and, in many cases, paid its managers accordingly. “The rankings became far too important,” confided a manager at one large Wall Street brokerage. “Our organization, and many organizations, managed their managers, and compensated their managers, for being in a certain place in the Morningstar or the Lipper pecking order, rather than on their absolute performance. If you made 15 percent—but other funds in your category were willing to take greater risks and made 20 percent—you might earn four stars that year instead of five. As a result, your bonus would shrink—even though your investors had made 15 percent. On the other hand, if you lost 10 percent—but other funds in your category lost 20 percent—you might well pick up a star, and get a raise. Your Morningstar rating could determine your entire bonus.” Perhaps inevitably, money managers began to let the ratings shape their investment decisions. “Once a week we would get a memo from our boss about how our fund’s ranking stacked up against the weekly Lipper rankings,” he continued. “Sometimes, you made stupid investment decisions—buying a stock that was hot—just to raise your short-term rating. And I did this,” he added ruefully, “even though I had all of my own savings in my own fund.”9 Meanwhile, the marketers learned how to tool the stars to fit their ads, boasting, for example: “42 of our 66 rated funds received an Overall Morningstar Rating of four or five stars.” The ad was worded carefully: “of our rated funds” was the key phrase. Typically, not all of a company’s funds were rated. ([Location 4212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4212))

- As the mutual fund industry grew, so did the cost of promoting its funds. Who footed the bill? Mutual fund investors. “12b-1” fees were created specifically so that existing investors could underwrite the expense of bringing in new investors.

- An investor might well assume that most of his 12b-1 fees pay for glossy magazine ads. In fact, the lion’s share of the money that mutual fund companies spend on marketing is funneled to brokers and financial planners. “Only a small portion of the fund business advertises. Most marketing has to do with relationships through the broker distribution system, and to a lesser degree the financial planners,” Michael Lipper explained. “Some financial planners take fees only from their clients. But they are the minority, because they can’t live on fees unless they have extremely wealthy clients with huge accounts.” Do most individual investors realize that their financial planner may receive a fee for recommending a particular fund? “They’ve been told,” said Lipper. “But I don’t know if they know.”14 ([Location 4250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4250))

- With higher rewards comes higher risk. A portfolio manager who chased returns of 20 percent or more faced a greater chance of blowing up. But if he took a more cautious course, he could scuttle his own career. Laurence Siegel, director of investment policy research at the Ford Foundation, spelled out the dilemma in an interview with Kathryn Welling, editor of welling@weeden: A money manager is judged by his results, and those results break down into four categories, Siegel explained. “You can be right and with the crowd—which is fine…. You can be right and alone—and then you are a hero. You can be wrong and with the crowd, which isn’t actually so bad. When everyone else is down it doesn’t hurt [the fund manager’s career] to be down.

- an idiot.” This is the ignominious fate that a career-conscious fund manager strives to avoid at all costs. When younger fund managers, “under the age of say, 45 or 50,” make investment decisions, “job-protecting behavior…dominates,” Siegel observed—a fact of life he described as “understandable, even if it is not good for the client. This is called the principal-agent conflict,” Siegel added, summing up the relationship between investors and portfolio managers. “Preserving purchasing power and earning a return on capital is good for the client. Minimizing the risk of being wrong and alone is good for the managers.”21 In other words, it is in the fund manager’s interest to follow the herd—even if he thinks the herd is wrong. In the worst-case scenario, he will go down in flames along with everyone else. No one will blame him. Alternatively, if he dares to think outside of the box, and do what he believes is in the best long-term interest of his clients, he takes the chance of being “wrong and alone.” Not surprisingly, as the market climbed, most managers chose investment risk (for their clients) over career risk (for themselves). In 1996, a portfolio manger who had any doubts about which course to take need only glance over his shoulder to glimpse the ghost of Jeff Vinik. The image of Vinik, Fidelity Magellan’s former manager, would be sufficient to remind him that in a market driven by momentum, his position was only as secure as that quarter’s returns.

- When Jeff Vinik took the helm of Fidelity’s flagship fund, Fidelity Magellan, in the summer of 1992, he shocked some investors by dumping the then-popular consumer stocks that Magellan’s founder, Peter Lynch, had favored, replacing them with stocks in less popular sectors: energy, technology, and heavy industry. To some, it seemed a reckless and irreverent move. A year later, Barron’s declared Vinik a “winner.” As he had predicted, semiconductor, oil-service, and natural-gas shares were leading the market, “while the favorites of yesteryear, the peddlers of brand-name goods,” were down by about 10 percent. “Jeff will buy what he wants to buy,” John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Reports, said at the time. “He’s never had a taste for growth stocks. He likes buying stocks with below-market multiples,” he added, referring to Vinik’s preference for what he called GARP—“growth at a reasonable price.” Even at the end of the decade, Vinik avoided the price/earnings ratios of 30, 40, or 50 that had become commonplace in the large-cap universe. “For a company that’s growing 15% or 20%, [I might pay] 12 times earnings,” he confided. “For a company that’s growing 40%, it might be 25 times earnings.” In 1993, Barron’s noted, “Vinik’s distaste for traditional growth stocks is ironic considering that Magellan is supposed to be a growth-stock fund. But,” the magazine acknowledged, “it’s hard to argue with his results.”22 For the moment, Vinik was allowed his head. At the time, Fidelity’s stars were given a fairly free rein to invest as they saw fit. In the early nineties, for example, when Vinik was steering Fidelity’s Growth and Income Fund, he had tucked 40 percent of its assets into cash, saving investors from the worst effects of the recession.

- fund’s position to less than 25 percent. Vinik thought the technology sector had become too speculative, and he continued to pare his holdings: by the spring of 1996, a mere 3.5 percent of Magellan’s assets were committed to tech. In the fund’s annual report, Vinik explained that he thought bonds would outperform stocks “over the next year or two.” With that in mind, he put 11 percent of Magellan’s funds into cash, and 19 percent into bonds, mainly long-term Treasuries.24 In one stroke, Vinik had violated the three articles of blind faith that drove the bull market: Over… ([Location 4339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4339))

- Gail Dudack, however, was not so ready to forget Vinik. She felt that he had gotten a raw deal at Fidelity, and that he had been “slaughtered” by the press. “What people don’t realize,” she told friends, “is that money managers like Jeff Vinik are put in an impossible position. Their firms want them to wear two hats: they’re expected to market the firm by giving media interviews, and at the same time they are supposed to manage money.”34 It was yet another sign that the marketers had taken over the mutual fund industry. Even a mutual fund manager running billions of dollars was expected to spend part of his time talking to reporters.

- Vinik’s “resignation/firing” sent a message to other mutual fund managers. “In the future…few major mutual funds will have the courage to reduce risk by raising cash or holding significant treasury note or bond positions,” wrote Ned Davis of Ned Davis Research, an independent technical-analysis firm founded in 1980.35 Davis would be right. Even after the Nasdaq cracked in the spring of 2000, the vast majority of fund managers felt that they had no choice but to remain fully invested. (See chart on page 461 in Appendix.) Years after he left Fidelity, Vinik would be remembered as the Magellan Fund manager who tried to time the market—with disastrous results. By 2002, however, it was becoming clear that an investor who moved out of technology and into Treasuries and cash in 1996 had made a shrewd move. He would miss the Nasdaq’s peak, of course, but he would also miss the wreck that followed. If investors had been patient, Vinik’s market timing might have worked after all. Over the next seven years, an investor who switched to bonds at the end of March 1996 would have done far better than someone who stuck with the S&P 500.

- The ultimate consequence of “Greenspan’s productivity bubble” would be unemployment. In a piece published on David Tice’s Prudentbear.com, Donald Perry used a parable to make the point. Dr. Perry was not an economist, nor was he a Wall Street strategist. He was, in fact, an ecologist—an outside observer with common sense—and he compared the New Economy to a chicken farm: “Basically, productivity in the coop increases when chickens lay more eggs per day,” Perry wrote. “Early on farmers noted that hens could produce more eggs when confined to a cage, instead of running around searching for food, being chased by cocks, or having to evade predators. To understand productivity as it relates to the economy substitute the word ‘chicken’ for ‘worker.’” If chickens are laying more eggs—but the price of eggs is falling—the egg business is at best “treading water,” Perry explained. Too many eggs, like too many ([Location 4913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4913))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- cell phones or too many computers, leaves the chicken farmer with little power to raise prices. “What Greenspan fails to acknowledge,” Perry observed, “is that while American business may be producing more eggs, the bottom is dropping out from under the price of eggs.” The solution, for the egg farmer, is “to send some of the chickens to Campbell’s [where they would wind up, quite literally, in the soup]. The farmer then has fewer chickens to feed, gets the highest average output per chicken, and makes a little extra money in the process. “But human chickens aren’t sent to Campbell’s,” he pointed out, “they get unemployment and buy fewer goods.” And, “since there are fewer buyers the glut of eggs becomes even greater. “Another complication is that while it is plain to see that putting chickens in sweat shops all over the planet produces huge numbers of eggs, who will buy these eggs? Obviously, the market must correct itself by ‘wringing out the excesses.’ Ultimately many egg producers are going to go out of business. So when you hear Greenspan touting productivity gains you should be thinking ‘Who will be going out of business next?’ Hint: Asian chickens produce more eggs on less food.” ([Location 4920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4920))

- Before deciding that rising productivity is a boon, one needs to ask why it is rising, Perry suggested. Rising productivity “makes economic sense when production rises faster than ‘hours worked,’ but it makes little or no sense when—as in recent years—hours worked fall faster than rising production.”14 Or, as Gail Dudack put it: “When productivity gains are linked to jobs vanishing, we see no miracle.”15 ([Location 4930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=4930))

- Companies like GE boasted of “managing” their earnings so that they rose, consistently and smoothly, quarter after quarter, year in and year out. In this way, GE was able to always meet, if not beat, analysts’ estimates. Of course, in the real world of business some years are better than others; profits do not rise in a straight line. This is why Jim Grant called managed earnings “fully deluded earnings.” Grant quoted Jim Chanos: “The trouble with smoothing a naturally jagged pattern of earnings is that the underlying problems of the business itself are likely to be obscured—until the day when they can’t be any longer.” ([Location 5070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5070))

- To mask problems, some companies created virtual revenues. One of the simplest ways to do this is to pay customers to buy your goods. And by the late nineties this is precisely what Cisco was doing. George Noble, a Boston-based portfolio manager best known for a successful stint running Fidelity’s Overseas Fund, recalled stumbling onto one of Cisco’s virtual customers. At the time, Noble was attending a road show for B2, a small broadband company that was trying to drum up interest in an IPO: “To lend credibility to the whole thing, they were pointing out all the big investors they had, like Morgan Stanley—who by the way was also their underwriter.

- Then they said, ‘We buy all of our equipment from Cisco. We gave Cisco an order for $330 million of equipment and we got 135% vendor financing.’” Noble perked up. He decided to play dumb. “How does that work? What is vendor financing?” “Well, the order was for $330 million of equipment and they gave us $450 million of financing at 9% interest and with no payment and principal for the first year,” the company spokesperson explained. “Is that good?” Noble asked, still playing the innocent. “The Morgan Stanley banker shot up out of his chair because he wanted to dazzle us with how great the deal was for B2,” Noble recalled. “Everyone knew where I was going with that question except the banker who went on to explain what a great deal it was.”8 At least for B2. The company received $330 million of free equipment plus $80 million in cash. In return, Cisco received $330 million of revenues—on paper. Maybe B2 would be able to repay the loan. Maybe not. Cisco was hardly alone. Telecom-equipment suppliers were particularly generous with their loans: by the end of 2000, they were collectively owed as much as $15 billion by customers, a 25 percent increase in a single year.9 ([Location 5079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5079))

- That is the theory. But, as the Levy Center’s report explained, over the course of the bull market companies found various ways to goose operating income. Sometimes, a company would mislabel one-time (and nonrecurring) revenue as operating revenue—as if it had sold products. This is precisely what IBM did in 1999 when it used a one-time $4 billion gain from its sale of its global network business to offset that year’s normal expenses. On other occasions, a company would sweep true operating expenses into the “one-time expense column.” Once tucked into that column, the expense did not have to be subtracted from operating income. In 1999, Warren Buffett elaborated on how this bit of legerdemain works: “A large chunk of costs that should properly be attributed to a number of years is dumped into a single quarter, typically one already fated to disappoint investors. In some cases, the purpose of the charge is to clean up earnings misrepresentations of the past, and in others it is to prepare the ground for future misrepresentations. In either case, the size and timing of these charges is dictated by the cynical proposition that Wall Street will not mind if earnings fall short by $5 per share in a given quarter, just as long as this deficiency insures that quarterly earnings in the future will consistently exceed expectations by five cents per share.”10 Because investors were so focused on the notion of quarterly earnings growth, the ruse worked. “If you take something as a [one-time] restructuring charge, investors will forgive you immediately,” explained Robert ([Location 5103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5103))

- Meanwhile, as executives exercised their options to buy stock, the number of shares outstanding mounted. In 1990, just two U.S. companies had more than a billion shares outstanding—Wal-Mart and AT&T. By 1995, GE, Coca-Cola, Exxon, Merck, and Ford had joined the group, bringing the total to seven. Then things got out of hand. Seven years later, 65 companies had joined what Steve Leuthold called “The Billion Share Club.” Near the top of the list: GE (9.9 billion), Cisco (7.3), Intel (6.7), Pfizer (6.3), Oracle (5.5), Microsoft (5.4), Citigroup (5.2), and AOL Time Warner (4.3). “Of course stock splits and stock based acquisitions explained part of this quantum leap,” Leuthold acknowledged, “but stock options have also been a major factor.”21 The potentially disastrous effect on earnings per share was obvious: when billions of new shares are issued, the earnings pie has to be sliced into smaller pieces. If earnings per share dropped too much, companies would never be able to meet Wall Street’s quarterly estimates no matter how diligently they padded their earnings reports. There was only one solution: companies had to begin buying back their own shares. And this is exactly what they did. At the height of the bull market, companies began paying a premium for their own overvalued shares, squandering money that could have been used either for research and development or to distribute dividends to shareholders. Some even borrowed to finance the buybacks.

- TAKING SHARES WITH ONE HAND, BUYING THEM BACK WITH THE OTHER Dell Computer provided a case study in just how costly options programs could become. In 1998, Michael Dell took home 12,800,000 options—in addition to nearly $3.5 million in salary and bonuses. That year Dell himself received 21 percent of all the stock options granted by the company to its employees. A year earlier, Dell had announced that it was expanding its share buyback program—even though its shares were trading at almost 40 times projected 1997 profits. The next year, the company paid $1.5 billion to buy back 149 million shares.23 In theory, companies gave out stock options in order to ensure employee loyalty and retain top talent.

- quarreled with Dell’s right to diversify: “It’s unwise to keep all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is Dell Computer,” acknowledged Fortune’s Thomas Stewart in a story titled “Does Michael Dell Need Stock Options?” “But why is Michael Dell, wearing his founder’s hat, selling stock, while in his managerial garb he sucks up so many options?”24 In fact, 1998 was a good year for Michael Dell to begin giving serious thought to diversification. A year earlier, Dell’s shares had led the S&P 500, gaining 216 percent, and in ’98, Dell once again ran at the head of the pack, climbing 248 percent. But this would be the stock’s last golden year. From the end of ’98 through the spring of 2000, Dell’s shares would rise by only 58 percent—then plunge. By year-end, they had lost 70 percent of their value. In the summer of 2003, Dell still traded below its December ’98 high. By September of ’98, Jim Chanos was shorting the stock. Worldwide computer sales continued to climb, but prices were falling. Chanos knew that the market was approaching saturation. Nevertheless, Dell’s shares were changing hands at 67 times the previous year’s net income and 49 times book value. Meanwhile, in order to try to… ([Location 5185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5185))

- preset price would wind up being lower than the actual market price. Dell’s foray into the options market did not stop there. To pay for the call options, the company began selling “put” options on its stock. The “puts” gave the buyer the right to sell the stock back to Dell at a preset price over a specific period of time. If the share price fell during that time, the investor who bought the put would win the bet, but if the shares continued to climb, the revenues the company raised by selling the puts would become pure profit. For a while, the strategy paid off. In one quarter, Dell made more by selling options than by peddling computers. But once Dell’s share price began to plummet, the gamble backfired. In the fiscal year ending February 1, 2001, Dell paid an average of more than $43 a share for the roughly 68 million shares that it bought back that year. Meanwhile, Dell’s shares were trading on the open market at an average price of $25. Dell’s problems did not end there: “The company eventually must buy 51 million more shares at around $45—again, well above Dell’s current price—through 2004,” Barron’s reported in 2002. Moreover, a built-in “trigger” provision requires that if Dell drops to $8, the box maker has to settle up on all the puts. Dell would have to spend $2.3 billion to cover this; it had $3.6 billion in cash at fiscal 2002’s end.25 Investors who bought Dell stock thought they were investing in a computer company, not a hedge fund.

- “Crossholding, American-Style” also made her list of dubious innovations: “Taking a page out of the Japanese play book American tech companies have become just about indistinguishable from keiretsu, the Japanese industrial groups that financed each other and held interlocking shares for strategic purposes,” Allyn remarked. Cisco was not the only company financing its customers. “There are lots of examples. Microsoft has a massive portfolio of investments in alliance partners and new technologies. Oracle is another great example. They have $500 million in an Oracle Venture Fund to invest in promising startups. One condition: They’ve got to buy Oracle software.” But keiretsu did not top Allyn’s list of potentially dangerous innovations. That space she reserved for one of the greatest sources of financial ingenuity: hedge funds. Combining computerized models with high finance, hedge funds served as the perfect example of how the revolution in technology was reinforcing the financial revolution. “At some point in the middle of 1999,” Allyn recalled, “a few of them—the Soro$Drucken-miller Quantum Fund, in particular—began investing in technology. They couldn’t resist getting involved. And they got badly, badly burned. “A hedge fund is a particularly ill-suited vehicle for technology investing,” she added. “The problem with hedge funds is that their investors wanted to see some distributions when the calendar turned over. Their friendly bankers knew their positions and lay in wait. As Soros noted, ‘Quantum is far too big and its activities too closely watched by the market to be able to operate successfully in this environment.’29 There was no way they ([Location 5243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5243))

In the fall of ’98, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) used high technology to create a new way to play financial markets—and in the process, it demonstrated just how volatile a combination high tech and high finance could be.

- When Russia defaulted on its bonds, it set off a domino effect. Floating anxiety prompted many hedge funds to want to raise capital, and a cascade of selling began. “With dozens of hedge funds trying to flee the markets, the selling pressure sent prices haywire around the world. Erratic prices served only to increase volatility,” Levy explained. Suddenly, LTCM found itself in an irrational market. That August, the fund lost roughly 45 percent of its capital—an event that, “according to LTCM’s mathematical model, should happen no more than once in the history of Western civilization,” Levy reported in his memoir, The Mind of Wall Street.32 LTCM had been undone by what Nassim Nicholas Taleb would call “a black swan.” ([Location 5281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5281))

The fact that it has never happened does not mean that it cannot happen. “In 1992, who would have believed that the Nasdaq would cross 5000?” asked Taleb. “But it did. And in March of 2000, how many people believed that it could lose more than 3000 points over the next 13 months?” Yet it did. “All we can learn from history,” Taleb added in a 2002 interview, “is that the unpredictable will happen—and does—time and again. The most dangerous error that an investor can make is to mistake probability for certainty.”33 In 2001, Taleb wrote a book that rolled down Wall Street like a small hand grenade, Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life.34 There, he described the “the black swan,” or “the rare event.” This is the event that lies outside of our experience: we have never seen a black swan, just as, until the nineties, we had never seen the Dow climb 1000 points in less than four years. Based on past experience, the run-up that followed seemed to many highly improbable—some would have said unimaginable. But, Taleb observed, the fact that an investor has not seen a black swan does not mean that he can rule it out.

- AA 10-year bond for 10 years, he is all but guaranteed to get his money back, plus interest when it matures. If he buys a stock, on the other hand, he cannot be at all certain how much it will be worth in 10 years. This is why, in order to attract investors, companies that issued stock instead of bonds traditionally had to pay a higher dividend. The cause and effect seemed rational and perfectly clear. Until the 1950s, when “for the first time in history,” Bernstein noted, the old rules were turned on their heads: bonds paid the higher yield. “A relationship sanctified by over 80 years of experience suddenly came apart.”35 In Against the Gods, Bernstein quoted the essayist G. K.

- they sell? How would LTCM’s own responses affect the efficient market that it thought it had modeled? Financial markets defy such calculations. In the physical world, it is much easier to calculate probabilities, because the possibilities are more likely to be finite. “If you roll dice, you know that the odds are one in six that the dice will come up on a particular side,” said Taleb, “because you know the dice have six sides. So, you can calculate the risk. But, in the stock market such computations are bull—you don’t even know how many sides the dice have!” Because the physical world offers a limited range of possibilities, events tend to arrange themselves on a symmetrical bell curve. Again, Taleb offered a practical example: “Let’s say you graph the weights of all the babies born in the U.S. over 10 years. Birth weights might range from under a pound to, perhaps, 15 pounds. If you took a large enough sample, and you plotted it on a graph, you would wind up with a smooth bell curve; there would be no babies weighing 500 pounds to skew it. In physical reality, it would be impossible for a woman to give birth to a 500-pound baby. There are limits to what can happen.” But if you graphed… ([Location 5317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=5317))

He was attempting to give her career advice. As she had told Money magazine a few months earlier, being a bear “is not good for your career and it’s not good for making friends.”8 Not long after, she went to a meeting with a client and was accused of being “unpatriotic” because she suggested that U.S. technology stocks were overpriced. The numbers no longer matter, Dudack thought. People want to buy stocks and they want them to go up. They want to make a million dollars—and they want people to tell them things that will make it happen. Dudack knew that she risked being labeled a Cassandra, one of those perverse seers who insist upon forecasting doom, even though no one is interested in hearing her bad news. In the summer of 1998, when Prudential’s Ralph Acampora predicted that the Dow would crash, and Prudential wound up hiring a bodyguard to protect him, Dudack understood the public’s reaction: They believe that if you say that the market will go down, you make it happen.

- Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan caught millennial fever. Responding to apocalyptic fears that as the world’s clocks changed from 1999 to 2000, computers worldwide would crash, the Fed chairman once again rode to the rescue, cushioning the expected crash with cash. “In the run-up to the millennial-liquidity-crisis-that-did-not-happen, the Fed created more than $100 billion of new credit, thereby stimulating a stock market that hardly seemed to need any additional encouragement,” Jim Grant noted in an op-ed piece that he wrote for The Financial Times.15 Washington, by contrast, was impressed. On January 4, 2000, President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Fed chairman, and “Greenspan’s Senate confirmation hearing—a tense scene on previous occasions—was more like a coronation this time around,” noted Justin Martin, author of Greenspan: The Man Behind Money. Indeed, Martin reported, at about the same time, “Americans were treated to the spectacle of the leading presidential candidates for the 2000 election falling all over one another to see who could heap ([Location 6028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6028))

- the highest praise on Greenspan. The prize went to John McCain. During a primary debate, [McCain] gushed: ‘And by the way, I would not only reappoint Alan Greenspan—if he would happen to die, God forbid—I would do like they did in the movie Weekend at Bernie’s. I would prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him.’”16 Not everyone was bowled over. Some, like Acorn Funds founder Ralph Wanger, believed that by keeping the bubble afloat, the Fed chairman was only postponing disaster. “In the end, what the market is valuing is the economy—and if the economy grows 6 percent and the market is going up 12 to 18 percent, after 10 years you’ve got an unstable situation. It reminds me of the conditions that lead to an avalanche,” he continued. “Once enough snow has accumulated, it’s hard to know what will trigger the avalanche. It can be almost anything—a tree branch, a deer, a skier—what really causes it is that you have an unstable snow buildup and any damn thing is going to trigger it. It doesn’t matter what the final trigger is—unless it happens to be you. In which case it becomes an overriding concern, for a short period of time. “When the avalanche comes crashing down, it takes everything in front of it.” In Wanger’s view, Greenspan committed his final, fatal mistake by bringing a snow-making machine to an avalanche. At the time, a blizzard of buying had already created the instability that inevitably would lead to disaster: “What Greenspan should have done,” said Wanger, “was to act like he was head of the ski patrol. You handle an unstable situation like that by setting off the avalanche under controlled conditions. You take care of the situation by having the avalanche earlier rather than later. “That last slug of liquidity in the last quarter of the year” helped send stocks to the moon, Wanger observed. “Biotech stocks went up eightfold. There was money all over the place, money flowing into sector funds—and sector funds set up the potential for disaster.”17 ([Location 6036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6036))

- Many of those sector funds were technology funds. In the 12 months that ended March 1, 2000, the Nasdaq skyrocketed a stunning 108.4 percent—making both the Dow’s 8.7 percent rise and the S&P 500’s 11.5 percent advance over the same span seem puny. Individual investors were still following the momentum. During the first three months of 2000, roughly two-thirds of the cash that individual investors shoveled into mutual funds was tagged for tech funds, helping to drive the benchmark technology index past yet another much ballyhooed barrier: on March 10, the Nasdaq crossed 5000. Then, on Monday, March 13, the trouble began. The New York Times called it “a small speed bump.”18 And so… ([Location 6053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6053))

- another hit, and once again bounced back. Investors took the swerve in stride. “Bull’s Retreat Doesn’t Cause a Stampede,” the Journal declared in the final days of March.19 By year-end, The Wall Street Journal would take a very different view of the events of March 2000. Looking back on the “tech wreck” that began that month, Wall Street’s paper of record compared it to “one-third of the houses in America sliding into the ocean.” For by then, the index had fallen 54 percent, peak to trough, and investors had lost $3.3 trillion in paper wealth—the equivalent of the loss of said houses, “in dollars if not in effect,” the Journal added, allowing for the fact that people might well have a sentimental attachment to their homes—not to mention a fondness for family members who could be trapped inside.20 Then, too, these were only paper losses. But most 401(k) investors thought of the money as theirs even though they had not yet sold their shares, and had planned their retirements accordingly. In retrospect, many observers would believe that the bear market began in March of 2000. That, after all, also was the month when the S&P 500 peaked. But market historians who stepped back to take a broader view realized that the Greek Chorus was right: the bear came on stage sometime in 1999. You only had to do the math. By March 1, 2000, stocks trading on the Nasdaq had climbed $3.1 trillion in 12 months, Jim Bianco of Bianco Research pointed out. Over the same 12 months the total value of all U.S. stocks—including Nasdaq shares—rose by only $2.1 trillion. Anyone who subtracted the Nasdaq’s gain from the total realized that by March of 2000, the overall market had fallen by $600 billion.21 “Bears,” Peter Bernstein later observed, “are people who do their arithmetic.”22 In other words, the bull did not suddenly roll over and die in the spring of 2000. What seemed a sudden shocking drop on the Nasdaq was part of a larger process that embraced not just the technology index but the whole market. The broad market had lacked support since the end of 1998, when just six stocks carried the S&P 500 over the finish line into positive territory. Gail Dudack was right: it was a “stealth bear market.” And the bear would continue to take his time. “The dollar did not break down until May 2002,” Dudack added three years later. “The unwinding of this bubble is like watching a movie in… ([Location 6060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6060))

- is a pause in the longest expansion in a century or the first stage of a recession.” No surprise, Wall Street’s paper of record was able to report that “much of Wall Street opts for the former view.” The basis for Wall Street’s faith, once again, was the central banker Boston money manager Jeremy Grantham liked to call “Archangel Alan.” “Economists expect [the Fed] to lower rates soon, and propel stocks and the economy forward,” the Journal reported.27 In reality, a bear market already had begun, not because the economy was heading into a recession (though it was), but because stocks were wildly overpriced. As Ralph Wanger had warned, the proximate cause of the first avalanche can be anything, and, in the end, the trigger is unimportant. The snow had been building up for a long, long time. Now much of that paper wealth was melting away. But even though the Dow had declined 16 percent, peak to trough, over the course of 2000, that 16 percent loss “failed to meet the 20% bear market rule,” The Wall Street Journal explained, echoing the received wisdom that a bear market has begun only when share prices have fallen 20 percent.

- To back up their assertion that this was not, after all, the beginning of a lasting downturn, financial pundits compared the 2000 crash to the disastrous plunge of 1973–74. In ’74, the bear devoured everything in sight. This time, by contrast, high-priced stocks such as Cisco Systems were still standing. At the end of 2000, Cisco ranked as the fourth most valuable company in the country, right behind General Electric, Exxon Mobil, and Pfizer. Wal-Mart ranked fifth, Microsoft sixth, followed by Citigroup, American International Group, Merck, and Intel. “Stocks like Cisco and EMC, both now at about 100 times trailing earnings, can remain high-priced for years,” Lehman Brothers’ Jeffrey Applegate asserted. Apparently it did not occur to most market strategists to compare the losses of 2000 to the mauling of 1970—in what turned out to be only the first leg down of the bear market of 1966–82.

Instead, Vanguard’s study revealed that if you pooled the experiences of all 401(k) investors—young and old, rich and poor—it turned out that more than 70 percent lost at least one-fifth of their savings during the three years ending December 31, 2002, with 45 percent of those surveyed losing more than one-fifth.8 An astounding number of media pundits seemed to think that this was good news. “401(k) plan participants are not suffering too much,” Business Week concluded after perusing Vanguard’s numbers.

- By now, it was becoming clear that, for many investors, 401(k) accounts would never match the nest eggs they would have had under a traditional pension system. In 2002, Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist, did the math: to produce the equivalent of a $20,000 annual company pension at the age of 65, a 401(k) investor would need to have accumulated $200,000 in savings by age 50. At the time, the 401(k) accounts of households in the 47-to-64 age group averaged only $69,000. The most desirable solution to the problem, Wolff suggested, “may be to re-establish the [old-fashioned] pension system.”15 But in 2003, it did not appear likely that employers were going to agree to switch back to what was, for them, a more costly alternative. Moving in precisely the opposite direction, they were cutting back funding of their 401(k)s. Companies like Goodrich, Textron, Goodyear, Ford Motors, and Charles Schwab had already announced that they were temporarily reducing or suspending their matching contributions.

- This, too, was part of the cleansing ritual that follows any financial frenzy, as John Kenneth Galbraith had noted in A Short History of Financial Euphoria. Galbraith explained that there are two reasons why the public focuses on a few individuals when assessing blame: “In the first place, many people and institutions have been involved, and whereas it is acceptable to attribute error, gullibility and excess to a single individual or even to a particular corporation, it is not deemed fitting to attribute them to a whole community, and certainly not to the whole financial community. Widespread naivete, even stupidity, is manifest; mention of this however, runs drastically counter to the…presumption that intelligence is intimately associated with money. The financial community must be assumed to be intellectually above such extravagance of error.” The second reason, Galbraith explained, is that investors are reluctant to admit that the market itself could have been wrong, allowing stocks to trade at ridiculous prices for a significant period of time. Those who believe in an efficient market insist that the market itself must be “a neutral and accurate reflection of external influences: it is not supposed to be subject to an inherent and ([Location 6415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6415))

- internal dynamic of error,” Galbraith observed. “This is the classical faith. So there is a need to find some cause for the crash, however far fetched, that is external to the market itself. Or some abuse of the market that has inhibited its normal performance.”27 In other words, while individuals can be fingered, few wish to recognize the systemic problem in corporate accounting that, in the Levy Center’s words, had infected not just a few apples, but “the whole bushel.”28 Similarly, while individual money managers might be roundly criticized for taking too many chances, the mutual fund industry as a whole escaped widespread blame. Few questioned why so many fund managers were forced to stay fully invested—even when it became clear that the market was tanking. “We have a special relationship with corporate America,” one industry executive explained privately.29 If his firm’s funds began withdrawing capital from overpriced stocks, the firm would be violating that special tie. He said nothing about a special relationship with the customers who invested in his firm’s products. ([Location 6424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6424))

- Despite three years of falling prices, which have significantly improved the attractiveness of common stocks, we still find very few that even mildly interest us. This dismal fact is testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during the Great Bubble. Unfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge. The aversion to equities that Charlie and I exhibit today is far from congenital. We love owning common stocks—if they can be purchased at attractive prices…. But occasionally successful investing requires inactivity. —Warren Buffett explaining why he and his partner, Charlie Munger, remained unenthusiastic about stocks (with the S&P 500 trading at 848.17, the Dow at 8181), February 21, 20031 ([Location 6573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6573))

- But in 1970, few investors were interested in oil and gas. Most were still obsessed with the Nifty Fifty—the market darlings that were about to betray them—and failed to notice just how cheap commodities had become. The pattern is an old one. “When a major theme ends, tremendous undervaluation exists in other sectors, because all the money was flowing during the final, manic stage of the boom into just one major investment theme,” Marc Faber, author of Tomorrow’s Gold, observed in 2002. “While everyone’s eyes are fixed on the cycle that is peaking, enormous opportunities arise elsewhere.” Over the course of a 30-year career, Faber had watched the tide turn many times: “gold, oil and gas, and foreign currencies—these were the major investment themes of the 1970s; Japanese stocks in the 1980s; emerging markets between 1985 and 1997; and US equities in the nineties.”4 ([Location 6599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6599))

- And Faber would always rather be early than late. “The greater damage is always done during the final phase of a bull market,” he observed. Instead of trying to ride a market to the very top, he would rather bail out before the final blow-off and concentrate his energies on finding the next investment theme. For the “greater the mania in one sector of a market, or in one stock market, the more likely that neglected asset classes elsewhere offer huge appreciation potential. This,” said Faber, “is one of the cardinal rules of investing, and will always work for the patient long-term investor.”7 But first, an investor must shrug off the conventional wisdom of the previous era.

- Even looking back over 34 years, from February 1969 through March of 2003, “stocks outperformed long-term Treasuries by a paltry 1% a year,” noted Martin Barnes, editor of The Bank Credit Analyst. In other words, for 34 years an investor could have been sleeping soundly—or lying awake, making that extra 1 percent. Granted, when compounded over 34 years, 1 percent adds up, but the 1 percent was not guaranteed, making it “a dismally small gap, given the extra volatility in stocks,” Barnes observed. This Barnes called “Wall Street’s dirty little secret.”8 (See chart “Stocks for the Long Run?” on page 356.) ([Location 6650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6650))

- “BUY AND HOLD” Inevitably the question arises: What if an investor bought stocks in, say, 1995, held until 2010, and continued to invest in the S&P each month? Would “buy and hold” work? No one knows. The real question comes down to this: Is the likely reward worth the risk? The danger is that, like a gambler in a casino, an investor who lost money after the bubble burst would think, “If I just stay a little longer, maybe I can make up for my losses…” “‘Stocks for the long run’ is an idea that has been drilled into the public—and the public has found it comforting,” Peter Bernstein, author of Against the Gods, observed in the spring of 2003. “People say, ‘I don’t care if my stocks are down. In the long run, I’ll be fine. But that’s a leap of faith. It’s not necessarily wrong—but it is a leap of faith.”10 What made Bernstein’s comment so notable is that in the early nineties he had written the foreword to a book that soon became the gospel for buy-and-hold investors, Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies. By the spring of 2003, however, Bernstein believed that the old rules no longer applied. “For now, equities aren’t the best place to be for the long run,” he told Kathryn Welling in an interview published in welling@ weeden. “The long run here is not necessarily going to bail you out,” Bernstein warned. “Or, even if it does, the margin by which equities will outperform could be too small to compensate for the volatility.”11 But what of Siegel’s argument that for more than 200 years, U.S. stocks have returned an average of 7 percent a year, after inflation? “The average dividend yield during all those 20-year periods that Jeremy [Siegel] looked at was over 4 percent,” Bernstein replied. Capital gains contributed only2.1 percent to that long-run 7 percent annual return. The rest was dividends. But in the spring of 2003, equities offered an average dividend yield of roughly 2 percent. “Which means that in order to achieve 7 percent real growth over the next 20 years, we’d need 5 percent real growth in earnings and dividends,” said Bernstein, “and that’s not exactly a reasonable expectation over the long run. Impossible, in fact.” The hard truth is that the market cannot grow that much faster than gross domestic product. In March of 2000, stocks were valued at 181 percent of GDP—up from 60 percent at the beginning of the decade.12 Yet “over time,” Bernstein noted, “real growth in earnings and dividends consistently lags long-run growth rates in real GDP—not just in the United States but in all other developed countries. Between 1900 and 2001, for instance, U.S. GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent in real terms, versus 1.5 percent earnings growth and just 1.1 percent dividend growth. And the U.S. economy was the most successful on the planet!” Bernstein added. Of course, an investor could gamble that dividends would climb higher—or that investors would push price/… ([Location 6671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6671))

- Yet by failing to take that step, an investor could be walking into the bear’s den. The history of the stock market shows that magnificent bull markets beget brutal bear markets. (See chart “The Market’s Cycles 1882–2003” on page 2.) This is why, in the summer of 2003, The Bank Credit Analyst’s Martin Barnes was “not optimistic about stocks on a long-run basis. After a bubble has burst, the classic pattern is for the market to trade sideways for years,” he explained, pointing to a chart of past financial manias. (See chart “The Profile of a Bubble,” Appendix, page 460.) History does not guarantee that bull and bear markets will be symmetrical. But both economics and investor psychology suggest that Warren Buffett may well have been right when he predicted that “the hangover is likely to be proportional to the binge.” Bubbles, after all, are caused by too much cash chasing one investment theme, leading to overinvestment followed by excess supply.13 “By 1999 the cost of capital for technology stocks was zero. When the cost of capital is zero—how many businesses do you start? You’re only limited by the waiting line to get lawyers and bankers to do the paperwork,” remarked Acorn Funds founder Ralph Wanger in 2003. “Whatever the idea is, it becomes a lousy idea if you dump enough money into it. Now that all has to get unwound.”14 ([Location 6707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6707))

- Investor psychology also plays a role. As Charles Dow had observed: “There is always a disposition in people’s minds to think the existing conditions will be permanent. When the market is down and dull, it is hard to make people believe that this is the prelude to a period of activity and advance. When prices are up and the country is prosperous,” investors are even more loath to believe that the years of plenty will end.17 So, in the spring of 2003, “the interesting thing is that people haven’t given up,” noted Acorn’s Ralph Wanger. “That’s the real news. People haven’t given up because the party was too good. How long will it take them? Before that happens, the stock market normally must revert to the mean—the historic average for stock prices. And, to do that, you have to spend some time below the mean—otherwise it’s not a mean. We haven’t even started doing that.”18 The mean serves as the magnetic center of all cycles. Over the years, the S&P 500 has traded at an average of 14 to 15 times earnings. During booms, financial markets trade far above their mean; during busts, far below. “We’ve looked at the price history of every asset class—stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities—and we have not found any that didn’t revert to its mean,” reported GMO’s Jeremy Grantham. “Whatever Greenspan does, whatever happens out there in the world, however strong the economy is, there is going to be a lot of pain. And then it will overrun its course. “The really bad news is that all bubbles over-correct, and that the timing and extent of the over-corrections appear to be largely unknowable but they usually take several years,” he added in June of 2003.19 Granted, the mean can move. Just because the S&P 500 has traded at 14–15 times earnings in the past ([Location 6734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6734))

- doesn’t mean that it always will. Changes in global economics and politics, could, over time, take the mean P/E on U.S. equities higher or lower. At the beginning of the 21st century, Jeremy Grantham believed that, with interest rates low, the mean might have migrated to 17½. But no one believed that the mean had risen to 31—or even 21. Yet in June of 2003, the S&P fetched about 31 times earnings for the preceding 12 months, and roughly 19 times forecast earnings for the coming 12 months—if you believed the analysts’ earnings estimates.20 Stocks still were not cheap. This was the major reason why value investors such as Richard Russell or Warren Buffett feared that the bear market was far from over. Price/earnings ratios offer one rough guide to the long-term returns that investors can reasonably expect. “History tells us that when you buy stocks with average P/Es on the S&P 500 under 10, then over the coming 10 years you’ll receive a median return of 16.9%,” Russell told his readers in June of 2003. By contrast, “when you buy stocks when P/Es are 16 to 17, over the coming 10 years your median return will be 10.7%. When you buy stocks when P/Es are 18 to 20 then over the coming 10 years your median return will be 7.5%. When you buy stocks when P/Es are 22, then over the coming 10 years your median return will be 5.0%. “What about today? What can you expect if you buy stock here?” Russell asked early in the summer of 2003. With the S&P fetching more than 30 times trailing earnings, Russell’s answer was: “Over the coming 10 years you’ll probably show a loss.” P/E ratios are not the only signpost, Russell added. “Using a different method based on a 10-year average of previous earnings, Peter Bernstein has shown that if you buy stocks now the odds are that over the coming 10 years, your stocks will be down one-third on average from where they are today.”21 Dividend yields also hinted that future returns were likely to prove paltry—especially since historically, dividends have made up such a large part of the stock market’s total return. “When you look at past secular market bottoms, the P/E on stocks was 10 and the dividend yield was 5 percent. You can talk about stocks at 15 times earnings being good value, but if you go back to 1942, 1949, 1974, 1980, and 1982, you will find P/Es of 10 and 5 percent dividend yields. We are not even close to that,” Ned Davis, founder of Ned Davis Research, an independent research firm, observed in June of 2003. “My guess is that, down the road, we’ll be facing another leg down—a crash more like 1973–74.”22 Davis was not alone. In the summer of 2003, old hands on Wall Street feared that the market had not yet touched bottom. After peaking, the average bear market in the last century has given back over five years of gains. If one assumed that the millennial boom peaked at the beginning of 2000, history suggested that the market could decline to 1995 levels. When 1995 began, the S&P ([Location 6748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6748))

- stood at 459 and the Nasdaq at 751. As for the Dow, it began the year at 3834. Five years is only a guess: history’s averages cover a broad range, and no two bear markets are alike. Each is unhappy in its own way. Nevertheless, those who believed big booms beget big busts worried that before the bear was done, the market would plunge below ’95 levels. When the bear market of 1966–82 found its low watermark in 1974, it gave back eight years of gains. At that point, investor psychology all but guaranteed that it would take many years to build a base for a new bull market. In a classic bear market, investors go through three stages, according to Russell: “The earliest stage is characterized by denial, increased anxiety, and fear. The second stage is panic. People suddenly say, ‘I’ve got to sell.’ The third phase is despair.”23 In the bear market that ran from ’68 to ’82, investors did not reach that third phase until after the second crash, the sickening plunge that ended in 1974. By then, the average stock purchased in ’68 had lost 70 percent of its value. A few years earlier, investors were eager to buy into the go-go market—at any price. Now investors no longer wanted to hear about stocks—at any price. This is why, in January of 1975,… ([Location 6771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6771))

- But despite the most ominous forecasts, within even the strongest boom and bust cycles, there are always intermissions. In 1990, for example, the bull paused, and the S&P 500 fell 6.6 percent. Similarly, during the lean years that stretched from 1966 to 1982, there were bright moments: in 1975 the S&P jumped 38.3 percent. At such moments, the bull stumbles or the bear pauses to digest—these are the boomlets and corrections that economists call “cyclical” bull and bear markets. They can last a year or more. But it is the longer waves, the “secular” bull and bear markets that determine the market’s primary trend for 10 or 15 or 20 years. “My great belief is that the only things that really matter in the stock market are the great bull cycles and bear cycles—not the interim bull markets, [but] the real humdingers, the ones ending in 1929, 1965 and 2000,” Jeremy Grantham declared in 2002. “They’re the ones that really count. And the bear markets that follow…tend to be very long. The first one in the 20th century lasted for 10 years, 1910 to 1920. The second one lasted from 1929 to 1944. And the third one lasted from 1965 to 1982, 17 years.

- term structural opportunity,” he cautioned in February of 2003. THE BEAR PUTS OUT HONEY: BEAR MARKET RALLIES Bernstein did not rule out the possibility of “monster” bear market rallies. “Rallies of 30% and even more are common in secular bear markets. Japan has had 9 rallies greater than 25% since 1990, and 3 that were greater than 40%,” he observed. “The U.S. experienced 13 bull markets of greater than 30% during its secular bears of 1902–1921, 1929–1949, and 1966–1982.”26 The media often does not distinguish between secular (long) and cyclical (short) bull and bear markets. So, during a bear market rally, a prophet will declare that a new bull market has begun—and it has—but this is not what Grantham would call one of “the real humdingers.” It is not a bull market that will reward a buy-and-hold strategy. In June of 2003, the market was turning up, and investors began to ask: Could the Dow once again cross 10,000? The answer was yes. The Dow might well break 10,000—or even 11,000—but the important question was this: Could it stay there, and if so, for how long?

- in. This is why bear market rallies also are called “sucker rallies.” Should an individual investor view bear market rallies as trading opportunities—a chance to get in, make a profit, and get out? In the summer of 2003, Richard Russell said no. It is too difficult to time a saw-toothed market. At the time, Russell himself was sticking to short-term treasuries, while hedging his portfolio with gold and gold mining shares.27 The problem is that bear markets often create the impression that something is happening, without quite delivering on the promise. “In the aftermath of a bubble, the stock market can become extremely volatile—without getting anywhere,” Ned Davis noted in the summer of 2003. “We did a study of 17 cyclical bull markets within secular bear markets,” he added. “In those markets the S&P 500 went up an average of 50% and the rally lasted an average of 371 days. But, they didn’t last as long as other cyclical bull markets—and didn’t go quite as high…. The rally was just a phase of a long-term bear market.”28 Bull markets reward risk taking, but when the bear puts out honey, he is usually laying a trap: “In recent years, U.S. investors have felt that they… ([Location 6809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6809))

- play to win. I have to play a game where I don’t make any mistakes.”29 In a bear market, this is what is most important: not making mistakes. The goal is to conserve capital. When a long bear market finally ends, those with cash will find bargains galore. But as investors learned in the late nineties, making a mistake, even on one stock, can be costly: lose 40 percent on one $50,000 investment and you need to make more than 60 percent on the remaining $30,000 investment—just to get back to square one. In the meantime, the investor has lost the opportunity to make money elsewhere—even if it was only an opportunity to make 5 percent. Over three years, 5 percent compounded, adds up to more than 15 percent. Investors who buy when too much money is chasing too few stocks often find that it takes a very long time to make up for what they have lost. Even the fleeting crash of 1987 could have a lasting effect on a portfolio, Steve Leuthold’s research revealed. Comparing an investor who put $1,000 into the S&P at its peak in August of ’87 to one who stashed his savings in risk-free T-bills, Leuthold showed that it would take the equity investor… ([Location 6820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6820))

- matter of months. High returns in the years that followed would airlift investors back to their master plan. By contrast, an investor who had the misfortune to invest $10,000 in the S&P 500 in January of 1973, at the peak of a bear market rally, would have to wait 12 years and 11 months to catch up with a neighbor who kept his money in T-bills—if the equity investor reinvested dividends. If he did not, the “catch-up” period would be 23 years and 1 month.30 The hypothetical example assumes that he bought at the zenith of the rally, but unfortunately, that is about when individual investors are inclined to join a bear market rally—after prices have been rising for many months and they feel secure. This is what many did during the bear market rally that followed the crash of ’29, and again in 1990, when Japanese stocks rallied following that market’s first leg down. In each case, investors were following the rule that they learned in a bull market: “The trend is your friend.” But in a bear market, “you have a whole different rule book,” Ralph Wanger observed. “In a straight-up growth market, your rule is to be 100 percent in equities all the time. Buy strength. Disregard risk. Only look at the income statement. And all stories are true, because we want… ([Location 6831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6831))

- statement, you look at the balance sheet [which shows a company’s debts]. All stories are false. It turns out that the guy in the bar is a married orthodontist from Connecticut.”31 And “selling strength” means viewing a bear market rally, not as a buying opportunity, but as a selling opportunity—a chance to realize losses and put the money to work someplace else. MANAGING RISK IN A BEAR MARKET Ultimately, secular bear markets teach investors to learn to manage risk in a different way, focusing, not on the odds, but on the size of the risk. Just how steep is the downside? A practical example explains the difference. “Let’s say you’re offered a wager where you’re told that the chances are 999 out of 1,000 that you’ll make $1, but if you accept the wager, there’s a 1 in 1,000 chance that you’ll lose $10,000,” said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of Fooled by Randomness. “Would you take the wager? Of course not. The frequency or probability of the loss is only 1 in 1,000, but that, in and by itself, is totally irrelevant. That probability needs to be considered within the context of… ([Location 6844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6844))

- said Taleb. “Investing in equities is often a successful strategy, but it does not matter how frequently a strategy succeeds if failure is too costly to bear.” In other words, an investor must always ask himself: What is the worst thing that can happen—and can I stand it?32 This is why a 55-year-old investor with a nest egg of $250,000 “would be crazy to put 80 percent of his money into the stock market,” Peter Bernstein declared in 2002. Even if the odds are high that over the next 10 years he will make money, “if he’s wrong, he is dead.” There is always the possibility, however slim, “that bears like Bob Prechter could be right,” said Bernstein, referring to Robert Prechter’s 2002 prediction that the Dow could fall below 1000. “No one knows.”33 The most dangerous error investors make, Bernstein and Taleb agreed, is “to mistake probability for certainty.” By concentrating on what is most probable, or what happens “on average,” investors often ignore the worst-case scenarios. For precisely this reason, said Taleb, investing can be more treacherous than a game of Russian roulette. “Reality is far more vicious…. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even… ([Location 6857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6857))

- the barrel of reality. One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette—and calling it by some alternative ‘low risk’ name. We see the survivors and never the losers…. The game seems terribly easy and we play along blithely.”34 So, in the late nineties, investors buying stocks at 100 times earnings did not recognize the size of the risks they were taking. They called the game of picking stocks by an alternative, low-risk name: “investing in an efficient market.” In fact, Taleb’s black swan could appear tomorrow. The stock that everyone said was a safe haven could blow up. Following a bear market rally, the Dow could suddenly drop 1000 points. “People tend to think of low-probability events as being distant in time,” said Bernstein. “In other words, we say, ‘Well, yes, gold went to $800 an ounce, but that was more than 20 years ago.’ Or, ‘Well, yes, in 1980 we had double-digit inflation—that couldn’t happen now.’” But he was emphatic: “Probability has nothing to do with time.” The surprise that would upset the best-laid forecasts could be waiting just around the corner. “When I explain this to people, they nod their… ([Location 6869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6869))

- term trend—to recognize, in Richard Russell’s words, “whether the tide is coming in or going out.” The Dow Theory that Russell used for nearly 50 years does not attempt to forecast the market’s short-term gyrations. As noted, it focuses on the underlying cycles. The strategy stood Russell in good stead. During the final two decades of the 20th century, readers who followed the advice in Richard Russell’s Dow Theory Letter earned, on average 11.9 percent a year, beating a buy-and-hold strategy, on a risk-adjusted basis, from June of 1980 to the end of 2001, according to Marc Hulbert, the editor of a newsletter that tracks financial newsletters. Russell’s record was particularly impressive given the fact that those two decades included a 17-year bull market—a time when a buy-and-hold strategy normally trumps market timing.36 Does Russell’s market timing work even better in a bear market? “The value of the strategy is more apparent in a bear market,” Hulbert allowed—then smiled. “But that’s like saying fire insurance works better when there is a fire.”37 Hulbert was right. Long-term market timing is designed to function like insurance—to protect an investor from the worst losses of a secular bear market. “In a bear market, everyone loses, but it is the people who lose the LEAST who are the winners,” Russell warned his readers in 2002.38 What Russell’s success suggests is that timing the long term can be far more fruitful than trying to predict the short term: “People ask what is going to happen next year, and I say I haven’t the faintest idea,” Jeremy Grantham admitted. “In general, the short term is unknowable and in an uncertain world, it should be unknowable.” By 1997, Grantham, like Gail Dudack, knew that the financial frenzy would not end pleasantly, though he did not know when. “These things are predictable, but at uncertain horizons,” said Grantham, a perspicacious, if occasionally prickly, Englishman. In other words, he could predict the ending, but not the way there. Some clients were unsatisfied. “How,” they asked, “is it possible to forecast the long run if you cannot predict the short run? After all, the long run is made up of a series of short runs.” This is a question that Grantham heard often, indeed more often than he wished to remember.

- As a new century began, investors who wanted to diversify began looking at natural resources. They seemed ready for a long-term move. In the eighties and nineties, while U.S. stocks and bonds soared, what the financial world calls “commodities” (which includes precious metals such as gold and industrial metals such as platinum, as well as crude oil and lumber, food, and fiber) languished, reaching a nadir at the end of the 20th century. Most made their lows between 1998 and 2002, and by June of 2003 many observers believed that a new cycle was beginning. “Commodities are up 77 percent from the lows they made in 1998,” Marc Faber observed, “a remarkable rise considering that investors had been saying that commodities would never rise again!” And because they were rising from such depths, plenty of upside remained. (See chart “Commodities Near All-Time Low,” Appendix, page 466.) The bear market in commodities that began in 1980 had started the way many bear markets do: overinvestment had led to excess capacity. “A decade of high real prices (and fat profit margins) during the 1970s encouraged a massive expansion in the supply of commodities on a global scale,” explained John Di Tomasso, founder of the Di Tomasso Group, a commodity trading advisor based in Victoria, British Columbia. “Then, from 1980 until 1993, prices came under constant pressure. A price recovery began in 1993 but it was snuffed out by the 1998 Asian financial crisis. As a result, commodity prices ([Location 6929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6929))

- When prices fall, “producers tend to respond in predictable ways,” Di Tomasso continued. “Mines are closed; exploration budgets are slashed; husbandry is neglected; herds are reduced; and crops are substituted. New production is discouraged. In a free market economy, production without profit cannot continue indefinitely. At some stage, prices must rise at least to the point where producers can earn a living. Otherwise, overall production of these raw materials will… ([Location 6944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6944))

- By 2000, Di Tomasso believed that the tide must turn: “Viewed within a long-term perspective, if reversion to historical ‘norms’ is a reasonable expectation, then commodity prices, in aggregate, could double,” he predicted. It has happened before—from the 1932 low to the 1934 high, in the midst of deflation and the Great Depression, commodity prices, on average, rose by 100 percent. “The point is this—commodity prices can increase if the decline in demand is met with a proportionately larger decline in supply (for example, OPEC’s modest crude oil production cutbacks in 1999 were followed by a tripling of energy prices).”42 He was right: as a new century began, the commodity index began to climb. Meanwhile, as emerging markets matured, demand for energy, food, and the raw materials of an industrial society grew. “If the world grows as much as people expect, demand will continue to rise,” said Faber in the summer of 2003. “In Asia, I can imagine oil consumption doubling over the next 10 years. Already, scooters are beginning to replace bicycles. China is importing more copper and iron ore. And each year, Asians are eating better—wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, cocoa, they should all benefit.

- same time, as was the case in Latin America in the eighties.” Gail Dudack agreed. “You could have the worst of all worlds: inflation in necessities—food, energy, housing, medical care—and deflation in other areas, with global competition keeping the price of manufactured goods [and profit margins] low.” Some investors favored spreading their risk by betting on a basket of commodities. In 2002, Pimco launched a fund that tracked an index of commodity futures contracts and was backed by Treasuries that protect against inflation (TIPS). This meant that an investor would benefit from any gains in commodity prices while also earning a T-bill rate on his underlying collateral. The fund was designed to “provide a hedge against inflation, particularly unexpected inflation,” Robert Greer, Pimco’s real return manager, explained. Equally important, the index fund allowed an individual to invest in energy, grains, metals, livestock, food, and fiber without trying to trade commodities futures himself. Finally, Greer suggested, “commodities could provide some protection from many geopolitical surprises that could adversely impact stocks and/or bonds.”44 In the nineties, many “natural resource” funds focused… ([Location 6960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6960))

- opened its commodities fund, Jim Rogers, who had co-founded the Quantum fund with George Soros, launched his own commodity index and a private fund based on it. By the spring of 2003, Rogers’s fund boasted a compound annual return of 14 percent. “I would much rather be in commodities than shares in the next few years,” said Rogers.45 At that point, it seemed likely that more funds might begin to follow the broad-based model, offering individual investors the opportunity to stake out a claim in the commodities market without betting all of their chips on oil and gas. GOLD AND THE DOLLAR Gold’s allure may be irrational, but for centuries the metal that John Maynard Keynes called “this barbarous relic” has had a nearly mystical hold on the human imagination. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that gold’s value seems eternal. “Gold is the child of Zeus; neither moth nor rust devoureth it,” Pindar wrote in the fourth century B.C. Fittingly, gold dissolves only in cyanide. Traditionally, gold has been viewed as a borderless currency.

By 2003, gold already had begun its ascent: Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Gold fund, for instance, rose 37.31 percent in 2001 before jumping 106.97 percent in 2002. (In 2003, as stocks rallied, gold lost ground, but in July, Eveillard’s fund remained up by more than 6 percent.) Despite enormous gains, investors like Richard Russell believed that gold’s turn in the sun had just begun. If they were right, the upside remained steep. In the middle of 2003, gold traded at around $350 an ounce; in the metal’s last secular bull market, which ended in 1980, it peaked over $800. Investors bullish on “gold for the long run” focused not on the question of deflation or inflation but on the central bankers’ global… ([Location 6984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6984))

- is why foreign investors were so eager to load up on Treasuries. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had concentrated his considerable intelligence and energies on keeping the dollar strong. At the beginning of the 21st century, however, Washington appeared content to see the dollar slide. Unemployment had risen; corporate profits were anemic. The administration’s hope was that a weaker dollar would help U.S. exporters by making their products cheaper abroad. The danger was that the dollar’s decline would accelerate. By June of 2003, the dollar had already tumbled to a point where one euro purchased $1.13; a year earlier, one euro equaled $.92. If the dollar continued to lose value, it was not at all clear what other currency could serve as the world’s safe haven. Economic problems in Japan ruled out the yen, and despite the euro’s recent rise, the new currency seemed neither old enough nor stable enough to serve as a magnet for the world’s wealth. Investors were beginning to move their money into real assets. “The recent rally in commodities, in gold, and possibly in real estate, are the shots across the bow for a long-term investor to shift back to hard assets in particular and commodities in general,” said Faber.48 But not all… ([Location 6995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=6995))

If rates rose, real estate prices would, all but inevitably, fall. In the end, for an individual investor, everything turned on the particular property, its location, how long he intended to hold it, and its “use value,” not just as an investment but as a home. For an investor looking for a home for his money, however, gold seemed to many the safe harbor of choice. Historically, when investors have lost faith that paper assets will hold their value (whether stock certificates or paper currencies), gold has provided shelter. For example, “during the Great Depression, Homestake Mining rose from $65 in 1929, to a high of $544 in 1936. Homestake also paid $171 in dividends—which was more than twice the price of its stock in 1929,” Marc Faber pointed out. During the seventies, gold once again soared.50 Still, even those who were most bullish about the long term did not pretend to forecast the short term… ([Location 7007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7007))

- Finally, if there was one new investment theme that stood out at the beginning of the 21st century, it was a desire for dividends. “What is rare is always most valuable,” Maureen Allyn, Scudder’s former chief economist, remarked in 2003, “and what is rare now is income.”55 During the Great Bull Market of 1982–99, dividends fell out of fashion. Indeed, they began to look decidedly dowdy. Who cared about a 5 percent dividend when capital gains of 15 to 20 percent were all but guaranteed? In the past, investors cherished their dividends; after all, they accounted for half of the stock market’s returns from 1926 through 1981. Without them an equity investor would have lost money in more than a third of those 56 years. But as Act III of the bull market began in 1995, all eyes were focused on capital gains. From the fall of 1996 through the fall of 2001, only 1.5 percent of the S&P 500’s 10.1 percent average annual return came from dividends. Companies were not paying dividends for a simple reason: they didn’t have to. “There was no pressure from shareholders,” observed Jim Floyd, a senior analyst at Leuthold’s firm. Even when bonds were paying 6 percent, stocks were able to compete on capital gains alone. Investors new to the market knew little about the history of dividends—or how important they were to supporting the mythology that surrounded “stocks for the long run.” ([Location 7042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7042))

- In the late nineties, investors did not just ignore dividends, they shunned companies that paid them. If a corporation lifed its dividend, its share price might well fall. In a corporate culture hooked on growth, sharing earnings with investors was seen as a sign of weakness. The conventional wisdom had it that if a company’s managers were on the ball, they could earn far more by retaining profits and plowing them back into the business. By 2003, however, the times were changing. In February, when Goodyear announced that it was dropping its dividend, the company’s share price plunged by 17 percent. The loss of the dividend was not the only reason shareholders dropped the stock (sales of the tires also had something to do with it), but the sharp reaction indicated that they were not pleased.56 “Dividends are going to come back,” said Ralph Wanger. “Shareholders are going to say, ‘You know you talked us into keeping the money in the company—you said you had great investment opportunities and we’d all be better off. And you deceived us.

- many theories about how to count them that no one was entirely certain just how profitable some of the nation’s largest corporations were. This is the problem with capital gains—they are gains only on paper, unless and until an investor sells his shares. “Today’s [low] dividend yield puts investors totally at the mercy of one another—what John von Neumann characterized as ‘combat and competition,’” Peter Bernstein observed at the end of 2001. “When cash flow is a trickle, the investor cannot obtain cash, for any purpose, without finding a buyer [for his stocks]. The buyer may or may not be there when needed. The price the buyer is willing to pay may or may not provide the total return the investor originally expected. Investments without cash flows are risky, uncertain.”57 Unlike earnings, dividends are forever; they can never be restated. “Dividends also demonstrate that management has enough confidence in the firm’s future to part with some cash,” Haywood Kelly, Morningstar’s editor in chief, observed. “This is why, historically, even though dividends per se do not… ([Location 7065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7065))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To an investor accustomed to the returns of a bull market, the idea of collecting 4 or 5 percent a year might well sound boring—and so it is, Richard Russell acknowledged, “until (after seven or eight years) when the money starts to pour in. Then, believe me, compounding becomes very interesting. In fact, it becomes downright fascinating!” Most investors have seen compounding tables that show how, over time, interest or dividends build wealth. (Boiling those tables down to a rule of thumb, “the rule of 72” says that 72, divided by an investor’s total return, tells him how long it will take for compounding to double his savings. For instance, if an investor earns capital gains of 3 percent and dividends of 5 percent for a total return of 8 percent, his money will double in nine years.) In 50-odd years of investing Richard Russell had never bought a stock that did not pay a dividend. Russell called compounding “The Royal Road to Riches,” in part because this is the route that “Old Money” has always taken. “In the investment world, the wealthy investor has one major advantage over the little guy, the stock market amateur and the neophyte trader,” he declared. “The advantage that the wealthy investor enjoys is that HE DOESN’T NEED THE MARKETS, because he already has all the income he needs. He has money coming in via bonds, T-bills, money market funds, stocks and real estate. In other words, the wealthy investor never feels pressured to ‘make money’ in the market.” ([Location 7101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7101))

- If an investor is paid while he waits for a new secular bull market to begin, he is less likely to make costly mistakes. He can afford to be patient: “When bonds are cheap and bond yields are irresistibly high, the wealthy man buys bonds,” Russell explained. “When stocks are on the bargain table and stock yields are attractive, he buys stocks. When real estate is a great value, he buys real estate. When great art or fine jewelry or gold is on the ‘give away’ table, he buys art or diamonds or gold.” And, if no outstanding values are available, the rich man sits on his hands. “Periods of inactivity” can be painful, as Warren Buffett acknowledged in the spring of 2003, but not nearly as painful as watching savings evaporate. Ultimately, Russell’s point was this: the poor man can become the wealthy man if he behaves as if he is already wealthy, scorning investments that do not provide income. The only exception is a situation that offers “safety, an attractive return, and a good chance of appreciating in price,” said Russell, setting a high bar. “At all other times,” he counseled his… ([Location 7113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7113))

- averages 7.7 percent a year (as it did in the seventies), an investor who holds on to an investment paying 5 percent loses 2.7 percent a year. By contrast, in an era when inflation hovers between 1 and 2 percent (as it did in 2003), a decent dividend makes all the difference. If an investor is saving for retirement, all that matters is the “real return” on his savings, after inflation. His only concern is not how much money he will have but how much that money will be worth. If an investor could stay, say, 2 to 3 percent ahead of inflation on every penny he saved over a lifetime, he would do very well. Unfortunately, in 2003 virtually every pundit acknowledged that inflation was not dead, merely hibernating. (The idea that we had come to the End of History came and went sometime in the nineties.) No one knew when it might return. Both reasonable and unreasonable men offered cogent and not so cogent arguments as to why inflation or deflation was more likely. Some, like Gail Dudack and Marc Faber, recognized that it would be quite possible to have both at the same time. Whenever inflation appears—whether in 10 months or in 10 years—it turns the “miracle” of compounding on its head.

- created TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), Treasury bonds that come with insurance against rising prices.62 Like plain-vanilla Treasuries, TIPS are backed by the federal government. When they mature, an investor can be certain of getting his principal back, plus a guaranteed fixed dividend. The difference is that TIPS also offer a buffer against inflation: each year that the dividend falls short of inflation (as measured by the consumer price index), the government pays a bonus to bridge the gap. In other words, the investor knows that his savings will always outpace inflation. His total return floats, but it cannot fall below the guaranteed yield. The fixed yield on TIPS can seem small, but with the inflation booster built in, TIPS compare favorably to other Treasuries. By 2003, TIPS had become so popular that funds investing in TIPS were soaring. For example, the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund boasted a total return of 16.6 percent in 2002, and 7.1 percent in the first five months of 2003. Because mutual funds trade TIPS, they offer the possibility of fatter returns in the form of capital gains as well as dividends.

- But while history may repeat, it always repeats with a difference. No two bear markets are alike. And in the spring of 2004, not everyone believed that the market faced a second leg down. Veterans such as Gail Dudack and Steve Leuthold suggested that the market might simply trade sideways for the rest of the decade, without making a new bottom—or a new top. “It could be a lot like the seventies,” Leuthold suggested, referring to that frustrating stretch from 1974 to 1982 when, despite numerous peaks and valleys, the Dow never managed to breach its precrash highs. As for the current rally, in April of 2004 Leuthold predicted: “We might have six to eight months left—at most. Then we’ll need to get defensive for another six to nine months.” Looking ahead to 2005, Leuthold expected a series of mini-bull and mini-bear markets. “Market timers and asset allocators could do pretty well in this type of market,” he added. “But this is not a market for ([Location 7234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7234))

Most individual investors, however, did not distinguish between short, “cyclical” bull markets—which can easily turn into bear traps—and the real McCoy, “secular” bull markets, which can last for 15 or even 20 years. As far as most 401(k) investors were concerned, the bull was back, and they did not want to miss a bull run. Indeed, Leuthold confided that he was “amazed” to see just how quickly individual investors were “drawn back to the flame.” Nevertheless, he understood that in the spring of 2004, many felt that they had no choice but to stash their savings in stocks. With interest rates at a 46-year low, money market accounts, CDs, and even Treasuries held little more allure than the proverbial mattress. As Leuthold put it, “stocks are the only game in town.”15 ([Location 7241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7241))

- Nevertheless, the bulls argued that the pile of debt was no problem. With rates so low, America’s families could afford to carry the load. Bears remained concerned: despite low rates, by March of 2004, the amount the average family now paid to service debt was approaching an all-time high. What would happen when rates rose? One thing was clear to even the most bullish observers: consumer spending alone could not sustain a recovery. The nation would not be able to shop its way out of a bear market. Rather than simply consuming wealth, the economy needed to begin producing it. Washington’s hope had been that consumer spending would lead to productive investment: if consumers created enough demand, they reasoned, this would spur businesses to make new capital investments, expand their businesses, increase production, and create enough new jobs to replace not only those that had been lost, but those needed to absorb new graduates entering the workforce each year. By the spring of 2004, this still had not happened. ([Location 7288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0013L2BKW&location=7288))

The war on terrorism, which was expanded to include a war in Iraq, accounted for only a part of the government’s debt: from 2001 to 2004, spending outside defense, homeland security, and defense-oriented foreign aid had jumped 23 percent, or more than 7 percent annually.23 Then there was the trade deficit. The United States continued to consume more than it produced, which meant that the gap between imports and exports was widening. By the end of 2003, the shortfall stood at a record $489 billion. For years, foreigners had been financing that deficit by using the dollars they received for their exports to buy U.S. Treasuries. But as U.S. debt grew, some began to fear that the world would no longer see the dollar as a safe haven. Indeed, by 2004, the greenback had fallen sharply against most major currencies.24 Yet the United States continued to depend on foreigners to buy its debt: in 2003 kind strangers owned more than a third of all government bonds.

- letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. “Late in 2002, however, the world started choking on this diet, and the dollar’s value began to slide….” Yet, Buffett observed that an ongoing trade deficit meant “whether foreign investors like it or not, they will continue to be flooded with dollars. The consequences of this are anybody’s guess. They could, however, be troublesome—and reach far beyond currency markets.” With that in mind, in 2002 Buffett had waded into the foreign currency market for the first time in his life, hedging against the dollar’s decline. In 2003, he reported that he had enlarged his position as he “grew increasingly bearish on the dollar.”25 Buffett was not alone. Chairman Greenspan’s critics argued that by flooding the world with dollars the Fed had been trying, quite literally, to “paper over” a financial crisis, and in the process had only postponed what Jim Grant called the stock market’s inevitable “rendezvous with fair value.”26 The artificial stimulus of easy money might keep the economy going through 2004, they acknowledged.
