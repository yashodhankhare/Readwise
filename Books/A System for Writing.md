## Highlights
- By giving your ideas a place to land, an inbox helps alleviate some of the potential anxiety that initially comes from working non-hierarchically (5.6). Later, when you process your inbox (that is, convert your fleeting notes into main notes), you can bring only what remains interesting into your network of ideas. I recommend processing the contents of your inbox at least once a week. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=247))

- If an idea feels particularly “zettel worthy,” write “ZK” next to it. Later in the day or week, scan your journals to see what of these captures you’d like to import into your zettelkasten as main notes, and do so.

- Fleeting notes are not stored in your zettelkasten. “Zettel worthy” fleeting notes must be transformed into main notes if they’re to become useful. Not all fleeting notes need be transformed into main notes. For best results, practice non-attachment when it comes to fleeting notes.

- The easiest way to turn your journals into sources is to add unique identifiers. If you’re working with digital journals, add dates to both your file names and each day inside the file. I have a separate file for each year, with a running list of days starting with the most recent day at the top. Physical journals are handled in a similar way. Date each notebook or give it a volume number, then add dates and/or page numbers to the entries inside. Adding these unique identifiers makes it possible to create reference notes from your journals (Fig. 17). ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=420))

- In addition to passages that speak to previously captured ones, try experimenting with the following: Read with a question or problem in mind. While writing Sitting With Spirits, I read both Rollo May and Carl Jung to learn what each had to say about daemons. I read Allan Kardec to gain insight into how he categorized spirits. I revisited my post-grad textbooks on Traditional Chinese Medicine to refresh my memory on how the Five Spirits function. When you have an agenda, all forms of media can be mined for inspiration and information. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=438))

- Capture ideas you disagree with. I once had an art history professor who on the first day of class told us, “I’m an expert on Cubism, because I hate Cubism.” I knew exactly what she meant, (although, admittedly, I’m a fan of the modernist movement). I find I’m never more verbose than when I disagree with something an author has said. So, don’t be afraid to capture ideas that rub you the wrong way. The stuff that gets under your skin can be incredibly motivating. Capture what you think about what the author thinks. Reader-response theory posits that no one person, not even the author, has a monopoly on the meaning of a text. Rather, meaning is created through the act of reading. And, meanings can be many. In her seminal book, The Reader, the Text, the Poem, leading theorist of “transactional” reading, Louise M. Rosenblatt, states: The range of potential responses [to a text]...are infinitely vast, since they depend not only on the character of the text but even more on the special character of the individual reader.23 There’s always a reason to learn more about what an author thinks. But, unless you’re writing a dissertation on a particular person, it’s sometimes more ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=443))

- useful to better understand what you think about the subjects the author discusses.24 Capture passages that inspire your own thoughts even if you don't fully understand those of the author. Capture someone else’s interpretation. Sometimes you feel drawn to an idea, but don’t know why. When in doubt, cite it in a reference note. For one thing, you can always come back to the capture and see if its relevancy has increased. But, you can also phone a friend or read someone else’s take. Record these in your notes, and cite your sources. As literary critic, Stanley Fish, states, “[I]t is interpretive communities...that produce meanings.”25 Lean on people you trust for insight, and insight will eventually come. Don’t forget fiction. Using a zettelkasten to capture ideas conveyed through fiction is done in the same way you would any other work. But, fiction also makes it possible to engage with ideas in novel ways. Keep an eye out for character behaviors and traits, narrative arcs, scenes, and settings, all of which can be mined for insights.… ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=455))

- see them as doing a certain kind of cultural work within a specific historical situation, and value them for that reason. I see their plots and characters as providing society with a means of thinking about itself....26 Reading fiction is a great opportunity to explore the many different ways authors comment on society. Go wild with your captures. In his book, North of Intention, Steve McCaffery states that “Problems in readership arise only from a refusal to abandon prejudicial reading habits,”27 a sentiment echoed by Juliana Spahr in her book, Everybody’s Autonomy: Wild reading…critiques the status quo because it disrupts schooled reading’s conventions, its socialization. One’s approach to reading…defines how one engages the larger social apparatus.28 How you read is in part determined by how you view the world, and vice versa. If you find the world to be a wild place, which it is, approach your texts with the same spirit.

- The most important thing about any form of reference note-making is to, at some point, return to the note. It’s the “going back” that makes all the difference, understanding that your initial scribble isn’t the end of the capture. It’s the beginning. A reference note is to be used as a reference. Its contents to be transformed into main notes. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=529))

- Niklas Luhmann’s reference notes served as a reservoir from which he could source ideas. But, he didn’t make main notes off of every capture. Nor should you feel pressured to do so. Like fleeting notes, not everything you capture in a reference note need be transformed into a main note. Feel free to make as many or as few main notes from your reference note, remembering that you can always come back to it later. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=532))

- Things to Remember A reference note is a single long-note containing citations related to interesting passages you came across while reading a book (or engaging with another form of media). Reference notes are stored in your zettelkasten. In addition to fleeting notes, a reference note is one of the resources you will use to create main notes. It’s possible that only some of the citations you captured in your reference note will be converted into main notes. “Reference notes,” “literature notes,” “bibliographic notes,” and “source notes” are different names for the same note. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=547))

- 3.1 What’s Inside a Main Note? In its most basic form, a main note should have at least two components: a single idea, and a link to another idea stored in your zettelkasten ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=564))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- These two elements—a single idea and a link to another idea—are so important that if your notes were to contain nothing else, you’d be well on your way to writing reams of prose. But, main notes can and usually do contain additional information that makes them all the more useful. Other elements that can be included in your main notes are: a title a quote or reference to where the idea comes from a record pointing to where and how the idea has been used in your writing a unique ID ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=570))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Titles A title acts as a condensed thesis summing up the content of the idea stored in the note.32 It should be a declarative statement rather than a descriptor.33 “Not all apples are edible” is a better title than “Apples and edibility.” The former tells the note maker what’s being said inside the note while the latter hints at the topic to which the idea might be speaking. There’s also the issue of duplication. Declarative statements make it easier to tell if you’ve already captured an idea, while a descriptor like “Apples and edibility” could contain any number of ideas going in any number of directions. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=587))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A Record of Ideas You’ve Put to Use One of the great benefits of creating dynamically linked, single-idea notes is that they can be reused.34 An idea dealing with labor need not only contribute to trains of thought dealing with work. It may also contribute to others dealing with immigration, Marxism, capitalism, agricultural legislation, the creative economy, the religious concept of “idle hands,” childbirth, and more. The more connections you make, and the more writing you create from these connections, the more important it’ll be to track how and where an idea has been used in your writing.35 Alphanumeric IDs You may have noticed a string of numbers and letters at the beginning of the titles in the examples above. These alphanumeric IDs, sometimes called folgezettel,36 give notes a permanent identity that can be referenced regardless of any changes made to the note’s ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=597))

- content. These will be discussed in chapter 5. 3.2 Why Is There so Much Stuff in My Notes? Everything that goes into creating main notes increases its value by making the idea more useful, connectable, memorable, and a joy to work with. If you’re feeling like there’s a lot going on inside main notes, remember it’s all done in service of your future self. The “you” that’s looking at your notes today isn’t the same “you” that created them and will not be the same “you” five years from now looking to your notes for insight and guidance. You’ll have grown, been introduced to new ideas and forgotten old ones. Your future self will benefit from having quality information to go on. If you take just a few moments to add useful information to your main notes when you create them, you’ll save yourself hours reinventing the wheel. Remember, you don’t need to engage with every aspect of every note every time you use it. Scan the note for what’s most relevant… ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=606))

- To process your inbox, take out or open one of the notes contained inside. Read the note to see if it contains something that might be useful for your thinking. If the note contains a reminder or task, set it aside (1.9:3). If the note contains an idea, consider if it speaks to another already stored in your zettelkasten, or if it’s a new idea you’d like to develop. If the idea is one you aren’t ready to examine, send it down to your “Sleeping” folder (if it isn’t there already). If the idea is inspiring you to think and write, read below. Creating Main Notes from Fleeting Notes Retype or copy/paste the idea into a new file, rewriting it if necessary, using complete sentences that capture the crux of the thought you’re trying to convey. Consider if/how this idea relates to another already stored in your zettelkasten. If the idea is unrelated to anything else, edit the idea so it’s readable, and import it without linking the idea to others. If the idea relates to another already networked in your slip box, either rewrite it to speak directly to the other idea, or reference the previously captured idea and state why you’… ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=617))

- other ideas stored in your zettelkasten (4.2:2). These connections establish additional trains of thought to which the idea can speak. Record these links in the note and give context for each, explaining why the connections were made (4.4). Once you’ve completed the above, give the note a title that briefly sums up the idea in a concise statement. This will help you remember its contents when browsing your files. Creating Main Notes from Captures in a Reference Note The first thing to do when creating a main note from a reference note citation is to retype, copy/paste, or reference the quote you want to comment on in a new note. This serves two purposes: It reminds you of where your idea came from. It helps you decide whether your idea is restating the quote or if the idea was merely inspired by the quote. (This will determine if/how you cite the source in your writing). The rest of the procedure is… ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=628))

- note a title. Creating Main Notes from Your Own Writing While it may seem obvious that main notes will be created from passing thoughts and other people’s ideas, your own writing can also be used as a source for main notes. Blogs, articles, newsletters, tweets, emails, and comments on forums can all be parsed out and repurposed as main notes to be reused in other pieces of writing or thought work. This can be done more or less in the same fashion as above: Copy and paste the idea into a new note. Consider its relation to other notes already stored in your zettelkasten. Link it. Give it an alphanumeric ID. Title it. Store it among your main notes. As a rule of thumb, it’s best to treat your own work the same as you… ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=638))

- Balancing “In Spite of” with “In Light of” The need to “carve out time,” to “fit it in,” to “make it part of one’s routine” has made dynamic, back-and-forth communication with the slip box a rarity. Not surprisingly, some note makers feel content with simply making “good” notes, focusing most of their attention on how best to pare an idea down to its “atomic unit.” In this environment, where notes function as autonomous nodes of information rather than as a means for communicating with one’s past, present, and future selves, communication with the zettelkasten risks becoming “an exchange of prepackaged commodities.”41 In this situation, the ability to dialog with one’s zettelkasten becomes yet another zettelkasten “myth.” And yet, the myth holds true. By regularly coming back to your zettelkasten even at short, inopportune times, you develop a familiarity with its contents and, even while reading, are reminded of ideas stored inside. If, when developing an idea you pause to consider the contents of your zettelkasten, you can build off what’s already been captured while creating bridges to both obvious and seemingly disparate trains of thought. By balancing the retrofitting of independent ideas in spite of what’s in your zettelkasten with developing ideas in light of others already stored therein, the zettelkasten speaks back, revealing “unpredictable combinations.”42 Here, ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=733))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- dialog with the slip box becomes the standard not the exception. 3.6 Main Notes that Contradict Other Main Notes Communicating with your slip box doesn’t mean you’ll agree with everything you hear. There’s always the possibility newly captured ideas will contradict or challenge others previously imported into your zettelkasten. When this happens, you may be inclined to change the previously captured idea to better align with the new information, or delete the old note altogether. But, there is another way. Niklas Luhmann didn’t revise his notes when new information presented itself that contradicted previously captured thoughts. As Johannes Schmidt writes, “[P]otential mistakes and red herrings...were revised by later entries, but not eliminated, as once a card had found its way into the index, it stayed there.”43 There’s no need to overhaul or change a note’s argument just because another refutes it. Doing so will complicate both the note and its ability to network within the slip box. Instead, create a new note containing the counter argument, state why this new idea bests its predecessor, link the new note to the one it challenges, and import it into the zettelkasten. Wrong ideas, if given context, can serve not only as counter arguments to be incorporated into your writing, but can be used to show how your own beliefs have shifted over time.

- Ideas you once held with which you no longer agree, if handled with humility, show your humanity. This makes for good writing. 3.7 Every Main Note Need Not Represent Your Current Thinking The question of contradictory ideas is really a question of perfection: Must each main note be a perfect summation of your current thinking? The short answer? No. Niklas Luhmann is explicit, while characteristically opaque, when he refers to the zettelkasten as a “septic tank,” advising note makers to not include “only those notes which have been clarified.”44 Relationships between ideas are what give them value. Over time, with the addition of new notes, your zettelkasten will help to separate out which ideas remain useful and which ones fall by the wayside. Johannes Schmidt speaks to Luhmann’s point stating: [Luhmann’s] main concern was not to develop an idea to maximum sophistication before including the note into the collection; rather, he operated on the assumption that a… ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=755))

- context of an inquiry, i.e. in using the card index as a database for new thoughts and publications.45 Take Schmidt’s words to heart. You don’t need to have it all figured out when creating main notes. Individual main notes don’t need to be perfect representations of your current thinking. They don’t need to contain the latest information, nor “all the links.” And, they don’t need to agree with one another. As your zettelkasten grows, and you import new ideas, more As your zettelkasten grows, and you import new ideas, more will be revealed as to how significant and useful the ideas are within it. Trust that the contents of the main note—the single idea, sources, and contextualized references to other notes—will work on your behalf when necessary. Allow yourself to lean into the controlled chaos of the zettelkasten.

- Before splitting it up, the original note would have been tethered exclusively to trains of thought about discrepancies. Now you have options. “Apples are good for your health” can now inform those dealing with classism, eating plans, nutrition, and discrepancies; all made possible by atomizing the original idea. What level of atomicity works best for you is personal. As a PKM comrade of mine has said, “make a note that contains the fewest number of pieces as necessary to be useful for its specified task.”51 In other words, shoot for “atomic enough.” Over time you’ll get a feel for at what point an idea becomes either too simplistic or too complex.

- Atomicity Allows You to Repurpose Ideas According to literary critic and semiotician, Julia Kristeva, written texts are “constructed as a mosaic of quotations” in which other texts are “absorbed” and “transformed.”52 Speaking on intertextuality—the idea that all written works influence and are influenced by other written works—Kristeva states in a not-atypical way that “each word (text) is an intersection of word (texts) where at least one other word (text) can be read.” Atomicity plays right into this understanding. As discussed above, ideas reduced to their essentials are highly connective, making it easy to repurpose them in different contexts. But, repurposing isn’t only about how ideas link to one another inside your zettelkasten. It’s also the means by which they’re imported. Working with a Luhmann-style zettelkasten is, in part, a practice of decomposition, where a writer’s previously structured thoughts are disassembled, to be networked in the… ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=903))

- the surface this pillaging may seem destructive, even an affront to something sacred, it’s actually one of the primary means by which new ideas are developed. Most long-form, non-fiction writing is structured to reveal a single argument or thesis (or series of single-ish arguments and theses).54 In these works, the thesis is built upon smaller claims; supported and organized to reveal a “proven” argument. For example, the thesis... “The riot grrrl band, Bratmobile, was a manifestation of third-wave feminism.” ...can be arrived at via two supporting claims: “Third-wave feminism critiqued second-wave’s reinforcing of hetero-normative beliefs.” “Bratmobile challenged prevailing hetero-normative conventions within the indie/punk music scene.” Just because the three statements work together to form a solid argument, doesn’t mean this is the only context in which they work.

Even the thesis, if taken out of its original context, could be used, not as a thesis, but as an aspect of a discussion on the prevalence of toxic-masculinity in 90s hardcore music.

- Linking and atomicity aren’t only about increasing the number of places an idea can be taken. They’re also about the quality of your trajectories. The writers I’ve found most inspiring have been those who make revelatory, revolutionary, and unexpectedly wild connections. Mikhail Itkin writing about the intersection of Christianity and queer, radical, faerie activism; David Graeber and Julianna Spahr each writing about anarchism, one in relation to anthropology, the other poetry; Ian Svenonius and Dick Hebdige writing about the semiotics of rock n roll through a Marxist lens; Michael Muhammad Knight writing about Islam’s intersection with punk rock, ayahuasca, William Burroughs, and magic. These are the kinds of connections one can make when working with a Luhmann-style zettelkasten. In his essay, “Communicating With Slip Boxes,” Luhmann states that writers using a zettelkasten should “seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected,” that “it is more fruitful to look for formulations of problems that relate heterogeneous things with each other,” and that “[t]he ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=947))

- slip box provides combinatorial possibilities which were never planned, never preconceived.”57 Referring to the way he might organize a lecture, Luhmann states in an interview, “New ideas emerge from the different possible combinations of the pieces of paper [stored in the zettelkasten].”58 For those of us who love exploring how seemingly dissonant ideas interact, a zettelkasten provides ample opportunities to explore radical ideas in the margins of contemporary thought. The example below (though, admittedly, far from “radical”) shows how two ideas that shouldn’t have anything to do with one another intersect (see notes 1.2b and 2.1b1): 1 APPLES 1.1 Not all apples are considered edible 1.1a Crab apples are often mistaken for cider apples 1.2 There are many different kinds of apples 1.2a Macintosh apples are native to Canada 1.2a1 Macintosh apples entered commercial production in 1870 1.2a2 Macintosh apples were discovered by John McIntosh 1.2b Pink lady apples are a branded apple 1.2c Honey crisps were created in Minnesota 1.3 Apples are a kind of fruit 1.3a Apples have been cultivated for roughly 8,000 years 1.4 Apples can be an integral part of a healthy diet 1.4a Eating too many apples has been known to cause spikes in blood sugar 2 SPORTS AND SUBCULTURE 2.1 Skateboarding is not a crime 2.1a Many townships have begun to soften laws against ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=955))

- skateboarding 2.1b Skateboarding slogans are subcultural markers and dog whistles 2.1b1 Commercial interests co-opt subculture symbols and turn them into branding When I look at notes 1.2b and 2.1b1, I see a possible relationship between the branding of apples and how branding is used to co-opt subcultures. Something about the mundanity of a common fruit set alongside the subversive nature of underground youth movements, and how both are subject to corporate interests, intrigues me. And, while this example might seem rather tame, think about what happens if I inform this connection with ideas stored in my zettelkasten that discuss the corporatization of healthcare in the United States. What about notes on the use of psychology in advertising, or those that reference ideas captured from Shoshana Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism? There are also my notes on the situationist theory of “the Spectacle,” as well as notes on the “industrial food complex.” All of a sudden, my passing thought about how branding functions becomes much more intriguing.

- It took me three months of tossing and turning before it clicked: relationships. Embracing and leveraging the symbiotic relationships between connected ideas is the means by which we engage (and locate) our notes. For note takers who require hierarchy and order, the anarchy of ideas can be a frightening place. The potential for getting lost inside the zettelkasten can feel anxiety producing, even threatening. But, rather than structuring the zettelkasten with fail-safes against getting lost, we should embrace the benefits ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1010))

- Dr. André Kieserling, one of Luhmann’s primary editors, speaks to this same experience with regards to working with a zettelkasten. For Kieserling, working with a zettelkasten is “a way of finding something that you weren’t looking for, but can still use.” More to the point: Just as in good libraries there is a book next to [the one you were originally searching for], that may be more informative than the book originally sought. So, [the zettelkasten is] a way of allowing oneself to be surprised by what one had entered from a completely different point of view.59 When Luhmann states that “[t]he slip box provides combinatorial possibilities which were never planned, never preconceived,” this is what he’s referring to—looking for one thing and finding another. But, this is only possible if relationships between ideas are regularly and proactively established. As Luhmann states: A note that is not connected to this network will get lost in the card file and will be forgotten by it. Its rediscovery depends on accidents and on the vagary that this rediscovery means something at the time it is found.60 Luhmann’s thinking comes from experience, as Johannes Schmidt writes: [W]e repeatedly find sets of cards that have not, or rarely, been revisited since the time they had been created, which can be inferred from their condition and the fact that no later notes were added and no other cards refer to them.61 For Luhmann, an idea’s ability to be recalled was due to its having been networked within the slip box where trains of thought had been established. So long as the beginning of a train of thought was noted elsewhere (6.3), he could… ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1016))

- There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order. Therefore, there is no need to worry about which alphanumeric IDs have already been taken.

- It can be helpful to think of alphanumeric IDs as you would street addresses. You’d never assume the occupant of 1 Middle Rd was the parent of the occupant living at 2 Middle Rd. Nor would you assume the occupant of apartment 1A was a sibling of the occupant living in apartment 1B. Relationships are determined by who occupies the address, not the address itself. Similarly, an idea contained in note 4.6a1 is not necessarily a “parent” of an idea contained in note 4.6a1a, despite both existing on the same “street.” Folgezettel only shows that there is a relationship. It doesn’t show the nature of that relationship. ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1213))

- 5.7 Three Reasons for Using Alphanumeric IDs As we come to the end of our discussion of alphanumeric IDs, you may be wondering if the practice is right for you. Fortunately, if you’re working with a paper-based zettelkasten, the answer is simple: yes it is. Working with a paper-based slip box requires some form of unique identification to locate notes. And yet, while this may not be a necessity for digital zettelkästen, there are still reasons why you may want to use such a system. Folgezettel provides a bird’s-eye view of your notes. Folgezettel provides a bird’s-eye view of the initial connections that were made between ideas as they were imported into the zettelkasten. This allows you to see these connections without having to pull out a single note. Luhmann speaks to the value of this practice when he recommends writing on only one side of the note “so that in searching through them, we do not have to take out a paper in order to read it.”68 For Luhmann, ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1239))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the ability to hover before diving in was beneficial. Maybe even preferable. Having the ability to scan and see connections helps writers navigate slip boxes that have grown in size, becoming too large to investigate “from one’s chair.”69 For prolific writers who publish weekly or daily, the ability to see a vast array of top-level connections quickly across subjects isn’t only important, but crucial. Folgezettel forces you to connect newly imported ideas. Aside from scanability, using folgezettel can also influence your note-making practice. This is particularly apparent when converting notes from fleeting to main notes. Forced to try and establish at least one connection between new notes and those already stored in the zettelkasten begins the process of creating trains of thought and making meaning of your captures. “Eufriction” is good friction. Just as weight training, writing a book, and giving birth are considered forms of “eustress,”70 that is high-intensity activities that have beneficial results, so too is folgezettel a form of “eufriction,” a slowing down to better engage with the work in front of you. Having to manually apply alphanumeric IDs to notes decelerates the note-making process just enough to force you to think about what you’re doing. It builds good habits. It strengthens mental connections. It’s the kind of friction needed to help those who tend to dump links in their notes without taking the time to convey why they’ve done so.

- The Keyword Index Hub notes and structure notes are, by design, relatively prescribed ways of engaging with the zettelkasten. Niklas Luhmann’s keyword index,87 on the other hand, functioned like an oracle. Luhmann’s keyword index wasn’t exhaustive. At most, each listed keyword had only four references to where the term could be found (in a slip box containing over sixty thousand notes!). The assumption was the references in the notes would be enough to direct Luhmann where he needed to go once he entered the slip box.88 Which is not to say Luhmann used his keyword index to locate specific notes. Luhmann is clear his zettelkasten wasn’t meant to be used primarily for storing and retrieving individual ideas.89 Instead, the slip box, via the keyword index, was meant to induce “serendipity.”90 As Johannes Schmidt states: [A]ccessing the file via the keyword index...does not limit the search to that term. Quite to the contrary.... [A]ny search soon opens up a vast web of notes.... [A] query via the keyword index brings chance into play and creates connections among a variety of heterogeneous aspects.91 In reading Schmidt’s description, I can’t help but think of experimental musician, John Cage’s, “chance operations” where aspects of the creative process were left up to external conditions (i.e., star charts) or the rules of a predefined process (i.e., a song must begin and end with a specific note).

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Regardless of which approach you take, keywords need not only speak to topics and themes. They could also point toward emotions and experiences. If you want to feel your way through your ideas, you might include indexed references to “Ideas that make me laugh” or “Ideas that make me want to change the world.” You might also include references to repeated situations in which certain ideas arise: “Ideas that arise in therapy,” or “Morning walking thoughts.” So long as your index helps you engage with your zettelkasten, it’s a functioning index.

- 7.1 Let Your Zettelkasten Tell You What to Write About One of the many myths surrounding the zettelkasten speaks of a slip box that communicates to writers what they should write. Like many myths, the above is more truth than fact.94 A zettelkasten will not tell you what to write. It will not literally speak to you. But, visible areas of increased connectivity within the slip box, what Sönke Ahrens calls “clusters,”95 can guide you toward ideas ready for expression. Niklas Luhmann referred to these active areas as “lumps” or “regions with which we will work more often than ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1454))

- with others.”96 These areas of increased connectivity, embedded within the zettelkasten’s distribution of notes, are clues pointing toward ideas of developing complexity. Below are a few ways this complexity is revealed. ([Location 1460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1460))

- Trains of thought can begin anywhere within the alphanumeric sequence (5.2). If after examining the contents of the notes above only a few remained interesting, then those would be the notes you’d work with. Clusters of ideas forming inside the zettelkasten are suggestions, not mandates. Look inside your zettelkasten and see if any areas have similarly swelled. Open or take out each note to see if there’s a train of thought you’d like to unpack and develop. Then, copy/paste or rewrite the main ideas into a new document. If writing isn’t your primary objective, create a structure note following the steps laid out in chapter 6, rearranging and expanding on your ideas. Be sure to examine not only the main ideas, but also links and references to others in your zettelkasten. Doing so will help reveal the many places your ideas can go. Reference notes show what’s been catching your attention. Reference notes can be surprising. If you allow your capturing of citations to be “wild” (2.5), you’ll find that what catches your attention while reading sometimes differs from what you expected to write about later. Imagine taking notes on a book about homesteading, thinking you’re going to write articles on the history of back-to-the-land movements in the United States, only to find the majority of the citations in ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1477))

- and the ways in which those connections can be expressed further. All of this can be leveraged for writing. Fig. 44 in chapter 6 shows just how useful they can be. Aside from helping me better understand the ideas in my zettelkasten regarding pratyahara, with only a few editorial tweaks, this structure note could easily be transformed into a rough draft. If you’re someone who likes to work on multiple writing projects at a time (9.4), I recommend leaning into your structure notes. They’re great places to develop your thinking, and will allow you to stage developing ideas so you can return to them later. Main notes nudge you toward composition. A good main note is a thing to behold. The idea contained inside is clear; the source of the idea is effectively cited; the references to ideas stored in other notes are contextualized. Fig. 45 is an example of one of my “good” main notes. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1498))

- 7.3 Don’t Let Your Zettelkasten Write for You All the examples in this chapter show how a zettelkasten can point toward what to write about. None, however, suggest the zettelkasten should do the writing for you. And, the reason is simple: Your zettelkasten is a terrible writer. The ideas you’ve been capturing in your main notes weren’t written in the context of any one specific piece of writing. These ideas need to be framed in light of the subject you’re writing about, the overall theme of the work, and your chosen tone. Ahrens reminds would-be writers to avoid copying notes into manuscripts, stating that writers should instead “[t]ranslate [ideas] into something coherent” by embedding the ideas “into the context of the argument.”98 This is advice worth heeding. References in scholarly journals to the zettelkasten over the past sixty years repeatedly refer to work suffering due to false expectations about the zettelkasten’s abilities.99 For example, one review stated how an author seemed “anxious to insert all the content of her ‘Zettelkasten’.”100 Another felt that using a zettelkasten made it “impossible to discern a clear line of thought.”101 Another felt a piece had “a disturbing lack of tangible context.”102 One writer was said to have “disguised intuitive aesthetic judgements” off “arbitrarily concocted ideas from the zettelkasten.”103 ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1645))

In the same vein, Hans Blumenberg—another zettelkasten progenitor and contemporary of Luhmann—has been accused of producing work that’s “disorienting in [it’s] digressiveness...seemingly impelled only by the desire to exhaustively transmit his enormously wide reading.”118 Scheper, too, has been accused of an inability to self-edit, with one reviewer quipping, “just because you increase your quantity doesn’t mean that you have increased your quality.”119 Another claimed, whether accurately or not, that Scheper merely “‘collected’ a lot of notes from a lot of research and without prioritizing or editing, dumped everything into a book.”120 While another reader was distracted by multiple “tangents and extraneous material.”121 ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=1676))

This style of recording and commenting is called “interstitial journaling,” a technique developed by Tony Stubblebine.134 The term “interstitial” refers to the space between things, in this case the space between transitioning from one task or project to another. In that space, Stubblebine suggests we record what we completed, what we thought about completing it, what we’re about to do, and what we think about doing it. According to Stubblebine, writing down what we’ve done and thoughts about what we’re doing next “empties our brain of the last project,” providing “space to formulate an optimal strategy for our next project.” It’s a way of letting the momentum of one cognitive cycle resolve, so you can begin another.135 ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0D18J83VB&location=2043))
