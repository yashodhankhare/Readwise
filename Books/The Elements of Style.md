## Highlights
- And you must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts take colour from what you see. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=370))
- The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive: I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. This is much better than My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=411))
- me. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=415))
- 11. Put statements in positive form. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=471))
- Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion. He was not very often on time. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=473))
- He usually came late. He did not think that studying Latin was much use. He thought the study of Latin useless. The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable… ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=476))
- character in Shakespeare’s works.     The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant. The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The corrected version… ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=482))
- All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word not. Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express even a… ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=487))
- trifling did not remember  forgot did not pay any attention to ignored did not have much confidence in   distrusted The antithesis of negative and positive is… ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=494))
- Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more. Negative words other than not are usually strong: The sun… ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=506))
- Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract. A period of unfavorable weather set in.… ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=512))
- He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward. He grinned as he pocketed the coin. There is a general agreement among those who have enjoyed the experience that surf-riding is productive of great exhilaration. All… ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=517))
- If those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one point, it is on this, that the surest method of arousing and holding the attention of the reader is by being specific, definite, and concrete. Critics have pointed out how much of the effectiveness of the… ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=526))
- definiteness and concreteness. Browning, to cite a more modern author, affords many striking examples. Take, for instance, the lines from My Last Duchess, Sir, ‘twas all one! My favour at her breast, The dropping of the daylight in the west, The… ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=528))
- her, the white mule She rode with round the terrace—all and each Would draw from her alike the approving speech, Or blush, at least, and those which end the poem, Notice Neptune, though, Taming a sea-horse,… ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=534))
- me. These words call up pictures. Recall how in The Bishop Orders his Tomb in St. Praxed’s Church “the Renaissance spirit—its worldliness, inconsistency, pride, hypocrisy, ignorance of itself, love of art, of luxury, of good Latin,” to quote Ruskin’s comment on… ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=543))
- Prose, in particular narrative and descriptive prose, is made vivid by the same means. If the experiences of Jim Hawkins and of David Balfour, of Kim, of Nostromo, have seemed for the moment real to countless readers, if in reading Carlyle we have almost the sense of being physically… ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=547))
- the details and the concreteness of the terms used. It is not that every detail is given; that would be impossible, as well as to no purpose; but that all the significant details are given, and not vaguely, but with such definiteness that the reader, in imagination, can project… ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=550))
- likewise never lose his hold upon the concrete, and even when he is dealing with general principles, he must give particular instances of their application. “This superiority of specific expressions is clearly due to the effort required to translate words into thoughts. As we do not think in… ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=553))
- represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual members of it, it follows that when an abstract word is used, the hearer or reader has to choose, from his stock of images, one or more by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned. In doing this, some delay must arise, some force be… ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=557))
- once suggested, an economy is achieved, and a more vivid… ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=559))
- Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=569))
- requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell. Many expressions in common use violate this principle: the question as to whether whether (the question whether) there is no doubt but that ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=571))
- no doubt (doubtless) used for fuel purposes used for fuel he is a man who he in a hasty manner  hastily this is a subject which this subject His story is a strange one. His story is strange. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=579))
- In especial the expression the fact that should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs. owing to the fact that since (because) in spite of the fact that though (although) call your attention to the fact that remind you (notify you) ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=595))
- I was unaware of the fact that I was unaware that (did not know) the fact that he had not succeeded his failure the fact that I had arrived  my arrival See also under case, character, nature, system in Chapter V. Who is, which was, and the ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=604))
- like are often superfluous. His brother, who is a member of the same firm    His brother, a member of the same firm Trafalgar, which was Nelson’s last battle Trafalgar, Nelson’s last battle As positive statement is more concise than negative, and the active voice more concise than the passive, ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=614))
- A common violation of conciseness is the presentation of a single complex idea, step by step, in a series of sentences or independent clauses which might to advantage be combined into one. Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=624))
- Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king. (51 words.) Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=627))
- becoming king of Scotland in his place. (26 words.) There were several less important courses, but these were the most important, and although they did not come every day, they came often enough to keep you in such a state of mind that you never knew what your next move would be. (43 words.) These, the most important courses of all, came, if not daily, at least often enough ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=630))
- to keep one under constant strain. (21 words.) ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=635))
- 14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences: ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=637))
- By this principle, an article or a preposition applying to ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=673))
- all the members of a series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term. The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese In spring, summer, or in winter In spring, summer, or winter (In spring, in summer, or in winter) ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=673))
- Correlative expressions (both, and; not, but; not only, but also; either, or; first, second, third; and the like) should be followed by the same grammatical construction, that is, virtually, by the same part of speech. (Such combinations as “both Henry and I,” “not silk, but a cheap substitute,” are obviously within the rule.) Many violations of this rule (as the first three below) ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=681))
- arise from faulty arrangement; others (as the last) from the use of unlike constructions. It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. The ceremony was both long and tedious. A time not for words, but action.   A time not for words, but for action. Either you must grant his ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=683))

My objections are, first, the injustice of the measure; second, that it is unconstitutional.  My objections are, first, that the measure is unjust; second, that it is unconstitutional. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=691))
- 16. Keep related words together. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=703))
- The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning. Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church. In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=708))
- church. Cast iron, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is changed into steel. By treatment in a Bessemer converter, cast iron is changed into steel. The objection is that the interposed phrase or clause needlessly interrupts the natural order of the main clause. Usually, however, this objection does not hold when the order is interrupted only ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=713))
- by a relative clause or by an expression in apposition. Nor does it hold in periodic sentences in which the interruption is a deliberately used means of creating suspense (see examples under Rule 18). The relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after its antecedent. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=719))
- 17. In summaries, keep to one tense. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=763))
- Apart from the exceptions noted, whichever tense the writer ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=775))
- chooses, he should use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=776))
- 18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=789))
- The proper place in the sentence for the word, or group of words, which the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end. Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways.           Humanity, since that time, has advanced in ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=791))
- many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness. Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors. The word or group of words entitled to this position of prominence is usually the logical predicate, that is, the new element ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=795))
- in the sentence, as it is in the second example. The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence which it gives to the main statement. Four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, one of the Italian mariners whom the decline of their own republics had put at the service of the world and of ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=801))
- adventure, seeking for Spain a westward passage to the Indies as a set-off against the achievements of Portuguese discoverers, lighted on America. With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourself ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=805))
- unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful prosecution of this war. The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, may become emphatic when placed first. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=808))
- The principle that the proper ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=822))
- place for what is to be made most prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the sentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a composition. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=822))
- Parentheses. A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is punctuated, outside of the marks of parenthesis, exactly as if the ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=837))
- expression in parenthesis were absent. The expression within is punctuated as if it stood by itself, except that the final stop is omitted unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point. I went to his house yesterday (my third attempt to see him), but he had left town. He declares (and why should ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=839))

- The too frequent use of but as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under Rule 14. A loose sentence formed with but can always be converted into a periodic sentence formed with although, as illustrated under Rule 4. Particularly awkward is the following of one but by another, making a contrast ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=945))
- to a contrast or a reservation to a reservation. This is easily corrected by re-arrangement. America had vast resources, but she seemed almost wholly unprepared for war. But within a year she had created an army of four million men. America seemed almost wholly unprepared for war, but she had ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=949))
- vast resources. Within a year she had created an army of four million men. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=953))
- Don’t. Contraction of do not. The contraction of does not is doesn’t. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=998))
- One hundred and one. Retain the and in this and similar expressions, in accordance with the unvarying usage of English prose from Old English times. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1132))
- Very. Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1247))
- themselves. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1248))
- Viewpoint. Write point of view, but do not misuse this, as many do, for view or opinion. While. Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for and, but, and although. Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for and or but, either from a mere desire to vary the connective, or from uncertainty ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1249))
- which of the two connectives is the more appropriate. In this use it is best replaced by a semicolon.

While I admire his energy, I wish it were employed in a better cause. This is entirely correct, as shown by the paraphrase, I admire his ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1258))

- The use of worth while before a noun (“a worth ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1290))
- while story”) is indefensible. Would. A conditional statement in the first person requires should, not would. I should not have succeeded without his help. The equivalent of shall in indirect quotation after a verb in the past tense is should, not would. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1290))
- He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise. To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense, without would, is usually sufficient, and from its brevity, more emphatic. Once a year he would visit the old mansion. Once a year he visited the old mansion. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1298))
- Note that a single consonant (other than v) preceded by a stressed short vowel is doubled before -ed and -ing: planned, letting, beginning. (Coming is an exception.) Write any one, every one, some one, some time (except in the sense of formerly) as two words. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HX6DK5Q&location=1385))
