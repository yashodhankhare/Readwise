## Highlights
- I have been cautious in writing this book, trying to make it very clear that a principle-based focus in therapy is not an alternative to a protocol-based approach. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=164))

- They go hand in hand, and a correct use of principles will deepen and broaden the reach of the therapist whose work adheres to the DBT manual. It will help the therapist to navigate and transform challenging moments, to stay on track, and to maintain movement when stalemates arise.

- The principles, from which the strategies and protocols flow, are derived from the three paradigms underlying DBT: acceptance, ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=271))

- change, and dialectics. In the next four chapters I present the paradigms more formally and the principles that follow from each. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=272))

- My recommendation throughout this book is that the therapist, in such moments, is wise to consider which way to move by wondering which of three paradigms to follow: acceptance, change, or dialectics. Each of the three represents a basic direction, and if the therapist moves in one of those directions, principles and strategies will follow. The acceptance paradigm prescribes just being there, in that moment, listening, inquiring, validating, elaborating, conveying objectivity, emanating compassion, and providing clarity. The change paradigm promotes the push for behavioral change by designating goals and target behaviors, assessing obstacles, finding solutions, insisting on action, and encouraging the patient to close the gap between designated targets and current functioning. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=314))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The dialectical paradigm focuses attention on balance, synthesis, and movement: balance between acceptance and change interventions, balance between opposing positions by finding the wisdom on each side, and synthesis of the contradictory positions. When the therapist moves toward acceptance, he engages DBT’s acceptance-based strategies. When he moves toward change, he engages the problem-solving strategies derived from CBT. And when he moves dialectically, he engages in dialectical thinking and uses dialectical strategies. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=319))

- Months later, after successfully establishing behavioral control and reducing her suffering, I was to learn that what would make her life worth living, among other things, was to be a gardener and homemaker. Following a complete course of DBT, she realized that dream. One of the take-home lessons was that many patients do not have access to an image of a life worth living at the beginning of treatment.

- The DBT therapist who is on the lookout for these three tasks early in treatment and is prepared to address them in a principle-based manner stands a better chance of addressing them with awareness and precision, getting therapy off to a good start. The first task is dialectical, in that the therapist will intervene in the patient’s dialectic, or ambivalence, between wanting to build a life worth living, on the one hand, and wanting to die, on the other. The second task is behavioral, in that the therapist can work to strengthen the patient’s capacity to vividly envision a life worth living and to translate that vision into realistic goals and treatment targets. The third task is relational, in that the therapist works toward the ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=402))

- establishment of a strong and flexible patient–therapist attachment, enhanced through encountering and solving adverse experiences together during pretreatment. It may be significant that these three tasks are suggested by the three words in the name of the therapy: there is a dialectical task, a behavioral task, and a therapy (relationship) task. As we now consider each of these three tasks, each being integral to the life-worth-living conversation, keep in mind that each task is addressed while following the contracting strategies with adherence to the manual, not instead of doing so.

- I asked her to tell me what her goals were, what her vision was of a life worth living. There was a long pause; in fact, I had the impression that she had entered a dissociative state. I called her name and she seemed to return to the present. She asked me what I had asked her. I repeated the question. She said she had no idea how to answer it, that she didn’t really think about the future. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=443))

- In DBT, when paralysis remains even in the face of change or acceptance strategies, the therapist naturally shifts to principles and strategies from the dialectical paradigm. Liberated by taking a “both . . . and” position that validates both sides of the dialectic and allows for speed, movement, and flow, I opened my mind to the strategic possibilities. One of DBT’s dialectical strategies is to use a metaphor that captures the dilemma and opens new avenues for conversation. I suggested to the patient that she was standing at the edge of a landmass where life had been incredibly painful, a place with conditions that ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=462))

- had driven her toward suicide. And she was looking across the vast waters in front of her, and it was a foggy day, and she couldn’t see very far. And I suggested that there was an island out there, beyond the fog, and on that island was a home for her, a cat, and a life in which people were treated decently. To get there would require that she get into a boat and row toward that island without knowing exactly where it was or what it looked like. That boat was her DBT treatment. Because she had informed me that she kept a special razor blade in her apartment, which she called her “saving grace,” I suggested that if she saw her DBT treatment as the boat, and her therapist as a fellow passenger, it would be important to leave the razor blade on shore and not take it with her. She was able to engage with the metaphor. She said that if she didn’t have the razor blade, she absolutely needed something else, something that could help her get through the unbearable times, especially when she was overtaken by flashbacks of sexual abuse. I agreed entirely, and we began to consider what kinds of strategies could replace the razor blade. The therapist simply cannot bypass, suppress, or overrule the essential life-versus-death ambivalence without making the problem worse. While staunchly holding out for a life worth living, sticking with a hopeful attitude in any way that works, the therapist also has to allow space and time for the patient to communicate ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=466))

- the thoughts, feelings, and wishes related to suicide, without endorsing them as a plan. Linehan has said that DBT therapists have to accomplish two overarching essential tasks in working with the suicidal individual with borderline personality disorder: They have to be able to “get into hell” with the patient and see what it looks and feels like, and to help the patient “find a way out of hell.” It’s a dialectical metaphor, acknowledging the validity of both sides: the side of wanting to die and the side of wanting to find a way out without dying. It’s a synthesis of acceptance and change. The work of “finding a way out of hell” begins with the work of envisioning a life worth living that works for that patient.

- I discussed the patient who was unable to envision any positive future outcome through the dense fog, or to name any goal beyond daily survival. The fact that she could not envision a better life, and that she could not name any goals toward a better life, was itself disabling. Without a life-worth-living goal to compete with the seductive magnetism of suicide, treatment loses a huge ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=502))

- ally. These are skills—the skill of envisioning a positive and realistic future state, and the skill of articulating realistic goals that lead to that future—that are familiar within a larger set of capabilities known as executive functions. In fact, the capacity to envision a desired future state (visually, if possible) is an executive function that recruits all of the other executive functions in the course of getting things done. (Other executive functions that follow include marshaling resources toward the goal, monitoring progress toward the goal, inhibiting alternative pursuits that will interfere, and maintaining a level of cognitive flexibility that facilitates problem solving in the face of various obstacles.) Once we conceptualize the failure to envision a positive and motivating image of the future, and the deficiency in setting goals toward such an image, as capability deficits, we can organize our thinking and interventions around a familiar task in DBT: capability enhancement, or skills training.

- When my older son was 13 and I was helping him to plan his summer, I asked him what mattered the most to him about this particular summer. For the first time in his life, as far as I could remember, he identified a goal that would affect the planning of the whole summer, several months in advance of it. He was on a youth hockey team, and he was, as he put it, “in the… ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=512))

- summer would translate into getting “up toward the top of the pack.” We agreed that it might, and he asked if I could sign him up for some hockey camps. This would mean cutting down on many of his favorite summer activities. He had a vision that we were able to spell out in the form of concrete goals, which in turn helped him to inhibit alternative activities that would have interfered with this vision, and he was able to stick to the plan. He began the next hockey season closer to the “front of the pack.” When our patients have little or no capacity to dream, to envision, or to set a non-mood-dependent goal, it is an invisible handicap. We can’t simply ignore this deficit. We need to assess it and to use our skills training knowledge to address it. And if we tackle this deficit at the very beginning of treatment, we might help to build or strengthen essential executive functions, to provide an in vivo demonstration of the value of skills training, and to begin a collaborative treatment relationship focused on acquiring capacities and improving motivation. How can we optimally understand this kind of skills deficit in individuals with borderline… ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=515))

- interacted. Our patients, having survived and having been shaped by environments in which they were disregarded, denigrated, criticized, punished, and scorned, were usually not encouraged to dream or to convert their unique ideas and qualities into unique life paths. In fact, in an invalidating environment, to communicate a big dream might result in criticism and humiliation. Over time, painful transactions such as these can establish a link between envisioning the future and experiencing scorn and disappointment. The pervasive invalidation by the environment is transformed over time to a syndrome of self-invalidation; individuals learn to automatically invalidate and criticize themselves, to suppress hopes and dreams, and to discount the expectation of real support or the prospect of success. They learn that dreaming, and getting there, is for others. And as a result, they fail to build this specific and powerful life skill set: envisioning a positive future and setting a goal in that trajectory. When the patient enters treatment and we ask her what she wants to accomplish, or more pointedly what would make life worth living, we encounter all… ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=525))

- locate the presence of a weakened or distorted capacity to dream and set goals, but it has been rendered invisible or ineffective due to one or more of several factors: Dreaming or goal setting may be associated with problematic assumptions or beliefs, may automatically trigger intense negative emotions based on prior traumatic or invalidating responses, or may result from other associated skills deficits (consider the impact of deficits in emotion regulation in general, in distress tolerance, or in the mindfulness skills). Furthermore, a lifetime of unfortunate reinforcement patterns may have extinguished or punished the activities of dreaming and goal setting, and may have reinforced more dysfunctional ways to handle the question about life goals. Because of all of this, the pretreatment stage, beginning with the first conversation, can provide the in vivo context for assessing these skills deficits, beginning to understand the nature and impact of this individual’s invalidating environment, and working to remedy the exposed skills deficits. If the capacity is truly missing, there is an opportunity to build it “from scratch,” that is, to intervene… ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=535))

- A third task that can be approached through the life-worth-living conversation during pretreatment is the development and strengthening of a collaborative relationship between therapist and patient. The initial discussions about goals allow the therapist to do several helpful things. He allies with hope, change, the patient’s dreams and goals, and a life worth living. He validates the patient’s suffering, validates the urge to commit suicide, and comes to understand the patient’s narrative within which suicide makes sense, all without validating suicide as a solution. He can (1) spell out the dialectic—the opposition between pursuing suicide and pursuing a life worth living, (2) validate parts of each side of the dialectic, and (3) demonstrate patience and respect in collaboratively trying to arrive at a synthesis. In conceptualizing the associated problems of picturing the future and identifying goals as skills deficits, he points the way to remediation of the deficits in a practical manner, with concrete instructions and deliberate practices. He can demonstrate how validating the patient’s suffering and sensitivity can be done without treating her as fragile. The goal is to help the patient experience the therapeutic atmosphere as ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=585))

- one that encourages openness, genuineness, honesty, and courage, and that will tolerate disagreement and conflict. Even though these conversations can be challenging, can “shake things up” a bit, for the therapist they are an opportunity to engage and to combine hopes for the patient, passion for the treatment, and respect for the patient’s positions. Linehan has outlined the optimal characteristics of a DBT therapist as finding the middle path between polarized positions along three dimensions. As spelled out in the manual (Linehan, 1993a, pp. 109–111), the therapist can (1) insist on behavioral change in the context of deep acceptance, (2) stand with unwavering centeredness while engaging with compassionate flexibility, and (3) benevolently demand collaboration while being unconditionally nurturing. The life-worth-living conversation is an excellent task and framework in which the therapist can find and practice the middle path between these dimensions. He insists on moving the patient toward a life worth living while conveying genuine validation of the wish to die, staying centered on the life-worth-living goal while remaining flexible enough to move back and forth with the patient’s ambivalence, and demanding that the patient work toward a higher quality of living while offering nurturance along the way. Obviously, a DBT therapist who can genuinely offer a ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=593))

- dialectical position, finding the right synthesis of these polarities in the clinical moment, has an advantage in navigating toward a stronger relationship with the patient. For many patients, the difficulty in responding to the goals question results in their first in-session therapy-interfering behavior. As such, it is the perfect opportunity for the therapist to bring the whole treatment package to bear, and to model the approach that will be used throughout the treatment when facing challenging situations in life and within the therapy relationship. It’s like the first chapter in a book or the prelude to a large piece of music. And although the step-by-step process of using the contracting strategies, as outlined in the manual, provides an excellent framework or skeleton for the first sessions, these protocol-driven steps do not tell the therapist what to do when it doesn’t go well. This is both a principle-based and a protocol-based treatment, and it starts that way from the beginning. Often the therapist needs the whole treatment package in the first minute.

Even though I didn’t know much about the rules, the strategies, or the players, it was obvious to me that there was one particularly outstanding player. First, he possessed technical mastery of the fundamentals of skating, puck handling, passing, shooting, and checking (legally hitting opposing players when they are handling the puck). His technical skill set was so overlearned and automatic that he seemed not to have to think about it. Second, he seemed to possess a heightened sense of awareness, as if his perspective, from a level above the game, allowed him to see in all directions and to… ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=628))

- Earlier in her teachings of DBT, Linehan described the cognitive-behavioral problem-solving strategies as the “bitter-tasting but effective pill,” and the validation strategies as the “sugar coating” that helped the pill go down. To accept patients with compassion and to intervene with accuracy, therapists needed to develop their own heightened levels of acceptance and awareness. The cultivation of acceptance and awareness was grounded in the principles and practices of mindfulness. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=647))

- Dialectics, which has been compared to jazz music in DBT, functioned to promote improvisation. Stripped to its essence, effective DBT requires the therapist to synthesize a technical cognitive-behavioral skill set, heightened acceptance and awareness, and capacity to improvise with DBT’s change, acceptance, and dialectical paradigms—all based on behaviorism, mindfulness, and dialectical philosophy—to alter entrenched behavioral patterns and “get the patient out of hell.” Each paradigm gave rise to particular sets of strategies, the triadic strategic core of the treatment: problem-solving strategies from the change paradigm, validation strategies from the acceptance paradigm, and dialectical strategies from the dialectical paradigm.

- On the acceptance side I could continue to validate her. Perhaps it would result in her feeling understood as she communicated her feelings about the incident, and in regulating her emotions more effectively. But standard DBT practice would recommend that I ask to see her diary card at this point in the session, as part of assessing the prior week and determining the highest-priority behaviors to target during the session—in other words, the change direction. Once the thought occurred to me that it was time to ask for the diary card, I could feel my urge to avoid doing so. It felt to me as if asking for her diary card at that moment would be like asking a bleeding car accident victim in an emergency room for her insurance information. On the other hand, if I were to avoid asking, out of fear of her response, I might be treating her as if she were fragile, reinforcing a dysfunctional pattern of mood-dependent behavior. With a matter-of-fact tone and “acting opposite” my own urge to avoid asking for the diary card, I interrupted her, indicating that we could come back to the situation about ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=734))

As expected, she felt interrupted and acted as if I had thrown cold water on her. She would not look at me and took no action to locate a diary card. She looked hurt and angry but did not speak; in fact, it seemed as if she withdrew and refused to speak. I told her I was sorry to have interrupted her, and that maybe I could have done it more tactfully, but reminded her that in DBT we needed to set an agenda for the session if we were going to change her life. She remained silent and I had the impression that I had inflamed her further. Though she would not respond to inquiries, I felt as if I were being punished. Several minutes passed. I asked again if she could express her reaction to what I had done. I felt we were at a crossroads of some kind. I noticed that I was uncertain of what was going on with her and uncertain about what to do next. Having introduced change into the session, I returned for the moment to a stance of acceptance. I tried to remain alert to subtle changes in nonverbal communications, and tried to remain balanced. I noticed an urge to confront her, and an opposing urge to apologize to her and rescue her. It then occurred to me that perhaps what had happened between us was not new to her, but was something that interfered with her relationships in ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=741))

I said, “Tracy, I think I was a bit clumsy the way I interrupted you, but I just wonder if this happens to you sometimes, and I wonder if we can learn something from this, both of us, that will help us hang in there with each other?” Having recognized that we were stuck, wanting to maintain movement, trying to recognize the validity both in what I had done and in her response, I tried to make “lemonade out of lemons.” In DBT that is a dialectical strategy. To review: I had begun the session within the acceptance paradigm, had shifted to the change paradigm by pressing her about the diary card, had come back to acceptance as I listened to her angry response, was feeling stuck, and had shifted into a dialectical paradigm with a lemonade-out-of-lemons strategy, highlighting our opposition and looking for synthesis. This shift broke the logjam. Tracy yelled at me, “You are a klutz at best!” and wondered how I could be a good therapist if I interrupted people. At that point she told me she had stopped filling out her diary card this week because it was too difficult and it seemed “stupid.” We proceeded to discuss the diary card, its place in the treatment, and some… ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=751))

- Finally, in determining how and when to shift among the three paradigmatic directions, the therapist is wise to remember two caveats. First, the acceptance paradigm should nearly always remain present and influential even if in the background when pushing for behavioral change. A pervasively validating environment is valuable in countering the client’s pervasive self-invalidation, facilitating attachment and the leverage it provides, and supporting change-oriented work. Second, the three paradigms are not “equal” to each other in order of priority. DBT is a goal-oriented treatment, CBT is the goal-oriented paradigm and is therefore central, and the other two paradigms ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=783))

- But we begin our formal discussion of the three paradigms with acceptance for several reasons. First, it is the oldest of the three, the beginnings of it being traceable back to the life of the ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=795))

- Buddha more than 2,500 years ago. It is a deep root of the “Tree of DBT” (see Chapter 6). Second, in most cases the use of acceptance-oriented interventions is a prerequisite for the effective use of cognitive-behavioral and dialectical strategies. “Getting into hell with the patient, ” as discussed in Chapter 1, is essential in helping the patient find a way out of hell, and it requires careful listening and validation, essentially acceptance and heightened awareness. Third, ideally we enter into each therapy session, skills training group, telephone coaching call, and consultation team meeting with an open mind and a compassionate, accepting heart. I don’t have empirical data to prove it, but my conviction, born out of clinical experience, is that I am more effective at helping my patients change when I start from an accepting—awake, alert, nonjudgmental, and fully present—stance. When I am truly and fully present at the beginning of a session, my patients notice. I can tell that they can tell. And it injects the session with a sense of relevance and immediacy. Finally, we begin here with the explication of the acceptance paradigm because in the teaching of DBT’s skills modules, the acceptance-based mindfulness skills are central to the teaching of every module, and are thus named the core mindfulness skills. Practicing mindfulness skills is integral to the learning and practice of the others. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=797))

Mindfulness is an innate capacity of the human mind, the capacity to see the unfolding of reality clearly, directly, in the here and now, moment by moment, without “delusion.” Although introduced through mindfulness meditation by the Buddha about 2,500 years ago, the basic concepts and practices can be found in every spiritual tradition around the world, and in secular traditions as well. Mindfulness happens unintentionally when we “wake up” in the present moment. For instance, we suddenly become mindful, fully awake and alert to present reality, when we experience a threat to our lives or our well-being. This same state can be cultivated intentionally by meditative practices to bring present-moment awareness into all aspects of our lives, thereby enhancing our well-being. In fact, the practice of mindfulness meditation throughout the centuries has given rise to certain insights that form the core of the principles of DBT’s acceptance paradigm. Whereas the totality of practices and insights from meditation provide nourishment for the DBT therapist, five overarching principles are particularly relevant:   Present-moment awareness. Nonattachment. Interbeing. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=807))

- Perhaps the concept and practice at the core of the acceptance paradigm—the prerequisite for the other acceptance principles—is this one: The present moment is the only moment. When our attention is fixed on the past, it is fixed on a memory, a story, a fiction of sorts. When our attention is drawn to the future, it is drawn to a fantasy. In a mindfulness retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh, he was asked how one could ever plan for the future if one’s attention never left the present moment. Thich Nhat Hanh answered that the best planning for the future happens when one brings the future into the present moment, not when one… ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=820))

- At times, when therapists are not “residing in the present moment” and then become aware of that fact, they can reenter the present by bringing attention to their body, noticing the contact of their body upon the chair or their feet on the floor, and experiencing that their center of gravity shifts downward into the abdomen. That is, present-moment awareness is at the core of the skills at the center of each therapist’s self-care, and completely necessary to the very important process in DBT of radically accepting reality.

- From a Buddhist perspective, derived from more than 2,000 years of mindfulness meditation, attachment is the root cause of human suffering, and letting go of attachment is a core practice in reducing that suffering. Attachment, in this therapeutic context, does not refer to the attachment between beings. Attachment between patient and therapist is a crucial ingredient ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=851))

- in DBT treatment. It refers instead to an attachment to beliefs, perceptions, possessions, preferences, and states of mind. If a person has arthritis of the hip, as I do, he experiences pain. If, in addition to that physical pain, he is attached to the belief that he should not have arthritis or that it is not fair that he has arthritis, then he is adding suffering to his pain. If a person is attached to remaining youthful, then the inevitable painful realities that accompany aging are aggravated further by the belief that it should not be so. For the person who is attached to health as if it were the only acceptable or fair state, that attachment will add suffering to the natural discomfort of illness. Those for whom the painful loss of a relationship, a person, a pet, or a job is simply unacceptable and never “should” have happened, will suffer from that nonacceptance in addition to the inevitable grieving. Having acquired the insight that life is inevitably filled with pain, and that resisting or protesting those painful realities causes additional suffering (known respectively as the First and Second Noble Truths of Buddhism), the Buddha then taught that the alleviation of suffering comes from acknowledging and accepting reality as it truly is, while letting go of attachment to beliefs, perceptions, possessions, and states of mind (Third Noble Truth of Buddhism). From these insights arises the ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=853))

- Let’s review the steps in this example for the sake of generalizing this process to other types of traps and attachments in therapy. First, I became attached. I “felt his pain,” I empathized with his urgent desire to get out of isolation. His attachment became my attachment before I even thought about it. Second, and this is the key to the whole process, I recognized that I was attached. This need to rescue is not unusual in doing therapy with individuals who exhibit high levels of emotional dysregulation. The feeling grabs hold of us that we have to do something. We get attached to doing something when, in fact, nothing ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=898))

- needs to be done. If we recognize our sense of urgency, only then are we positioned to reestablish our freedom and balance, and only then do we stand a chance of helping the patient. Third, actually letting go of the attachment, even when we see that we are attached, is not necessarily so easy. In this case I was helped by the practice of stepping back, going within myself, and observing one entire in-breath and out-breath, with full attention to the breath. We often need a vehicle like this when we are midstream in trying to get unhooked from an attachment. By analogy, if we drive a car with a manual transmission, and we want to shift from one gear to another, we need to push the clutch pedal all the way to the floor in order to shift. Engaging the clutch pedal allows us to disengage from our present gear, allowing us to then shift to the new gear. In therapy we routinely get trapped in one “gear” or another, and we need a “clutch pedal.” We may be attached to preventing our patients from engaging in suicide attempts or self-harming episodes, substance use, or dissociative episodes. Or we may be attached to ensuring that our patients show visible progress. Or we may be attached to not becoming a target of their anger. The more we get attached to those things over which we don’t have control, the more we get emotionally dysregulated, the more we suffer, and the less effective we become.

- Then the paradox occurred to me—that he might get out sooner if he stopped trying to get out—and I could communicate it to him. His puzzlement and ambivalence about my suggestion threw him off balance and opened the door to a fresh start. A quick and dirty protocol for this process might be captured as follows:   Get attached (immediate, involuntarily, automatic). “Wake up” to the recognition of being attached. “Let go” of the attachment, possibly with the assistance of a mindfulness vehicle. See the patient’s reality as it is. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=916))

- Borrowing further from a metaphor of Thich Nhat Hanh, we can think of each one of us as a wave in the ocean, rolling toward the shore, from birth in the ocean to death on the shore. Each wave has its own shape, size, speed, and other features; has its unique story and form. On the other hand, every distinct wave is made up entirely of water molecules, the same as all other waves. In fact, a given wave is made up of water molecules that were part of a different wave moments before. The waves are historically unique and distinct, and they are profoundly interconnected ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=974))

- and interdependent. We are waves, and we are water. Both are true, and we can shift our focus back and forth between the unique waves and the indivisible water. In fact, both “realities” are valid: the conventional, historical reality honoring uniqueness and separateness, and the deep truth of the interdependence of all elements all the time, as captured in the term interbeing. It is but a short leap from these ideas to the idea of non-self. Without boundaries, without separateness, independence, or uniqueness, each of us is but a temporary, evolving, interdependent rearrangement of matter and energy. Experiencing life from this perspective, we can observe our thoughts without thinking of ourselves as the “thinkers”; feel our emotions without being the one who “has” them; and when we act, we can realize that these actions are in one respect not really our own. It can be unsettling and confusing to realize the extent to which this perspective is true; in another respect, it can be quite freeing and can contribute to deep insight about human nature. It is the wisdom of non-self, of interbeing, of no boundaries, and of emptiness. When I first took note of these ideas in the teachings of meditation masters, they struck me as challenging, a bit weird, arguable, and thought provoking. But what does this set of insights have to do with ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=978))

- the practice of DBT? Everything. Whether we choose to notice it or not, the “beginning” and “ending” of therapy are difficult to define; the boundaries between patients and therapists, between patients and their social contexts, between therapists and their DBT teams, and between patient–therapist dyads and society in general are difficult to specify; and the answer to the question “Who did what to whom?” is more complicated than it seems. When the mental health staff of an inpatient unit complains that a certain patient is “manipulating us,” we can revisit the same circumstance with concepts of non-self, interbeing, and no boundaries. We realize rather quickly that the staff is supposedly in charge of establishing the conditions of the program, and that the staff, consciously or unconsciously, reinforces some patient behaviors and not others. It would be just as valid (but just as unhelpful) to argue that the staff is “manipulating” the patient to engage in certain actions by reinforcing those actions. Ultimately, the determination of who is manipulating whom becomes less meaningful and useful… ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=988))

- One time my two young sons were fighting with each other over the control of the television remote device while I was doing something in the kitchen, very near to them. I was so aggravated by what seemed to me to be the senselessness and the unnecessary battle. My tolerance was growing short. I had the urge to repeat what I had typically done: to stand between them and the television, to raise my voice, possibly to turn off the TV, and give them a lecture about cooperating, caring for each other, or respecting that I might not want to hear their fighting. That is, I had the usual urge to “do something” about the situation, which usually had an unhappy outcome. They were “doing something” to each other, “doing something” to me, and then I would “do something” to them. But on this particular occasion, I dipped into the frame of “being.” I simply observed them; observed my own thoughts, feelings, and urges; and let go of my attachment to changing the situation. Then I walked over to where they were sitting, sat between them, and continued to just observe the dance of conflict that was going on. And as I sat there, just noticing but not “doing” anything, the two of them ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1009))

- From the perspective of the acceptance paradigm, centered around “being” rather than “doing,” we see ourselves and our patients as interdependent beings, each one part of the other, boundaries uncertain or dissolved, united in the task of therapy, sharing space, time, energy, matter, ideas, intentions, and so on. In the “doing” perspective, there is a destination or a series of destinations; there is the power of purpose. In the “being” perspective, there is no destination; there is the power of being, or interbeing, in the present moment. Out of the change paradigm perspective flow the problem-solving strategies, the irreverent style of communication, and the insistence on working with patients to solve their life problems. Out of the acceptance paradigm perspective flow validation strategies, a reciprocal style of communication, and the willingness to intervene in patients’ environments on their behalf.

- Her DBT skills group had just begun a new module, the Emotion Regulation Training module. In the first session, the teachers presented a number of basic features of emotions. One of them was that emotional responses are in fact rather brief in duration if one does not continue to retrigger them with emotional thoughts and actions. As a practice assignment, patients in the group were invited to study “the life and death of an emotion” next time an intense emotion arose. During the community meeting on the following day, she asked me if she could be on the agenda. When I called on her, she told everyone that “a miracle happened last night.” She explained that during a conversation with her mother on the telephone she had felt hurt and intense anger. She hung up on her mother and was riddled with urges to harm herself. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1065))

- over the next 20 minutes, she also found that they faded away after that amount of time, at which point she hung out with some of her peers. Her description in the meeting was exciting, as if she was reporting a newly discovered human phenomenon—which is exactly what it was for her. Yes, emotions are impermanent, if only we let ourselves realize it. So are thoughts, actions, and the situations in which we find ourselves. The recognition that impermanence is the nature of reality can be transformative. This can be particularly helpful for therapists who feel as if they are facing, in session after session, the same unchanging patient. Frustration grows and hopelessness sets in, in part because of the growing conviction that nothing is changing, when in fact that cannot possibly be true. As therapists, we are wise to learn from our young patient’s revolutionary discovery. As with the other insights discussed in this chapter, the recognition of the impermanence of reality also informs us as therapists deeply, subtly, and constantly. It can alleviate our distress, reduce our suffering, and keep us on track in DBT if we can simply accept that things are always in flux. What seems unchangeable or impenetrable is actually changing. Every moment is fresh, in fact, despite the experience of both parties that it is old, unchanging, and stagnant. In Buddhism, the term beginner’s mind refers to the experience that the encounter with each moment is fresh and new. Like a persistent wave in the ocean, every persistent problem represents a formation or sequence, which no matter how unyielding it may seem, is made up of constantly changing ingredients, in a constantly changing context. The wave may look the same, but it consists of another, and another, and then another collection of water molecules in constantly changing orientations. Understanding this basic reality, we can say with conviction, “This too shall pass.” We become more patient, more resilient, more alert to missing variables, and we learn that the “boiling point” of change could come at any moment if we keep up the heat. Another value of recognizing impermanence as a permanent phenomenon is the… ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1073))

- “THE WORLD IS PERFECT AS IT IS.” This is another one of those insights that can sound rather simplistic, alien, and impossible. How could the world be perfect, when in fact there is so much suffering, wrongdoing, conflict, and misunderstanding? How can we say that everything had to be as it is, that everything should be the way it is, that everything is perfect just as it is? How can a suicide attempt, a vicious assault, or a treatment failure be “perfect”? The statement can be confusing, invalid on the face of it, until we understand that the word perfect is not being used in a conventional way. “The world is perfect as it is” does not mean that things are OK, that the world is fair and just, the environment is compassionate and forgiving. It does not mean that we approve of the world as it is, or agree with it. It simply means that the world is exactly as it is, exactly as it should be, given everything that came before. It simply means that everything is caused by what came before. Someone attempts suicide because, historically, leading into the present moment, all causes and conditions are in place to support the act of suicide. How could this moment be anything other than what it is, given the collective impact of all previous moments? This perspective is no different from the way a behaviorist thinks when assessing the controlling variables of a given behavior—that is, when assessing the causes and conditions that bestow a certain function on a behavior and maintain it. Karma is a principle arising from Buddhism that rests upon much of the same thinking. It means that everything now was caused by prior deeds. Taking it one step into the future then means that we build our future deed by deed, by today’s choices, thoughts, words, and actions. Every seed planted today has consequences tomorrow. Looking backward at how the current state came into… ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1094))

- wounds,” but it definitely results in change. For the therapist working with the difficult-to-treat patient, it can be rather comforting to understand that if she can persist at the practice of DBT through thick and thin, applying its multitude of guidelines and strategies, things will indeed change. In DBT, the therapist has things to do that may help her and the patient to outlast the pathology, which is transforming constantly. This principle that the world is perfect as it is finds its way into DBT’s treatment package in several “locations.” One of DBT’s clinical assumptions is that, regardless of what may seem to be the case, patients are doing the best they can. Another assumption is that regardless of how patients appear to be undermining their own improvement, we assume that they want to improve. Patients may seem to be willfully and defiantly ruining their lives, ignoring their therapists, forgetting the skills, and doing the same self-destructive thing over and over again. How can they be doing the best they can? How can it be true that they want to improve? That is exactly the question at that moment for DBT.

Then, in that moment, experiencing each patient with compassion and without judgment, the therapist can work with the patient to build a better life from that time forward. The concept of karma finds its way into a third assumption about patients in DBT: Patients have to try harder, do better, and be more motivated to change. Even though everything is as it has to be, given everything that was, the future is not determined. Every behavior now has consequences; actions matter. With each action, each choice, each intervention, we are laying down stones for a path that will lead to the conditions of the future, hopefully to a life worth living.

- The sequence then begins with a behavioral chain analysis, the technique used to identify the controlling variables of the target behavior. Having applied one, then more, behavioral chain analyses to a given target behavior, the therapist and patient scan for relevant patterns to be found among the links in the chain. Highlighting those patterns, the therapist generates hypotheses to explain the patterns, shares them with the patient, and between them they arrive at the hypotheses that make the most sense. This process is known as insight. Armed with insight, the therapist moves on to the next step, solution analysis, which involves generating and then considering a range of possible solutions that will result in the desired behavioral changes. Possible solutions are shared with the patient, and the dyad selects one or more of the solutions to implement. The solutions involve variations and combinations of four categories of change procedures, ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1151))

For skills deficits, the therapist draws from skills training models and principles and applies skills training procedures in the session. For problematic cognitions, the therapist draws from cognitive mediation models and principles and applies cognitive modification procedures. For problematic contingencies, wherein maladaptive behaviors are reinforced and adaptive behaviors are not, the therapist looks to operant conditioning theory and principles and applies contingency procedures. Finally, for those sequences of links in the chain where cues elicit automatic and disruptive emotions based on prior conditioning, the therapist looks to classical conditioning theory and principles and applies stimulus control and exposure procedures. Throughout the attention to behavioral change, the therapist uses didactic interventions to educate the patient, orienting strategies to clarify the respective roles of patient ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1158))

- While it is difficult to name a few underlying change-based principles, since problem solving involves such a wide range of strategies and stems from a number of substantial theories, I have found it possible to identify seven core processes that have helped me to apply the entire repertoire of problem-solving strategies with flexibility. The first three are foundational change-oriented tasks or processes at work in nearly every DBT session: (1) targeting and monitoring; (2) getting a commitment; and (3) behavioral chain analysis and case conceptualization. The other four are tasks or processes that flow from four underlying theories of behavioral change that are integrated into DBT: (4) skills deficit theory; (5) classical conditioning theory; (6) operant conditioning theory; and (7) cognitive mediation theory. These final four, based as they are on four rich theories of change, bring with them four respective sets of principles, four different ways of thinking, four different styles of therapeutic interaction, and four different sets of techniques.

I explained that I did my best writing when I have 5 or 6 free hours, in which I could generate ideas, create momentum, search through other literature, and write. He challenged me again, on three counts: First, it was unrealistic to expect that I could build 5 or 6 hours into my regular schedule; second, it was a burdensome and “costly” way to write; and third, it was not a good way to create day-by-day momentum. He suggested that I write every day, 7 days a week, for 6 months, using smaller blocks of time that were scheduled at the same time every day. Furthermore, he suggested that I write the first draft of each article “straight out of my head,” without the distracting and time-consuming practice of consulting other literature.

I decided not to open any mail or e-mail during those 90 minutes, or to even look at incoming messages. I confessed that 90 minutes seemed too short, but Steve suggested that if I followed this plan, I would be “writing all the time” in the back of my mind, and the 90 minutes would be enough to put it into writing. He correctly anticipated that sometimes I would want to extend the 90 minutes, if I were “on a roll.” For reasons that I did not understand at first, he was opposed to any extensions. In fact, he asked me to call him if I felt strongly like continuing past 9:30 and to get his input before going ahead. About 2 weeks later it happened, and I called him. “Steve, I’m having a lot of good ideas, and I want to keep writing.” Steve got back to me shortly after I called. “Charlie, it’s so great that you called.

- probably better than before.” I accepted his suggestion on faith, and soon the value became clear to me. The structuring of my writing periods was so clear and so confined to the 90 minutes per morning, that I no longer felt that I “needed” to write later in the day. I wasn’t plagued with the ever-present feeling that I should be writing. I experienced a sense of “flow” as I wrote, and a sense of freedom later during the day. Once the Swenson plan was in place, those 6 months were among the most productive and enjoyable of my career. Writing was no longer paired in my mind with burden. I finished about one article per month, submitted six in 6 months, and within 1 year of starting, five had been accepted. This was more than enough to get me promoted. Not only was I surprised and pleased, I had also had my first lessons in the essentials of a behavioral approach. We began by determining my goal for treatment. We broke it down into specific objectives. We settled on a method. We created the structure in which the method could take place. We met weekly, whereupon we monitored progress, agreed on direction, and took up particular difficulties. Steve was direct in his style, bold in his expectations, and optimistic in tone. He challenged some writing-interfering assumptions, pushed me to take challenging steps that I would usually avoid, and routinely reinforced me when I was “on task.” Still, he managed to convey respect for me, and I felt like we were a team on a mission. In practicing DBT, I have reflected on these lessons a thousand times. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1271))

- DBT is, first and foremost, a therapy driven by the pursuit of outcomes—goals that are subdivided into specific behavioral targets to be accomplished sequentially. At the beginning of treatment, therapist and patient collaboratively reframe the presenting problem behaviors as specific behavioral targets, understood as obstacles to the achievement of the patient’s goals. The targets then determine the agenda of the treatment as a whole and the agenda of each session. Progress on the targets is monitored every day by the patient with diary cards (self-monitoring forms to be completed each day), and every week by the therapist with the review of those diary cards. Therapist and patient monitor the discrepancy between targeted outcomes and current functioning, always attempting to close the gap. In this respect, targeting is not just an activity that takes place at the beginning of treatment or at the beginning of each session; it is a constant preoccupation. At any moment, if a DBT therapist engaged in a session were to be interrupted and asked the question, “What is the current target in your session?” he should have an answer. If he loses sight of his target, he is more likely to drift, influenced by other “drivers” such as the alleviation of momentary emotional distress. In sum, the practices of defining the targets, attending to them throughout treatment, and monitoring progress with regard to them are a central organizing concern in the practice of DBT. We return to this topic in two upcoming chapters: Chapter 7, on targeting, and Chapter 8, on dialectical dilemmas and secondary targets.

- It is a helpful oversimplification to say that there are three essential terms, or elements, of the classical conditioning story. We can organize our thinking around these three terms for purposes of assessment and intervention. The three terms are, respectively and sequentially, the cue, the emotion, and the escape. The cue elicits the emotion; the emotion is uncomfortable, possibly unbearable; and the individual escapes from the emotion into some other behavior. The escape is often the presenting problem, such as cutting or substance use. Let’s consider the three terms in more detail. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1336))

- The present-day cue automatically sets off a powerful emotional response that is more appropriate to the earlier traumatic incident. In using an exposure procedure, the therapist arranges for the patient to voluntarily encounter a present-day cue that sets off the traumatic response in memory, again and again, until the present-day cue loses its power to elicit the traumatic response. Essentially, exposure procedures create conditionings for unpairing the present-day cue from the potent cue from the past. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1352))

- The emotion is the response triggered by the cue. In the case of individuals with high emotional sensitivity and reactivity, and with severe emotion dysregulation, this step in the behavioral chain can be a sudden and painful one, involving panic, terror, shame, anger, or other primary emotion, leading to dysfunctional efforts to cope with it. The fact that the powerful emotional response was triggered by what appears to be a relatively benign cue can be confusing to the patient and to those around her, sometimes confusing to the therapist, and can result in judgmental and pejorative responses to the emotionally triggered individual. The patient’s repeated experience of the cue and the painful emotion may so effectively and rapidly pave the way to the escape that the emotion seems almost invisible. In other words, once this sequence is established and proves effective for avoiding emotional pain, the cue seems to elicit an escape behavior without an emotion in between. Then the therapist may need to imagine the nature of the emotion from which the patient escaped, and assess for it.

- The escape is the behavior in which the individual engages as a way to modify or eliminate the painful emotion. Escape can come in the form of action (e.g., self-cutting), cognition (e.g., dissociative episodes), and/or emotion (e.g., moving from a primary emotion, such as fear or shame, to a secondary emotion, such as anger). Because the nature of the cue may be objectively benign, perhaps not even noticeable; and the intense emotional response can be so evanescent, often hidden further by suppression; the whole sequence may become noticeable only because of the escape. If it happens in a therapy session, for instance, the therapist may notice that the patient has suddenly become more withdrawn, has undergone a shift in mood, has become very angry, or threatens self-harm. The therapist who is always on the lookout for the “classical conditioning story” may then wonder whether she is encountering an escape, and may try to… ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1364))

- The alert DBT therapist is informed by this theory and is always scanning for its manifestation, searching for the cues, watching for and inquiring about unbearable emotional responses, trying to reduce or block the escapes. Our entire understanding of what we are doing in DBT can be built around the classical conditioning model, in which case the process of change can be conceptualized as centering around the procedure of exposure. One might say we are always trying (1) to block escape behaviors, which requires good cooperation, commitment, orientation, and distress tolerance skills; (2) to enhance exposure to the unbearable emotions, which requires mindfulness and emotion regulation skills that help to recognize emotions and then act opposite the urge to escape; and (3) to identify and “treat” the cues, which often include the use of interpersonal… ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1377))

- Operant conditioning theory, or radical behaviorism, focuses our attention on a different three-element story embedded in the larger chain. It’s the story of the context, the target behavior, and the consequences.   Context → Target Behavior → Consequences The Context The context refers to the stimulus context, otherwise known as the antecedent conditions, in which the target behavior occurs. Within that context will also be the cue that we discussed in relation to classical conditioning theory, but the operant conditioning model highlights the stimulus context in all of its aspects, and one other feature in particular. As part of the “operant conditioning story,” we want to discover the discriminative stimuli, those stimuli that signal to the patient that reinforcement may be available for engaging in a certain behavior, in this case, the target behavior. For instance, we noticed that one of the patients in our inpatient DBT program would periodically respond to her frustration by banging her head ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1446))

- on the wall, usually during the evening shift. Upon further assessment it became clear that all such episodes took place when a particular staff member, who worked evenings, was present and was not otherwise occupied. The patient was fond of that staff member, and the episodes would lead to closer contact with her. The discriminative stimulus was the presence, availability, and responsiveness of that staff member. With that knowledge it was possible to come up with interventions that led to elimination of the head-banging behavior. The Target Behavior The target behavior is followed by reinforcement. The behaviors that we target for change in DBT, and for which we use contingency procedures to alter the operant conditioning story, are of two types. Most obviously, we target behaviors on the patient’s list of treatment targets, developed at the beginning of treatment and modified over time. We also target behaviors of the patient that cross the therapist’s personal limits; if therapists do not courageously observe their own personal limits, and target the behaviors that violate those limits, they will suffer from therapist burnout. Although most of the target behaviors of which I have ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1454))

- spoken in this book are problematic behaviors of the patient, there are two other relevant sets of behaviors. First, we target the patient’s adaptive behaviors to increase them, and in doing so, we rely on the same operant conditioning story, considering how to reinforce those behaviors. Second, we target the behaviors of the therapist that interfere with the treatment; this is done within the consultation team, and the same principles are operative. Fortunately, the principles associated with operant conditioning are familiar. We all learn them naturalistically in our lives. We know what it is to reinforce, extinguish, and punish behaviors. We do it, and receive it, all the time. But the use of these principles in treatment with emotionally dysregulated individuals requires an enhanced awareness of them and a more disciplined understanding of how to use them. The Consequences The consequences of interest to the therapist in the model of operant conditioning are those that (1) are contingent upon the target behavior and (2) influence the future likelihood that the target behavior will happen again in a similar context. For the sake of illustration, let’s say that, while getting coffee together, I frequently ask you for money. I never pay you back, I barely thank you, and I seem to take your generosity for granted. You get tired of this behavior, you act a little annoyed, and you ask me to stop. Your explicit request doesn’t stop me. Somewhat baffled, you become curious about what is motivating me. The target behavior is my repeated request for coffee money. In the context, the discriminative stimuli might include several features: You are wealthier than me, you are a generous soul, you have money with you, and you act warmly toward me. Obviously, you have reinforced my prior requests by loaning me money in spite of your stated objections. If you decide to change my behavior, now you have all the information you need: the context, the behavior, and the reinforcer.

- Recognizing these challenges casts light on a broader issue related to reinforcement: that is, the atmosphere of the sessions in general. Given that these patients have been invalidated and traumatized, and are usually emotionally sensitive and reactive, generally we want to establish a baseline atmosphere of warmth, concern, compassion, gentleness, and ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1531))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- validation. We want our DBT patients to realize that they are in a safe situation in which to share their vulnerabilities. And we want them to realize that positive reinforcement for adaptive behaviors is readily available to strengthen skillful approaches. I discuss validation later; for now, it is sufficient to note that we want patients to have the experiences in which the therapist is listening, present, accurately understanding, and being as genuine as possible. Such experiences set the bar at a warm level where reinforcement for functional behaviors is not far away. If we want to extinguish or punish behaviors of any kind, it usually requires only a slight deviation from this baseline. But this baseline can become nontherapeutic if it creates an unrealistic atmosphere of unconditional regard and warmth. The patient may feel safe, but over time the therapist may discover that whenever she pushes him for behavioral change, even when making rather normative requests and interventions, these interventions trigger intense negative responses. A baseline that conveys warmth, patience, compassion, and validation must also convey a treatment approach that pushes constantly for behavioral change. Finding this balance is sometimes not so easy. If I am too warm and approving, for example, I am treating the patient as fragile, providing temporary safety and trust that will lead to long-term paralysis in a change-oriented ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1533))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- oriented treatment. If I am too pushy and demanding of change, on the other hand, my approach will trigger memories of trauma and invalidation, elicit self-invalidation, and create an adversarial relationship in which pushing for change is nearly impossible. In trying to strike the right balance of acceptance and change so that contingencies will be effective in modifying behaviors, therapists face a further challenge. Because of the distorted environments in which our patients have learned how to respond to interpersonal stimuli, we might not receive much reinforcement from them for delivering effective therapy. We might be overtly reinforced for being warm and approving (e.g., “You are the only therapist who really has listened to me”), and punished for change-oriented interventions (e.g., “How dare you ask me to try that skill? Obviously you haven’t been listening to anything I have said”), and over time have trouble finding the right balance. Similarly, we may in fact find therapeutic responses that do effectively reinforce or extinguish the behaviors in the intended direction, but then cannot discern from the patient’s in-session response whether the interventions are efficacious. So, based on patients’ responses to interventions, therapists’ behaviors are sometimes shaped into an empathic therapy approach that avoids troubling issues and behaviors, and at other times, therapists do not receive any input from patients to confirm the value of their contingency procedures. Both cases are examples of one of the most important functions of the weekly DBT consultation team meeting: Team members can reinforce each therapist for doing effective therapy, figuring out what works, helping each to stay flexible and attentive to the patient, and maintaining morale against the pressures toward burnout. Finally, I have noticed another challenge for DBT therapists in using contingencies skillfully. As therapists, we tend to want to reinforce anything the patient does that we think is adaptive, and to avoid reinforcing any behaviors that strike us as maladaptive. But in applying contingencies as a broad brush to any behaviors that come our way, based on whether we think they are adaptive or maladaptive in the moment, we fail… ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1543))

- own styles and values, rather than staying focused on those behaviors the patient needs to change in order to build a life worth living. This kind of indiscriminate practice of contingency procedures can dilute the potency of the procedures as well as blur the awareness of what we are targeting. A certain set of therapist qualities and a particular kind of therapeutic stance are optimal for implementing contingency procedures. First, we need to keep each patient’s targets, and our own personal limits, in view throughout treatment. Simply by staying focused on specified targets and limits, we will be likely, quite naturally, to reinforce adaptive patient behaviors and to extinguish or punish maladaptive ones. Second, we must maintain a clear view of the “rules of the game”: DBT agreements, treatment protocols, assumptions about patients and therapy, and rules pertaining to the context in which treatment occurs. Insofar as we are alert and firm in staying on target, maintaining limits, and delivering consequences crisply and promptly, we need the same characteristic qualities as an excellent referee in… ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=1562))

- Needless to say, the first principle of skills training is that the patient needs to recognize that she needs the skill, and ascertaining this requires the therapist’s attention to the “preacquisition” stage of change (Prochaska et al., 1992). Most patients with whom I have worked, unlike the example of the woman with anorexia, are aware of needing skills, are motivated to learn them, are gratified when they work, and ultimately value this part of DBT. But even with the willing patient, the effective skills trainer is aware of needing to “sell” each new skill by helping patients find their particular need for it. The excellent skills trainer combines qualities that exemplify effective piano teachers and loving mothers. The piano teacher knows how to play what she is teaching, knows how to break down the ability to play the piano into teachable steps, knows how hard to push each student and how to provide individualized reinforcement, and shows a joy for the process of learning. The devoted and loving mother knows her child, and unambiguously knows that her child, in order to have a better life, simply has to learn to do certain things.

- emotional responses, skills deficits, and problematic contingencies conspire toward a life of avoidance, escape, maladaptive behavioral patterns, and constant misery; and (3) cognitions come into being that are compatible with, and accompany, the situational, emotional, and action components of the problem. As a result, cognitions may not be primary in causing the problems (though it may occasionally be the case for some behavioral patterns for some individuals) that bring an individual to DBT, but they have become a piece of the problem, and addressing them is part of the solution. In keeping with this way of thinking about the role of cognitive mediation in generating problems that patients present in DBT, Linehan (1993a) has recommended that therapists remain continually alert to the emergence of problematic cognitions, never letting them pass by without some intervention, even if minimal. For instance, if a patient were to say, “I’m just not a competent person,” the therapist might respond, “Yes, I know, you have the thought that you are not very competent.” The patient, recognizing the challenge, might then go on, “But I mean I’m really not very competent.” The therapist might just leave it at that point, having underlined the problematic thought; or clinical judgment might lead to something like, “Yes, I know that you have a lot of conviction that that thought is true,” and so on.

- The strategies within DBT’s treatment package for addressing logjams are the dialectical strategies. They flow from the three principles of the dialectical paradigm, which are derived from a dialectical worldview and a dialectical way of bringing influence to bear. Particularly suited for “stuck” situations during treatment, the dialectical activity of DBT clinicians is also part of the baseline stance when doing DBT. In this chapter I detail the three dialectical principles—opposites and synthesis, systemic thinking, and flux; discuss the dialectical stance that is part of DBT practice; and illustrate how DBT’s nine dialectical strategies flow from the principles.

- The more clearly we grasp this essential nature of reality, the less surprising it is that we encounter opposition and polarization in treatment. We expect it. Rather than thinking “How could this be? What a surprise! Why is she opposed to what I am saying?,” the attitude becomes, “Of course we are on opposite sides of this—how understandable.” It is, of course, stressful working with people whose biology and history result in rigid positions that place them in opposition to us. But if we can truly grasp the essential nature of reality, wherein opposites are present on a regular basis, we have a chance to desensitize ourselves to opposition. If we can relax into the awareness of opposition, expect it, perhaps even learn to appreciate it, we stand a better chance of working with it creatively and productively. We model for the patient that opposites need not be feared, but instead can be approached with curiosity and might even serve as the leading edge of growth.

Hiring a new administrator of a child therapy agency put a stranglehold on the open sharing of emotions and thoughts in a DBT consultation team, negatively affecting the patients’ treatment and likely hurting the reputation of the facility.

- The third principle of a dialectical worldview overlaps considerably with the acceptance principle of impermanence. At every second, everything has changed from the previous second: every molecule, every structure, every relationship, and every idea. It can be disconcerting, for some people even frightening, to accept the radical truth of this principle: Literally nothing stays the same. After all, what is there left to hold onto, what can we count on, what can we predict? If we are to be in synch with reality, we need to be aware that the past is gone, and that whatever we think is coming is just a fantasy. All that is, is present right now. Reality is a massive mixture of constantly interacting diverse ingredients (compare “Brownian motion” in physics), forever moving and changing. To remember that everything is changing every second stands in direct opposition to the common assumption when we experience things as “stuck”: that nothing is changing at all. When we treat individuals with rigid behavioral patterns, we tend to get mired, unable to move forward or backward, unable to bring about discernible change, sometimes targeting a particular behavioral pattern for months at a time with little evidence of movement. We can grow frustrated, hopeless, and tense. When our minds focus on an increasingly narrow perspective in which change is missing, the flexibility of our thinking can diminish, and therapeutic burnout looms on the horizon (for both therapist and patient!).

- Once I was treating a woman who relentlessly picked her skin. For a time her skin-picking behavior was at the top of our hierarchy of treatment targets. At the end of every day, she would record on her diary card the number of times she had picked her skin, the depth of the picking, and whether it brought relief. In every weekly session we would review her diary card, and in order to target the relentless picking behavior, we would carry out a careful behavioral chain analysis. It grew tedious, as we never seemed to learn anything new, never could find a new angle or develop a working solution. It is more difficult to conduct behavioral chain analyses on a behavior that is happening almost constantly than on a behavior that happens intermittently. It was early in my DBT career, and I was in a weekly supervision with Marsha Linehan. In one supervision session I complained to Marsha that my repeated behavioral chain analysis of skin-picking behavior was proving completely useless, and that it was demoralizing for me and the patient. “Marsha, it is the same every week, in every detail.

Dialectics provides a way of working that augments problem solving and helps to keep things flowing or to get back on track. It does not provide a destination. Dialectical interventions are not ends in themselves; they are means. What are some of the practical implications for therapists adopting the principles of the dialectical paradigm? For one thing, we keep moving. Understanding that everything is interrelated, that everything is changing all the time, that oppositions arise, and that the truth is constructed over time through… ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=2020))

- is left out, pushing for change and accepting things as they are. In our household, my children once had a toy that was a 2-foot-tall replica of R2-D2 from Star Wars. When turned on, R2-D2 started marching forward in a straight line, shuffling his plastic legs like a soldier marching in formation. When he bumped into something, he would bounce back a little, and then march forward again. He might bump into the wall, or some immovable object, again and again, but each time he bounced backward, it would be at a slightly different angle. Over time, he might “get stuck” for a minute or two, hitting the same wall or fixed object, until he rotated sufficiently that he would move past the wall, on to another obstacle. Life for R2-D2 involved constant movement and one obstacle after another. He never would stop (until we switched him off!). Similarly, as DBT therapists we continue to move, hitting obstacles (oppositions), bouncing back, rotating (using different strategies or variations of the same ones), again and again without visible progress, until things shift sufficiently to bring clinical change. Using dialectics involves trial and error,… ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=2026))

- fundamental to the philosophy of DBT, is the opposition between acceptance and change. Starting with an attitude of acceptance, we push for behavioral change in the direction defined by the treatment targets. Pushing for change, we eventually “run into a wall.” We bounce back (assess the situation), then move forward, possibly with a different change strategy, or with the same change strategy but applied somewhat differently. We may arrive at the impression that the push for change, regardless of which strategy, is not working. Then we shift to acceptance, using a validation strategy and a reciprocal tone. We let go of change and offer acceptance. The patient feels better understood. Then we may shift back to change strategies. We continue to move: R2-D2 doing psychotherapy! We may need to find just the right synthesis of pushing for change in the context of acceptance, and we will undoubtedly arrive there through trial and error. We might be shifting rapidly between acceptance and change interventions, so much so that they form one intervention. Or, as we saw in the example of… ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=2036))

- Although the dialectic between acceptance and change is central to DBT, the therapist balances other opposing positions as well. For instance, she balances centeredness and flexibility. The need for this kind of balance can come into play when the therapist is trying to hold the patient to one of the expectations of treatment, such as the daily completion of a diary card. When the patient objects to completing it, it can become one of the many stalemates in treatment. The therapist orients the patient to the rationale and firmly insists on its completion. “I need you to complete the diary card so that I can see how you are doing every day on your target behaviors and your skills.” The patient may refuse, or only complete part of the diary card. Therapist and patient may become stuck, facing off against each other. Both sides can get rather rigid about it. In fact, the work done toward finding the synthesis can be valuable, and should not be rushed. As Linehan has put it in her supervision of therapists, “diary card therapy” might be valuable since “there are so many ‘diary cards’ in life, tasks we have to complete even though they are not particularly pleasurable.” One possible synthesis regarding the diary card involves shifting focus away from the form of the card and the details of the expectations, and instead focusing on the functions of the card. If we emphasize the functions of self-monitoring and communication of details to the therapist, we can be ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=2065))

- more flexible about the rules and the form of a diary card review. In one case, when I was working with someone who had significant learning disabilities and found the card to be too dense with cognition and numbers, we created a new card that was less dense, was more visually appealing, and allowed for ratings on a 1–3 scale rather than on a 0–5 scale. The patient was then willing, even proud, to do it. The better that therapists understand the real principles and functions of DBT, the more they can be flexible in negotiating the trappings.

- To accurately recognize opposing positions, to find the validity on both sides, and to shift back and forth in search of synthesis requires several therapist qualities. First, we need to stay alert, “awake,” agile, and responsive. Second, we need to maintain speed, movement, and flow, especially in the face of stalemates, impasses, and conflicts. Third, when we take positions in therapy, whether in concert with a patient or on the opposing side, it is valuable if we can take those positions with certainty, strength, and conviction in the moment, while at the same time being willing to listen to, and see the wisdom in, the other side. For instance, DBT therapists will typically hold patients to the expectations of treatment rather than treating them as fragile, but then will come to the patients’ aid, supportively coaching them in trying to meet those expectations that are difficult for them. Finally, DBT therapists work hard to keep the relationship intact, preserving it through inevitable challenges.

I do not describe the strategies here; they are described and illustrated with clinical examples in her DBT treatment manual (Linehan, 1993a). Instead I consider how the dialectical strategies flow from the principles discussed above. My emphasis is on elucidating the essential “formula” for dialectical strategies, such that a therapist might even improvise and create new ones that fit the situation. By keeping our minds on the principles, while applying dialectical strategies, we will “be dialectical” in treatment, alongside “being behavioral” and “being mindful.” Being dialectical affects the conduct of DBT more pervasively, so that we are not only resolving logjams, we are breaking up logjams almost before they happen through systemic thinking; speed, movement, and flow; and the awareness and synthesis of opposites.

- treatment, where two sides of a contradiction are simultaneously true. Examples abound. In life: To be more fully present requires having attended to the future; to plan the best vacation requires being fully in the present moment; and to be really independent is benefited by a capacity for healthy dependency. In treatment: If we repeatedly rescue our patients, we may lose the opportunity to help them save themselves; and even though someone’s problems may have been caused by others, the patient will need to solve them herself. None of these contradictions is difficult to understand, but if the therapist highlights the truth of both sides in the moment, in brief and without explanation, the patient may experience disbelief and confusion while vaguely recognizing the truth in what the therapist is saying. As Linehan (1993a) mentions in the treatment manual, the therapist should refrain from the urge to explain to the confused patient that the paradox “makes sense.” The goal is not to educate; the goal is to derail the patient from a stuck position. This approach to therapy is an echo of the earlier innovative work by Milton Erickson, who was a master of paradoxical interventions (Haley, 1973). The therapeutic style for this strategy is to be pithy, brief, matter-of-fact, stating truths that appear to contradict each other. It might be possible to break up the logjam of the moment by purposefully destabilizing the paralyzing homeostasis. For instance, the therapist might say:   “Your behavior makes total sense, and it has to change.” “If I didn’t care so much for you, I would try to save you.” “You have the right to kill yourself, and I have the right to stop you.” “If you want to get better at truly being with others, you have to spend more time truly being alone.” Two other dialectical strategies start with the recognition that the patient is engaged in a maladaptive position, almost inviting the therapist to challenge it. The patient holds the maladaptive position; the therapist holds the adaptive position. Both parties dig in their heels in opposition. Suddenly the therapist “leapfrogs” past the patient’s maladaptive position, taking a stance that is even more maladaptive than the patient’s. If done effectively, the patient is momentarily surprised and thrown off balance, again allowing for the possibility of repositioning and movement. One of these… ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=2134))

As I led her through a more thoughtful evaluation of the contribution of the three states of mind, she quickly realized that while it was rational for her to leave her job, and would be wise to find another one, she realized that the urgency was driven by emotion mind. She agreed to work with me toward a wise transition in her life, as well as a wise approach to tolerating her daily work life. Metaphors provide extraordinary utility in DBT as constructions that can creatively represent polarized situations and systemic thinking, and that can allow for movement in an otherwise stuck situation.

Stalemates, especially those regarding conditions and ground rules in the therapy relationship, can be handled by allowing natural change rather than by holding all conditions in place.

When 50 minutes were up, I usually found that we were in the middle of an important discussion. For some reason, it seemed to take us 50 minutes to get to a crucial point. When I realized it, I felt I was violating the limits that I had set and was a bit embarrassed about it. I brought it up to the patient: “Have you noticed that we usually go longer than the 50 minutes I told you we would meet for?” Patient: “Of course, I’ve noticed all along.” Me: “Why didn’t you say something?” Patient: “I was afraid you would take it away, and I feel like I need it.” Me: “I don’t know why, but maybe there is some kind of wisdom in our meeting a little longer.

These elements include the three sets of principles; the biosocial theory; the ultimate goal of a life worth living; the goals, stages, and targets; the functions and modes; the various sets of agreements made by patients, therapists, and teams; the sets of assumptions about patients and about therapy; and the entire collection of strategies used in DBT (which includes the skills).

To implement DBT, the tree serves as a blueprint of a comprehensive DBT program, diagramming all essential ingredients, allowing the implementation team to consider the presence and strength of all parts of the treatment and their relationship to each other. To adapt DBT to a different population or context, the implementation team can systematically consider which aspects of the original model program to preserve (as much as possible!) and which to modify. To consult with an existing DBT program, the DBT Tree serves as a mechanism for systematically assessing the roots, the trunk, and all branches, large and small, locating strengths and weaknesses, leading to a plan for strengthening the program.

It was difficult to “grow DBT” in an environment where it was viewed merely as a circumscribed protocol offering skills specifically to those with self-injurious behaviors, rather than being seen as a comprehensive model of psychotherapy for a group of complex disorders. As DBT eventually won respectability based on the steady growth of the evidence base in randomized controlled trials, and through championing by local DBT clinicians, these centers changed their attitude and DBT grew in stature and application.

- Linehan’s answer to the substantial degree of chaos, crisis, and comorbidity characteristic of individuals with severe emotional dysregulation was to establish a clear, prioritized, sequenced, specific list of behavioral treatment targets, known in short as the “target priority list.” In the initial sessions, therapist and patient collaborate to tailor a target priority list that will serve as the treatment agenda. It is done with reference to the target priority list template in the manual (Linehan, 1993a), which represents a distillation of years of treatment development and practice. It is organized around the individual patient’s unique preferences, life-worth-living goals, and the obstacles to those goals. And it is applied with a substantial dose of common sense, so that the list is realistic and useful session after session for weeks, months, maybe even years.

Without it, the course of treatment can drift over time, even within a given session, driven by emotional priorities rather than behavioral goals.

As a result, the individual who is already contending with a biologically based excess of poorly regulated emotional responses, fails to acquire the capacity to accurately discern and label her emotional responses, to understand her emotions in a compassionate manner, or to use strategies to regulate those responses.

- The three primary concepts in the biosocial theory—biologically based emotional vulnerability, invalidating environment, and chronic and severe emotional dysregulation—are seen from the perspective of the outside scientific observer. Each concept is defined objectively, in ways that can then be subjected to research. The outcome of the biosocial transaction takes shape in the form of certain complex behavioral patterns in the individual patient, and these are the dialectical dilemmas. But although the biosocial theory and the dialectical dilemmas are intimately related to each other, with the former giving rise to the latter, they represent very different perspectives. Rather than the objective, scientific perspective of the biosocial theory, the dialectical dilemmas represent the subjective perspective of the individual. For instance, emotional vulnerability is a scientifically defined construct, seen from the “outside-in,” when we are considering the biosocial theory; but the same term, when used to name one of the dialectical dilemmas, refers to the “inside-out” perspective of one who is suffering from uncontrollable, agonizing emotional responses. Similarly, in biosocial theory the term invalidating refers to an objective construct with several defined features, whereas the term self-invalidation, as one of the dialectical dilemmas, refers to the painful subjective experience of self-criticism or self-hatred. We move from the language of theory to the language of personal experience. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=3212))

- But the invalidating parental environment, for a range of reasons, is ill equipped to help the individual manage and process losses and traumatic events. Not only do the caregivers show disinterest in the individual’s negative life events; they are likely to communicate that those events didn’t really happen or were not that serious. We might recall the example earlier in this chapter, in which the parents of the teenage girl who was raped and then committed suicide minimized the traumatizing events of their daughter. By invalidating the nature or the extent of the painful experience, parents in these situations implicitly or explicitly insist that the young person bury his grief and traumas, and “stop complaining.” This pervasive message activates the two previously discussed dialectical dilemmas (emotional vulnerability vs. self-invalidation, and active passivity vs. inhibited grieving), and furthermore contributes to the third dialectical dilemma, inhibited grieving versus unrelenting crisis. Unable to process or tolerate the globally disruptive impact of negative life events, and unable to get effective help from the environment to do so, the highly sensitive, reactive individual reacts with affective dysregulation, distractibility, rigid and unrealistic thinking, faulty anticipation of consequences, and confusion. In this state, he acts impulsively and makes errors in judgment, resulting in the pattern of “unrelenting crisis.” It can be difficult even ([Location 3358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=3358))

- for a therapist to recognize that the pattern of impulsivity and poor judgment, fostering chaos, is related to an incapacity to tolerate and process responses to loss and trauma. Having an awareness of this pattern during careful listening and a systematic study of antecedents may help the therapist formulate the “underlying” problem: the failure to process life events in a safe and effective manner. Obviously, unrelenting crisis, driven as it is by unrealistic thinking and poor decision making, can lead to chaos, despair, and in the extreme case, suicide. Whereas unrelenting crisis is the pattern in this dilemma that is characterized by global dyscontrol (i.e., cognitions, emotions, and actions), its dialectical partner, inhibited grieving, heavily influenced by the invalidating environment, is characterized by overcontrol. The patient automatically avoids cues related to grief or trauma, and when exposed to them, attempts to escape from them and from his initial response to them as quickly as possible. The individual is engaged in a constant effort to block awareness and extinguish memory of negative events. As a result, he loses access to memories… ([Location 3368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=3368))

- eruptions of suppressed experience resulting in unrelenting crisis or the other two biologically driven patterns of active passivity and emotional vulnerability. Inhibited grieving, taken to the extreme, can result in a level of suppression and detachment that lends itself to extreme loneliness, despair, and suicide. To summarize, the biosocial theory posits a transaction that takes place between a biologically based emotional vulnerability and an invalidating environment. Burdened with this transaction, the individual undertakes the processes of learning to relate to the world and to her own responses to that world. Three of these processes are to modulate emotions, to ask for help, and to process painful life events. Rather than developing relatively balanced and effective solutions to each of these challenges, as might occur under more optimal conditions, the individual develops two dialectically opposed types of extreme behavioral patterns. Because each pattern is inherently unstable and temporary, the individual alternates from one of these patterns to another, a bit like switching from one bad channel to… ([Location 3378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=3378))

- As Linehan wrote in her manual, “Commitment itself is viewed as a behavior, which can be learned, elicited, and reinforced” (1993a, p. 285). Getting a commitment to making a behavioral change from someone without psychopathology is challenging enough. If you add to that the additional burdens imposed by the presence of emotional sensitivity and reactivity; a baseline of depression or high anxiety; a tendency toward avoidance, withdrawal, and fatigue; and a syndrome of mood-dependent behavior, you magnify the problem of commitment multiple times over. If self-injurious behaviors have evolved as the most and only reliable strategy for bringing emotional relief, and the therapist is asking the patient to give them up and use more adaptive behaviors that don’t work as well in the short run, the challenge is understandably enormous. Now consider further that the patient with whom you are trying to elicit a stronger commitment has been profoundly shaped by negative experiences of making such efforts in prior, pervasively invalidating environments. The mere thought of pushing oneself forward to realize life-worth-living goals and constructive intentions can elicit memories of being dismissed, criticized, demeaned, and blamed. For example: “What makes you think you can do this? What makes you think you are better than all the rest of us? Just give up!” A backlog of life and treatment failures infiltrates the woodwork of memory. For example: “I can’t do this no matter how hard I try and they can’t help me with this! I have never been able to stick with anything or succeed.” Now we are considering the monumental challenge of getting someone with borderline personality disorder to commit wholeheartedly to a defined challenge, whether it be to enter DBT treatment, to ([Location 4010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4010))

- sign on to the agreements in DBT, to target destructive behavioral patterns that have been reinforced a thousand times, or to try new skills. DBT has within it a huge range of strategies, skills, and protocols that facilitate behavioral change, but none of them will work without the requisite level of commitment, and the set of behaviors associated with commitment require attention throughout the treatment process. If you have a great set of tools and materials for building a house, and you have the skills to do it and the blueprints in front of you, you still will not build the house if you cannot generate and maintain the necessary commitment to exert the required effort. This basic reality was the discovery that launched the development and widespread application of motivational interviewing in the world of substance abuse treatment (Miller & Rollnick, 2012).

- Inherent in this is another Buddhist principle, nonattachment. It’s challenging but helpful, since the concept of commitment immediately pulls one’s attention to the future, to notice one’s attachment to how things should be and should have been. As soon as we think of committing to some behavioral pattern in the future, we tend to become attached to it, to ruminate about it, to assess whether we can do it, to go back over times when we failed to honor a commitment. We multiply our anxiety and our suffering by getting attached to what should happen instead of just staying focused, in this moment, on noticing and strengthening our commitment. We tend (and our patients tend) to get attached to whether we can do what we are saying we will do, and the associated anxiety results in diminishing the strength of our commitment. I am suggesting that we reach for a commitment that is centered only in this one moment, even though it is a statement about future behavior. Recently I asked a patient, whose depression and fear were resulting in a pattern of avoidance, to “just commit, right here, right now, to me, that you will get up tomorrow morning, and that whatever is your state of mind, you will get dressed, eat something, and go to school.” ([Location 4209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4209))

That is simply a fact, and it is not your fault. You cannot predict how you will feel. All you can do is to take care of this, and only this, one moment. And I am asking you, right here, right now, to decide that you are going to get up and go to school tomorrow. And I want you to picture it, to believe it.” “But how can I?” she asked, “I just don’t know what will happen.” ([Location 4218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4218))

- We can apply the same reasoning to the concept of commitment. We can realize that there is no such thing as commitment, as there is no such thing as self, and commitment is made up entirely of noncommitment elements. What we are conveniently calling commitment is simply a collection of behaviors that increases one’s chances of making desired behavioral change; it is not a real “thing” in itself. There is no real entity of self and no real entity of commitment. We are simply working to increase the collection of elements, energies, or behaviors that will help move things in the direction of the desired goal. This is consistent with the Buddhist principle of emptiness To let go of considering commitment as a solid and unique thing in itself, as a thing belonging to the individual, is to embrace the broader concept that commitment comprises a huge range of interdependent influences without boundaries.

- Weighing the Pros and Cons The entire commitment conversation revolves around the weighing of pros and cons of making a commitment. It is far from a simple listing of pros on one side of the page, cons on the other side, and then weighing them. Ideally it is an artful weaving back and forth between advantages and disadvantages of making the commitment to behavioral change. My preference is to begin with the cons rather than the pros. I ask the patient to explain to me why she continues to use the ([Location 4397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4397))

- problematic behavior, or why she does not engage in change. I enter into this conversation with a spirit of genuine curiosity, with the approach of truly wanting to “get it.” My goal is to understand the reasons for the patient’s persisting with the current behavioral pattern to such a degree that I myself begin to think I would make the same choice. As soon as I begin to notice that I am thinking, “Wow, if I were in that position, I would do the same thing,” I feel that I have arrived at a potentially helpful place. From that position I can genuinely express understanding of the patient’s rationale for not committing to change. I can articulate it to the patient and validate it, overcoming any judgmental reactions that I held before. At that point I tend to switch to the pros of making the commitment. I ask something like, “Given how much sense it makes for you to persist in doing what you are doing, and how little sense it makes for you to change your behavior, are there any reasons at all that weigh in favor of committing to change?” If I have accurately recognized the cons of changing and have joined the patient in that position for the moment, I find that the inquiry about the pros of changing behavior flows much better. In a commitment session with a 40-year-old woman who was seriously victimized as a child, developed PTSD as an adolescent, began heavy polysubstance use as a teen, and then added severe self-cutting in her late teens, all of which ([Location 4401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4401))

- On my inpatient DBT unit, our treatment program was entirely based on DBT. Sometimes we had a patient who “refused” to do DBT, did not want to attend the groups, learn the skills, or go to DBT-based therapy. I would tell that patient that he always had a choice. He could enter into the DBT programming, or he could choose not to participate. “But what would I do if I don’t participate in DBT?” I would answer that ([Location 4438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4438))

The patient had the freedom to choose and a relative absence of alternatives. If the insistence on not participating in DBT went too much beyond the first weeks, we would look for another setting to which to refer the patient if possible.

- the coming year!” Does the therapist ask for less than she actually hopes to get, in the service of eliciting and building upon the patient’s willingness?: “I want you to commit to completely abstaining from cutting, drinking, using drugs, or bingeing and purging only for the coming week, and then we will review the week and consider whether to renew the commitment for another week.” Or does the therapist begin by asking for something close to what she thinks is realistic and what the patient might be willing to do? The success of this intrinsically dialectical strategy requires us to “feel” where the patient is with respect to commitment. Is it enough to just “hint” at commitment, and then “let it rest” for a time? Are we being too careful if we do not boldly insist on commitment, a door-in-the-face commitment? Are we being too timid, too bold, too warm and accepting, too pushy? There is no answer in the absolute. Without knowing the context, we can’t say which route to take.

- CONCLUDING COMMENTS When DBT therapists are themselves (1) committed to the treatment and to behavioral change, (2) committed to their patients’ need to commit, (3) focused on specific goals or targets, and (4) have good connections with their patients, they stand a very good chance of eliciting sufficient commitment from their patients over time. To do so intelligently and artfully, it is helpful to grasp and implement the three paradigms and their principles, to maintain the “spirit of commitment,” and to appreciate and make use of the complexity and richness of each of the commitment strategies.

By trying to “overcome the resistance,” “get the data in spite of the patient,” or otherwise hang on to our desire to get what we consider a requisite level of detail about what happened, we grow more frustrated, less flexible, less aware of the patient in the moment, and we can end up invalidating the patient.

- Change Is Constant; Everything Is in Flux Discussed above as “impermanence” in the context of doing behavioral chain analysis, the recognition that everything is constantly changing, including every element brought into the chain, can set the stage for hope for the therapist and patient who are stuck repeating the chain analysis of a repetitive target behavior. I have often reminded myself, “This too will pass; this too will change.” Similar to the Buddhist recognition that “one never steps in the same stream twice,” the DBT therapist can recognize that one never conducts the same chain twice. The perspective that change is occurring helps to combat the sense of stuckness and paralysis that attends some therapies. And it promotes an approach to the chain that is itself characterized by movement. ([Location 4973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=4973))

Validation would help our relationship, which might be the most important thing. It would help my island companion to regulate her emotions. It might even make her a better problem solver without teaching her any problem-solving strategies. Sometimes we can be pretty confused, and if we just get validated, we figure out what to do.” Validation: the aspirin of DBT!

- Experts in DBT often instruct therapists to “validate the valid, and invalidate the invalid.” This statement can be rather confusing, given that, theoretically, every behavior has validity. Every behavior has been caused by all events up to that point in time. As I said in an earlier chapter, the world is perfect as it is. We ([Location 5369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=5369))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- can take this to mean that every behavior is valid with respect to the past. So, what do DBT experts mean? If everything is valid, why do we consider some behaviors to be invalid? Why do we choose to validate some behaviors and not others? The short answer is that we sometimes choose to invalidate behaviors because they will interfere with progress toward the patient’s previously stated goals. They are invalid with respect to the stated ends-in-view. Let’s say that our patient abuses heroin and has agreed to enter treatment to get clean. It is a high-priority treatment target. If the patient then goes on to use heroin, is there validity in this behavior? Yes, clearly there is. The behavior is valid with respect to the past and the individual’s biology; she has an addiction and we can see that, given this history and this biology, the use of heroin is valid. And it may be valid with respect to current context, in that it may be the one and only means through which she can alleviate her distress in her current context, and she may in fact function more effectively after using. The problem arises if we take validation to the final step of communicating the validity to the patient. Because validation usually also functions as reinforcement, we would probably be reinforcing her heroin use—obviously, not a good idea. If we validate in this context, we are opposing very important goals of the treatment.

- DBT’s biosocial theory begins with the proposition that patients have a higher-than-average degree of emotional sensitivity and reactivity, and a slow return to baseline from an emotional response. These patients’ emotional responses were invalidated in childhood by a pervasively invalidating environment, and over the course of time, they have come to respond to their own emotions by invalidating them. It has become automatic for them to respond to their own emotions by judging them, hating them, and maybe even hating themselves in their entirety. They have acquired the tendency to avoid emotional cues, suppress emotional responses, and escape from current emotions through actions or secondary emotions. Given the confusion and suppression that attend emotional experience for many DBT patients, it is important and validating simply to notice them, inquire about them, listen carefully to them, and encourage them to communicate with us.

- treatment. It is not. The ultimate aim is the pursuit of a life worth living through specified goals. Validation is one of the interventions that can be instrumental in getting there; it is a means to an end, not an end. I sometimes have shown videotapes of Marsha Linehan conducting individual DBT sessions. Not uncommonly the first question from the audience is, “Why didn’t Marsha validate the patient more?” There are two problems with that question. One is that the videotape may not reveal the presence of validation even if it is occurring in the room. It can be a subtle transactional process recognized only by the two participants. The other problem is that the questioner may be thinking that Marsha should have validated the patient more. Deciding whether, when, and how much to validate are complicated assessments and should be based more on whether the patient is progressing toward her goals than on some moral mandate to validate. Having said that, it is also true that ideally we use certain levels of validation all the time. In the next section, I outline the six levels of validation in DBT. Level 1 and Level 6 should be present consistently throughout treatment. Level 1 prescribes that a therapist be “wide awake” and alert while listening to the patient. Level 6 is described as “radical genuineness,” a stance in which we remain our genuine selves as we engage the patient in treatment.

We review these levels here so that we have all the technical aspects of validation in our minds as we move on to considering how the principles of the acceptance, change, and dialectical paradigms influence or modify our use of validation.

- Level 2, which involves reflection, is a natural extension of Level 1. By already being awake, aware, and listening, we are more likely to detect something in the patient’s words or gestures. We check it out by restating it, even using the patient’s words. A patient said to me the other day, “Charlie, in the last session you really disappointed me.” I took it in, restated it: “Oh. I didn’t realize that. I really disappointed you.” Patient: “Yeah, you came on way too strong.” The patient communicates it, I receive it and restate it (to confirm that I got it), and then we can move on. On the other hand, by restating it, the patient may hear that I did not really receive it or understand her accurately.

It’s not that I don’t feel understood by him. He doesn’t understand me, he never has.” If I am alert, awake, and I hear her correction of my reflection, I can try again: “Oh, I guess I misunderstood. You are saying that he just doesn’t understand. Right?” “Right.” The process of reflecting back what the patient actually says plays an important role in getting in synch with each other. It’s a back-and-forth dance that ensures mutual understanding or that lays bare a gap, which can then be acknowledged and addressed. It fosters attunement and attachment.

For instance, if we continue with the example “You say you are fine, but you don’t seem fine,” the patient may then clarify, “No, I really am fine, but I saw the dentist just before coming here, and my face feels distorted.” The interplay between Levels 1, 2, and 3—listening, reflecting, finding common ground, finding differences, correcting errors, repairing ruptures—goes on almost constantly in a good psychotherapy relationship. It is the dance of listening, recognizing, and empathizing. As the interaction between the therapist and patient unfolds, the therapist tries to hold the other person’s mind in her mind, hold her own mind in mind, and hold in mind the interaction between the two of them. It’s a finely honed skill, which, in attachment theory, is seen as the core skill for forming secure attachment relationships. It involves careful listening, sensitive responding, attunement, regular reflection, reading between the lines, and getting an increasingly elaborated narrative of the patient’s story (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004).

- Validation is the purest manifestation of the principles of the acceptance paradigm in DBT. Whereas most people think that validation is a completely familiar concept and practice, in fact it is much more complex. Its complexity becomes obvious when we use it in psychotherapy to treat individuals with emotional dysregulation, a history of pervasive invalidation, and a tendency toward self-invalidation. In this chapter, I have reviewed and illustrated many technical aspects of validation—functions, definitions, targets, and levels—and then considered the ways in which validation plays a role in the implementation of all three paradigms in DBT.

- In the middle of a difficult session, my 34-year-old female patient grew very frustrated with me. Nothing seemed to help. She began to stand up, and it was clear she was intending to walk out of the session. Aware that her urge to leave was strong, and that I was not likely to change her mind at that moment, I used eliciting wise mind to bring about a brief pause and catalyze further reflection in the moment. I said, “I can see that you are leaving, and I am not going to try to stop you, but can I ask you one thing before you go?” She shouted back at me, “What!?” “I just want to know, in deciding to leave, are you in rational mind, emotion mind, or wise mind?” She was definitive: “You know damn well that I am in emotion mind!” “Can I ask you one more thing then?” Again, “What!!!” ([Location 5965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=5965))

It didn’t stop her from walking out of the session, but from my point of view it was a significant step forward, helping her to directly express her anger. We could build on that step later.

- Although commonly used in the service of strengthening commitment, devil’s advocate can also be used in other contexts. I saw a young man who lived with his parents and had never lived on his own; one of the targets of treatment was to establish an independent life. He repeatedly claimed that he wanted to be autonomous of his parents, but he did not take the needed steps to make it happen. Following his lead, I worked with him to solve the problems, but we made no progress to get him to live outside his parent’s home. I validated his fears of independence and avoidance of the steps he needed to take. Still, there was no movement. Meanwhile, his parents were in conflict with each other about their son’s dependence on them, and they were often arguing. Realizing how stuck we were, I switched over to the devil’s advocate strategy. I argued that he should put aside his hopes of independence for the time being. “I have come to realize that your intentions to move out come at a bad time for your parents. They are arguing a lot, they seem unhappy together, and I think they need you at home to mediate their conflicts. Their problems could take years to resolve, if ever, but as their son it is your job to help them out.” He immediately argued back: “But you are asking me to put off my life to help them, and we don’t even know if it will help.” I kept advocating for the “devil”: “Yeah, I hear what you are saying, but can’t you just stay with them at least another couple of years so they can get their feet on the ground?” He responded, “but that’s 2 years of my life, and I’ve already been there forever.” By turning the tables, arguing against independence, his resolve to move out was strengthened. He was then in the position to convince me that he should move out, which provided more momentum than before. One might raise a question about this kind of paradoxical intervention in DBT. After all, as his therapist I actually did not want to have him stay with his parents for another 2 years for their sake. It sounds as if it is antithetical to the radically genuine stance that characterizes DBT. The problem is relatively minor if in fact (1) the therapist cares about and respects the patient, (2) sees the outcome as very important, and (3) has run out of other interventions to effect the outcome. It is a manipulative intervention, turning the tables to get the patient to reconsider his avoidance of moving toward independence. Any damage to the integrity of the relationship can be repaired after the fact if the therapist’s heart is in the right place. Occasionally there is a tension, a dialectic, between two priorities of DBT; in this case the priority on accomplishing the agreed-upon goal is in the service of building a life worth living, and the priority of being radically genuine. The synthesis is to be radically genuine in playing the devil’s advocate based on deeply caring about the patient’s life. Having reviewed four of the dialectical strategies, it is… ([Location 6029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6029))

- Extending is not always an appropriate response to threats or dysfunctional intentions. If the patient is not ambivalent about the threat, then extending it might just reinforce the dysfunctional response. In the context that calls for the use of extending, the therapist should be aware of two elements: (1) the patient communicates a manifest threat or dysfunctional intention, but (2) the manifest threat functions to communicate yet disguise a latent agenda. For instance, the manifest threat might be to quit therapy; the underlying agenda might be the communication of anger at the therapist. Or, the manifest threat might be a 15-year-old patient’s announcement that she is leaving home to live on the streets; the underlying agenda is to communicate that she is not being taken seriously or cared for at home. If the therapist simply works with the manifest threat with problem-solving strategies, she misses the latent agenda and perpetuates the stalemate. If she tries to address the latent agenda directly—“I guess you are angry at me and that is why you are threatening to leave me”—the patient denies it and strengthens the manifest threat. By extending the threat, the therapist is appearing to support and even amplify the manifest threat, but is actually precipitating an imbalance by turning the tables. If it works correctly, the patient can now state the underlying agenda. The therapist says, “Yes, let’s get you out of that house and ([Location 6076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6076))

- on your way; shall we look at some homeless shelters where 15-year-olds can live?” The patient is caught by surprise, stops arguing for leaving home, and might counter, “I don’t really want to leave home! I just hate it there!” Now the therapist and patient can shift to problem solving about the home environment. If the therapist is understandably frustrated with the patient and has become emotionally dysregulated and out of balance, extending can misfire. The suggestion to the patient that she do something even more pathological than she is threatening to do can feel like a rejection and a trick by the therapist. This strategy, like other dialectical strategies as well as DBT’s irreverent communication strategies, should be used by a therapist who is grounded in compassion and regard for the patient, feels emotionally balanced at the time, and can accurately read the patient’s ambivalence.

- The therapist is always deciding about the degree to which to “go with the flow” versus to challenge behavior. The whole treatment is based on the therapist’s capacity to define conditions of treatment, hold to those conditions, push for change, accept things as they are, and to find the synthesis of the two in the moment. Allowing natural change as a crystallized strategy and as a subtle in-the-moment set of decisions is part of that dialectical enterprise. While relentlessly pushing for change, we also incorporate the message from the Beatles: “Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.” ([Location 6160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6160))

- Or, in some cases, as beleaguered therapists ask themselves, “What am I missing in this situation?,” we might realize that we are not receiving sufficient support from our consultation teams and that we need to ask for more. The possibilities go on and on. We are always missing something—some perspective, fact, dynamic, treatment-related factor—so if we are stuck at an impasse in treatment, we should automatically ask, “What am I missing?” We might not find any satisfying answer, certainly not immediately, but simply to ask the question, and perhaps to change the level of magnification, alters everything and can provide a turning point.

But in each case, another crisis would appear, and our work would be undone. I asked myself the question, “What am I missing?” I spoke with my consultation team about it, and I posed the question to my patient. I wondered aloud with her, “Do you have any idea why we were not making progress?” Her answer was telling. “I think you care more about my progress than I do. I’m not really sure I want to make progress. It is hard to imagine a life that goes smoothly. I think it would be totally stifling.” I was completely surprised. She had put on a good show of engagement around identified goals, and I had completely missed her ambivalence about improving. She was then able to articulate a variety of fears of what life would be like if she were to make progress. Suddenly it made sense that she was not likely to make progress unless we addressed her underlying fears of success. Another way to ask the question “What am I leaving out of my current understanding?” is to ask which relevant links in the behavioral chain we are… ([Location 6251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6251))

- To illustrate how a therapist might invent and use new dialectical strategies, I mention two here that have worked for me: drop the rope and be the dog. Drop the rope is, of course, a metaphor itself. When I realize that I have fallen into a struggle with a patient in my problem-solving efforts, and that the struggle has become nonproductive and tiring, I imagine that the patient and I are involved in a tug-of-war, each holding opposite ends of a rope and pulling against each other, with neither side winning. Then I simply imagine dropping my end of the rope. Stated more ([Location 6287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6287))

- prosaically, I let go of my attachment to my side of the argument. This concept can be found within other dialectical strategies, such as allowing natural change. But sometimes I just find it useful, all by itself, to imagine the tug-of-war and to let go of my end of the rope, to see what will happen next. I was treating a teenage girl who would barely speak during the first 3 months of therapy with me. She actually would talk in the family sessions I held with her and her parents, where I taught skills to them, but not in individual sessions. She sat sideways to me, had long hair, and I almost never saw her face. She always seemed angry and resentful, treated me as if I were ridiculous and useless, and yet she continued to come to sessions—whereas she had dropped out of school. I tried everything I could think of just to get her engaged in conversation, including some of the dialectical strategies. Nothing worked. It was becoming difficult to go on as her therapist. One day I came into the session in a different frame of mind. I just felt that there was no point continuing to try to engage her in dialogue. I just started talking, and told her about something that had happened to me the previous day: THERAPIST: Yesterday I took my 2-year-old son with me to get the snow tires put on the car. He wanted to watch them as they hoisted the car up and changed the tires.

THERAPIST: (I’m a bit shocked, and I can tell that the question is heartfelt.) I was very lucky. The guy knew he hit something or someone, and he stopped backing up. I fell forward and hit my knees hard on the pavement. I held my son up as high as I could, and my elbows hit the pavement too. My son was fine. In fact, he thought it was pretty cool that within minutes there was an ambulance, a police car, and a fire truck from next door.

- engaged. Maybe she felt more comfortable when I spoke with her more like a friend talks with a friend, different than a therapist talking with a patient. Or maybe it made a difference to her that I provided an example in which I was hurt and vulnerable, and in which my son’s well-being was in jeopardy. I was never to know for sure, but I knew I had stumbled onto something that worked, and I tried to replicate it. I started the next few sessions talking about episodes from my own life in which I was vulnerable, in which I did things wrong, or in which people close to me were in jeopardy. She noticeably softened in her reactions to me, she sat facing me, and she began to open up about her own life. Within a few weeks we were working on her problems. I have labeled this dialectical strategy being the dog. Rather than thinking of the patient as a dog and myself as a trainer, using learning principles, I thought of myself as the dog and her as the trainer. As the dog, I was looking for reinforcement.

- For those therapists who are new to DBT, and who ask me how to get started, I generally suggest learning the skills and then teaching them to an individual or a group. In that process, you learn that in order to change behavior, you have to change behavior; that to teach the skills, you have to learn them yourself; that to teach the skills to others, you must get their attention; and that people do not learn to use new skills unless they perceive themselves as needing them. In the learning curve when becoming a skills trainer, you discover, firsthand, the necessity of all three steps of skills training: skills acquisition, skills strengthening, and skills generalization. Finally, you learn a great deal about behavioral treatment in general by starting out by learning and teaching the “replacement behaviors.” ([Location 6478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01GK5818Q&location=6478))

How difficult it is to solve a problem when you cannot see its infrastructure! The skills trainer who understands that the “devil is in the details”—that the details are skills deficits (and deficits in subskills), that skills deficits can be replaced with skills, and that to do so requires diligence, accuracy, and compassion—can change the patient’s life. And that skills trainer will realize that he cannot diagnose the impediments to a skill without seeing, or hearing about, the patient’s practice of the skill. He needs to see it, break it down, make specific coaching suggestions, have the patient do it again, and work toward a more integrated, smooth, and effective practice of the skill at hand.

- Beyond this agenda, in the service of helping each patient notice and overcome obstacles to the acquisition and strengthening of skills, the skills trainer is informed by the behavioral change principles that underlie the four change procedures in DBT.   The skills deficit model proposes that deficits in the skills repertoire of the individual account for problematic processes and outcomes, and that skills training is the solution.

The model of operant, or instrumental, conditioning proposes that targeted problematic behaviors are reinforced by consequences, and that the effective use of contingency procedures is the solution.

- IT IS UNIQUELY THE ROLE OF THE DBT CONSULTATION TEAM TO PREVENT AND TREAT THERAPIST BURNOUT OF EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM! I have yet to convey that therapist burnout is normal. Just as firefighters must prepare for the likelihood that they will, at some point, suffer some burn or smoke inhalation injury, DBT therapists must prepare for the likelihood that in working with emotionally dysregulated individuals, they will, at some point, become emotionally dysregulated. It is necessary to assume this as an expectable possibility at any time for any therapist on the team. One of the primary functions of a DBT team is to anticipate and actively manage therapist burnout, ideally preventing it whenever possible, detecting it when it happens, and treating it when it has occurred.

- Emotional dysregulation in one therapist becomes a point of concern for all; becomes, in a sense, everyone’s emotional dysregulation. The intimate quality of support stays with each therapist, so that even when he or she is doing therapy, it is, to some degree, as if the team were doing the therapy. In fact, Linehan has recommended that if one therapist on a team is called into a court hearing as a result of a patient’s suicide, the entire team should attend, making it clear that all are one in the team. Obviously, the chances of recognizing indicators of burnout and helping a therapist to process the emotional response is much more likely to happen in this team context than in a collection of separate, unrelated individuals, each one wary of the others. Recognizing the principle of impermanence—stating that everything, including things that we treasure and things that we fear, is transient—promotes a desire to live within, appreciate, and treasure the present moment. Every moment of every team meeting is fleeting, precious, unique, and will pass on immediately.

- “show up,” to share vulnerable material, and to take good care of each other. In short, each moment matters. Even if the present moment is unpleasant, and is not yielding a desirable solution, team members know that it is temporary, that things are changing, that “this too shall pass.” Therapists might be able to inhabit the precious moment, recognize it, and let go of the need to control it. It becomes easier to allow, and even trust, the emergence of possibility. Impermanence, in concert with present-moment awareness and nonattachment, helps each therapist to simply be in the moment, to let go of controlling it, recognize its transient nature, and engage in practicing the treatment. For the therapist who is “on the fence” with respect to sharing vulnerable feelings and difficulties in therapy, the resulting atmosphere will be more conducive to his or her “jumping in.” Burnout prevention becomes the natural consequence.

- For a consultation team to “be dialectical” adds enormous potential to prevent and treat burnout if it is used to augment, and not replace, standard approaches from the acceptance and change paradigms. To be dialectical means to elucidate opposing positions when there is a stalemate and then move toward synthesis. It means to expand the perspective of the therapist and the team to take account of systemic thinking. And it means to recognize that movement never stops and that it is helpful to keep things moving in therapy and in the team. It catalyzes creative and improvisational thinking and action that include taking some risks in the face of uncertainty. To realize that the team is a system, and that changes in any one member can bring about changes in all, opens the door to a myriad of dialectically based interventions.

It is my suspicion that the three paradigms also provide an excellent basis for solving stubborn problems in life in general: how to cope with chronic illness or care for a partner in decline, how to parent teenagers or manage family life, how to come to grips with adversity at work, and even how to perform at the highest level. Extrapolations of the principles of DBT beyond the clinical situation will have to wait for another book. For now, I focus on each of the three paradigms, presenting the five principles of each.
