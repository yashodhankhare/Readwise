- Category: #books

## Highlights
- The only question that counts is: What do you know that others don’t? ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=131))
- know anything others don’t. Most folks don’t think they’re supposed to know something others don’t. We’ll see why. But saying you must know something others don’t isn’t at all novel. Pretty much everyone who took a basic college investment ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=133))
- class was told this, although most people conveniently forget this truism. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=135))
- Markets are pretty efficient at pricing all currently known information into today’s prices. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=137))
- If you try to outguess where the market will go or what sectors will lead and lag or what stock to buy based on what you read in newspapers or chatter about with your friends and peers—it doesn’t matter how smart ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=140))
- or well trained you are—you will sometimes be right or lucky or both, but likely more often wrong or unlucky or both, and overall do worse than if you didn’t make such bets at all. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=142))
- Instead, it’s ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=163))
- surprise that moves markets. It’s what happens next that few previously fathomed. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=163))
- (The VIX ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=191))
- is a statistically provable worthless forecaster, by the way—but many people use it every day, applying a wasteful mythology losing more money than it makes.) ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=191))
- You might be much smarter than me, too. But that won’t make any difference on whether you can do better than me as an investor. Smarts and training are good—nothing wrong with them. A PhD ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=225))
- is good. But they aren’t enough. And they aren’t necessary. You must know something others don’t and then—with that extra something—you can do better than people who are smarter than you are. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=226))
- Why am I telling you this? Because most of what there is to know about investing doesn’t exist yet and is subject to scientific inquiry and discovery. It isn’t in a book and isn’t finite. We just don’t know it yet. We know more now about how capital ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=271))
- markets work than we did 50 years ago but little compared to what we can know in 10, 30 and 50 years. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=273))
- Contrary to what the pundits and professionals will have you believe, the study of capital markets is both an art and a science—one in which ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=273))
- theories and formulas continually evolve and are added and adjusted. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=274))
- To know things others don’t, you just need to think like a scientist—think freshly and be curious and open. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=280))
- As a scientist, you should approach investing not with a rule set but with an open, inquisitive mind. Like any good scientist, you must learn to ask questions. Your questions will help you develop hypotheses you can test for efficacy. In ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=282))
- the course of your scientific inquiry, if you don’t get good answers to your questions, it’s better to be passive than make an actionable mistake. But merely asking questions won’t, by itself, help you beat the markets. The questions must be the right ones ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=284))
- leading to an action on which a bet can be made correctly. So, what are the right questions? ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=285))
- First, we need a question helping us where we see wrongly. Then we need one helping us where we don’t see at all. Third, we need one helping us sense reality when our eyes aren’t at all appropriate as ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=289))
- tools. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=290))
- Over time, you get more knowledge, more data. Something that once worked doesn’t anymore. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=334))
- Something that didn’t work at all becomes more relevant. The world moves and changes and is dynamic, but the basic process of a disciplined scientific method shouldn’t change. Which is why these are the Three Questions that still ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=335))
- count. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=337))
- People persist in believing things that are wrong because, individually, people rarely investigate their ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=387))
- own beliefs, particularly when what they believe makes sense intuitively—even more so when those around them agree with them. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=387))
- For example, investors categorically believe when the stock market has a high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), it’s riskier ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=403))
- and has less upside than when it has a low P/E. Think about it casually, and it probably makes sense. A high P/E means a stock (or even the whole market) price is high—way high—compared to earnings. Get too far out on that scale, and it would ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=403))
- seem a high P/E means a stock is vastly overpriced and likely to start falling. This belief is so widely held by so many people, seems so logical and has been a basic tenet of investing for so long that if you start proposing to your friends it’s ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=405))
- false, you will meet with overwhelming rejection, ridicule and perhaps suggestions you’re morally deficient somehow. Yet I proved statistically more than 15 years ago the P/E, no matter its level, by itself ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=407))
- tells you nothing about market risk or return. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=409))
- To change the success (or lack thereof) you’ve had so far with investing, be skeptical. Be a cynic. Be the one to point out the emperor wears no clothes. Look ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=424))
- around and assess what you and your fellow investors are accepting as truth. But the most important person to be skeptical of is yourself. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=425))
- If I can prove I’m wrong and most everyone else is also wrong, then I’ve got some useful information. I can bet against everyone knowingly. I’ve got ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=435))
- one provable form of knowing something others don’t. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=436))
- For now, I just want you to accept in your bones if you can learn an accepted mythology is actually false, you ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=448))
- can bet against it and win more often than you lose. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=449))
- A good way to think about successful investing is it’s two-thirds not making mistakes ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=451))
- and one-third doing something right. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=452))
- Have you ever presented such a question to yourself about capital markets? Asking yourself if ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=461))
- what you believe is actually wrong requires introspection. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=462))
- In fact, overconfidence—the belief you can do something successfully when rationality would argue otherwise—is basic to human success in most fields and necessary to our successful evolution as a species. However, ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=465))
- it hurts tremendously when it comes to capital markets. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=466))
- I’d say you believe myths mostly because of two facts: (1) They ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=536))
- make common sense, and you aren’t typically prone to challenge your own common sense. (2) People around you tend to agree these things are true, and you aren’t prone to challenge widely held views. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=536))
- Note: Campbell and Shiller’s study, tepid support or not, became wildly popular because it ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=611))
- supported the view society had long held. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=611))
- What’s more, forecasting long-term stock returns is a near impossibility ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=627))
- because stock prices in the long term are the result primarily of shifts in far-distant levels of the supply of equities, which in today’s state of knowledge (or ignorance), no one knows how to address. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=627))
- But remember, when anyone gets angry, they are afraid and just can’t quite put their finger on their fear. In this case, I think it’s because very little real scientific work has been done analyzing shifts in supply and ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=629))
- demand for securities. Yet, by definition, shifts in supply and demand are what determine pricing. There are great future advances to be made here, but so far, the progress is minimal despite supply and demand being basic to economics. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=631))
- If you need ultra-complicated math to support the existence of a market myth, your hypothesis is probably wrong. The more jury-rigging and qualification your analysis needs, the more likely you’re forcing your ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=644))
- results to support your hypothesis. Forced results are bad science. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=645))
- Investors fall prey to myth because they’re used to seeing investing truisms in accepted and normal ways—as they were taught. Once you ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=706))
- start thinking even a bit differently—not in a complicated way, just differently, like graphing a bell curve or looking for the same phenomenon overseas—myths tend to fall apart. Whenever you’re confirming an investing belief, try ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=707))
- it from a fresh angle. Go crazy. Be creative. Flip things on their heads, backward and inside out. Hack them up and go over their guts. Instead of trying to be intuitive, think counterintuitively—which may turn out to be much more intuitive. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=708))
- Why does this myth persist? Because fundamentally, TGH is perverse and counterintuitive. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=723))
- Investors will actually adopt additional risk if they believe it can help them avoid a loss they would otherwise incur. Kahneman and Tversky described this phenomenon in what they called “prospect theory.” They discovered normal investors ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=752))
- (again, you) confuse actual risk with the perception of risk, all in the effort to avoid the possibility of a loss.9 The perception (or, one could say, misconception) of possible losses long misassociated with high-P/E markets is ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=754))
- what keeps investors fearful in what could otherwise be a relatively low-risk market environment. The same powers are at work at the bottom of a bear market. Investors are typically most fearful at the end of bear markets ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=756))
- when risk is diminished and upside potential considerable. Investors’ perceptions are just off. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=757))
- Investors, particularly many who consider themselves “value investors,” have had violent and ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=759))
- near-religious reactions to this notion. Instead of practicing introspection and asking themselves Question One—What do I believe that is wrong?—they grab at any straw to disavow they’re influenced by a very natural bias. In rebuttal, ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=759))
- they claim the phenomenon occurs because ultra-high P/Es come from suppressed earnings posted at the end of a recession. Not quite. This sometimes happens, but it’s far from universal. It certainly wasn’t ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=761))
- true in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=763))
- The counterintuitive truth is stock market returns following periodic deficit extremes have been much higher on average than surplus peaks or even decreasing ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=872))
- deficits. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=873))
- The word politics comes from the Greek poli, meaning “many,” and tics, meaning “small bloodsucking creatures.” ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=896))
- And you know he is dishonest, a slimeball and someone if whom your daughter planned to marry, you would instead seek a cult deprogrammer to protect her. What you have difficulty accepting is when ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=900))
- another poli-tic says things you like and believe in, that he or she is simply lying. Of course, that’s just my view. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=902))
- (Perhaps I’ve been bombastic for comedy’s sake in the past few paragraphs, but you’ll be a better investor and sleep better at night if ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=908))
- you tune out approximately 97% of what poli-tics say.) ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=909))
- This doesn’t work just with deficits. Anytime the media tries to scare you with huge numbers, think about it relatively—think scale. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=942))
- What can I see that others can’t? ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1006))
- In today’s world, if the global yield curve says one thing and America’s says another, go with the global. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1309))
- You can apply global thinking to so many things that the age-old but seldom-applied notion of “Think global, act local” is ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1397))
- a truly valuable saw—one way ahead of its time. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1398))
- Your biggest investing enemy is your brain. Even more precisely, your biggest enemy is the cerebral evolution that formed your brain to be largely focused on keeping you alive in the face of starvation, treachery and woolly, fanged ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1790))
- beasts. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1791))
- Investors aren’t rational automatons; they are humans and regularly behave in crazy ways when ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1834))
- making financial decisions. And that is because our brains weren’t set up to do this stuff. Our brains were set up to do survival stuff from a long time ago. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1835))
- If we can understand why people behave as they do, we can ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1836))
- better understand how markets work and bet better based on what we know about human behavior. If you can understand your brain better, you can understand how to better control yourself so you can begin avoiding many of ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1837))
- the typical mistakes investors make and begin lowering your error rate. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1838))
- After all, the market is nothing more than millions of people behaving like, well, cavemen. If you can unravel this code and understand your own decision-making process ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1840))
- better, you can conquer your caveman brain and get humiliated less by TGH—that is the goal. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1841))
- There is an age-old but almost universally true statement nearly ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1866))
- no one can accept: “Bull markets die with a whimper, not with a bang.” ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1867))
- Bear market bottoms are different only in form. TGH just ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1868))
- confuses us differently. Bottoms are often violent and sharp, freaking everyone out so enough folks finally dump their stocks. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1868))
- The only ones concerning us here involve market behavior. Most ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1890))
- investing errors result from cognitive errors, the most common of which we cover here. ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1891))
- Americans (we’ll assume you’re normal) hate losses about two and a half times as much as they like gains.6 ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1894))
- This is commonly known as loss aversion, sometimes referred to as myopic loss aversion, ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1896))
- intimating shortsightedness and an overactive reaction to short-term movements. It explains many investing errors. At root, myopic loss aversion and the mistakes it leads to are about two things—pride and regret. ([Location 1897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1897))
- Many sources say investors are ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1919))
- motivated by greed and fear. Behavioralists would disagree and suggest investors, and through them markets, aren’t driven by greed and fear, but by humanity’s drive to accumulate pride and shun regret. It just comes out as ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1920))
- greed and fear. ([Location 1921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1921))
- The natural tendency of ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1925))
- humans is to want to think success was because of skill and repeatability, not luck. ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1925))
- Regret is a process of denying responsibility for failure—attributing it not to lack of skill but usually to bad luck or victimization. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1930))
- Suppose Bill owns a stock that rises 40%. Bill was smart to have chosen such a stock. He is a savvy stock picker, and he believes he can do it again—he accumulates pride. ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1942))
- Then his stock drops 10%. He feels the loss about two and a half times as much as the gain and disregards the fact that overall he is still up 26%. The sudden drop causes pain he wants to avoid, so he shuns regret. He believes he was just unlucky on ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1944))
- this 10% drop because previous pride accumulation convinces him he can and will succeed overall. He considers selling while he can. He concludes the stock will fall further and loses sight of his long-term goals, focusing only on the short term, and ([Location 1945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1945))
- acts to minimize potential short-term pain. He sells the stock and protects his ego for another day of hunting. But the stock bounces back and goes to new highs. He chooses to ignore that because acknowledging it would cause too ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1947))
- much pain and ignoring it shuns regret nicely. Regret causes Bill to avoid pain by taking action—selling at a temporary relative low point. Pride prevents him from analyzing his behavior accurately, so he is ([Location 1949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1949))
- doomed to repeat this vicious cycle. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1951))
- Loss aversion causes investors to buy high and sell low—not a great strategy. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1951))
- One behavioral lesson learned in recent decades is the average investor is markedly overconfident. He believes he has greater skill than he really possesses. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1954))
- This is parallel to ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1955))
- the notion that 75% of drivers believe they’re above-average drivers. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1955))
- Reading The Wall Street Journal and a handful of blogs and newsletters every day doesn’t make anyone an investing expert. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=1966))

- Demand for currency is determined by ([Location 4834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORXIB6&location=4834))
