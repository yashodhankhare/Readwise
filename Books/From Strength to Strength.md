- In the sacred Hindu text Uddhava Gita, Lord Krishna teaches, “One who desires to adopt the third order of life, vanaprastha, should enter the forest with a peaceful mind, leaving his wife with his mature sons.” But then he adds, “Or else taking her along with him.”[8] I’ll take that second option.

- Finally, there is gratitude. Many have written about the so-called “gratitude walk,” the practice of focusing on the positive events in your life while walking, helping you to savor happiness by amplifying gratitude. I practiced this all throughout the coronavirus lockdowns, around my neighborhood nightly after dinner. It was one of the sweetest memories I have of that period, and it inadvertently prepared me for my Camino in 2021. Almost the moment I began the journey, my gratitude began to bubble up—for my family, faith, friends, and work; but also for a cool drink of water, taking off my shoes, and a soft pillow at night. I will be processing my Caminos for years to come. They helped me understand much of the change and turbulence in my own life and positioned me for a vanaprastha that is fruitful. Despite my best efforts here to describe them, they are fundamentally an ineffable experience, and a highly personal one as well. “It’s your road and yours alone,” wrote the Sufi poet Rumi.[16] “Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you.” All I can say is that you won’t be the same afterward. It will supercharge your vanaprastha. You might just walk right onto your second curve. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2290))

- When we think of our identities as fixed and unchanging—I am this kind of person; I am not that kind of person—we’re shutting ourselves off from many of life’s possibilities. Being open to reevaluating our ideas about ourselves can keep us from getting stuck in patterns that aren’t true to our changing selves. And what I have presented here shows that when it comes to faith, many people do change with age. Allowing that change to happen and developing our inner life helps us get onto the second curve.

- At first consideration, this seems like a leadership lesson worthy of Through the Looking-Glass, where up is down and backward is forward. For most of us, it sounds both impossible and insane to advertise our decline to those we need to impress. “Hey everyone—I am sick, suffering, and getting worse! Want to join my religion?” That’s pretty bad marketing. And advertising our own source of decline always seems bad for us, too, which is why people spend inordinate amounts of time and money trying to cover up the ravages of time. Botox, hair plugs, and invisible hearing aids are good business for a reason. ([Location 2342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2342))

- Decline is loss; loss is bad. Remediate it or hide it, but certainly don’t talk about it! Right? ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2349))

- Wrong. Paul was right. The secret to going from strength to strength is to recognize that your weakness—your loss, your decline—can be a gift to you and others. ([Location 2350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2350))

- Human connection through weakness I had a friend many years ago, a clinical psychologist with a booming practice in New England. At forty-five, he was at the top of his profession, which he adored. But he had a problem: having suffered all his life with type 1 diabetes, he was now losing his sight—not an uncommon malady for diabetics as they age. His initial reaction was total denial, and he insisted on continuing his life as he always had, including driving. He finally faced up to his impending blindness—averting potential tragedy—when his neighbors complained that he was running over their mailboxes. ([Location 2352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2352))

- He struggled for a number of years, angry at God for giving him this cruel fate. But then one day he received a phone call from a woman who told him she was experiencing a mental health crisis and needed treatment but had a reason not to divulge her identity. She was quite famous, it turned out, and desired anonymity even with her therapist. She needed—and found—a blind psychologist. He helped the woman and went on to build a practice around well-known people who desired similar treatment. What my friend had to do was let go of his pride and become defenseless in his weakness. Only then could he prosper in a new way. This is the case made by Brené Brown in her best-selling book Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead. Brown talks about making ourselves vulnerable to others if we really want to be happy and successful, that walling ourselves off hurts us. Another way to understand Brown’s point is that, as we all know, defensiveness is a terrible quality and never helps us. The right goal is defenselessness. ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2357))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But the point I’m making pushes the case a little further. It is indeed important to take risks and be willing to fail—to dare greatly, as Brown likes to say. But the true master then uses the inevitable failures—including the declines that inevitably follow a life of success—as a source of deep human connection. ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2365))

- Here is what I learned from that experience: it was through my weakness, not my strength, that I was able to connect with people I never would have met otherwise. These were strivers, outsiders who were overlooked in the traditional ways, and they were my people! I never would have connected to any of them had I not shared my story, with all its twists and turns. The lesson is that if you want to make a deep human connection with someone, your strengths and worldly successes won’t cut it. You need your weaknesses for that. If I had gone to a fancy college, it might impress people but it wouldn’t establish a connection with most of them. “Elite” means not many have that distinction, and that distinction is hard to attain. Elite credentials don’t make you relatable. They are a barrier to deep human connection. ([Location 2384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2384))

- No matter what your religious beliefs, there are two obvious lessons here. First, as I’ve been emphasizing over and over, it doesn’t matter who you are—if you live long enough, you will see the decline of your fluid intelligence. Second, you never really know what kind of impact your work will have had. There’s no telling. ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2399))

- So ask yourself: Which type of person do you want to be? One who declines with seeming indifference while suffering privately? Or one who—like Paul—acknowledges loss openly and yet maintains faith, believes in the power of love, and continues to serve others? Your decline, as painful as it is, should be experienced—and shared. ([Location 2411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2411))

- Vulnerability can be about little things or intensely painful personal experiences. In 2019, for example, the comedian Stephen Colbert elicited ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2422))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- an enormous amount of public admiration when he was asked in an interview by CNN’s Anderson Cooper about a plane crash that killed Colbert’s father and two of his brothers when he was ten years old. Cooper had heard Colbert say previously that he had learned to “love the thing that I most wish had not happened.” He asked Colbert to clarify this extraordinary statement. “It’s a gift to exist, and with existence comes suffering,” replied Colbert. “I don’t want it to have happened . . . but if you are grateful for your life . . . then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can’t pick and choose what you’re grateful for.”[10] Beyond simply demonstrating incredible vulnerability, Colbert is saying that he found strength in his tragedy. The psychiatrist Victor Frankl said much the same thing in his famous book Man’s Search for Meaning, which chronicled in intimate detail his time imprisoned by the Nazis in the Auschwitz concentration camp.[11] “When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2423))

- that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.” Frankl felt that people could find the meaning of their lives, and personal growth, in all kinds of suffering. Colbert’s and Frankl’s ideas are at odds with the way we typically see suffering and weaknesses today—as something to be avoided, and certainly not shared. They are personal, embarrassing, or too painful to recount. Further, we have a tendency to assume that traumatic events, from accidents to illnesses to all kinds of personal loss, can only provoke pain and lingering problems, especially if we talk about them with others. However, this isn’t generally the case. The key, as Colbert and Frankl suggest, is finding meaning in the suffering and sharing that meaning. I have seen this remarkable… ([Location 2433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2433))

- prognosis might logically have sunk him further into his natural funk. Just the opposite happened: he realized that he had been missing his own true life and he decided that—confronted with limited time—he wasn’t going to miss any more of it. He vowed to remember that every day might be his last, to live whatever life he had left simply as he truly was, focused on what he truly loved, and to share this truth with others. By some miracle, my friend survived a year, then another, and then two decades more. His doctor said the cancer would ultimately be back at some point—the wolf is always at the door with these things—which, paradoxically perhaps, kept him from going back to his old ways of thinking. He was happy and grateful for waking up from his slumber decades ago and continued to live as if he were enjoying his last few months.

- Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud believed that trauma from pain and loss is always harmful to a person, and relief requires getting beyond trauma’s often-hidden mal-effects.[12] Of course, we can find many cases of deleterious trauma, including among sufferers of abuse and PTSD. But this is not the norm.[13] Emerging research shows clearly that most people are resilient—even more, that they grow from losses and negative events.[14] Negative emotions make us more effective in our day-to-day activities. In an influential 2009 article in the journal Psychological Review, the evolutionary psychologists Paul W. Andrews and J. Anderson Thomson argue that sadness has persisted in the face of evolution because it brings cognitive benefits.[15] There is evidence that it makes us better at assessing reality in social situations, because we are less likely to flatter ourselves or… ([Location 2450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2450))

- Psychologists have found that many of the most meaningful experiences in life are quite painful.[17] In one 2018 study, for example, two psychologists at Western Illinois University asked a large group of college students to report the positive and negative emotions—as well as the meaningfulness—they associated with their education and with their relationships.[18] The students reported that these things gave them tremendous meaning, but that the cost was high. As the researchers summarized their findings, “Meaning involves negative affect and worry about loss.” Finally, exposure to negative emotions makes us stronger for when there is a true crisis. Research shows that stress inoculation training—in which people learn to cope with anger, fear, and anxiety by being exposed to stimuli that cause these feelings—is effective in creating emotional resilience.[19] It is easy to imagine that attempts to… ([Location 2462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2462))

- In the last decade of Beethoven’s life (he died at fifty-six), his deafness was complete, so his compositions were only in his imagination. That meant the end of his compositional career, right? Wrong. During that period, Beethoven wrote the music that would define his unique style, change music permanently, and give him a legacy as one of the greatest composers of all time. Entirely deaf, Beethoven wrote his best string quartets (with more high notes than in works from the previous decade), his magisterial Missa Solemnis, and his greatest triumph of all, the Ninth Symphony. He insisted on conducting the latter piece’s premier in Vienna (although there was a second conductor standing behind Beethoven whom the orchestra was actually following). After the performance, unaware of the standing ovation his masterpiece was receiving, Beethoven had to be physically turned around by one of the musicians to see the audience that was cheering for perhaps the greatest orchestral piece ever written. Being aware of Beethoven’s deafness, they threw their hats and scarves in the air to make sure he could see their enthusiasm. It seems counterintuitive, to say the least, that Beethoven became more original and brilliant as a composer in inverse proportion to his ability to hear his own—and others’—music. But maybe it isn’t so surprising. As his hearing deteriorated, he was less influenced by the prevailing compositional fashions and more by the music forming inside his own head. His early work is pleasantly reminiscent of his instructor Joseph Haydn’s music. Beethoven’s later work became so original that he was, and is, regarded as the father of music’s Romantic period. “He opened up a new world in music,” said French Romantic master Hector Berlioz, who idolized the deaf composer. “Beethoven is not human.”[23] ([Location 2501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2501))

- its discomforts to be sure and entails loss. But it is also an opportunity—to connect more deeply with others; to see the sacredness in suffering; even to find new areas of growth and success. Stop hiding it, and don’t resist it. Doing so has another benefit for strivers—maybe the most important one of all: you can finally relax a little. When you are honest and humble about your weaknesses, you will be more comfortable in your own skin. When you use your weaknesses to connect with others, love in your life will grow. And finally—finally—you will be able to relax without worrying about being exposed as less than people think you are. To share your weakness without caring what others think is a kind of superpower. What I am recommending here is going to be hard for some readers, though. I know, you’ve learned your whole life to do the opposite: show strength! Sharing weakness is hard because it is the ultimate act of subversion against your special, objectified self. You won’t go down without a fight!

- If you are reluctant to embrace your weaknesses, start by imagining the peace in your heart from no longer pretending you are not weak. Visualize others drawn to you as a person of authenticity, defenseless and unafraid. See how they relax around you and confide in you. See how it lifts their spirits to be around a person of your considerable accomplishment who is unafraid to say, “I once was better at this than I am.” Imagine people who are happier and less afraid because of you. Feel the relaxation in your mind and body that comes from being truly yourself, without hiding anything, and without caring about the results. See yourself relaxing in your humility, being yourself—and thus ready to jump to the second curve. But you still do have to jump. And as people remind me all the time, that means definitively leaving what is known and comfortable, and striking out in a new direction in life. It means a big life transition, and as we all know, transitions can be hard. So that’s where we need to turn our attention next: making the jump.

- Liminality There’s nothing new about hard, scary, midlife transitions. In his fourteenth-century Divine Comedy, Dante Alighieri nicely sums up a fear many of us have had: Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark For the straightforward pathway had been lost.[2] Psychologists have a special word for uncomfortable life transitions: “liminality.”[3] It means the time between work roles, organizations, career paths, and relationship stages. The author Bruce Feiler wrote a popular book in 2020 on liminality called Life Is in the Transitions: Mastering Change at Any Age.[4] ([Location 2566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2566))

- In his book, he interviews hundreds of people about their transitions, finding that a significant change in life occurs, on average, every eighteen months, and that lifequakes like his—or those that involve voluntary or involuntary career changes—happen very regularly. Most are involuntary—and thus unwelcome at the time—but nothing is more predictable than change. Most wisdom traditions have long taught this. The Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius said that “the universe is transformation, life is opinion.”[6] The Buddha spoke very frequently about the impermanence (in Sanskrit, anitya) of everything. “Impermanent truly are conditioned things, having the nature of arising and passing away,” he taught. It struck him as the greatest irony that the ([Location 2579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2579))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- central characteristic of the universe—change—is the thing with which we are most uncomfortable. He taught that to be at peace, we must accept the impermanence of life and existence. There are many meditations on impermanence, and they almost all take the same basic form, of calmly noticing and accepting the change that surrounds you at every second. For example, without judgment, notice the constant changes in your thoughts and perceptions as your mind wanders from topic to topic. Feel your breathing and perhaps your pulse, and visualize the changes you cannot feel, such as the cells that are dividing and dying, the growth of your hair and fingernails. Consider the changes occurring in the world that you can’t see but you know are occurring: people accomplishing things, being born and dying; the earth moving around the sun, and the moon around the earth. Impermanence is simply the state of nature. ([Location 2585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2585))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Liminality is uncomfortable, as all transitions are difficult. But here’s the good news: even unwelcome transitions are usually seen differently in retrospect than they are in real time. Indeed, Feiler finds that 90 percent of the time, people ultimately report that their transition was a success, insofar as they made it through in one piece and with no permanent setbacks. Even better, research shows that we tend to see important past events—even undesirable ones at the time—as net positives over time.[9] This ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2615))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is in part because unpleasant feelings fade more than pleasant feelings do, a phenomenon known as “fading affect bias.” This may sound like a cognitive error but really isn’t. Almost every transition—even the most difficult one—bears some positive fruit; we usually see and treasure it in the long run. For example, one of my sons is in the military. His boot camp was absolutely brutal, and a day after it finished, he told me he’d never voluntarily do anything like that again. Today, he talks about the experience—which earned him the title “U.S. Marine”—with amusement, relish, and pride. In fact, it is the difficult, painful transitions that can yield the greatest understanding of purpose in our lives. Research on how people derive meaning has uncovered that we actually need periods of pain and struggle that make us temporarily unhappy.[10] To quote one study from 2013 that surveyed a national random sample of 397 adults, “Worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness.” In his book Meanings of Life, psychologist Roy Baumeister argues that when you find meaning, life seems more stable. Perhaps paradoxically, suffering during transitions can create the meaning in life that imposes a sense of stability over subsequent transitions.[11] This is one of the great consolations of aging and seeing a lot of change.

- LESSON 1: IDENTIFY YOUR MARSHMALLOW Maybe “find your marshmallow” sounds like some groovy sixties code language for dropping acid or joining a commune, but you already know that’s not my advice. It’s actually just a nod to a classic social-science experiment.[21] In 1972, the Stanford University social psychologist Walter Mischel undertook a psychology experiment involving preschool kids and a bag of marshmallows. He would sit across the table from each child, take out a marshmallow, and ask, “Do you want it?” Obviously, they did. He told them it was theirs—but there was a catch. He was going to leave the room for fifteen minutes. The child could eat the marshmallow while he was gone, if he or she wanted. But when the researcher came back in, if the first marshmallow was still there, the child would get a second one. Mischel found that a majority of the kids couldn’t wait and gobbled up the marshmallow ([Location 2762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2762))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- when he left the room. He followed up on the children in the study and found that those who were able to delay their gratification found greater success as they grew up: they were healthier, happier, earned more, and scored higher on their SATs than the kids who had eaten the marshmallow.[22] In the years that followed, other researchers pointed out that Mischel’s results were about far more than just willpower; they also involved a child’s family background, socioeconomic circumstances, and other factors.[23] But the implication remained: good things come to those who wait—and work, and sacrifice, and maybe even suffer. The question for you is not whether you could have passed Mischel’s marshmallow test; you wouldn’t be bothering with this book if you couldn’t, because you wouldn’t have had enough success to be suffering right now. The question, at this moment of reset, is, What exactly is the next marshmallow? Do you know what you want as you start making new sacrifices? If you are scratching your head, don’t despair—that’s what the next three lessons are for. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2771))

- And this leads me to underscore once again the truth that nature is not destiny and, sometimes, we must fight our natural instincts if we want to be happy. This is hard for some people to believe, I know. Our worldly urges for money, power, pleasure, and prestige come from our ancient limbic brains. We also instinctively want to be happy and satisfied. We then make an erroneous connection: “Since I ([Location 2856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WCKY8MB&location=2856))

- have these urges, following them must make me happy.” But that is Mother Nature’s cruel hoax. She doesn’t really care either way whether you are unhappy. If you conflate intergenerational survival with well-being, that’s your problem, not hers. And matters are hardly helped by Mother Nature’s useful idiots in society, who propagate a popular piece of life-ruining advice: “If it feels good, do it.” Unless you share existential goals with protozoa, this is often flat-out wrong. To go from strength to strength requires learning a new set of life skills. We need to adopt a new formula, which I have laid out in detail in this book, chapter by chapter. But of course you are unlikely to memorize the last sixty thousand words. So let me summarize the whole book in seven—a formula that encapsulates all the lessons I have learned and now strive to live: Use things. Love people. Worship the divine.
