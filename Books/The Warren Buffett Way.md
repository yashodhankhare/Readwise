## Highlights
- It’s not that no investors beat the market. Every once in a while some do, and just as many underperform; market efficiency isn’t so strong a force that it’s impossible for individual investors’ returns to deviate from the market’s return. It’s merely asserted that no one can do it to a sufficient degree and consistently enough to disprove the Efficient Market Hypothesis. There are outliers, as in most processes, but their superior returns are described as being based on randomness and thus ephemeral. When I grew up, there was a saying that “If you put enough chimpanzees in a room with typewriters, eventually one of them will write the Bible.” That is, when randomness is present, just about anything can happen once in a while. However, as my mother used to say, “It’s the exception that proves the rule.” A general rule may not hold 100 percent, but the fact that exceptions are so rare attests to its basic truth. Every day, millions of investors, amateur and professional alike, prove you can’t beat the market. And then there’s Warren Buffett. Warren and a few other legendary investors—including Ben Graham, Peter Lynch, Stan Druckenmiller, George Soros, and Julian Robertson—have performance records that fly in the face of the Chicago School. In short, they’ve outperformed by a big enough margin, for long enough ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=135))

- periods of time, with large enough amounts of money, that the advocates of market efficiency are forced onto the defensive. Their records show that exceptional investors can beat the market through skill, not chance. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=146))

- Finally, he’s not worried about losing his job. Very few investors are able to take all the actions they think are right. Many are constrained in terms of their ability to buy assets that are illiquid, controversial or unseemly; sell appreciating assets that “everyone” is sure will go further; and concentrate their portfolios in their few best ideas. Why? Because they fear the consequences of being wrong. “Agents” who manage money for others worry that acting boldly will expose them to the risk of being fired by their employers or terminated by their clients. Thus, they moderate their actions, doing only that which ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=255))

- is considered prudent and uncontroversial. That’s the tendency that caused John Maynard Keynes to observe, “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” But that tendency introduces an important conundrum: if you’re unwilling to take a position so bold that it can embarrass you if it fails, it’s correspondingly impossible to take a position that can make a real difference if it works out well. Great investors are able to follow up their intellectual conclusions with action; in short, they dare to be great.

- Warren Buffett stresses that the critical investment factor is determining the intrinsic value of a business and paying a fair or bargain price. He doesn’t care what the general stock market has done recently or will do in the future. He purchased over $1 billion of Coca-Cola in 1988 and 1989 after the stock had risen over fivefold the prior six years and ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=354))

- over five-hundredfold the previous 60 years. He made four times his money in three years and plans to make a lot more the next five, 10, and 20 years with Coke. In 1976 he purchased a very major position in GEICO when the stock had declined from $61 to $2 and the general perception was that the stock was definitely going to zero.

- Warren Buffett has established a high standard for the future performance of Berkshire by setting an objective of growing intrinsic value by 15 percent a year over the long term, something few people, and no one from 1956 to 1993 besides himself, have ever done.

- When Warren Buffett visited my father 40 years ago, in a world with relatively primitive information tools by today’s standards, my father had his own ways of gathering information. He slowly built a circle of acquaintances over the decades—investment professionals he respected and who knew him well enough to understand what he was and wasn’t interested in, and who might share good ideas with him. Toward that end, he concluded that he would meet any young investment professional once. If he was impressed, he might see that person again and build a relationship. He rarely saw anyone twice. Very high standards! In his mind, if you didn’t get an “A,” you got an “F.” And once he had judged against someone, he simply excluded that person, forever. One shot at building a relationship. Time was scarce. Warren Buffett as a young man was among the very, very few who impressed my father sufficiently in his first meeting to merit a second meeting and many more meetings after that. My father was a shrewd judge of character and skill. Unusually so! He based his career on judging people. It was one of his best qualities and a major reason why ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=414))

- he put so much emphasis on qualitative judgment of business management in his stock analysis. He was always very proud he had picked Warren Buffett as an “A” before Buffett had won his much-deserved fame and acclaim.

- Every decade, Mr. Buffett has done things no one would have predicted from reading about his past, and done them well. Within professional investing, most people learn in craft-like form some particular style of investing and then never change. They buy low price-earnings (P/E) stocks or leading tech names or whatever. They build that craft and then never change, or change only marginally. In contrast, Warren Buffett consistently took new approaches, decade after decade—so that it was impossible to predict what he might do next. You could not have predicted his 1970s franchise orientation from his original strict value bent. You could not have predicted his 1980s consumer products orientation at above-market average P/Es from his previous approaches. His ability to change—and to do it successfully—could be a book unto itself. When most people attempt to evolve as he has, they fail. Mr. Buffett didn’t fail, my father believed, because he never lost sight of who he was. He always remained true to himself. My father was never physically far for very long from Rudyard Kipling’s famous poem, “If.” In his desk, by his nightstand, in his den—always close. He read it over and over and ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=449))

- quoted it often to me. I keep it by my desk as part of keeping him close to me. Being insecure but undaunted, he would tell you in Kipling-like fashion to be very serious about your career and your investments, but do not take yourself too seriously. He would urge you to contemplate others’ criticisms of you, but never consider them your judge. He would urge you to challenge yourself, but not judge yourself too extremely either way and, when in your eyes you’ve failed, force yourself to try again. And he would urge you to do the next thing, yet unfathomed. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=458))

- And that is the prime part of Warren Buffett you should try to emulate. Know who you are. I am writing this introduction in part to suggest to you how to use this book. Throughout my career, people have asked me why I don’t do things more like my father did or why I don’t do things more like Mr. Buffett. The answer is simple. I am myself, not them. I have to use my own comparative advantages. I’m not as shrewd a judge of people as my father and I’m not the genius Buffett is. It is important to use this book to learn, but don’t use this book to be like Warren Buffett. You can’t be Warren Buffett and, if you try, you will suffer. Use this book to understand Buffett’s ideas and then take those ideas and integrate them into your own approach to investing. It is only from ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=475))

- your own ideas that you create greatness. The insights in this book are useful only when you ingest them into your own persona rather than trying to twist your persona to fit the insights. (A twisted persona is a lousy investor unless you’re twisted naturally.) Regardless, I guarantee that you cannot be Warren Buffett no matter what you read or how hard you try. You have to be yourself. That is the greatest lesson I got from my father, a truly great teacher at many levels—not to be him or anyone else, but to be the best I could evolve into, never quitting the evolution. The greatest lesson you can glean from Warren Buffett? To learn from him without desiring to be like him. If you’re a young reader, the greatest investment lesson is to find who you really are. If you’re an older reader, the greatest lesson is that you really are much younger than you think you are and you should act that way—a rare gift. Were that not possible, then Mr. Buffett wouldn’t still be ably evolving at what for most people is postretirement age. Think of Warren Buffett as a teacher, not a role model, and think of this book as the single best explanation of his teachings, well stated and easily learned. You can learn an enormous amount from this book, and that can be the foundation for developing your own successful investment philosophy.

- “What we do is not beyond anybody else’s competence,” said Buffett. “I feel the same way about managing that I do about investing: It’s just not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.” ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=544))

- At the 1995 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Charlie Munger said, “It’s extraordinary how resistant some people are to learning anything.” Buffett added, “What’s really astounding is how resistant they are even when it’s in their self-interest to learn.” Then, in a more reflective tone, Buffett continued, “There is an incredible resistance to thinking or changing. I quoted Bertrand Russell one time, saying, ‘Most men would rather die than think. Many have.’ And in a financial sense, that’s very true.” ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=587))

- “Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily understood business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher, five, ten, and twenty years from now. Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet those standards—so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.” ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=606))

- American Express was one of the biggest casualties of what became known as the salad oil scandal. The company lost $58 million and its share price dropped by over 50 percent. If Buffett had learned anything from Ben Graham, it was this: When a stock of a strong company sells below its intrinsic value, act decisively. Buffett was aware of the $58 million loss, but what he did not know was how customers viewed the scandal. So he hung out at the cash registers of Omaha restaurants and discovered there was no drop-off in the use of the famous American Express Green Card. He also visited several banks in the area and learned that the financial scandal was having no impact on the sale of American Express Travelers Cheques. Returning to his office, Buffett promptly invested $13 million—a whopping 25 percent of the partnership assets—in shares of American Express. Over the next two years, the shares tripled and the partners netted a cool $20 million in profit. It was pure Graham, and pure Buffett.

- Buffett mailed a letter to his partners confessing that he was out of step with the current market environment. “On one point, however, I am clear,” he said. “I will not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand, although I find it difficult to apply, even though it may mean forgoing large and apparently easy profits, to embrace an approach which I don’t fully understand, have not practiced successfully and which possibly could lead to substantial permanent loss of capital.”20 ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=847))

- However, he made it clear that he expected the textile group to earn positive returns on modest capital expenditures. “I won’t close down a business of subnormal profitability merely to add a fraction of a point to our corporate returns,” said Buffett. “I also feel it is inappropriate for even an exceptionally profitable company to fund an operation once it appears to have unending losses in prospect. Adam Smith would disagree with my first proposition and Karl Marx would disagree with my second; the middle ground,” he explained, “is the only position that leaves me comfortable.”21 ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=873))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Despite the misfortunes of the textile group, the experience was not a complete failure. First, Buffett learned a valuable lesson about corporate turnarounds: They seldom succeed. Second, the textile group did generate enough capital in the early years to buy an insurance company, and that is a much brighter story.

- In 1967, the two insurance companies had a bond portfolio worth more than $24.7 million and a stock portfolio worth $7.2 million. In two years, the combined portfolio approached $42 million. This was a handsome portfolio for a seasoned stock picker like Buffett. He had already experienced some limited success managing the textile company’s securities portfolio. When Buffett took control of Berkshire in 1965, the company had $2.9 million in marketable securities. By the end of the first year Buffett had enlarged the securities account to $5.4 million. In 1967, the dollar return from investing was three times the return of the entire textile division, which had 10 times the equity base of the common stock portfolio.

- Considering the complexities of the issue, Graham proposed his own definition: “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”3 That simple sentence is densely packed with ideas, and they deserve our careful attention. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1068))

- multiplying those earnings by an appropriate capitalization factor. This capitalization factor, or multiplier, is influenced by the company’s stability of earnings, assets, dividend policy, and financial health. He added a strong caution: The success of this approach is limited by our ability to calculate a company’s economic future, a calculation that is unavoidably imprecise. Future factors such as sales volume, pricing, and expenses are difficult to forecast, which makes applying a multiplier that more complex. In spite of that, Graham believed that the margin of safety could work successfully in three areas: (1) in stable securities such as bonds and preferred stocks; (2) in comparative analysis; and (3) in selecting stocks, provided the spread between price and intrinsic value is large enough. Graham asked us to accept that intrinsic value is an elusive concept. It is distinct from the market’s quotation price. Originally, intrinsic value was thought to be the same as a company’s book value, or the sum of its real assets minus its obligations. This notion led to the early belief that intrinsic value was definite. However, analysts came to know that the value of a company was not only its net real assets but also the value of earnings that these assets produce. Graham proposed that it was not essential to determine a company’s exact intrinsic value; even an approximate value, ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1126))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- compared against the selling price, would be sufficient to gauge the margin of safety. Financial analysis is not an exact science, Graham reminded us. To be sure, certain quantitative factors lend themselves to thorough analysis: balance sheets, income statements, assets and liabilities, earnings, and dividends. We must not, however, overlook certain qualitative factors that are not easily analyzed but are nonetheless essential ingredients in determining a company’s intrinsic value. Two of these are management capability and the nature of the business. The issue for Graham was: How much attention should be paid to them? He had misgivings about the emphasis placed on qualitative factors. Opinions about management and the nature of a business are not easily measured, and that which is difficult to measure can be badly measured. Optimism over qualitative factors often found its way to a higher multiplier. Graham’s experience led him to believe that, to the extent investors moved away from hard assets and toward intangibles, they invited a potentially risky way of thinking. If, on the other hand, a greater amount of a company’s intrinsic value is the sum of measurable, quantitative factors, Graham figured that the investor’s downside was more limited. Fixed assets are measurable. Dividends are measurable. Current and historical earnings are measurable. Each of these factors can be demonstrated by figures ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1137))

- There are two rules to investing, said Graham. The first rule is: Don’t lose. The second rule is: Don’t forget the first rule. Graham solidified this “don’t lose” philosophy into two specific, tangible guidelines that cemented his margin of safety: (1) buy a company for less than two-thirds of its net ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1159))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Over the years, many other investors have searched for similar shortcuts for determining intrinsic value. And while Graham’s low price-to-earnings ratio approach is still generally favored, we have learned that making decisions based solely on accounting ratios is not enough to ensure profitable returns. Today, most investors rely on John Burr Williams’s classic definition of value, as described in his book The Theory of Investment Value (Harvard University Press, 1938): The value of any investment is the discounted present value of its future cash flow. We will learn more about the dividend discount model in Chapter 3. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1175))

- From these experiences, Fisher came to believe that superior profits could be made by (1) investing in companies with above-average potential and (2) aligning oneself with the most capable management. To isolate these exceptional companies, Fisher developed a point system that qualified a company according to the characteristics of its business and management. The characteristic of a company that most impressed Fisher was its ability to grow sales and profits over the years, at rates greater than the industry average.8 To do ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1204))

- that, Fisher believed that a company needed to possess “products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for several years.”9 Fisher was not so much concerned with consistent annual increases in sales. Rather, he judged a company’s success over a period of several years. He was aware that changes in the business cycle would have a material effect on sales and earnings. However, he believed that two types of companies would, decade by decade, show promise of above-average growth: (1) those that were “fortunate and able” and (2) those that were “fortunate because they are able.” ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1210))

- But the margin of safety theory was so profound and so important to Buffett that all other current weaknesses of Graham’s methodology can be overlooked. Even today, Buffett continues to embrace Graham’s primary idea, the margin of safety. It has been almost 65 years since he first read Ben Graham. Nonetheless, Buffett never hesitates to remind everyone, “I still think those are the three right words.”24 The key lesson that Buffett took from Graham was: Successful investing involves purchasing stocks when their market price is at a significant discount to their underlying business value.

- From Graham, Buffett learned how to think independently. If you reach a logical conclusion based on sound judgment, Graham counseled Buffett, do not be dissuaded just because others disagree. “You are neither right or wrong because the crowd disagrees with you,” Graham wrote. “You are right because your data and reasoning are right.”25 Phil Fisher was in many ways the exact opposite of Ben Graham. Fisher believed that, to make sound decisions, investors needed to become fully informed about a business. That meant investigating all aspects of the company. They had to look beyond the numbers and learn about the business itself, for the type of business it was mattered a great deal. They also needed to study the attributes of the ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1413))

- company’s management, for management’s abilities could affect the value of the underlying business. They were urged to learn as much as they could about the industry in which the company operated, and about its competitors. Every source of information should be exploited. From Fisher, Buffett learned the value of scuttlebutt. Throughout the years, Buffett developed an extensive network of contacts who have been helpful in assisting him in evaluating different businesses. Finally, Fisher taught Buffett not to overstress diversification. He believed that it was a mistake to teach investors that putting their eggs in several different baskets reduces risk. The danger in purchasing too many stocks, he felt, is that it becomes impossible to watch all the eggs in all the baskets. Investors run the risk of putting too much in a company they are unfamiliar with. In his view, buying shares in a company without taking time to develop a thorough understanding of the business is far riskier than having a limited diversification.

- After Buffett read Phil Fisher’s book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, he sought out the writer. “When I met him, I was as impressed by the man as his ideas.” Buffett said. “Much like Ben Graham, Fisher was unassuming, generous in spirit and an extraordinary teacher.” Graham and Fisher’s investment approaches differ, notes Buffett, but they are “parallel in the investment world.”26 Taking the liberty of rephrasing, I would say that instead of paralleling, in Warren Buffett they dovetail: his investment approach is a combination of a qualitative understanding of the business and its management (as taught by Fisher) and a quantitative understanding of price and value (as taught by Graham). Warren Buffett once said, “I am 15 percent Fisher and 85 percent Benjamin Graham.”27 This remark has been widely quoted, but it is very important to remember that it was ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1436))

- made in 1969. In the intervening years, Buffett has made a gradual but definite shift toward Fisher’s philosophy of buying a select few businesses and owning those businesses for several years. My hunch is that if he were to make a similar statement today, the balance would come pretty close to 50/50. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1445))

- There is no fundamental difference, according to Warren Buffett, between buying a business outright and buying a piece of that business, in the form of shares of stock. Of the two, he has always preferred to directly own a company, for it permits him to influence the business’s most critical issue: capital allocation. Buying its common stock instead has one big disadvantage: You can’t control the business. But this is offset, Buffett explains, by two distinct advantages: First, the arena for selecting noncontrolled businesses—the stock market—is significantly larger. Second, the stock market provides more opportunities for finding bargains. In either case, Buffett invariably follows the same strategy. He looks for companies he understands, with favorable long-term prospects, that are operated by honest and competent people, and, importantly, are available at attractive prices.

- If we go back through time and review all of Buffett’s purchases, looking for commonalities, it is possible to discern a set of basic principles, or tenets, that guide his decisions. If we extract these tenets and spread them out for a closer look, we see that they naturally group themselves into four categories: 1. Business tenets—three basic characteristics of the business itself. 2. Management tenets—three important qualities that senior managers must display. 3. Financial tenets—four critical financial decisions that the company must maintain. 4. Market tenets—two interrelated cost guidelines. Not all of Buffett’s acquisitions will display all the 12 tenets, but taken as a group, these tenets constitute the core of his equity investment approach.

- for several years. Undergoing major business changes increases the likelihood of committing major business errors. “Severe change and exceptional returns usually don’t mix,” Buffett observes.4 Most people, unfortunately, invest as if the opposite were true. Investors tend to be attracted to fast-changing industries or companies that are in the midst of a corporate reorganization. For some unexplained reason, says Buffett, investors are so infatuated with what tomorrow may bring that they ignore today’s business reality.

- When a company has demonstrated consistent results with the same type of products year after year, it is not unreasonable to assume that those results will continue. Buffett also tends to avoid businesses that are solving difficult problems. Experience has taught him that turnarounds seldom turn. It can be more profitable to look for good businesses at reasonable prices than difficult businesses at cheaper prices. “Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems,” Buffett admits. “What we have learned to do is to avoid them.

- Buffett divides the economic world into two unequal parts: a small group of great businesses, which he terms franchises, and a much larger group of bad businesses, of which most are not worth purchasing. He defines a franchise as a company providing a product or service that is (1) needed or desired, (2) has no close substitute, and (3) is not regulated. These traits allow the company to hold its prices, and occasionally raise them, without the fear of losing market share or unit volume. This pricing flexibility is one of the defining characteristics of a great business; it allows the company to earn above-average returns on capital. “We like stocks that generate high returns on invested capital,” says Buffett, “where there is a strong likelihood that [they] will continue to do so.”6 He added, “I look at the long-term competitive advantage, and [whether] that’s something that is enduring.”7 Individually and collectively, these great businesses create what Buffett calls a moat—something that gives the ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1600))

- company a clear advantage over others and protects it against incursion from competition. The bigger the moat, and the more sustainable, the better he likes it. “The key to investing,” he explains, “is determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of the advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors. The most important thing for me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the business. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat with piranhas and crocodiles.”8 Last, Buffett tells us, in one of his many succinct bits of wisdom, “the definition of a great company is one that will be great for 25 to 30 years.”9 Conversely, a bad business offers a product that is virtually indistinguishable from the products of its competitors—a commodity. Years ago, basic commodities included oil, gas, chemicals, copper, lumber, wheat, and orange juice. Today, computers, automobiles, airline service, banking, and insurance have become commodity-type products. Despite mammoth advertising budgets, they… ([Location 1610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1610))

- cuts into profit margins. The most dependable way to make a commodity business profitable is to become the low-cost provider. The only other time commodity businesses turn a healthy profit is during periods of tight supply—a factor that can be extremely difficult to predict. A key to determining the long-term profit of a commodity business, Buffett notes, is the ratio of “supply-tight to supply-ample years.” However, this ratio is often fractional. “… ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1625))

A company that provides average or below-average investment returns but generates cash in excess of its needs has three options: (1) It can ignore the problem and continue to reinvest at below-average rates, (2) it can buy growth, or (3) it can return the money to shareholders. It is at this crossroads that Buffett keenly focuses on management’s decisions, for it is here that management will behave rationally or irrationally.

- When management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward is twofold. If the stock is selling below its intrinsic value, then purchasing shares makes good business sense. If a company’s stock price is $50 and its intrinsic value is $100, then each time management buys its stock, it is acquiring $2 of intrinsic value for every $1 spent. Transactions of this nature can be very profitable for the remaining shareholders. ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1686))

- Buffett holds in high regard managers who report their company’s financial performance fully and genuinely, who admit mistakes as well as share successes, and are in all ways candid with shareholders. In particular, he respects managers who are able to communicate the performance of their company without hiding behind generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1695))

- “What needs to be reported,” argues Buffett, “is data—whether GAAP, non-GAAP, or extra-GAAP—that helps the financially literate readers answer three key questions: (1) Approximately how much is the company worth? (2) What is the likelihood that it can meet its future obligations? (3) How good a job are its managers doing, given the hand they have been dealt?”14 Buffett also admires managers who have the courage to discuss failure openly. Over time, every company makes mistakes, both large and inconsequential. Too many managers, he believes, report with excess optimism rather than honest explanation, serving perhaps their own interests in the short term but no one’s interests in the long run. Most annual reports, he says bluntly, are a sham. That’s why in his own annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett is very open about Berkshire’s economic and management performance, both good and bad. Throughout the years, he has admitted the difficulties that Berkshire encountered in both the textile and insurance businesses, and his own management failures in regard to these businesses. In the 1989 Berkshire Hathaway annual report, he started a practice of listing his mistakes formally, called “Mistakes of the First Twenty-Five Years (A Condensed Version).” Two years later, the title was changed to “Mistake Du Jour.” Here, Buffett confessed not only mistakes made but opportunities lost because he failed to act appropriately. Critics have noted that it’s a bit disingenuous for Buffett to publicly admit his mistakes; because of his large personal ownership of Berkshire’s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired. This is true. But by modeling candor, Buffett is quietly creating a new approach to management reporting. It is Buffett’s belief that candor benefits the manager at least as much as the shareholder. “The CEO who misleads others in public,” he says, “may eventually mislead himself in private.”15 Buffett credits Charlie Munger with helping him understand the value of studying one’s mistakes, rather than concentrating only on successes.

- The Institutional Imperative If management stands to gain wisdom and credibility by facing mistakes, why do so many annual reports trumpet only success? If allocation of capital is so simple and logical, why is capital so poorly allocated? The answer, Buffett has learned, is an unseen force he calls “the institutional imperative”—the lemming-like tendency of corporate managers to imitate the behavior of others, no matter how silly or irrational it may be. ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1717))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Buffett believes that the institutional imperative is responsible for several serious, but distressingly common, conditions: “(1) [The organization] resists any change in its current direction; (2) just as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up available funds; (3) any business craving of the leader, however foolish, will quickly be supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) the behavior of peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.”17 ([Location 1726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1726))

- Why would they do this? Buffett isolates three factors as being most influential in management’s behavior. 1. Most managers cannot control their lust for activity. Such hyperactivity often finds its outlet in business takeovers. 2. Most managers are constantly comparing their business’s sales, earnings, and executive compensation to ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1745))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- other companies within and beyond their industry. These comparisons invariably invite corporate hyperactivity. 3. Most managers have an exaggerated sense of their own capabilities. Another common problem, we have learned, is poor allocation skills. CEOs often rise to their position by excelling in other areas of the company, including administrative, engineering, marketing, or production. With little experience in allocating capital, they turn instead to staff members, consultants, or investment bankers, and inevitably the institutional imperative enters the decision-making process. If the CEO craves a potential acquisition that requires a 15 percent return on investment to justify purchase, it’s amazing, Buffett points out, how smoothly the troops report back that the business can actually achieve 15.1 percent. The final justification for the institutional imperative is mindless imitation. The CEO of Company D says to himself, “If Companies A, B, and C are all doing the same thing, it must be all right for us to behave the same way.” They are positioned to fail—not, Buffett believes, because of venality or stupidity, but because the institutional dynamics of the imperative make it difficult to resist doomed behavior. Speaking before a group of Notre Dame students, Buffett displayed a list of 37 investment banking firms. Every single one, he explained, had failed, even ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1748))

He ticked off the positives: The volume of the New York Stock Exchange had multiplied 15-fold, and the firms were headed by hardworking people with very high IQs, all of whom had an intense desire to succeed. Yet all failed. Buffett paused. “You think about that,” he said sternly, his eyes scanning the room. “How could they get a result like that? I’ll tell you how—mindless imitation of their peers.” ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1761))

- For gathering the necessary information, Buffett offers a few tips. Review annual reports from a few years back, paying special attention to what management said then about the strategies for the future. Then compare those plans to today’s results; how fully were the plans realized? Also compare the strategies of a few years ago to this year’s strategies and ideas; how has the thinking changed? Buffett also suggests it can be very valuable to compare annual reports of the company in which you are interested with reports of similar companies in the same industry. It is not always easy to find exact duplicates, but even relative performance comparisons can yield insights.

However, he’s quick to point out, “If you put these same guys to work in a buggy whip company, it wouldn’t have made much difference.”19 He adds, “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that stays intact.”20 ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1785))

Profitable returns, he wryly notes, don’t always coincide with the time it takes the planet to circle the sun.

- of stock, he owns businesses, not pieces of paper. The idea of buying stock without understanding the company’s operating functions—including its products and services, inventories, working capital needs, capital reinvestment needs (e.g., plant and equipment), raw material expenses, and labor relations—is unconscionable, says Buffett. In the summation of The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham wrote, “Investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” These words are, Buffett often says, “the nine most important words ever written about investing.” Investors have a choice: They can decide to conduct themselves like the owner of a business, with all that implies, or spend their time trading securities just for the sake of being in the game—or indeed for any reason other than business fundamentals. Owners of common stocks who perceive they merely own a piece of paper are far removed from the company’s financial statements. They behave as if the market’s ever-changing price is a more accurate reflection of their stock’s value than the business’s balance sheet and income statement. They draw or discard stocks like playing cards. Buffett considers this the height of foolishness. In his view, there’s no difference between owning the company and owning a share of it, and the same mentality should apply to both. “I am a better investor because I am a businessman,” confesses Buffett, “and a better businessman because I am an investor.”32 Buffett is often asked what types of companies he will purchase in the future. First, he says, he will avoid commodity businesses and managers in whom he has little confidence. What he will purchase is the type of company that he understands, one that possesses good economics and is run by trustworthy managers. “A good business is not always a good purchase,” says Buffett, “although it is a good place to look for one.”33 ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=2000))

- Warren Buffett does not think in seconds, minutes, days, months, or quarters, but in years. He doesn’t need to keep up with hundreds of companies, because his common stock investments are focused in a select few. He refers to himself as a “focus investor”—“We just focus on a few outstanding companies.”1 This approach, called focus investing, greatly simplifies the task of portfolio management. Focus investing is a remarkably simple idea, and yet, like most simple ideas, it rests on a complex foundation of interlocking concepts. In this chapter, we look more closely at the effects focus investing produces. The goal here is to give you a new way of thinking about portfolio management. Fair warning: In all likelihood, this new way is the opposite of what you have always been told about investing in the stock market. The current state of portfolio management appears to be locked into a tug-of-war between two competing strategies: (1) active portfolio management and (2) index investing.

- From an investor’s point of view, the underlying attraction of both strategies is the same: to minimize risk through diversification. By holding a large number of stocks representing many industries and many sectors of the market, investors hope to build in a warm blanket of protection against horrific loss that could occur if they had all their money in one arena and that arena suffered some disaster. In a normal period, so the thinking goes, some stocks in a diversified portfolio will go down and others will go up, so let’s keep our fingers crossed that the latter will compensate for the former.

That alternative is focus investing.

- are likely to produce above-average returns over the long haul, concentrate the bulk of your investments in those stocks, and have the fortitude to hold steady during any short-term market gyrations. The Warren Buffett tenets, if followed closely, lead inevitably to good companies that make sense for a focus portfolio. The companies chosen will have a long history of superior performance and a stable management, and that stability points toward a high probability that they will perform in the future as they have in the past. That is the heart of focus investing: concentrating your investments in companies with the highest probability of above-average performance. (Probability theory, which comes to us from the field of mathematics, is one of the underlying concepts that make up the rationale for focus investing. We will learn more about probability theory later in this chapter.) Remember Buffett’s advice to a “know-nothing” investor, to stay with index funds? What is more interesting is what he said next: “If you are a know-something investor, able to understand business economics, and can locate five to ten sensibly priced companies that possess important long-term competitive advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you.”4 ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3441))

- Focus investing is the antithesis of a broadly diversified high-turnover approach. Although focus investing stands the best chance, among all active strategies, of outperforming an index return over time, it does require investors to patiently hold their portfolios when it appears that other strategies are marching ahead. In shorter periods, we realize that changes in interest rates, inflation, or near-term expectations for a company’s earnings can affect share prices. But as the time horizon lengthens, the trendline economics of the underlying business will increasingly dominate its share price. How long is that ideal time? There is no hard-and-fast rule, although Buffett would probably say five years since this is the time period he is focusing on for Berkshire Hathaway’s results. The goal is not a zero turnover ratio; that’s ([Location 3473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3473))

- foolish in the opposite direction, for it would prevent you from taking advantage of something better when it comes along. I suggest that, as a general rule of thumb, we should be thinking of a turnover rate between 10 and 20 percent. A 10 percent turnover rate suggests that an investor holds the stock for 10 years; a 20 percent rate implies a five-year period. Focus investing pursues above-average results, and, as we will see, there is strong evidence, both academic research and actual case histories, that the approach is successful when thoughtfully applied. There can be no doubt, however, that the ride is bumpy, for an increased level of price volatility is a necessary by-product of the focus approach. Focus investors tolerate the bumpiness because they know that, in the long run, the underlying economics of the companies will more than compensate for any short-term price fluctuations. Buffett is the master bump ignorer. So is his partner Charlie Munger, who came to the fundamental concept of focus investing by a slightly different route. “Back in the 1960s,” he explained, “I actually took a compound interest rate table, and I made various assumptions about what kind of edge I might have in reference to the behavior of common stocks generally.”6 Charlie worked through several scenarios to determine the number of stocks he would need in ([Location 3479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3479))

He concluded that as long as he could handle the price volatility, owning as few as three stocks would be plenty. “I knew I could handle the bumps psychologically, because I was raised by people who believed in handling bumps.”7 Maybe you also come from a long line of people who can handle bumps. But even if you were not born so lucky, you can acquire some of their traits. You need to consciously decide to change how you think and behave.

- Bayesian analysis gives us a logical way to consider a set of outcomes of which all are possible but only one will actually occur. It is conceptually a simple procedure. We begin by assigning a probability to each of the outcomes, on the basis of whatever evidence is then available. If additional evidence becomes available, the initial probability is revised to reflect the new information. Bayes’s theorem gives a mathematical procedure for updating our original beliefs, thus changing our relevant odds. How does this work? Let’s imagine that you and a friend have spent the afternoon playing your favorite board game, and now, at the end of the game, you are chatting about this or that. Something your friend says leads you to make a friendly wager: that with one roll of a die from the game, you will get a 6. Straight odds are one in six, a 16 ([Location 3535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3535))

- percent probability. But then suppose your friend rolls the die, quickly covers it with his hand, and takes a peek. “I can tell you this much,” he says; “it’s an even number.” Now you have new information and your odds change dramatically to one in three, a 33 percent probability. While you are considering whether to change your bet, your friend teasingly adds: “And it is not a 4.” With this additional bit of information, your odds have changed again, to one in two, a 50 percent probability. With this very simple example, you have performed a Bayesian analysis. Each new piece of information affected the original probability, and that is a Bayesian inference. Bayesian analysis is an attempt to incorporate all available information into a process for making inferences, or decisions, about the underlying state of nature. Colleges and universities use Bayes’s theorem to help their students study decision making. In the classroom, the Bayesian approach is more popularly called the decision tree theory; each branch of the tree represents new information that, in turn, changes the odds in making decisions. “At Harvard Business School,” explains Charlie Munger, “the great quantitative thing that bonds the first-year class together is what they call decision tree theory. All they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real life problems. The students love it. They’re amazed to find that high school algebra works in life.”11 ([Location 3541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3541))

- As Charlie points out, basic algebra is extremely useful in calculating probabilities. But to put probability theory to practical use in investing, we need to look a bit deeper at how the numbers are calculated. In particular, we need to pay attention to the notion of frequency. What does it mean to say that the probability of guessing heads on a single coin toss is one in two? Or that the probability that an odd number will appear on a single throw of the dice is one in two? If a box is filled with 70 red marbles and 30 blue marbles, what does it mean that the probability is three in 10 that a blue marble will be picked? In all these examples, the probability of the event is what is referred to as a frequency interpretation, and it is based on the law of averages. If an uncertain event is repeated countless times, the frequency of the event’s occurrence is reflected in its probability. For example, if we toss a coin 100,000 times, the number of times that are expected to be heads is 50,000. Note I did not say it would be equal to 50,000. The law of large numbers says the relative… ([Location 3554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3554))

- In any problem that deals with uncertainty, we will, quite obviously, never be able to make a definitive statement. However, if the problem is well defined, we should be able to list all the possible outcomes. If an uncertain event is repeated often enough, the frequency of the outcomes should reflect the probability of the different possible outcomes. The difficulty arises when we are concerned with an event that happens only once. How do we estimate the probability of passing tomorrow’s science test or the probability of the Green Bay Packers winning the Super Bowl? The problem we face is that each of these events is unique. We can look back at all the statistics on the Green Bay games, but we don’t have enough exact matchups with the exact personnel who played each other repeatedly under identical circumstances. We can recall previous science exams to get an idea of how well we test, but all tests are not identical and our knowledge is not constant. Without repeated tests that would produce a frequency distribution, how can we calculate probability? We cannot. Instead we must rely on subjective interpretation of probabilities.

- enough repetitions of a certain event to get an interpretation of probability based on frequency, we have to rely on our own good sense. You can immediately see that many subjective interpretations of those two events would lead you in the wrong direction. In subjective probability, the burden is on you to analyze your assumptions. Stop and think them through. Are you assuming a one-in-10 chance of doing well on the science test because the material is more difficult and you haven’t adequately prepared, or because of false modesty? Is your lifelong loyalty to the Packers blinding you to the superior strength of the other team? According to the textbooks on Bayesian analysis, if you believe that your assumptions are reasonable, it is “perfectly acceptable” to make your subjective probability of a certain event equal to a frequency probability.12 What you have to do is sift out the unreasonable and illogical and retain the reasonable. It is helpful to think about subjective probabilities as… ([Location 3577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3577))

- “Take the probability of loss times the amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of possible gain. That is what we’re trying to do,” says Buffett. “It’s imperfect but that’s what it is all about.”13 ([Location 3592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3592))

- Let’s preface Buffett’s next remarks to the Stanford students with this scenario. Suppose the Abbott Company began the day trading at $18 per share. Then, in midmorning, it is announced that sometime this year, perhaps in six months, Abbott will be sold to the Costello Company for $30 per share. Immediately, the share price of Abbott races to $27, where it settles in and begins to trade back and forth. Buffett sees the announced merger and must make a decision. First of all, he tries to assess the degree of certainty. Some corporate deals don’t materialize. The board of directors could unexpectedly resist the idea of the merger or the Federal Trade Commission might voice an objection. No one ever knows with certainty whether a risk arbitrage deal will close, and that is where the risk comes in. Buffett’s decision process is an exercise in subjective probability. He explains: “If I think there is a 90 percent chance of occurring and there is 3 points on the upside and there is a 10 percent chance that it will fall through and there is 9 points on the downside, then that’s $0.90 off of $2.70, leaving $1.80 mathematical expectation.”15 ([Location 3605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3605))

- Next, said Buffett, you have to figure in the time span involved and then relate the return of the investment to other investments available to you. If you bought one share of Abbott Company at $27, there is, according to Buffett’s mathematics, a potential 6.6 percent return ($1.80/$27). If the deal is expected to close in six months, the annualized return on the investment would be 13.2 percent. Buffett would then compare the return from this risk arbitrage with other returns available to him. Buffett freely acknowledges that risk arbitrage carries the potential for loss. “We are perfectly willing to lose money on a given transaction,” he said, “arbitrage being one example, but we’re not willing to enter into any transaction in which we think the probability of a number of mutually independent events of similar type has an expectancy of loss. We hope,” he added, “that we’re entering into transactions where our calculations of those probabilities have validity.”16 We can see quite clearly that Buffett’s risk arbitrage estimates are subjective probabilities. There is no frequency distribution in risk arbitrage. Every deal is different. Every circumstance requires different estimations. Even so, there is value to approaching the risk arbitrage deal with some rational mathematical calculation. The process, we shall learn, is no different when you invest in common stocks.

- Thorp’s strategy was based on a simple concept. When the deck is rich with 10s, face cards, and aces, the player—let’s say it’s you—has a statistical advantage over the dealer. If you assign a −1 for the high cards and a +1 for the low cards, it’s quite easy to keep track of the cards dealt; just keep a running tally in your head, adding and subtracting as each card shows. When the count turns positive, you know there are more high cards yet to be played. Smart players save their biggest bets for when the card count reaches a high relative number.

- I believe the Kelly model is an attractive tool for focus investors. However, it will benefit only those who use it responsibly. There are risks to employing the Kelly approach, and investors would be wise to understand its three limitations: 1. Anyone who intends to invest, using the Kelly model or not, should have a long-term horizon. Even if a blackjack player has a sound model that can beat the house, it does not always hold that success will be revealed in the first few hands dealt. The same is true for investing. How many times have investors seen that they have selected the right company but the market has taken its own sweet time in rewarding the selection?

- 2. Be wary of using leverage. The danger of borrowing to invest in the stock market (with a margin account) has been trumpeted loudly by both Ben Graham and Warren Buffett. The unexpected call on your capital can occur at the most unfortunate time in the game. If you use the Kelly model in a margin account, a stock market decline can force you to sell your stock, causing you to remove a high-probability bet. 3. The biggest danger in playing high-probability games is the risk of overbetting. If you judge that an event has a 70 percent chance of success when in fact it is only a 55 percent event, you run the risk of so-called gambler’s ruin. The way to minimize that risk is to underbet, by using what is known as a half-Kelly or fractional-Kelly model. For example, if the Kelly model would tell you to bet 10 percent of your capital, you might choose to bet only 5 percent (half-Kelly) instead. Both the half-Kelly bet and the fractional-Kelly bet provide a margin of safety in portfolio management; that, together with the margin of safety we apply to selecting individual stocks, provides a double layer of protection. Because the risk of overbetting far outweighs the penalties of underbetting, I believe that all investors, especially those who are just beginning to use a focus investment strategy, should use fractional-Kelly bets. Unfortunately, minimizing your bets also minimizes your potential gain. ([Location 3667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3667))

- However, because the relationship in the Kelly model is parabolic, the penalty for underbetting is not severe.

- From Theory to Reality Now, let us move away from the racetrack and put all this theory together into the reality of the stock market. The chain of thinking is the same. 1. Calculate probabilities. This is the probability you are concerned with: What are the chances that this stock I am considering will, over time, achieve an economic return greater than the stock market? 2. Wait for the best odds. The odds of success tip in your favor when you have a margin of safety; the more uncertain the situation, the greater the margin you need. In the stock market, the margin of safety is provided by a discounted price. When the company you like is selling at a price that is below its intrinsic value, that is your signal to act.

- 3. Adjust for new information. Knowing that you are going to wait until the odds turn in your favor, pay scrupulous attention in the meantime to whatever the company does. Has management begun to act irresponsibly? Have the financial decisions begun to change? Has something happened to alter the competitive landscape in which the business operates? If so, the probabilities will likely change. 4. Decide how much to invest. Of all the money you have available for investing in the market, what proportion should go into a particular purchase? Start with the Kelly formula, then adjust downward, perhaps to a half-Kelly bet or a fractional-Kelly bet. ([Location 3715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3715))

- Making this shift will not be easy. Our entire industry—money managers, institutional investors, and all manner of individual investors—is price myopic. If the price of a particular stock is going up, we assume good things are happening; if the price starts to go down, we assume something bad is happening, and we act accordingly. It’s a poor mental habit, and it is exacerbated by another: evaluating price performance over very short periods of time. Not only are we depending solely on the wrong thing (price), Buffett would say, but we’re looking at it too often and we’re too quick to jump when we don’t like what we see.

- In 1986, V. Eugene Shahan, a Columbia University Business School alumnus and portfolio manager at U.S. Trust, wrote a follow-up article to Buffett’s “The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville.” In his piece, titled “Are Short-Term Performance and Value Investing Mutually Exclusive?,” Shahan took on the same question that we are now asking: How appropriate is it to measure a money manager’s skill on the basis of short-term performance? He noted that, with the exception of Buffett himself, many of the people Buffett described as “Superinvestors”— ([Location 3991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3991))

- undeniably skilled, undeniably successful—faced periods of short-term underperformance. In a money-management version of the tortoise and the hare, Shahan commented: “It may be another of life’s ironies that investors principally concerned with short-term performance may very well achieve it, but at the expense of long-term results. The outstanding records of Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville were compiled with the apparent indifference to short-term performance.”44 In today’s mutual fund performance derby, Shahan explains, the Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville would have been overlooked. The same is also true of the Superinvestors of Buffettville. John Maynard Keynes, who managed the Chest Fund for 18 years, underperformed the market one-third of the time. Indeed, he underperformed the market the first three years he managed the fund, which put him behind the market by 18 percentage points. The story is similar at the Sequoia Fund. In the marking period, Sequoia underperformed 37 percent of the time. Like Keynes, Ruane also had difficulty coming of age. “Over the years,” he confessed, “we have periodically qualified to be the Kings of Underperformance. We had the blurred vision to start the Sequoia Fund in mid-1970 and suffered the Chinese water torture of underperforming the S&P four straight years.” By the end of 1974, Sequoia was a whopping 36 percentage points behind the market. “We hid ([Location 3996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3996))

- under the desk, didn’t answer the phones and wondered if the storm would ever clear.”45 But of course the storm did clear. Seven years after inception, Sequoia had gained 220 percent, versus a gain of 60 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Even Charlie Munger couldn’t escape the inevitable bumps of focus investing. Over 14 years, Charlie underperformed 36 percent of the time. Like other focus investors, he had a string of short-term bad luck. From 1972 through 1974, Munger fell behind the market by 37 percentage points. Over 17 years, Lou Simpson underperformed the market 24 percent of the time. His worst relative performance, which occurred in a one-year period, put him 15 percentage points behind the market. Incidentally, we saw the same performance trends when we analyzed our laboratory of 3,000 focus portfolios. Of the 808 portfolios that beat the market over the 10-year period, an astonishing 95 percent endured some prolonged period of underperformance—three, four, five, or even six years out of 10.

- can we tell, just using price performance as our measure, whether we are looking at a very bright investor who is having a poor year (or even a poor three years) but will do well over the long haul, or a manager who perhaps lacks the skills to be a good focus investor? We can well imagine what Warren Buffett might say. For him, the moral of the story is clear: We have to drop our insistence on price as the only measuring stick, and we have to break ourselves of the counterproductive habit of making short-term judgments. But if price is not the measuring stick, what are we to use instead? “Nothing” is not a good answer. Even buy-and-hold strategists don’t recommend keeping your eyes shut. We just have to find another benchmark for measuring performance. Fortunately, there is one, and it is the cornerstone of how Buffett judges his performance and the performance of his operating units at Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett once said he “wouldn’t care if the stock market closed for a year or two. After all, it closes on Saturday and Sunday and that hasn’t bothered me yet.”46 It is true that “an actively trading market is useful, since… ([Location 4021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4021))

- more than does the lack of daily quotations for [Berkshire’s wholly owned subsidiaries]. Eventually our economic fate will be determined by the economic fate of the business we own, whether our ownership is partial [in the form of shares of stock] or total.”48 If you owned a business and there were no daily quotes to measure its performance, how would you determine your progress? Likely you would measure the growth in earnings, the increase in return on capital, or the improvement in operating margins. You simply would let the economics of the business dictate whether you were increasing or decreasing the value of your investment. In Buffett’s mind, the litmus test for measuring the performance of a publicly traded company is no different. “Charlie and I let our marketable equities tell us by their operating results—not by their daily, or evenly yearly, price quotations—whether our investments are successful,” he explains. “The market may ignore a business success for a while, but it eventually will confirm it.”49 But can we count on the market to reward us for picking the right companies?

- companies, we learned that the longer the time period, the stronger the correlation. With stocks held three years, the degree of correlation between stock price and operating earnings ranged from .131 to .360. (A correlation of .360 means that 36 percent of the variance in the price was explained by the variance in earnings.) With stocks held for five years, the correlation ranged from .374 to .599. In the 10-year holding period, the correlation between earnings and stock price increased to a range of .593 to .695. This bears out Buffett’s thesis that, given enough time, the price of a business will align with the company’s economics. He cautions, though, that translation of earnings into share price is both “uneven” and “unpredictable.” Although the relationship between earnings and price strengthens over time, it is not always prescient. “While market values track business values quite well… ([Location 4050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4050))

- with turnover ratios of less than 20 percent were able to achieve returns 14 percent higher than funds with turnover rates of more than 100 percent. This is one of those commonsense dynamics that is so obvious it is easily overlooked. The problem with high turnover is that all that trading adds brokerage costs to the fund, which works to lower your net returns. Except in the case of nontaxable accounts, taxes are the biggest expense that investors face—higher than brokerage commissions and often higher than the expense ratio of running a fund. In fact, taxes have become one of the principal reasons why funds generate poor returns. “That is the bad news,” according to money managers Robert Jeffrey and Robert Arnott. They are the authors of “Is Your Alpha Big Enough to Cover Its Taxes?” which appeared in the well-respected Journal of Portfolio Management. “The good news,” they write, “is that there are trading strategies that can minimize these typically overlooked tax consequences.”58 In a nutshell, the key strategy involves another of those commonsense notions that is often underappreciated: the enormous value of the unrealized gain. When a stock appreciates in price but is not sold, the increase in value is an unrealized gain. No capital gains tax is owed until the stock is sold. If you leave the gain in place, your money compounds more forcefully. ([Location 4117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4117))

- Before we end this chapter, it is critically important that you think seriously about what exactly a focus investing approach entails: Do not approach the market unless you are willing to think about stocks, first and always, as part-ownership interests in businesses. Be prepared to diligently study the businesses you own, as well as the companies you compete against, with the idea that no one will know more about your business than you do. Do not even start a focus portfolio unless you are willing to invest a minimum of five years (10 years would even be better). Never leverage your focus portfolio. An unleveraged focus portfolio will help you reach your goals fast enough. Remember, an unexpected margin call on our capital will likely wreck a well-tuned portfolio.

In Graham’s view, an investor’s appropriate reaction to a downturn is the same as a business owner’s response when offered an unattractive price: ignore it. “The true investor,” says Graham, “scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares and at all other times is free to disregard the current price quotation.”2 ([Location 4323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4323))

- Over the years, Richard Thaler had the good fortune to study and collaborate with Kahneman and Tversky as well as several other academics in the field of behavioral finance. He has written several articles on decision making, many of which can be found in his popular book, The Winner’s Curse: Paradoxes and Anomalies of Economic Life (Free Press, 1992). However, Thaler is best known for his 1995 article titled “Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Risk Premium,” cowritten with Shlomo Benartzi, professor and cochair of the behavioral decision-making group at the University of California at Los Angeles Anderson School of Management. In their article, Thaler and Benartzi took loss aversion described in Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory and connected it directly to the stock market. Thaler and Benartzi were puzzled by one central question: Why would anyone with a long-term horizon want to own bonds over stocks when they know that stocks have consistently outperformed? The answer, they believed, rested on two central concepts from Kahneman and Tversky. The first was loss aversion, which we have already explored. The second was a behavioral concept called mental accounting, which describes the methods people use to code financial outcomes. It refers to our habit of shifting our perspective on money as surrounding circumstances change. We tend to mentally put money into different “accounts,” and that determines how we think about using it. A simple situation will illustrate. Let us imagine that you have just returned home from an evening out with your spouse. You reach for your wallet to pay the babysitter, but discover that the $20 bill you thought was there is not. So, when you drive the sitter home you stop by an ATM machine and get another $20. Then the next day you discover the original $20 bill in your jacket pocket. If you’re like most people, you react with something like glee. The $20 in the jacket is found money. Even though the first $20 and the second $20 both came from your checking account, and both represent money you worked hard for, the $20 bill you hold in your hand is money you didn’t expect to have, and you feel free to spend it frivolously. Once again, Richard Thaler provides an interesting academic experiment to demonstrate this concept. In his study he started with two groups of people. People in the first group were given $30 in cash and told they had two choices: (1) pocket the money and walk away, or (2) gamble on a coin flip in which if they won they would get $9 extra and if they lost they would have $9 deducted. Most (70 percent) took the gamble because they figured they would at the very least end up with $21 of found money. Those in the second group were offered a different choice: (1) try a gamble on a coin toss: if they win they’d get $39 and if they lost they’d get $21, or (2) get an even $30 with no coin toss. More than half (57 percent) decided to take the sure money. Both groups of people stood to win the exact… ([Location 4436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4436))

- Thaler and Benartzi weren’t through. Thaler remembered a financial riddle first proposed by the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson. In 1963, Samuelson asked a colleague if he would be willing to accept the following bet: a 50 percent chance of winning $200 or a 50 percent chance of losing $100. According to Samuelson, the colleague turned down the initial offer but then reconsidered. He would happily play the game, he said, if he could play 100 times and did not have to watch each individual outcome. The willingness to play the game under a new set of rules sparked an idea for Thaler and Benartzi. Samuelson’s colleague was willing to accept the wager with two qualifiers: lengthen the time horizon for the game and reduce the frequency in which he was forced to watch the outcomes. Moving that observation into investing, Thaler and Benartzi reasoned that the longer the investor holds an asset, the more attractive the asset becomes but only if the investment is not evaluated frequently. When analyzing historical investment returns, we find that the vast majority of long-term returns are a result of just 7 percent of all trading months. The return of the remaining 93 percent averages out to approximately zero.7 What is clear, then, is that evaluating performance over shorter periods of time increases the chances that you will ([Location 4466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4466))

- see a loss in your portfolio. If you check your portfolio daily, there is a 50/50 chance you will experience a loss. The odds don’t improve much if you extend the evaluation period to a month. But if you don’t check your portfolio every day, you will be spared the angst of watching daily price gyrations; the longer you hold off, the less likely you will be confronted with volatility and therefore the more attractive your choices seem. Put differently, the two factors that contribute to an investor’s emotional turmoil are loss aversion and a frequent evaluation period. Using the medical word for shortsightedness, Thaler and Bernatzi coined the term myopic loss aversion to reflect a combination of loss aversion and frequency. Next, Thaler and Bernatzi sought to determine the ideal time frame. We know that over short periods, stock prices are much more volatile than bond prices. We also know that if we’re willing to extend the period in which we measure changes in stock prices, the standard deviation of stock returns… ([Location 4478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4478))

- Recall that in modern portfolio theory, risk is defined by the volatility of the share price. But Buffett had always perceived a drop in share prices as an opportunity. If anything, a dip in price actually reduces risk. He points out, “For owners of a business—and that’s the way we think of shareholders—the academic’s definition of risk is far off the market, so much so that it produces absurdities.”13 Buffett has a different definition of risk: the possibility of harm or injury. And that is a factor of the “intrinsic value risk” of a business, not the price behavior of the stock. The ([Location 4609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4609))

- real risk, Buffett says, is whether after-tax returns from an investment “will give him [an investor] at least as much purchasing power as he had to begin with, plus a modest rate of interest on that initial stake.”14 Risk, for Buffett, is inextricably linked to an investor’s time horizon. This alone is the single greatest difference between how Warren Buffett thinks about risk and how modern portfolio theory frames risk. If you buy a stock today with the intention of selling it tomorrow, Buffett explains, then you have entered into a risky transaction. The odds are no better than the toss of a coin—you will lose about half the time. However, says Buffett, if you extend your time horizon out to several years, the probability of its being a risky transaction declines meaningfully, assuming of course that you have made a sensible purchase. “If you ask me to assess the risk of buying Coca-Cola this morning and selling it tomorrow morning,” Buffett says, “I’d say that that’s a very risky transaction.”15 But in Buffett’s way of thinking, buying Coca-Cola this morning and holding it for 10 years, that’s zero risk.

- Buffett’s problem with the efficient market theory rests on one central point: It makes no provision for investors who analyze all the available information and gain a competitive advantage by doing so. “Observing correctly that the market is frequently efficient, they went on to conclude incorrectly that it was always efficient. The difference between these propositions is night and day.”17 Nonetheless, the efficient market theory is still religiously taught in business schools, a fact that gives Warren Buffett no end of satisfaction. “Naturally, the disservice done students and gullible investment professionals who have swallowed EMT has been an extraordinary service to us and other followers of Graham,” he wryly observed. “In any sort of a contest—financial, mental or physical—it’s an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught it’s useless to even try. From a selfish standpoint, we should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual teaching of EMT.”18 ([Location 4641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4641))

All market activity lies on a time continuum. Moving from left to right, we observe buy-sell decisions that occur in microseconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, and decades. Although it is unclear exactly where the demarcation line is located, it is generally agreed that activity on the left side (shorter time frame) is more likely to be speculation and activity on the right side (longer times) is considered investing. Warren Buffett, it probably goes without saying, sits comfortably on the right—quietly patient over the long term.

A rational person thinks clearly, sensibly, and logically. The first thing to understand is that rationality is not the same as intelligence. Smart people can do dumb things. Keith Stanovich, a professor of human development and applied psychology at the University of Toronto, believes that intelligence tests like IQ tests or SAT/ACT exams do a very poor job of measuring rational thought. “It is a mild predictor at best,” he says, “and some rational thinking skills are totally dissociated from intelligence.”3 In his book, What Intelligence Tests Miss: The… ([Location 4809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4809))

Treynor begins by talking about the ever-present puzzle of market efficiency. Is it true, he wondered, that no matter how hard we try we’ll never be able to find an idea that the market hasn’t already discounted? To address the question, Treynor asks us to distinguish between “two kinds of investment ideas: (a) those whose implications are straightforward and obvious, take relatively little special expertise to evaluate, and consequently travel quickly and (b) those that require reflection, judgment, and special expertise for their evaluation, and consequently travel slowly.”5 “If the market is inefficient,” he concludes, “it will not be inefficient with respect to the first kind of idea, since by definition the first kind is unlikely to be misevaluated by the great mass of investors.”6 To say this another way, the simple ideas—price-to-earnings ratios, dividend yields, price-to-book ratios, P/E-to-growth ratios, 52-week-low lists, technical charts, and any other… ([Location 4840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4840))

It was a New York Times best seller and one of the top five nonfiction books that year—quite an accomplishment for a 500-page book on decision making.

- are more alert, more intelligently active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions.”8 Shane Frederick, associate professor of marketing at Yale University, has given us a fascinating look at how people with fairly high IQs navigate between System 1 and System 2 thinking. He gathered a group of Ivy League students from Harvard, Princeton, and MIT (presumably all highly intelligent) and asked them the following three questions: 1. A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 2. If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? 3. In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long will it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?9 To Frederick’s surprise, over half of the students got the answers wrong, leading him to delineate two significant problems. First, people are not accustomed to thinking hard about problems and often rush to the first plausible answer that comes to mind so they don’t have to engage the heavy burden of System 2 thinking. The second problem, which is disturbing in itself, was the realization that the System 2 process does a very poor job of monitoring System 1 thinking for errors. It seemed clear to Frederick that the students were stuck in System 1 thinking and could not, or would not, convert to System 2. How do System 1 and System 2 thinking work in investing? Say an investor is considering making a common stock purchase. Using System 1 thinking, the investor would tabulate a company’s price-to-earnings ratio, book value, and dividend yield. Seeing that the two ratios are trading near historical lows and the company has raised the dividend each year for the past 10 years, the investor might quickly conclude that the stock is a good value. Sadly, too many investors rely almost exclusively on System 1 thinking to make a decision, never stopping to engage System 2 thinking.… ([Location 4876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4876))

- It doesn’t have to be that way. The success of Warren Buffett is very much about his desire to play the game differently. And we are all invited to join him in that game. The only requirement for successful play is the willingness to adopt a different set of rules. Of these, none is more important than the value of patience. Time and patience, two sides of the same coin—that is the essence of Buffett. His success lies in the patient attitude he quietly maintains toward both Berkshire’s wholly owned businesses and the common stocks held in the portfolio. In this high-paced world of constant activity, Buffett purposefully operates at a slower speed. A detached observer might think this slothlike attitude means forgoing easy profits, but those who have come to appreciate the process realize that Buffett and Berkshire are accumulating mountains of wealth. The speculator has no patience. Buffett, the investor, lives for it. As he reminds us, “The best thing about time is its length.” And so we come back full circle, to the critical issue of emotion and its counterpoint, rationality. Intelligence alone is not enough to ensure investment success. The size of the investor’s brain is less important than the ability to detach the brain from the emotions. “Rationality is essential when others are making decisions based on short-term greed or fear,” says Buffett. “That is when the money is made.”12 Buffett recognizes that he is neither richer nor poorer because of the market’s short-term fluctuations in price, since his holding period is longer-term. Whereas most individuals cannot endure the discomfort associated with declining stock prices, Buffett is not unnerved, because he believes that he can do a better job than the market in valuing a company. Buffett figures that if you can’t do a better job as well, you don’t belong in the game. It’s like poker, he explains—if you have been in the game for a while and don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy. Absent rationality, investors easily default to System 1 thinking, which is adequate for simple and predictable tasks but not for the complexity that is the stock market. Absent rationality, investors become enslaved to the basic emotions of fear and greed. Absent rationality, investors are destined to become the patsy in the game called investing.

- Just as people spend fruitless hours worrying about the stock market, so too do they needlessly worry about the economy. If you find yourself discussing and debating whether the economy is poised for growth or tilting toward a recession, whether interest rates are moving up or down, whether there is inflation or disinflation, stop! Give yourself a break. Buffett is a casual observer of the economy, but he dedicates no significant time or energy analyzing with the intent of predicting what the economy will do. Often investors begin with an economic assumption and then go about selecting stocks that fit neatly within this grand design. Buffett considers this thinking foolish. First, no one has economic predictive powers any more than they have stock market predictive powers. Second, if you select stocks that will benefit only in a particular economic environment, you inevitably invite turnover and speculation. Whether you correctly predict the economy or not, you’ll find yourself continuously adjusting your portfolio to benefit in the next economic scenario. Buffett prefers to buy a business that has the opportunity to profit regardless of the economy. Of course, macroeconomic forces may affect returns on the margin, but overall, Buffett’s businesses are able to profit nicely despite the vagaries in the economy.

- For Every Dollar Retained, Make Sure the Company Has Created at Least One Dollar of Market Value This is a quick financial test that will tell you not only about the strength of the business but how well management has rationally allocated the company’s resources. From a company’s net income, subtract all dividends paid to shareholders. What is left is the company’s retained earnings. Now, add the company’s retained earnings over a 10-year period. Next, determine the difference between the company’s current market value and its market value 10 years ago. If your business has employed retained earnings unproductively over this 10-year period, the market will eventually catch up and set a lower price on the business. If the increase in the company’s market value is less than the sum of the retained earnings, the company is going backward. But if your business has been able to earn above-average returns on retained capital, the gain in market value of the business should exceed the sum of the company’s retained earnings, thus creating more than one ([Location 5238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=5238))

Yet this same CEO will impulsively sell stocks in his or her personal portfolio with little more logic than the idea that “you can’t go broke taking a profit.” “In our view,” Buffett explains, “what makes sense in business also makes ([Location 5301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=5301))

- investors face. The mind craves patterns, Johnson believes; patterns suggest order, which allows us to plan and make sense of our resources. What we have come to understand about Buffett is that he is continually seeking patterns—patterns that can be found when analyzing a business. He also knows that these business patterns will, at some point, reveal the future pattern of the stock price. Of course, a stock price pattern will not obligingly follow every change in the business pattern, but if your time horizon is long enough, it is remarkable how the price patterns eventually match up with the business patterns. Too many investors are seeking patterns in the wrong places. They are certain that there is some predictable pattern for gauging short-term price changes. But they are mistaken. There simply are no predictable patterns for guessing the future direction of the stock market. The exact patterns do not repeat. Still, these investors keep trying. How do investors maneuver in a world that lacks pattern recognition? The answer is to look in the right place at the right level. Although the economy and the market as a whole are too complex and too large to be predictable, there are recognizable patterns at the company level. Inside each company, there are business patterns, management patterns, and financial patterns. ([Location 5319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=5319))

- If you study these patterns, in most cases you can make a reasonable prediction about the future of the company. Warren Buffett focuses on those patterns, not on the unpredictable behavioral patterns of millions of investors. “I have always found it easier to evaluate the weights dictated by fundamentals,” said Buffett, “than votes dictated by psychology.”17 One thing we can say with certainty is that knowledge works to increase our investment return and reduces overall risk. I believe we can also make the case that knowledge is what defines the difference between investment and speculation. In the end, the more you know about your companies, the less likely it is that pure speculation will dominate your thinking and your actions.
