## Highlights
- creativity, I simply mean new ways of thinking about things. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=46))

- Wherever you can find a way of doing things that is better than what has been done before, you are being creative. Another myth is that creativity is something you have to be born with. This isn’t the case. Anyone can be creative. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=49))

- And you can teach creativity. Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, you can teach people how to create circumstances in which they will become creative. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=58))

- This is how I began to discover that, if I put the work in before going to bed, I often had a little creative idea overnight, which fixed whatever problem it was that I was trying to deal with. It was like a gift, a reward for all my wrestling with the puzzle. I began to think to myself, “It can only be that while I’m asleep, my mind goes on working at the problem so that it can give me the answer in the morning.” ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=88))

- Chewing this over, I realised it was like the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon: when you can’t remember a name, and you chase after it in your mind, and find you just cannot recall it…and then a few moments later, when you are thinking about something else, the name pops into your mind. Clearly, your brain was still working on it even after you’d given up. So I began to realise that my unconscious was working on stuff all the time, without my being consciously aware of it.

- This intelligent unconscious of ours, then, is astoundingly powerful. It allows us to perform most of our tasks in life without requiring us to concentrate on them. Without it, we couldn’t function at all. There’d be much too much to think about. But that doesn’t mean that our intelligent unconscious behaves in an entirely predictable way.

- A perfect example. An experimental psychologist in the US asked a group of people to view various Chinese characters that were displayed on a screen, like these: The volunteers were then asked to return a few days later to look at a further batch. Some of the characters they viewed this time around they had seen the week before; others were quite new to them: They were asked to say which ones they recognised from the previous session. The results were, as you would guess, completely hopeless. People had absolutely no clue when it came to recalling these unfamiliar shapes. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=141))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Then the psychologists repeated the experiment with a different group. But this time, after the second session, the volunteers were not asked to identify which characters they had seen the week before. They were simply asked to say which ones they liked best. This may seem a rather odd question, but the group seemed to understand what was required, and were able to say, “Yes, I prefer this character to that character.” And now for the mind-boggling fact… The ones they liked were the ones that they had seen before. Think about this for a moment. Their unconscious recognised the Chinese characters from the previous week, but instead of prompting the volunteers to say, “Yes, we saw them last week,” it simply generated a feeling of liking. And that’s the problem with the unconscious. It is unconscious. You can’t order it about or hit it with a stick. You have to coax it out in all sorts of strange and crafty ways. And be clever about interpreting what it does tell you. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=149))

- Put simply, you can’t ask your unconscious a question, and expect a direct answer—a neat, tidy little verbal message. This is because your unconscious communicates its knowledge to you solely through the language of the unconscious. And the language of the unconscious is not verbal. It’s like the language of dreams. It shows you images, it gives you feelings, it nudges you around without you immediately knowing what it’s getting at. I’ll be coming back to this idea later, because it’s so important.

- schools I attended concentrated entirely on teaching us to think logically, analytically and verbally (or numerically). But what they didn’t tell me was that while this way of thinking is absolutely right for solving certain kinds of problems, it’s no good at all for other kinds. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=167))

- This basic truth became much clearer to me when, twenty years ago, I was lucky enough to read a wonderful book by Guy Claxton, called Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=170))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The absolutely crucial point he goes on to make is that this leisurely “Tortoise Mind,” for all its apparent aimlessness, is just as “intelligent” as the much faster “Hare Brain.” “Recent scientific evidence,” he says, “shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined…when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose—or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought—we need recourse to the tortoise mind…This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even ‘wisdom.’ ” Reading this wonderful stuff, I realised that my schools had had such an obsession with logical, critical, analytical thinking that they never appreciated that this kind of mental process is useless if you want to be creative. It was presented as the only way of thinking. It wasn’t until I read Guy Claxton’s book that I came to understand the “Tortoise Mind.” So how can we better understand how to think in this slower, more creative way?

- The conclusion he came to was that there were only two differences between the creative and the uncreative architects. The first was that the creative architects knew how to play. The second was that the creative architects always deferred making decisions for as long as they were allowed. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=203))

- As philosophers say, let’s unpack those two findings. When MacKinnon talks about “play,” he means the ability to get enjoyably absorbed in a puzzle: not just to try to solve it so that you can get on to the next problem, but to become really curious about it for its own sake. He describes this kind of activity as “childlike.” Picture small children playing. They are so absorbed in what they are doing that they are not distracted, they’re just…exploring, not knowing where they’re going, and not caring either. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=206))

- Children at play are totally spontaneous. They are not trying to avoid making mistakes. They don’t observe rules. It would be stupid to say to them, “No, you’re not doing that right.” At the same time, because their play has no purpose, they feel utterly free from anxiety (perhaps because adults are keeping an eye on the real world for them). Most adults, by contrast, find it hard to be playful—no doubt because they have to take care of all the responsibilities that come with an adult’s life. Creative adults, however, have not forgotten how to play. Now, let’s look at the second characteristic of the creative architects. Most people are very surprised to learn that this involves deferring decisions for as long as possible. Doesn’t this mean that creative architects are, by definition, indecisive? Isn’t… ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=210))

- answer will eventually present itself. Let me elaborate. I once wrote a script for a training film about decision-making, and talked to various experts on the subject. They explained to me that if you have a decision to make, the first question you must ask is: “When does this decision have to be made?” You live in the real world, so there is always a cut-off point. But once it’s been agreed when that real-world decision has to happen, why make it before the deadline arrives? Why? Well, it would be foolish, because if you can wait longer, two… ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=220))

- Because you’re uncomfortable, that’s why! You see, leaving a question unresolved, just leaving it open, makes some people anxious. They worry. And if they can’t tolerate that mild discomfort, they go ahead and rush the decision. They probably fool themselves that they’re being decisive. But creative people are much better at tolerating the vague sense of worry that we all get when we leave something unresolved. So if, like the creative architects, you can tolerate that anxiety, you will be able to give yourself the time to come up with a better decision. NOW…the harder part of being creative. How do we learn to play like a child? Start with this thought. The greatest killer of… ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=228))

- to return to your previous state of consciousness, and up to twenty minutes to get back into a state of deep focus. Let’s just think about interruptions… It may be an interruption from outside, like someone coming over and talking to you, or an email popping up in your inbox. Or it may come from inside, as you suddenly remember something that you’ve forgotten to do, or worry that time is running out, or that you don’t think you’re clever enough to solve whatever problem it is that you’re trying to deal with. (As I was writing this, I heard someone coming down the stairs, and it caused me to lose focus. Then I started to think how often that happens, and the same thing happened again. First, an external interruption, then an internal one.) But perhaps the… ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=237))

- Let me reassure you. When you’re being creative there is no such thing as a mistake. The reason is very simple: you can’t possibly know if you are going down a wrong avenue until you’ve gone down it. So, if you have an idea, you must follow your line of thought to the end to see whether it’s likely to be useful or not. You must explore, without necessarily knowing where you’re going. As Einstein once pointed out, if we know what we’re doing when we’re investigating something, then it’s not research! In order to remove such interruptions, whether internal or external, so that you can enter your “Tortoise Mind,” you have to create a safe place, where you can play. This involves first creating boundaries of space, and then boundaries of time. You create boundaries of space to stop others interrupting you.… ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=246))

- space. You might, for example, decide to create a specific play period that starts in a few minutes’ time and finishes, say, ninety minutes later. You treat those ninety minutes with huge respect and don’t allow any interruptions. And, knowing that this chunk of time is sacred, you can then start to play. Of course, it takes a while before you can do this. The chances are that the first time you try it, you’ll find yourself thinking, “Oh, I forgot to call Tom!” Next, you’ll remember that you haven’t yet bought your cat a birthday present. Then you’ll recall how embarrassed you were last night when you couldn’t remember your sister’s name. Then you’ll wonder why your leg is itching so much, and why Germany always wins on penalties, and whether you shouldn’t actually start by making yourself a cup of coffee. Don’t worry. It’s the same for everyone! It’s just… ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=256))

- mind is like a chattering, drunken monkey. On and on, and all completely trivial and uninvited. What can you do about this? Well, people who are stronger-minded than me seem to be able just to bat these thoughts away. Lucky sods. I can’t do that. Instead, I write them down straight away on a yellow sticky note on my desk. Then I can forget about them. Once you start chasing away any distracting thoughts, you’ll discover, just like in meditation, that the longer you sit there, the more your mind slows and calms down and settles. Once that starts to happen you can begin to focus on the problem you’ve chosen to think about. You just keep it vaguely there, in your mind, while you let your thoughts wander around. In order to avoid allowing them to wander too far, you could take a tip from my great friend, the Oscar-winning screenwriter Bill Goldman. (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, A Bridge Too Far, The Great Waldo Pepper, The Hot Rock, Marathon Man—need I say more?) He once told me that when he was working on a particular scene he’d write down the key idea behind it on a piece of paper, and then stick the note right in front of his nose on the computer. If he realised his mind had wandered too far, he would glance at the note and that would bring him back to what he was trying to achieve. So you just sit there and, eventually, as the mind quietens, odd ideas and notions relevant to your puzzle start popping in your mind. But they are…odd! And the reason they seem odd is that they’re not what our usual logical, critical, analytical mind is used to. They don’t arrive in the form of words, in neatly typed little sentences. Because they come from your unconscious, they speak the language of the unconscious. You will remember that I’ve touched on this before. Think about how you think when you’re not conscious, when you’re asleep. Consider your dreams. When you recall your dreams, you remember situations, you remember images, you remember feelings, you remember recurring patterns…but nothing is very clear-cut or precise. Now, if you find all this a bit “touchy-feely,” read what Einstein had to say on the subject of ideas: “The words or the language, as they are written or spoken,” he wrote, “do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in… ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=265))

- fire in this sleepy, relaxed kind of way, the more they began to look like snakes that were biting their own tails. And as he sat there, half-asleep, it suddenly occurred to him that the snake biting its own tail was a ring—and that so too was the structure of a benzene molecule. And, if your logical, analytical “Hare Brain” senses that you’re wandering too far away and that hard, logical thinking should be in there somewhere… Then think of one of the greatest scientists of all time, Edison, the man who invented the light bulb. He found that he got his best ideas in that funny no man’s land between being awake and being asleep. So he used to sit in a comfy armchair with a few ball bearings in his hand and a metal bowl underneath. When he dropped off to sleep his hand relaxed, the ball bearings fell on to the plate and the noise they made woke him up. He’d then pick up the ball… ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=292))

- we’re practising a kind of meditation. Because if we don’t, if instead we are running around, looking at our watches and checking our smartphones, there’s not a hope in hell that we’re going to notice the subtle messages we’re being sent. A word of warning. When we’re trying to be creative, there’s a real lack of clarity during most of the process. Our rational, analytical mind, of course, loves clarity—in fact, it worships it. But at the start of the creative process things cannot be clear. They are bound to be confusing. If it’s a new thought, how can you possibly understand it straight away? You’ve never been there before. It feels unfamiliar. So, much of our “Tortoise Mind” work takes place in an atmosphere of uncertainty and gentle confusion. It’s therefore really important that you don’t rush. Let these new notions of yours slowly… ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=302))

- So how do you decide which it is, or whether, in fact, it’s a bit of both? Because what you do at this point, when this new idea of yours has become pretty clear, is to bring in your critical, analytical, fact-seeking mind to assess it. Yes, your “Hare Brain,” which has been sitting around twiddling its ears, can now hop in and apply all its hard-nosed “scientific” thinking: gathering data, making measurements, reaching logical conclusions, generally checking out your new idea…and seeing if it will actually fly. Yes? No? Or…perhaps? It might be an idea with both good bits and not-so-good bits. If that’s the case, once you’ve decided with your logical mind which parts you want to keep, and which you can now get rid of, you can later go back into your creative mood again, and build on the good parts. It is, however, very… ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QMGR1V&location=312))
