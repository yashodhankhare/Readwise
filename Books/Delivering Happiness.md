- I learned a valuable lesson in humility. And somewhat ironically, I’d just learned the term hubris in my Greek history class, which was defined as “an exaggerated sense of pride or self-confidence,” and it caused the downfall of many a Greek hero.

I didn’t really care what my specific job function was, what company I worked for, what the culture of the company was like, or where I ended up living. I just wanted a job that paid well and didn’t seem like too much work. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=490))

- I thought about how I enjoyed creating, building, and doing stuff that I was passionate about. And there was so much opportunity to create and build stuff, especially with the Internet still exploding, and not enough time to pursue every idea out there. And yet here I was, wasting my time, wasting my life, so that I could make more money even though I had all the money I ever needed for the rest of my life. A lot was going to change about the world. We were on the eve of not only a new century, but a new millennium. The world was about to change in a dramatic way, and I was about to miss out on it so that I could make even more money when I already had all the money I would ever need. And then I stopped thinking to myself and started talking to myself: “There will never be another 1999. What are you going to do about it?” I already knew the answer. In that moment, I had chosen to be true to myself and walk away from the all the money that was keeping me at Microsoft. A few days later, I went to the office, sent my good-bye e-mail to the company, and walked out the door. I didn’t know exactly what I was going to do, but I knew what I wasn’t going to do. I wasn’t going to sit around letting my life and the world pass me by. People thought ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=843))

- I was crazy for giving up all that money. And yes, making that decision was scary, but in a good way. I didn’t realize it at the time, but it was a turning point for me in my life. I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion. I was ready for the next chapter in my life.

- With the exception of poker, almost all games in a typical casino are stacked against the player, and in the long run the casino always comes out ahead. I was intrigued by poker because in poker you are playing against other players, not against the casino. Instead, the casino just takes a service fee for each hand dealt (usually from the winner of each hand). In a casino, each poker table seats up to ten players. As long as at least one of the players is not playing in the mathematically optimal way (and usually it’s several players that aren’t), the players who are playing correctly will generally end up winning at the end of the day. Learning the basic math behind limit hold ’em poker was not actually that hard. I bought and studied a book called Hold ’em Poker and started going to card rooms in California several times a week to practice what I was learning from the book. (Although California is a generally no-gambling state, card rooms are allowed because poker is not a game against the house.) Within a few weeks, I felt that I had mastered the basics of the mathematics behind playing hold ’em. Understanding the mathematics behind hold ’em and playing against players who didn’t was like owning a coin that would land on heads one-third of the time and tails the other two-thirds of the time, and always being allowed to bet on tails. On any individual coin flip, I might lose, but if I bet on tails a thousand times, then I was more than 99.99 percent guaranteed to win in the long run. Likewise, when playing a game against the house such as roulette or blackjack, it would be like being forced to always bet on heads: Even though you might win any individual coin flip, if you did it a thousand times, you would be more than 99.99 percent guaranteed to lose in the long run. One of the most interesting things about playing poker was learning the discipline of not confusing the right decision with the individual outcome of any single hand, but that’s what a lot of poker players do. If they win a hand, they assume they made the right bet, and if they lose a hand, they often assume they made the wrong bet. With the coin that lands on heads a third of the time, this would be like seeing the coin land on heads once (the individual outcome) and changing your behavior so you bet on heads, when the mathematically correct thing to do is to always bet on tails no matter what happened in the previous coin flip (the right decision). For the first few months, I found poker both fun and challenging, because I was constantly learning, both through reading different books and through the actual experience of playing in the field. I started to notice similarities between what was good poker strategy and what made for good business strategy, especially when thinking about the separation between short-term thinking (such as focusing on whether I won or lost an individual hand) and long-term thinking (such as making sure I had the right decision strategy). I noticed so… ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=979))

- Evaluating Market Opportunities Table selection is the most important decision you can make. It’s okay to switch tables if you discover it’s too hard to win at your table. If there are too many competitors (some irrational or inexperienced), even if you’re the best it’s a lot harder to win. Marketing and Branding Act weak when strong, act strong when weak. Know when to bluff. Your “brand” is important. Help shape the stories that people are telling about you. Financials Always be prepared for the worst possible scenario. The guy who wins the most hands is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1003))

- The guy who never loses a hand is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run. Go for positive expected value, not what’s least risky. Make sure your bankroll is large enough for the game you’re playing and the risks you’re taking. Play only with what you can afford to lose. Remember that it’s a long-term game. You will win or lose individual hands or sessions, but it’s what happens in the long term that matters. Strategy Don’t play games that you don’t understand, even if you see lots of other people making money from them. Figure out the game when the stakes aren’t high. Don’t cheat. Cheaters never win in the long run. Stick to your principles. You need to adjust your… ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1011))

- Differentiate yourself. Do the opposite of what the rest of the table is doing. Hope is not a good plan.

Read books and learn from others who have done it before. Learn by doing. Theory is nice, but nothing replaces actual experience. Learn by surrounding yourself with talented players. Just because you win a hand doesn’t mean you’re good and you don’t have more learning to do.

- Don’t be cocky. Don’t be flashy. There’s always someone better than you. Be nice and make friends. It’s a small community. Share what you’ve learned with others. Look for opportunities beyond just the game you sat down to play. You never know who you’re going to meet, including new friends for life or new business contacts. Have fun. The game is a lot more enjoyable when you’re trying to do more than just make money. Aside from remembering to focus on what’s best for the long term, I think the biggest business lesson I learned from poker concerned the most important decision you can make in the game. Although it seems obvious in retrospect, it took me six months before I finally figured it out. Through reading poker books and practicing by playing, I spent a lot of time learning about the best strategy to play once I was actually sitting down at a table. My big “ah-ha!” moment came when I finally learned that the game started even before I sat down in a seat. In a poker room at a casino, there are usually many different choices of tables. Each table has different stakes, different players, and different dynamics that change as the players come and go, and as players get excited, upset, or tired. I learned that the most important decision I could make was which table to sit at. This included knowing when to change tables. I learned from a book that an experienced player can make ten times as much money sitting at a table with nine mediocre players who are tired and have a lot of chips compared with sitting at a table with nine really good players who are focused and don’t have that many chips in front of them. In business, one of the most important decisions for an entrepreneur or a CEO to make is what business to be in. It doesn’t matter how flawlessly a business is executed if it’s the wrong business or if it’s in too small a market. Imagine if you were the most efficient manufacturer of seven-fingered gloves. You offer the best selection, the best service, and the best prices for seven-fingered gloves—but if there isn’t a big enough market for what you sell, you won’t get very far. Or, if you decide to start a business that competes directly against really experienced competitors such as Wal-Mart by playing the same game they play (for example, trying to sell the same goods at lower prices), then chances are that you will go out of business. In a poker… ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1028))

- I’d realized that whether in poker, in business, or in life, it was easy to get caught up and engrossed in what I was currently doing, and that made it easy to forget that I always had the option to change tables. Psychologically, it’s hard because of all the inertia to overcome. Without conscious and deliberate effort, inertia always wins. I’d started to force myself to think again about what I was trying to get out of life. I asked myself what I was trying to accomplish, what I wanted to do, and whether I should be sitting at a different table. From my poker experience, I knew it was never too late to change tables.

- I didn’t know it at the time, but ten years later I would learn that research from the field of the science of happiness would confirm that the combination of physical synchrony with other humans and being part of something bigger than oneself (and thus losing momentarily a sense of self) leads to a greater sense of happiness, and that the rave scene was simply the modern-day version of similar experiences that humans have been having for tens of thousands of years. In the moment though, I felt a sense of experiential epiphany. It swept through my entire being. In that instant, I suddenly understood the appeal of the techno music. I couldn’t simply listen to it the way I listened to music on the radio. I had to let it flow through me in the context of a mind-set that I hadn’t really experienced until just now. It was like someone had bestowed on me the Rosetta Stone of techno music, and no amount of verbal explanation would have helped me understand it. I had to experience it for myself.

- They say that novelty is the biggest aphrodisiac. Making the initial investment to fund new ideas and companies was exciting, but in a relatively short period of time, Alfred and I had made twenty-seven investments and there was no more money left in the fund. Without more investment capital, we couldn’t get involved with any new companies, and the excitement of being an investor wore off quickly. At the time, almost every idea we heard seemed like a great idea, so the money went quickly. (We would find out ten years later that, on average, we had made a slight profit on most of the companies that we invested in, but the vast majority of the profits from the fund would come from Zappos. It turns out venture investing is a lot like poker. The one who makes the most money isn’t the one who tries to play and win as many hands as possible. At the end of 2009, we had distributed over 5.8 times the initial fund amount to our investors, making Venture Frogs one of the top-performing funds from 1999.) In April 2000, the high-flying dot-com stocks started to crash in the stock market, causing widespread panic throughout Silicon Valley. Many companies went out of business, and the venture-capital firms that we were counting on to take our portfolio companies to the ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1340))

- next level scaled back and refused to provide additional funding for almost all of our investments. A couple of companies moved into our new incubator office space, but without additional funding, they stopped paying their bills and went out of business a few months after that. Eventually, Zappos was the only company left in the incubator, and we weren’t optimistic about the prospects of any other companies moving in anytime soon. It was a bad situation for our fund, for the incubator, and for Zappos. Alfred and I originally had the ambitious goal of raising a second fund of $100 million. We had done all the paperwork, and asked investors who had participated in our original fund if they wanted to put money into our second fund. Our first fund had been a great vehicle for meeting a lot of interesting companies and people in a relatively short amount of time. As general managers of the fund, we had taken the idea of having the universe come to us and made it happen. We enjoyed learning about new companies, meeting new people, entertaining new ideas, and making new investments. The problem was that once the investments had all been made, most of our time was spent dealing with ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1349))

- companies that were not doing well and were unable to raise additional venture-capital money to keep them going. We thought our best bet was to raise a second fund. If we could raise $100 million, then we could provide the next round of funding for the portfolio companies from our first fund to get them to the next level. We sent out an e-mail to our previous investors to get an idea of how many would be interested in participating, and then waited anxiously for their response. As it turned out, not a single person was interested. We ended up raising exactly $0. Up until this point, I hadn’t been too worried about the dot-com crash. Even though LinkExchange had been a bad experience from a culture perspective, financially it was a success story. Alfred and I had used our credibility from the LinkExchange sale to raise the $27 million for our first fund, so we naturally assumed that it wouldn’t be that hard to raise… ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1359))

- Alfred and I had continued to keep in touch with Michael Moritz at Sequoia about Zappos, and despite the progress that Zappos was making, Sequoia was still not interested in investing. I believed with all my heart that Zappos had a great shot at succeeding. I felt that I needed to prove to myself and to Sequoia that the financial success of LinkExchange was not a fluke, that it wasn’t just dumb luck. I wanted to prove to the world that I could do it again. So I decided to take off my investor and adviser hat and put on my entrepreneur hat again. I joined Zappos full-time later that year. I decided that Zappos was going to be the universe that I wanted to help envision and build. It would be the universe that I believed in.

- It was a valuable lesson. We learned that we should never outsource our core competency. As an e-commerce company, we should have considered warehousing to be our core competency from the beginning. Outsourcing that to a third party and trusting that they would care about our customers as much as we would was one of our biggest mistakes. If we hadn’t reacted quickly, it would have eventually destroyed Zappos. ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1785))

- I thought back to my poker days and about the most important decision being which table to sit at. We had been sitting at the online footwear sales table. It was time to make a switch and move to a bigger table. I wondered if we could think of something even bigger than shoes, handbags, and apparel online. “We had a customer e-mail us the other day,” I said. “He had ordered a pair of shoes that we had in our warehouse and we surprised him with a shipping upgrade so that he got his order in two days instead of our original promise of a week. He said he loved our customer service and would tell his friends and family about us. He even said we should one day start a Zappos Airlines.” “That’s pretty funny,” Fred said. “Have you read Good to Great by Jim Collins?” I asked. “No, is it a good book? I mean… is it a great book?” “Yeah, you should definitely read it,” I replied. “He talks about what separates the great companies from just the good ones over the long term. One of the things that he found from his research was that great companies have a greater purpose and bigger vision beyond just making money or being number one in a market.

- companies fall into the trap of just focusing on making money, and then they never become a great company.” “Well,” Fred replied, “making money would certainly be a nice problem for us to have right now.” “We’ll get there. We just need to get through this year. We had a good phone call with Wells Fargo today, so maybe we can get a loan from them.” “What are the chances of that happening?” Fred asked. “It’s too early to tell. But at least they didn’t flat-out say no like all the other banks we tried to contact.” Fred and I continued talking. On the one hand, we had to get through our short-term cash-flow challenges. On the other hand, we wanted to make sure we were thinking long-term and laying the foundation for the future of the company. We knew we couldn’t choose one over the other. We had to do both. By the end of lunch, we realized that the biggest vision would be to build the Zappos brand to be about the very best customer service. Maybe one day there really would be a Zappos Airlines that would just be about the very best customer service and customer experience. We talked about how the Zappos brand could be like the Virgin brand and be applied to many different types of businesses. The difference was that we thought ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1818))

- the Virgin brand was more about being hip and cool, whereas we just wanted the Zappos brand to be about the very best customer service. Customer service had always been important at Zappos, but making it the focus of our brand would be a bold move, especially for an online company. “Let’s sleep on this for a while and see if we still feel good about it in a week or two,” I said. “Sounds good,” Fred said. “You know, we could apply the whole service mentality to our vendors as well. That’s never really been done before in the industry. We already treat our vendors well, but we can build up our reputation within the vendor community even more by really treating our vendors as true partners in the business. Most vendors aren’t happy dealing with most retailers because the retailers, especially the department stores, usually try to squeeze every last dollar out of them. We could be the first major retailer that doesn’t try to do that.” I nodded, thinking of the… ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=1829))

This will allow us to one day expand into other categories beyond just shoes.

To keep our culture strong, we wanted to make sure that we only hired people who we would also enjoy hanging out with outside the office.

- Looking back, a big reason we hit our goal early was that we decided to invest our time, money, and resources into three key areas: customer service (which would build our brand and drive word of mouth), culture (which would lead to the formation of our core values), and employee training and development (which would eventually lead to the creation of our Pipeline Team). Even today, our belief is that our Brand, our Culture, and our Pipeline (which we internally refer to as “BCP”) are the only competitive advantages that we will have in the long run. Everything else can and will eventually be copied. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2073))

- Zappos has been repeat customers and word of mouth. Our philosophy has been to take most of the money we would have spent on paid advertising and invest it into customer service and the customer experience instead, letting our customers do the marketing for us through word of mouth. So what is great customer service? It starts with what customers first see when they visit our Web site. In the United States, we offer free shipping both ways to make the transaction as easy as possible and risk-free for our customers. A lot of customers will order five different pairs of shoes, try them on with five different outfits in the comfort of their living rooms, and then send back the ones that don’t fit or they simply don’t like—free of charge. The additional shipping costs are expensive for us, but we really view those costs as a marketing expense. We also offer a 365-day return policy for people who have trouble committing or making up their minds. At most Web sites, the contact information is usually buried at least five links deep and even when you find it, it’s a form or e-mail address that you can only contact once. We take the exact opposite approach. We put our phone number (1-800-927-7671) at the top of every single page of our Web site, because we actually ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2164))

I personally think it’s kind of funny when I attend marketing or branding conferences and hear companies talk about consumers being bombarded with thousands and thousands of advertising messages every day, because there’s usually a lot of discussion among companies and ad agencies talking about how to get their message to stand out. There’s a lot of buzz these days about “social media” and “integration marketing.” As unsexy and low-tech as it may sound, our belief is that the telephone is one of the best branding devices out there. You have the customer’s undivided attention for five to ten minutes, and if you get the interaction right, what we’ve found is that the customer remembers the experience for a very long time and tells his or her friends about it. Too many companies think of their call centers as an expense to minimize. We believe that it’s a huge untapped opportunity for most… ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2174))

- ROI calculations. We view the lifetime value of a customer to be a moving target that can increase if we can create more and more positive emotional associations with our brand through every interaction that a person has with us. Another common trap that many marketers fall into is focusing too much on trying to figure out how to generate a lot of buzz, when really they should be focused on building engagement and trust. I can tell you that my mom has zero buzz, but when she says something, I listen. To that end, most of our efforts on the customer service and customer experience side actually happen after we’ve already made the sale and taken a customer’s credit card number. For example, for most of our loyal repeat customers, we do surprise upgrades to overnight shipping, even though we only promise them standard ground shipping when they choose the free shipping option.

- has less of a distance to walk. But we’re not trying to maximize for picking efficiency. We’re trying to maximize the customer experience, which in the e-commerce business is defined in part by getting orders out to our customers as quickly as possible. The combination of a 24/7 warehouse, surprise upgrades to overnight shipping, and having our warehouse located just fifteen minutes away from the UPS Worldport hub means that a lot of customers order as late as midnight EST, and are surprised when their orders show up on their doorstep eight hours later. This creates a WOW experience, which our customers remember for a very long time and tell their friends and family about. We receive thousands and thousands of phone calls and e-mails every single day, and we really view each contact as an opportunity to build the Zappos brand into being about the very best customer service and customer experience. Seeing every interaction through a branding lens instead of an expense-minimization lens means we run… ([Location 2193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2193))

- into reps worrying about how quickly they can get a customer off the phone, which in our eyes is not delivering great customer service. Most call centers also have scripts and force their reps to try to upsell customers to generate additional revenue. At Zappos, we don’t measure call times (our longest phone call was almost six hours long!), and we don’t upsell. We just care about whether the rep goes above and beyond for every customer. We don’t have scripts because we trust our employees to use their best judgment when dealing with each and every customer. We want our reps to let their true personalities shine during each phone call so that they can develop a personal emotional connection (internally referred to as PEC) with the customer. Another example of us using the telephone as a branding device is what happens when a customer calls looking for a specific style of shoes in a specific size that we’re out of stock on. In those instances, every rep is trained to research at… ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2202))

- lifelong relationship with each customer, one phone call at a time. A lot of people may think it’s strange that an Internet company is so focused on the telephone, when only about 5 percent of our sales happen through the telephone. In fact, most of our phone calls don’t even result in sales. But what we’ve found is that on average, every customer contacts us at least once sometime during his or her lifetime, and we just need to make sure that we use that opportunity to create a lasting memory. The majority of phone calls don’t result in an immediate order. Sometimes a customer may be calling because it’s her first time returning an item, and she just wants a little help stepping through the process. Other times, a customer may call because there’s a wedding coming up this weekend and he wants a little fashion advice. And sometimes, we get customers who call simply because they’re a little lonely and want someone to talk to. I’m reminded of a time when I was in Santa Monica, California, a few years… ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2211))

In our inebriated state, a few of us cajoled her into calling Zappos to try to order a pizza. She took us up on our dare, turned on the speakerphone, and explained to the (very) patient Zappos rep that she was staying in a Santa Monica hotel and really craving a pepperoni pizza, that room service was no longer delivering hot food, and that she wanted to know if there was anything Zappos could do to help. The Zappos rep was initially a bit confused by the request, but she quickly recovered and put us on hold. She returned two minutes later, listing the five closest places in the Santa Monica area that were still open and delivering pizzas at that time.

- Top 10 Ways to Instill Customer Service into Your Company   1. Make customer service a priority for the whole company, not just a department. A customer service attitude needs to come from the top.   2. Make WOW a verb that is part of your company’s everyday vocabulary.   3. Empower and trust your customer service reps. Trust that they want to provide great service… because they actually do. Escalations to a supervisor should be rare.   4. Realize that it’s okay to fire customers who are insatiable or abuse your employees.   5. Don’t measure call times, don’t force employees to upsell, and don’t use scripts.   6. Don’t hide your 1-800 number. It’s a message not just to your customers, but to your employees as well.   7.

- Your Culture Is Your Brand Building a brand today is very different from building a brand 50 years ago. It used to be that a few people got together in a room, decided what the brand positioning was going to be, and then spent a lot of money buying advertising telling people what their brand was. And if you were able to spend enough money, then you were able to build your brand. It’s a very different world today. With the Internet connecting everyone together, companies are becoming more and more transparent whether they like it or not. An unhappy customer or a disgruntled employee can blog about a bad experience with a company, and the story can spread like wildfire by e-mail or with tools like Twitter.

The fundamental problem is that you can’t possibly anticipate every possible touch point that could influence the perception of your company’s brand. For example, if you happen to meet an employee of Company X at a bar, even if the employee isn’t working, how you perceive your interaction with that employee will affect how you perceive Company X, and therefore Company X’s brand. It can be a positive influence, or a negative influence. Every employee can affect your company’s brand, not just the front-line employees that are paid to talk to your customers. At Zappos.com, we decided a long time ago that we didn’t want our brand to be just about shoes, or clothing, or even online retailing. We decided that we wanted to build our brand to be about the very best customer service and the very best customer experience. We believe that customer service shouldn’t be just a department, it should be the entire company. Advertising can only get your brand so far.

- So what’s a company to do if you can’t just buy your way into building the brand you want? What’s the best way to build a brand for the long term? In a word: culture. At Zappos, our belief is that if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff—like great customer service, or building a great long-term brand, or passionate employees and customers—will happen naturally on its own. We believe that your company’s culture and your company’s brand are really just two sides of the same coin. The brand may lag the culture at first, but eventually it will catch up. Your culture is your brand. So how do you build and maintain the culture that you want? It starts with the hiring process. At Zappos, we actually do two different sets of interviews. The hiring manager and his/her team will do the standard set of interviews looking for relevant experience, technical ability, fit within the team, etc. But then our HR department does a separate set of interviews, looking purely for culture fit. Candidates have to pass both sets of interviews in order to be hired. We’ve actually said no to… ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2322))

- After hiring, the next step to building the culture is training. Everyone that is hired into our headquarters goes through the same training that our Customer Loyalty Team (call center) reps go through, regardless of department or title. You might be an accountant, or a lawyer, or a software developer—you go through the exact same training program. It’s a 4-week training program, in which we go over company history, the importance of customer service, the long-term vision of the company, our philosophy about company culture—and then you’re actually on the phone for 2 weeks, taking calls from customers. Again, this goes back to our belief that customer service shouldn’t just be a department, it should be the entire company. At the end of the first week of training, we make an offer to the entire class. We offer everyone $2,000 to quit (in addition to paying them for the time they’ve already worked), and it’s a standing offer until the end of the fourth week of training. We want to make sure that employees are here for more than just a paycheck. We want employees that believe in our long-term vision and want to be a part of our culture. As it turns out, on average, less than 1% of people end up taking the offer. One of the great advantages of focusing on culture is when reporters come and visit our… ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2337))

- Integrity was a value that had been suggested by some employees, but I made a conscious choice to leave it out. I felt that integrity would come from us actually committing to and living up to our core values in everything we did, not just referring to them when it was convenient. Over time, our recruiting department developed interview questions for each and every one of the core values, and we tested our commitment during the hiring process. Be Humble is probably the core value that ends up affecting our hiring decisions the most. There are a lot of experienced, smart, and talented people we interview that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line. But a lot of them are also really egotistical, so we end up not hiring them. At most companies, the hiring manager would probably argue that we should hire such a candidate because he or she will add a lot of value to the company, which is probably why most large corporations don’t have great cultures. Our philosophy at Zappos is that we’re willing to make short-term sacrifices (including lost revenue or profits) if we believe that the long-term benefits are worth it. Protecting the company culture and sticking to core values is a long-term benefit. ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2417))

- In the books Good to Great and Tribal Leadership, the authors looked at what characteristics separated the great companies from the good ones. One of the most important ingredients they found was a strong company culture. Core values are essentially a formalized definition of a company’s culture. As it turns out, it doesn’t actually matter what your company’s core values are. What matters is that you have them and that you commit to them. What’s important is the alignment that you get from them when they become the default way of thinking for the entire organization. Your personal core values define who you are, and a company’s core values ultimately define the company’s character and brand. For individuals, character is destiny. For organizations, culture is destiny. To learn more about how you can create committable core values for your organization, take a look at the links in the Appendix of this book.

- We implement this partnership mentality in many ways at Zappos, but it all begins with the Golden Rule: Treat others as you’d like to be treated. When vendors fly to visit our offices in Las Vegas, they are greeted at the airport by one of our Zappos shuttles. When they arrive at our offices, their buyer welcomes them as we take their sample bags off their hands so we can deliver them to the meeting room. If it’s their first time visiting our office, we give them a tour. We offer them drinks and snacks, basically anything we can do to make them feel comfortable. This is all far from industry standard, but if we were in their position, I’m sure we wouldn’t mind being treated this way. The same mentality applies to communication with our vendors. If they call, we try to return their call the same day. If they e-mail, we try to respond within a few hours. We realize the importance of communication, and if our partners are trying to reach us, we need to be responsive. Our customers expect this type of responsiveness from us, and so should our vendors. Early on in Zappos, because of the size of our business, we realized we were going to need help running it. There was just no way we could afford ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2941))

- to staff all the buyers needed to manage the number of styles and sizes in our selection. I’ll never forget the afternoon I turned my chair around and asked Tony what he thought about giving vendors access to the same information as our buyers. Traditionally in retail, information is hoarded, kept secret, and used as leverage against the vendors to get more out of them. Retailers wouldn’t want a vendor to know how well they’re doing so they can demand more. But if we created true transparency in our business, not only would they help us, they’d benefit as well. Not too long after I proposed the idea to Tony, he spun back around and said, “Were you thinking about something like this?” He created the beginning of what we now refer to as “the extranet.” It does exactly what we had discussed. It allows the vendors complete visibility into our business. They’re able to see inventory levels, sales, and profitability. They can write suggested orders for our buyers to approve. They can communicate with our creative team and make changes to their brand boutiques on the site. In effect, they’re given the keys to the shop. Why do we do this? The average buyer at Zappos has a portfolio of fifty brands, but because of transparency, there’s an additional fifty pairs of eyes helping run the business too. Not only that, vendors are the experts at what they do. No one buyer knows a brand better than the brand’s own representative. So why not leverage their knowledge to help us run a better business? As a result, when they feel empowered to manage their own business using the tools and accessibility we provide, they’ll spend more hours helping us than their typical account. The success of our team can be attributed to our buyers and vendor partners, together. ([Location 2951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=2951))

Again, whatever your response to the previous question was, I’d like you to ask yourself: “Why?” The next set of answers people give might be so they can spend more time with their family, or get married, or run a marathon. What’s interesting is that if you keep asking yourself “Why?” enough times, you’ll find yourself arriving at the same answer that most people do when they repeatedly ask themselves why they are doing what they are doing: They believe that whatever they are pursuing in life will ultimately make them happier. In the end, it turns out that we’re all taking different paths in pursuit of the same goal: happiness. ([Location 3598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003JTHXN6&location=3598))

- From my perspective, it seemed to make sense to try to learn more about the science of happiness so that the knowledge could be applied to running our business. We could learn about some of the science behind how to make customers and employees happier. Today, we even offer a Science of Happiness class to our employees. As I studied the field more, I learned that one of the consistent findings from the research was that people are very bad at predicting what will actually bring them sustained happiness. Most people go through their lives thinking, When I get ___, I will be happy, or When I achieve ___, I will be happy.

- In fact, the research shows that the happiness they thought they would achieve fades fairly quickly. For example, there have been studies on lottery winners that compare their happiness levels right before winning the lottery with their happiness levels a year later. The studies generally find that a person’s happiness level reverts back to wherever it was before. To me, learning about this phenomenon was incredibly interesting. It meant that for most people, finally achieving their goal in life, whatever it was—whether it was making money, getting married, or running faster—would not actually bring them sustained happiness. And yet, many people have spent their entire lives pursuing what they thought would make them happy. The question for you to ask yourself is whether what you think you want to pursue will actually get you the happiness you think it will get you. If the ultimate goal is happiness, then wouldn’t it make sense for you to study and learn more about the science of happiness so that you can apply the research that’s already been done to your own life? With just a little bit of knowledge based on the findings from scientific research, how much happier could you be?

But research has shown that you can perform better in a marathon if you train yourself in ways that may initially seem to go against your gut instinct. Similarly, research in the science of happiness has shown that there are things that can make you happier that you may not realize will actually make you happier. And the reverse is true as well: There are things that you think will make you happy but actually won’t in the long run. I don’t claim to be an expert in the field of the science of happiness.

So I wanted to briefly share some of the frameworks of happiness that I personally found the most useful in helping shape my thinking, with the goal of whetting your appetite to do a little bit of reading yourself so that you can maximize your own personal level of happiness.
