## Highlights
- Taleb hit on a notion he’d learned from Kahneman called anchoring. It worked like this. Say you’re shopping on Amazon and see a fleece jacket that costs $500. Seems like a lot for a jacket. Then you see a similar jacket that costs $1,500. Suddenly that $500 jacket doesn’t seem so expensive. Retailers exploit this bias all the time by offering discounts. Selling a $500 jacket with a 50 percent discount makes it seem like a bargain. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=1156))

- Church put up a slide that read: “Precautionary Principle. If an action might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public, in the absence of a scientific consensus, the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action.” “You’ve got this precautionary principle,” Church said. “There’s a tendency, when you don’t understand things, to do nothing. And that’s defensible in some circumstances, and not in others. And I don’t think we need to talk about it a lot.” ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=1750))

- If ever there was a “roundabout” approach to investing, it was Universa’s love-to-lose method, always with that explosive payoff waiting in the wings. Spitznagel laid out many of these ideas in his 2013 book, The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World, a medley of autobiography—with tales of CBOT trading and Klippisms such as “love to lose”—history, Eastern philosophy, trading insights, military strategy, economic theory, a critique of Robinson Crusoe, even a diversion into the arcane realm of forestry.

- The risk-takers were thrown life preservers. Because they didn’t have skin in the game, bankers had turned their firms into high-stakes casinos that rewarded them with all the upside, with virtually zero risk on the downside. In later years, Taleb would go on to describe this as the “Bob Rubin trade,” a reference to the former Clinton administration treasury secretary Robert Rubin who pocketed $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the years leading up to its implosion during the Global Financial Crisis, and wasn’t forced to give back any of that cash stockpile. Rubin didn’t have “skin in the game” that would have motivated him to press the bank to take less risk. “These people are using the system,” Taleb complained. “Let’s go back to where banks were boring.” Summers disagreed that no one paid a price, noting that nearly all major bank CEOs lost their jobs. (Left unmentioned was their lucrative severance packages.) “I’m not for government running financial institutions. I’m for making them much more failure-proof and more safe for failure when they do fail. What are you for?” “I’m for punishment,” Taleb responded.

- He showed a slide displaying what he called the Disorder Cluster: uncertainty… variability… imperfect, incomplete knowledge… chance… chaos… volatility… disorder… entropy… time… the unknown… randomness… turmoil… stressor… error. “Everything in nature likes these things or doesn’t like these things to some degree,” he said. He was taking a page from his latest book, Antifragile, published in 2012. The book, another bestseller, examined a range of phenomena that are either destroyed or improved by the Disorder Cluster, i.e., extreme volatility. Something that’s antifragile, a Talebian neologism, is made stronger when encountering disorder, chaos, volatility, etc. Like The Black Swan, the book had its roots in the crash-proof trading strategy Taleb had developed alongside Spitznagel at Empirica—all those out-of-the-money put options love volatility, the more the better.

- After mischievously gifting Sornette with a copy of The Black Swan, Taleb put a question to him. “Do you think September 11 was a Black Swan event?” “No,” Sornette replied. “For someone in the building, was it a Black Swan event?” Sornette shrugged. “For the pilot of the plane, was it a Black Swan event? My whole thing is, a Black Swan for the turkey is not a Black Swan for the butcher.” ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2029))

- “I was a trader for twenty-one years,” Taleb said. “I had hair when I started. One thing you learn as a trader is that it’s not your opinion that will ever make you money or make you bankrupt. You know what will really make it or break it for you is how you express your opinion. The financial instrument or the strategy is vastly more important than whether you guess right. You see. For example, if you use options and they’re convex you can be wrong 99 percent of the time and still be okay.” (Put simply, something that’s convex benefits from volatility.)

- upside than investors seeking protection in Treasury bonds or cash. That didn’t mean it was easy. Universa traders found the job hard and often tedious. Coming in every day—and losing money—for years. A big incentive for traders is the year-end bonus, which is often calculated as a percentage of the profit the trader made in a calendar year. That gave traders the fortitude to come into the office every day and engage in an activity that was, by any measure, extremely stressful. At Universa, there often wasn’t a profit. Traders were told to think like employees of a private tech company with a boatload of options that will only be valuable when it goes public. You might have to wait for years, but when it happens, you’ll be rich. Spitznagel remained extraordinarily bearish, always waiting for another crash around the corner—fully expecting it. That didn’t mean he was timing the market or making a call on a crash that would hurt his investors if it didn’t happen. It almost seemed like a magic trick—Universa investors could make money in bull and bear markets. After all, that’s what hedge funds said they did—that’s what the hedge in hedge funds was there for. Many didn’t. ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2083))

- Such as: Don’t lose money. “A strategy that worked in the past naturally isn’t guaranteed to work again in the future,” Spitznagel wrote in his letter, a concession to the possibility that maybe he’d just been lucky all along, a fool of randomness (which of course he didn’t believe). “Yet, if a strategy didn’t work in the past, isn’t there something inherently unscientific about expecting that it will in the future?” He ended on a chest-thumping note. “Our legacy to date speaks for itself.” ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2179))

- tail hedge but not getting that fantastic bang for the buck? Spitznagel conceded that in such a market, the Universa tail hedge wouldn’t work. It was Universa’s kryptonite. He pointed out that historically there was very little precedent for such a market. Bear markets, instead, are characterized by sudden crashes. You even get crashes during bull runs—Volmageddon was just one example. Somewhat paradoxically, he said, for investors a slow downward-trending market is the best of all possible worlds, because it gives them the ability to exit their trades. In a crash, you’re stuck. Everyone’s trying to rush out of the door at once. “Why would I give you protection against the best thing that can happen to you?” he asked the room.

- The problem isn’t so much the predictions, Spitznagel said, it’s the way many investors attempt to protect themselves from the unpredictable—through diversification. “This is the Kool-Aid that we’re drinking from modern finance, diversification, lowering the volatility of our portfolio is going to somehow protect us from things like this. But in fact, it doesn’t. What it’s doing is just making us poor at the end of the day—it doesn’t provide enough protection when we need it.” ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2312))

- In short order, Taleb and Read got to work summarizing their views in what would eventually become the multiauthored paper “The Precautionary Principle.” ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2642))

- The following day, Read took the stage with Taleb. The subject: “How do you solve a problem like uncertainty?” One area where uncertainty reigned, Taleb said, was humanity’s dangerous experiments with the natural world. Exhibit number one: GMOs. “Nature tinkers slowly and over time. Some shmuck was telling you on Twitter,” Taleb said, looking over at Read, “that GMOs are biological. That’s bullshit all right. Nature discovered that it took one hundred million years how ([Location 2712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2712))

- to make it. And now we humans with our arrogance want to introduce it top-down. Whatever we introduce tends to be fragile.” This is where the precautionary principle comes in, he said. “Necessarily, if I go against Nature, then I have to prove why I’m not harming Nature. It’s not like we have to prove it. Someone might say you have no evidence that I’m harming Nature. I say no no no. It doesn’t work that way. You need to produce the evidence you’re not harming. Think about it. Evidence shows up too late in risk systems.” One way of thinking about it, Taleb added, was to consider the fact that there are far more slightly ill people in the world than very sick people (which he said is why Big Pharma is constantly developing treatments for the slightly ill). Since Nature has seen many more slightly ill cases, they don’t require significant medical interventions—or any at all. Nature will take care of it—it doesn’t require the precautionary principle. Very sick cases require quick, aggressive intervention. “This gives a statistical structure to precaution,” he said. “A little bit of rigor in the way we apply precaution. If I have a cold, don’t treat it. If I have a headache, don’t treat it. If I have cancer, see six doctors, not one.” ([Location 2716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2716))

- In the summer of 2014, Yaneer Bar-Yam, founder of the New England Complex Systems Institute, or NECSI, heard about Taleb and Read’s work on the precautionary principle. He was intrigued. He called up Taleb, who was planning to come to a conference Bar-Yam was holding at NECSI’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “I think what you’re onto here is fascinating, Nassim,” Bar-Yam said. “Let’s talk about it once you’re here.” “Sure thing,” Taleb replied. At the NECSI campus, they began to swap ideas about how to advance the paper. Bar-Yam’s specialty was complex systems. A property of complex systems is that it’s very difficult to predict how they will react to new information or actions, a conundrum Bar-Yam had frequently written about. In certain classes of complex systems—and nature is the most complex of all—controlled experiments and models aren’t sufficient to determine what will happen in the real world, he’d argued. Because it’s so hard to determine specific outcomes, the focus needs to narrow down to one simple, crucial question: Is the threat local or global?

- The study of complex systems is an analysis of the interrelations and emerging properties of systems and their parts and their connections to the larger world (there are hundreds of definitions of complex systems, and not all align). That may sound vague, but it has real-life implications. The properties of an ant colony can’t be found in an individual ant, but in the collective properties of all the ants functioning together, forming the complex system that is a colony. The nature of a spear-wielding Greek phalanx marching toward Marathon can’t be captured in the psyche of a single hoplite—the phalanx is a thing in itself, a complex system with its own rules and properties. The nature of an NFL offense driving down the field in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter of a tied game can’t be captured in the brain of the quarterback. You have to analyze the whole team, the coach, the defense, the rules of the game, and more to capture the dynamics of the system. The study of complex systems is anti-reductionist—you have to study the whole colony, the whole team. As complexity scientist Peter Dodds put it: “There’s no love in a carbon atom, no hurricane in a water molecule, no financial collapse in a dollar bill.” ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2743))

- Complexity science is intimidating due to its, well, complexity—but it’s intensely fascinating because of the vast potential it has for solving real-world applications. Bar-Yam spelled out a number of those applications in his 2004 book Making Things Work: Solving Complex Problems in a Complex World. Themes included military warfare, education, health care, ethnic violence, and terrorism. A quasi-handbook for laymen showing how to put complexity theory to use, the book revolves around a singular insight: Any organization designed to solve complex problems needs to match (or exceed) the complexity of the problem itself. That means single individuals by definition are unable to solve very complex problems. Solving very complex problems takes a village. Bar-Yam wrote: “The underlying challenge of this book is the question: How do we create organizations that are capable of being more complex than a single individual?” ([Location 2761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2761))

- In late 2010, Bar-Yam had noticed a troubling spike in food prices in the Middle East. Examining historical correlations between high food prices and social unrest, he found that whenever the United Nations’ FAO food index climbed above 210, the risk of outbreaks of violence shot up. It was troubling, because food prices had been steadily rising, with periods of extreme volatility, for the past decade. NECSI researchers found two primary triggers for higher global food costs, and they both resided in U.S. policy. One was the 1999 deregulation of commodity markets that unleashed speculation by traders. The second was the use of American corn to make ethanol, which saw a huge increase under the George W. Bush administration. The spike in food prices combined with signs of mounting social unrest and political instability led Bar-Yam to predict extreme turmoil in the Middle East and Northern Africa. In December, he reported his expectations to the U.S. government. Days later, Mohamed Bouazizi, a twenty-six-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in Tunisia harassed by local police, lit himself on fire and died, sparking waves of protest that quickly spread to other countries in what became known as the Arab Spring. Bar-Yam’s uncannily accurate forecast put him in the international spotlight along with the emerging science of complex systems. “Times of change can be drastic—revolutions topple dictators, extreme weather kills tens of thousands, and market crashes plunge people into poverty—but for scientists studying complex systems they are fertile ground,” a March 2011 Reuters article proclaimed. “According to Yaneer Bar-Yam… this kind of science is a vital tool for protecting societies from such dangers as pandemics, natural disasters, terrorism, climate change, resource exhaustion and economic crises.” The goal, according to Bar-Yam, wasn’t just predicting outcomes and weighing odds like a bettor in a casino. Rather, it was to figure out how things work, and what’s gone wrong, in order to fix problems before they blow up in our collective face. It was, in a way, a proactive form of insurance. “Prediction tells you that something is going to happen, and that can be helpful so you can run away from it if you need to,” he told Reuters. “But much better is understanding why it happens—that can enable us to take action that may prevent things.” ([Location 2808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2808))

- After the Global Financial Crisis, Bar-Yam began studying the complex system that is the stock market. He claimed to have helped discover a phenomenon that skeptics such as Taleb maintained was impossible—a system to predict market crashes, just like Didier Sornette’s LPPLS model could detect Dragon Kings. In April 2011, Bar-Yam and a team of NECSI researchers produced a paper that identified internal market mechanisms that they claimed foretold a crash.

- Abstract—The precautionary principle (PP) states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing severe harm to the public domain (affecting general health or the environment globally), the action should not be taken in the absence of scientific near-certainty about its safety. Under these conditions, the burden of proof about absence of harm falls on those proposing an action, not those opposing it.

- The section of “The Precautionary Principle” that invited a coordinated attack on the authors—none took more heat than Taleb due to his highly public profile—was its call for an outright ban on GMOs. “Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and their risk are currently the subject of debate,” they wrote. “Here we argue that they fall squarely under the PP because their risk is systemic.” Taleb and his coauthors believed the three decades of research behind GMOs were insufficient to conclude that these wide-ranging genetic experiments on nature were harmless. And that’s a problem, because (they argued) GMOs pose the risk of a tail event—the risk of ruin. If a genetically modified form of rice somehow began to interbreed in the wild with natural rice—or if the new DNA was introduced into some other organism, like bacteria—the outcome is unknowable. And even if those risks were small, their existence required the application of the precautionary principle. The GMO cheerleaders, they said, need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt there is nearly zero existential risk—a very tough challenge indeed. Taking on the pro-GMO crowd had its risks. GMO critics are often tarred as anti-science conspiracy nuts, lumped in with the anti-vaccination crowd or climate-change deniers—a deep irony for Read, who’d spent years battling climate-change deniers. Read argued there was nothing “anti-science” about being against the mass implementation of a novel engineering method on the crops that fed much of the planet, nothing anti-science about asking logical, philosophical, ethical, political, and statistical questions about the proposed rollout, for profit, of a technology that could carry big hidden risks. Taleb & Co. wanted to change the debate. Not science versus anti-science, but recklessness versus precaution. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=2940))

- For investors, Taleb’s most salient observations came in the final chapter, “The Logic of Risk Taking,” where he compared two different ways of analyzing risk—“ensemble probability” and “time probability.” Recall the two ways of thinking about gambling that helped define a ruin problem. In one, a hundred gamblers bet $1,000 on roulette. Some win, some lose it all. If gambler 59 goes bust, that has no impact on gambler 60, and the average profit of the group might be $10 per bet. That’s “ensemble probability.” Next, a single gambler makes one hundred bets on the roulette wheel, putting all his money on red. Such a gambler will never make it to a hundred. That is the “time probability” way of looking at risk, which is path-dependent in time. It is, Taleb argued, the correct way to think about risk—especially when there’s a chance of ruin. And while it might seem obvious that “time probability” is how the real world works, it’s not how much of modern finance weighs market odds. Modern finance theory favors taking the average of all the bettors and using that as a proxy for the risk individual gamblers take. According to this view, the odds of surviving a round of Russian roulette are 83 percent—not so bad. And a risk practically no one would take, even if offered $1 million. Taking an average of a collective series of bets hides the risk of disaster—of gamblers’ ruin. As Taleb wrote in Skin in the Game, “never cross a river if it is on average four feet deep.” By thinking of risk in this way, “more than two decades ago, practitioners such as Mark Spitznagel and myself built our entire business careers around it…. While I retired to do some flaneuring, Mark continued relentlessly (and successfully) at his Universa.” These scenarios of interconnected, self-reinforcing extreme risk are precisely where the precautionary principle applies. In the “time probability” realm, each roll of the dice or spin of the wheel is connected to the other. They can’t be separated into independent units that are averaged out. In much the same way, systemic risk occurs when there are correlations and connections between people facing risks. One person dying in a bathtub won’t increase the risk that his neighbor will die in a bathtub. One person dying of an infectious disease does increase the risk that his neighbor will get sick and die. When such risks become systemic, posing potential ruin to society as a whole, extreme precaution is required.

- “This is why the book’s authors developed the concept of Green Swans, inspired by the famous Black Swans of Nassim Nicholas Taleb,” Samama said. “A Green Swan is a highly certain event with multiple nonlinear and interacting causes that threatens life on Earth. Climate change is an example of a Green Swan.” There was that inconvenient word again: nonlinear. “Climate change carries a variety of nonlinear and interacting risks: physical, regulatory, and societal. It is very challenging to make such a complex model,” the fund manager said. ([Location 3101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=3101))

- Put simply, Spitznagel’s argument in Safe Haven is that investors can both lower risk and raise returns at the same time. In fact, higher returns can and should follow lower risk as a direct consequence, when done right. That contradicted a key tenet of MPT: the trade-off between risk and return. To boost your chance of making bags of money, you need to bear the risk of losing a lot. A startup electric-vehicle maker has a lot more potential upside than your local electric utility. But it’s a hell of a lot more risky. You could lose everything. Spitznagel called this conundrum the great dilemma of risk. MPT-constructed portfolios adjust risk and return to provide the optimal payout—in theory. The method typically measures how volatile an investment is historically relative to a stable asset, such as Treasury bonds. It also measures an investment’s performance relative to its past performance. The approach has gone through multiple iterations over the years. Litterman’s Black-Litterman model is just one variation of the theme. Universa is the counterfactual to the risk-reward calculation, Spitznagel said. “People think of risk mitigation as a liability, as a trade-off against wealth creation, because it usually is,” he wrote in Safe Haven. “Universa is, if nothing else, a real-life case study and out-of-sample test that unequivocally proves the point that risk mitigation doesn’t have to be viewed that way. Risk mitigation can and should be thought of as being additive to portfolios over time—with the right risk mitigation, that is.” Even better, he said, an effective risk-mitigation strategy allows you to take more risk. Recall the various portfolios Spitznagel wrote about in his investor letters and in Barron’s. The hypothetical Universa portfolio had an allocation of 97 percent in stocks and 3 percent in put options with potentially explosive returns, compared with 75 percent or lower in stocks for other strategies. By protecting against the big losses with a bet that turns into a jackpot during crashes, you can put nearly all your chips into the market. A good defense lets your offense get more aggressive—you can throw more Hail Marys, swing for more home runs, shoot more three-pointers, drive faster, pedal to the metal. Universa’s approach was, in a way, a form of panicking early all the time. Spitznagel was permanently panicking for his investors—so they didn’t have to. The logic behind it all can be daunting, and in Safe Haven Spitznagel at times complicates his argument with overly sophisticated language. (“As investors, what we are really doing is trying to perform a mathematical optimization of this logarithmic objective function so we can maximize our geometric returns.”) Warren Buffett, perhaps, said it best and in the simplest terms. Rule No. 1 for investing: Don’t lose money. Rule No. 2: Don’t forget Rule No. 1. While Universa itself lost small amounts on a regular basis, the strategy combined with a large stock position consistently… ([Location 3755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BHTLBG1Q&location=3755))

- Spitznagel has always admitted he’s a terrible forecaster, having warned about a terrifying crash in the market for some two decades, year after year (getting it right a few times like the proverbial broken clock). That was one of the tricks behind Universa. Unlike predictors such as Didier Sornette, who believed he could detect Dragon Kings looming in the market’s tea leaves, Spitznagel didn’t need to forecast to be successful.
