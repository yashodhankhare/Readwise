## Highlights
- One such lecture was given by economics professor Makoto Kanda, who presented his work studying shinise, ancient and honored Japanese companies, or “old companies of long standing.” I was fascinated. The common characteristics of these organizations in many ways echoed my own beliefs about how businesses should be run. Here potentially was proof that my ideas weren’t unreasonably idealistic, even though many of the practices Mako described weren’t usually taught in business schools. Several of the oldest known continuously-operating companies in the world are Japanese. Seven were founded prior to the year 1,000. The size of companies in the database of Japanese firms over 100 years old clearly proves that firms do not have to grow large to survive. In fact most shinise are small- to medium-sized, ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=59))

- sized, private (often family-owned) businesses. This revelation especially impressed me, considering how ingrained the maxim of “grow or die” has become in modern management theory. After returning from Japan, I couldn’t stop thinking about Professor Kanda’s presentation. Several questions came to mind: How unusual is it for a company to live to be 100 years old? If it is rare, how have some companies managed to beat the odds? Are there any secrets to corporate longevity we could learn by studying the management practices of the old companies? Since Japan has such a concentration of old companies, how culturally specific are these behaviors? Would old companies in the United States exhibit similar practices? I had found my research agenda.

- A premise of this book is that a fundamental objective of any organization, though often unstated, is survival. Arie de Geus explains in the prologue to his ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=81))

- book The Living Company, “Like all organisms, the living company exists primarily for its own survival and improvement, to fulfill its potential and to become as great as it can be.” Though students are often taught the purpose of a business is to return a profit, de Geus argues that profits are really the means for companies to survive, not their purpose. As business guru Peter Drucker has said, businesses exist for much more than to produce profits for shareholders, just as humans exist for more than our work. We all want to survive and thrive, and working at a job is a means to that end. Similarly, profits are the means for companies to survive and thrive.

- “Few other types of institutions—churches, hospitals, or universities, for instance—seem to have the abysmal demographics of the corporate life form.” de Geus concludes that companies die prematurely because managers focus exclusively on economic activity, forgetting that an organization is a community of humans. In the words of Ian Davis, former managing director of the multi-national management consulting firm ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=99))

- What enables some companies to defy the odds and continue operating for a century or more while most others succumb to an early death? Well over 95 percent of all businesses are small- and medium-sized enterprises and privately-owned, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Previous research on corporate longevity has dealt with large, mostly publicly-owned companies using very small sample sizes (Collins & Porras, 1994; Pascale, 1990; Hall, 1997; de Geus, 1999; Grossman & Jennings, 2002; Stadler, 2007; Kwee, 2009). For this reason, the research on which I embarked with my Japanese partner Makoto Kanda focused on small- and medium-sized, privately-owned firms. We wanted our research to be useful to a majority of companies today. We wanted the practices we revealed to be relevant and practical, even for small family firms.

- survival for over a century. To test our model, we administered a survey of 125 questions regarding the model’s key factors to 90 Japanese companies over 100 years old. Their responses confirmed that Century Club companies believe the practices described in our model are indeed important factors in their longevity. Then the survey was sent to all 7,000 companies in the Chuo Ward of Tokyo, Japan, both old and young, to see if the behaviors described in our longevity model were unique to Century Club companies. A number of statistically significant practices of old companies emerged. When hearing the results of this research at academic conferences, people most often asked whether these behaviors are unique to Japan. Was our longevity model really describing Japanese businesses and therefore not relevant to organizations in the United States or other economies? After taking several years to construct a database of U.S. companies over 100 years old, we were able to test our framework for its relevance in the United States. We translated the survey into English and sent it to U.S. companies over 100 years old. Not only did the results confirm the validity of our longevity model in the United States, the U.S. companies told us that many of the significant Century Club practices are even more important to them than they were to their Japanese counterparts.

- Based on in-depth interviews and subsequent surveys of companies in business for more than a century, five factors emerged that these companies believe contribute significantly to their long-term survival. Leaders of the Century Club companies say these practices build loyalty to their firms, in particular with customers and employees, but also with other business partners and their local communities. They also believe their approach to doing business is difficult for competitors to imitate and helps their firms to thrive. Here are brief descriptions of the five components of our longevity model. Later chapters will describe these factors in detail along with the unique practices employed by enduring enterprises. The leaders of the case study Century Club companies were adamant that all these factors must be implemented together to sustain a firm for the long run: together they form a mutually reinforcing web of sustainable business practices.

- Present leaders of Century Club companies see themselves as stewards or custodians of the business and feel an obligation to manage the firm in a way that both honors the past and ensures its survival into the future. This deliberate focus on continuity, rather than making a name for themselves, results in real differences in the way old companies are managed.

- The Henokiens Association, in referencing their member companies, which have been in business for over 200 years, says the specific characteristics of these old companies’ backgrounds and the common values that unite them constitute a message of hope for all businesses, especially those with a desire to form the economic and social fabric of the future.

- Strong Corporate Mission and Culture W.C. Bradley Co. (1885) The W.C. Bradley Co. could only survive and thrive because of very strong values shared by everyone. It also survives because the owners were always willing to take a long-term view, often foregoing attractive short-term opportunities when they did not fit with their vision and long-term goals. These core values based on integrity and stewardship have served the company well over the years and we continue to live by them.2 ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=194))

- Carrollton Bank (1877) My great-great grandfather was a founding partner of the bank. He was the first of an unbroken string of five generations to lead Carrollton Bank, and he had some pretty sound ideas. So sound, in fact, that they’re still around for you to take advantage of today. Throughout these many decades, through wars, depressions and even the constant change in today’s banking industry, there remains—and will always remain—one constant: the solid values, passed down from generation to generation, which govern how we treat our customers. Menasha Corporation (1852) Menasha Corporation has cultivated a culture of possibilities, a spirit fueled partly by 160 years of family values and partly by a tireless desire to deliver value to customers. It is evident every working day whether interacting with one another, our customers, or our stakeholders. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=199))

- Most Century Club companies have strong oral traditions represented in sayings such as, “The customer is always #1—that means you call them by their name.” Or “We don’t play pricing games—we offer a good, first deal.”  Some are simply common sayings such as “We follow the Golden Rule” or “Be fair and honest.” A corporate credo or mission statement, is not a characteristic limited to Century Club companies. Eighty-eight percent of the old companies surveyed had some sort of mission statement; 85 percent of young firms also did. There are, however, some significant differences in the content of the old companies’ mission statements and in how they use this sense of purpose to manage the company and shape culture. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=212))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Century Club companies emphasize relationships with their business partners in their credos and tend to include statements about the special technologies or capabilities that make their company unique. There is a notable absence of talk about profits or financial strength. The old firms showed the most differentiation from other firms in the ways they live up to their mission statements. They score higher on every aspect of credo utilization, strongly emphasizing actually managing according to the credo. In other words, the old companies really live their mission statements, which have meaning beyond words developed for their website or to fulfill some fad  in popular management practice. As the current owners of Burdine’s Five and Dime (1908) in Harrisville, West Virginia put it: The store’s philosophy remains just the same as it was when K.C. first opened its doors a century ago: treat each customer special while striving to maintain a friendly shopping experience. Today, every customer is greeted warmly, with our employees understanding that treating others with civility is more important than making a sale.

- Everyone sees themselves as trusted advisors to their clients, rather than big-shot attorneys, which is similar to how lawyers thought of themselves centuries ago. The firm isn’t trying to make the most money or become the largest company. There’s a commitment to continue what has come before. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=234))

- Except for their focus on relationships, which I discuss in more detail later, the specifics of Century Club company  cultures vary. There is, however, one common practice the old companies share: a conservative approach to managing finances. These firms are very reluctant to go into debt as a way of funding their business. (One leader recounted with glee how he had ignored the advice from a Lehman Brothers consultant that his firm was under-leveraged and they should take on more debt.) The Century Club companies also place more importance on profitability than growth. These practices are likely the reason a large majority of companies over 100 years old are small- to medium-sized businesses. As sixth-generation owner Kevin Hancock of Hancock Lumber Co. (1848) explained when interviewed: I’m not surprised there is no correlation between being large and long-term survival. In fact, if anything, perhaps the opposite is true. Most of the companies in our industry I have seen go out of business did so during periods of unsustainable growth and overreaching.

- This approach to financial management is well described by Arie de Geus in The Living Company: “Long-lived companies were conservative in financing. They were frugal and did not risk their capital gratuitously. Having money in hand gave them flexibility and independence of action. They could pursue options that their competitors could not. They could grasp opportunities without first having to convince third-party financiers of their attractiveness.” The benefit of this approach to managing finances is evident in the 125th anniversary video posted on the website of brokerage and investment banking firm Stifel (1890): While many firms faltered, our fiscal responsibility allowed us to flourish… ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=266))

- Another example is how specialty printer Weldon, Williams & Lick (1898) weaves their conservative approach to finances into their mission: WW&L grew into a firm that placed great importance on such things a employee relations, honesty in all dealings, conservative financial management, frugality in operations, and dedication to serving customers well. Meeting the changing needs of customers and market demands have played a major role in our continued success. Being trusted to take care of “other people’s money” makes WW&L the best place to buy from and the best place to work. A fundamental objective of the Century Club firms is survival, and staying financially sound is a means to this end. For these company leaders making a profit is not an end in itself: it is the means to sustain their business. Stone carver Nick Benson of The John Stevens Shop (1705) in Newport, Rhode Island, says the business has survived for over 300 years for two reasons. He is not concerned about making big bucks, and he cares deeply about his work. “We don’t care about the money as much as we care… ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=275))

- described this view of profits on the part of long-lived firms: “Profitability is a necessary condition for existence and a means to more important ends, but it is not the end in itself . . . . Profit is like oxygen, food, water, and blood for the body; they are not the point of life, but without them, there is not life.” As Max De Pree of Herman Miller, Inc. (1905) said, profit is the result of doing well what they do as a company, not their goal.      Century Club companies talk passionately about the purpose of their business. Whether it is to enhance human life (pharmaceutical company), create great places to live and work (furniture manufacturer), or provide a bit of sunshine to every customer’s day (candy store), the purpose of these old companies is clear and meaningful. They talk… ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=286))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Whether talking literally about a secret sauce, such as McIlhenny Company’s Tabasco® sauce, or using the term metaphorically to refer to a particular technical specialty or core competency, most of the companies that have survived for over 100 years attribute their success partly to the accumulation over time of some specialized knowledge, skills, or technology. The Century Club companies believe their “secrets” or special methodologies make the organization and their offerings unique. Such a differentiation strategy sets them apart from the competition and makes what they do difficult for others to imitate, thus giving the company a sustainable competitive advantage over time. This approach to business, which offers differentiation from the competition and is difficult for others to imitate, falls in line with academic and author J.B. Barney’s “resource-based view” of competitive advantage. The beliefs held by the old companies that they have unique core competencies, their products or services are difficult to copy, and their offerings have a strong appeal other than price do not significantly differ from beliefs of a majority of younger firms. It is in how they manage their strengths where century club companies help ensure their survival. The old companies build on their special skills or technologies in every aspect of their business, including the fine details of their offering, how they train and educate new employees, how they work with suppliers, and how they convey their uniqueness to customers as part of the sales process. Another area where management of strengths is unique among Century Club companies lies in how they strengthen their core competencies over time. Though the old companies say some things should not change, such as product quality, or production and sales methodologies, they are constantly working to improve their operations as well as develop and improve their core competencies.

- Peter Drucker reminds us in The Essential Drucker, it is not necessary for a company to grow bigger, but it is necessary for a company to constantly grow better. Owner Charlie Stephens, of Randolph Jewelers (1852) explained their evolution: At one point we were doing eyeglasses, and then billiard balls. When I took over, our #1 seller was Black Hills gold. Now we’re doing computer-aided design and selling much higher-end jewelry. I didn’t come in with a vision that I was going ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=336))

- to transform the business... I waited and listened, then slowly began to change based on what customers wanted The way Century Club companies go about changing seems to make a difference. Collins & Porras described this unique approach to change in Built to Last: “Visionary companies display a powerful drive for progress that enables them to change and adapt without compromising their cherished core ideas.” ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=340))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As a college professor, I could not help but notice that the change management practices used by the old companies follow the principles of successful change implementation taught in business courses today. It is rewarding to see what we teach confirmed by successful, real-world businesses. As the saying goes: It’s not that people don’t like change, they just don’t like being changed. When a new direction or initiative is necessary, help employees understand the situation and, as much as possible, involve them in developing the response. They will feel ownership for the change while remaining proud of the past. Century Club companies have precious histories and a heritage they protect at all costs. At the same time, they do not stubbornly observe their traditions without challenge. Their ability to change by first affirming their traditional past and then altering what is necessary—the balance of tradition and innovation—enables their long lives.

- The point of this story: Don’t walk away from your past when change needs to take place, build on it. Change is absolutely necessary to survive over the long term, but how you change makes a difference. A company’s culture and core competencies can evolve. They become the building blocks used to make needed changes in Century Club companies. Changing through building on your company’s core competencies and unique technologies rather than abandoning them may make take longer but will be far more effective in the long run.

- Close Relationships with Business Patners ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=390))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The approach to managing change used by Century Club companies described in the previous chapter grows out of the importance they place on maintaining their relationships. They understand that their companies are part of large, interdependent systems. These companies know they cannot control everything around them and that they must depend on a complex web of people and organizations beyond the walls of their firm. When pursuing internal change, Century Club companies patiently work with their external partners, so that no one is left behind once the change is implemented. The systemic effect of this approach is to reinforce the loyalty of customers and develop the dedication of other business partners to the success of the company. Thus the old companies are more often able to survive upheavals in their industry, advances in technology, and other environmental changes outside their control. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=402))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Because these old companies view relationships with their business partners as something more than economic transactions or the trading of goods and services for financial gain, they are willing to share technologies and ideas that other companies would consider company-confidential. The willingness to learn from all partners is seen by the old companies as an important factor in their long-term survival. Century Club companies truly believe part of the reason for their success comes from their long and deep relationships with customers and suppliers. This emphasis on long-term relationships leads to a kind of symbiosis with their business partners. Close-knit, mutually-supportive relationships help the old companies and their partners learn and adapt over time, often resulting in longevity for all involved.              Old companies are significantly more likely than younger firms to emphasize their corporate values and product story when working with customers, and they also make more of an effort to see that their products are used in the best way. Further, old companies work hard to gain an understanding of key customers, using customer service and after-sales services as a way to build long-term relationships and to learn from them. Often the old companies define their purpose in terms of helping customers accomplish their purpose, such as this statement from DWS Printing ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=423))

- (1865): “We are the last step in the visions of a lot of passionate people. . . . Our purpose is to help actualize your vision, to help tell your story, and to become a part of your legacy.” ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=434))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This emphasis on long-term relationships does not prevent the old companies from seeking out new business partners. In our research, old companies place even more importance on developing new customers than do younger ones. However, the old companies truly believe they cannot maintain their success for a long period of time without the help of others. When customers and suppliers become trusted partners, both parties are willing to share information and do favors for each other that don’t necessarily result in any readily apparent financial gain. The willingness to share information, technologies, and ideas becomes a two-way street, resulting in mutual learning, mutual success, and enduring trust. It may seem obvious that old companies are more likely than young firms to emphasize their corporate history, culture, and product “story” when working with customers, however their difference in dealing with customers goes beyond the selling process. The old companies are significantly more likely than younger ones to make every effort to see that their products are used by customers in the best way. They also build their relationships with customers through after-sales services, responding quickly to customer complaints and use customer service as an important opportunity to talk with and connect to customers (not just to fix the immediate problem). This interest ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=444))

- in how customers use the company’s products provides insight and information often leading to future changes and improvements. These relationships also help old companies to survive upheavals in their industry, advances in technology, and other environmental and social changes that often leave their competitors behind. Alden shoe company (1884) sources its leathers mostly from small tanneries—its shell cordovan comes from the last such tannery in America, Horween Leather Company (1905). Alden has used Horween as their leather supplier since 1930, and is their longest cordovan customer. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=453))

One of IBM’s corporate leaders talked about the company culture that enabled them to survive for the last century. One item she mentioned was their long-term relationships with customers, which led to mutual learning and success. Without any prompting—or knowledge of who I was and what I did—the gentleman sitting next to me leaned over and said, “Our company has been an IBM customer for 80 years, and I can… ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=458))

- Swedish investor Marcus Wallenberg says: “Established firms have a huge natural advantage in the marketplace because of their strong customer and supplier bases.” Former McKinsey managing director Ian Davis in his 2014 reflections on corporate longevity in the McKinsey Quarterly says that older companies “relentlessly focus on their customers, and not just on their performance with customers but also on understanding what their best and most innovative customers are doing.” And the older companies “engage their key suppliers to solve problems and identify opportunities, so that these activities also become key sources of insight.” By viewing their relationship with business partners as something more than the… ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=463))

- One explanation for the lack of significant difference between old and young companies’ self-reported behavior toward employees could be that many companies now realize retaining well-trained employees is of great benefit to their business. As Bill Marriott, CEO for 40 years, says of Marriott International (founded 1927, so not quite 100 years old), “A seasoned workforce does a better job—and they cost you less money.” Long-term employees have a wealth of information that can help the firm provide better customer service. As Carol, third generation co-owner with her brother Mac of Fitch Lumber and Hardware (1907) explains: Though the Fitch family runs the store, we have several families where the father and son and grandson have worked here. The average length of time people work at Fitch Lumber is 18 years. It’s this reliability on seeing a familiar face that keeps people coming back. When you go to a hardware store, you like to see someone who has helped you before and you feel comfortable going back to.

- Century Club companies invest in the training and development of their employees. They are especially deliberate about teaching employees the history of their company in addition to the technologies and skills employees will need to keep the company successful into the future. Because of this investment made in their employees, the old companies make every effort to retain them. The connection between employee training investments and long-term employment is well documented by Stanford University professor Jeffrey Pfeffer in his description of the human resource practices of successful companies, in publications such as The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First and Seven Practices of Successful Organizations. Labor economists would say it doesn’t make sense to spend company resources on employee development if you don’t expect them to stay with the firm to see the payoff for that investment. Many of the old companies reported keeping employees on the payroll even when they didn’t have enough work to keep them busy at their regular tasks.

- engage in maintenance work or development activities. Some firms even “lent out” their employees to non-profit organizations during slow business times. When business picked up again, these firms didn’t have to worry about recruiting, screening, selecting, and training new workers, all of which takes time and resources. The old companies choose to invest their resources in employee retention rather than replacement. Such employee retention practices build great loyalty to the company on the part of employees and enhance company performance. This is an area where we easily see the interconnection of the longevity factors. If the company hadn’t been financially conservative during the good years, it wouldn’t have the resources to keep paying employees during a business downturn and thus be able to quickly respond to the upturn when it comes.

- After years with the company, employees identify very closely with the firm and its goals. Many of the Century Club companies engage in some type of profit-sharing, employee ownership, or participatory management practices. Even without any type of formal ownership in the company, employees in these companies develop an ownership attitude—it’s their company. The resulting integration of personal and organization goals and objectives has a major impact on the company’s success. Employees conduct their work and use company resources as if they were their own. This sense of employees and the company being partners in making a company successful can also extend to union relationships.

- Developing leaders from within the firm appears to be one of the key differentiating factors in sustaining a business for the long term. The old companies are concerned not just about reaping today’s harvest, they are cultivating the ground for future crops. This factor is especially apparent in the area of leadership development. As Arie de Geus describes in The Living Company, “No matter how widely diversified companies were, their employees (and even their suppliers, at times) felt they were all part of one entity. This cohesion around the idea of ‘community’ meant that managers were typically chosen for advancement from within; they succeeded through the generational flow of members and considered themselves stewards of the longstanding enterprise.” These leaders do, indeed, see themselves as stewards of the company, hired to ensure the organization’s long-term success rather than to make a name for themselves. Century Club companies are proud of their employees and want their employees to feel pride in the company they work for. Employees are not seen as “hired hands” but as whole people with whom to engage and build relationships. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=573))

- Because Century Club companies see themselves as an integral part of a web of relationships often connected to their family history and reputation, the development of relationships within the local community—both commercial and social—is just as important as the development of relationships with their business partners. The old companies actively participate in their local communities, promoting them and developing local networks for mutual learning and benefit. In many cases a company and its local community are so closely associated with each other that they are seen as one and the same.

- Unexpectedly, I discovered that many Century Club companies exhibit their concern for community through environmental sustainability practices. Who knew that being an environmental sustainability leader would be a distinguishing factor of old companies? We didn’t even ask about environmental efforts in our initial research. We should perhaps have had a clue, based on the commitment of Century Club companies to their communities, as well as the fact that they have an attitude of stewardship regarding sustaining their business. But the fact is, I came across this factor by accident. One of the courses I taught is called Managing for Environmental Sustainability. In prepping for the course I ordered a book I thought would be good for our business students called Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=666))

- Value, and Build Competitive Advantage by Daniel Esty and Andrew Winston. The authors list companies they consider forward-thinking in the area of sustainable business practices, calling them “wave makers.” As I was reading through the list, I recognized a number of the names from my database of 100-year-old companies. Most people assume that a “green” strategy is something new and entrepreneurial, but it turns out Century Club businesses commonly include sustainability in their values and practices. The more I thought about this, the more sense it made. The stewardship attitude of leaders in the old companies frames their role as preserving the firm for future generations. It’s a logical extension of this leadership philosophy to include preserving the environment for future generations. Old companies’ environmental sustainability strategies likely arise from their sense of social responsibility to their communities. As Sawyer Bentwood (1801) says: Our factory is located in the quiet town of Whitingham in rural Vermont, where nature abounds; our rural location is a testimony to our love and respect for the outdoors. Sawyer Bentwood is committed to reducing wood and water waste; we work in partnership with local businesses to help reduce our collective ecological footprint.

- For some Century Club companies, environmental practices are the very core of their business, such as Louis Padnos Iron & Metal Company (1905) whose business is recycling. E. Butterworth & Co. (1839) has been a recycler of textiles for its entire history and is one of the oldest companies in the world handling textile by-products and recycled textile waste. The environmental practices of Century Club companies may also stem from their frugality. Though sustainable business practices often require up-front investments, they usually save money in the long run. Since these companies intend to be around for the long term, they know they will benefit from the investment. Once sustaining the company becomes part of the DNA of a firm, long-term, holistic thinking becomes an overriding factor in every decision. As Levi Strauss & Co. (1853) says, “Using innovative, sustainable, and progressive practices isn’t just how we make our jeans and other products, it’s… ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=683))

- 2014, its head of R&D mentioned that the company was developing fuel cell technology to power ships. He said they didn’t expect it to be viable for 20 years or so, but they were investing in the project because they felt it was the best way to address the issue of how to power big ships in an environmentally responsible manner. With a 20-year timeframe and based on a belief in finding the best solution to an environmental issue, who other than a very profitable 200-year-old company would make such an investment? This is an example of the innovative strategies of old companies. They innovate and change, or they wouldn’t have survived for so long. Their belief in stewardship makes innovation, including in environmentally sustainable practices, a way to ensure their viability into the future.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It has been estimated that the natural life span of a corporation could be as long as 200-300 years. There are several companies in Europe and Asia this age and older. By identifying, monitoring, and implementing the right practices, we humans have increased our life span over 80 percent in just one century. In addition to medical advances, we have learned what behaviors increase longevity: a balanced diet, regular exercise, monitoring key measures such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and so on. In spite of the complexities of corporate life, research has identified some very specific practices that could similarly result in longer-lived corporations. When a company dies a “natural” death it looks more like the following story of a furniture company that closed after over 130 years in business. Facing increasing cost pressures from offshore manufacturers, and with no one in the next generation interested in running the business, this family-owned furniture manufacturer decided it needed to close. After spending quite a bit of time explaining to employees this decision, a public announcement was made. Three TV stations and two newspapers immediately showed up at the company site. The company owner and president told the media he couldn’t deal with all of them, so he gave the news teams the run of the place. They took full advantage of the opportunity, interviewing and filming dozens of employees. The TV reporter said he’d covered over 100 plant closings and this was the only one where not one person had a bad thing to say about the company. He concluded his evening news report with this: “They say your name doesn’t have to be on the door to be part of this family company. You get the feeling it really is that way.” Following the announcement that the factory would be closing, productivity actually went up and quality reached levels of near perfection. When employees were asked about this, they related a determination to ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=738))

- What role does leadership play in corporate longevity? One of the questions I receive most frequently about the characteristics and behaviors of companies that have survived over 100 years concerns leadership behaviors. The short answer is that no consistent leadership qualities emerged from our research. Most companies revere their founders or other leaders who led the company during a critical juncture in the firm’s history. And most of these companies have leaders who have grown up in the company, which usually produces some consistency in leadership style within an organization. But we did not identify any consistency in leadership behaviors across the organizations we surveyed. What did seem important was that leaders follow the principles of longevity, including embodying the corporate culture and its values, and having a stewardship approach to running the company so it survives to the next generation. As with all companies, Century Club firms face crises. Almost every one we talked to related a story about the time the company overcame great obstacles to continue to live another day. These stories often describe heroics on the part of the founder or key salesperson or some other leader. But they also describe how employees or suppliers sacrificed to help the organization survive rough times, or how customers or the local community provided support to recover from a disaster. Of course leadership matters, and these old companies, as with other firms, thrive under astute leaders who make good business decisions. But the Century Club companies also seem to survive under weak leadership, as long as the core principles of the longevity model are not violated. Increasingly, companies are beginning to realize that… ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=757))

- Does keeping a company in the family, or at least privately owned, make a difference in longevity? Every privately-owned Century Club company interviewed said staying private was key to their longevity. They felt being private enabled them to chart their own course, rather than having to “dance to Wall Street’s tune.” The Economist calculates the majority of the world’s most successful medium-size companies are family firms and account for two-thirds of Germany’s Mittelstand. Family owners typically want their firms to last for generations, so they can make long-term investments without worrying about shareholders looking for short-term profits. However, when analyzing our U.S. database of 100-year-old companies, we found that the percentage of privately-owned firms was no greater than their representation in the general business population. There are more than a few successful public firms over 100 years old. In several of them members of the founding family still wield significant clout. Even if the family doesn’t hold a majority of shares, family members often are board members and influence the choice of chief executive. A 2014 The Economist article describes the positive influence family ownership or involvement can have on a business: Whether private or public, family firms tend to take a longer-term perspective. . . . Non-family-controlled public companies tend to be obsessed with meeting the demands of investors to maximise short-term profits. . .… ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=774))

- Isn’t the purpose of every company to maximize profits? Why do you downplay the role of profits in the longevity model? One of the longevity practices of old companies that produces skepticism among managers and academics, particularly those with a financial background, is how seldom making money is stated as the chief purpose of these businesses. Old companies often talk about the purpose or goal of their business in lofty terms that seem soft and idealistic. The old companies are certainly concerned about profitability. They readily concede the necessity of profits, but they look at them as the fuel to keep their company “engine” running rather than their destination. Century Club companies are profitable; they wouldn’t have survived for over 100 years if they weren’t. If they have to choose between profits and growth, they will choose profits. However, maximizing profits is not seen as the primary purpose of their business. As one CEO put it, “I need to eat to survive, but that doesn’t mean my focus ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=794))

- in life should be maximizing my consumption of food. Eating enough to stay healthy is sufficient.” Here is a nice comment on this question from Mark Gunther’s book Faith and Fortune. As architects of great companies, James C. Penney [company founded 1902] and Milton S. Hershey [company founded 1894] were in some respects ahead of their time. Each man imbued his company with a purpose that was more inspiring than making money. Both knew that profits were essential, but profits were not the reason to do business. They saw their role as serving their workers and their customers, as well as making money for themselves and their owners. . . . They managed not for the next quarter, but for the next quarter of a century. In Japan, where my research partner was able to obtain profitability data even from small privately-owned firms, companies over 100 years old were twice as profitable as the average Japanese firm. I have not been able to obtain such data from U.S. companies, but I have no reason to believe they are any different. The point is not that that the old companies don’t see profits as important, but that they view them from a different perspective. Accomplishing their mission and purpose comes first. If the company does this well, they believe making money will follow. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RV5WGHS&location=802))

When I first began this research I suspected, based on observation of the number of 100-year-old stores in my home town, that retail businesses were more likely to survive in the long term. However, after analyzing an industry sort of my data base of old companies and comparing it to the U.S. business population as a whole, it turns out the percentage of retail businesses in the Century Club is very similar, and even slightly lower, than in U.S. businesses overall. There are, however, a few industry categories in which Century Club companies show a significantly larger representation than in the general U.S. business population. Out of the 18 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics industry classification the most significant differences are in the Mining, Utilities, and Manufacturing categories.
