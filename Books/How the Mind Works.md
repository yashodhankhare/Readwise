## Highlights
- The linguist Noam Chomsky once suggested that our ignorance can be divided into problems and mysteries. When we face a problem, we may not know its solution, but we have insight, increasing knowledge, and an inkling of what we are looking for. When we face a mystery, however, we can only stare in wonder and bewilderment, not knowing what an explanation would even look like.

- My goal was to weave the ideas into a cohesive picture using two even bigger ideas that are not mine: the computational theory of mind and the theory of the natural selection of replicators. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=49))

- trillions of facts. It must be equipped with a smaller list of core truths and a set of rules to deduce their implications. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=269))

- An intelligent being has to deduce the implications of what it knows, but only the relevant implications. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=287))

- The mind is a system of organs of computation, designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of life, in particular, understanding and outmaneuvering objects, animals, plants, and other people. The summary can be unpacked into several claims. The mind is what the brain does; specifically, the brain processes information, and thinking is a kind of computation.

- The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox. It says that beliefs and desires are information, incarnated as configurations of symbols. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=478))

- This chapter is about human reasoning: how people make sense of their world. To reverse-engineer our faculties of reasoning, we must begin with Wallace’s paradox. To dissolve it, we have to distinguish the intuitive science and mathematics that is part of the human birthright from the modern, institutionalized version that most people find so hard. Then we can explore how our intuitions work, where they came from, and how they are elaborated and polished to give the virtuoso performances of modern civilization.

- A ground rule when you solve a problem at school is to base your reasoning on the premises mentioned in a question, ignoring everything else you know. ([Location 5858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=5858))

- But outside of school, of course, it never makes sense to ignore what you know. ([Location 5871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=5871))

- A second reason we did not evolve into true scientists is the cost of knowledge. Science is expensive, and not just the superconducting supercollider, but the elementary analysis of cause and effect in John Stuart Mill’s canons of induction. Recently I was dissatisfied with the bread I had been baking because it was too dry and fluffy. So I increased the water, decreased the yeast, and lowered the temperature. To this day I don’t know which of these manipulations made the difference. The scientist in me knew that the proper procedure would have been to try out all eight logical combinations in a factorial design: more water, same yeast, same temperature; more water, more yeast, same temperature; more water, same yeast, lower temperature; and so on.

- But the experiment would have taken eight days (twenty-seven if I wanted to test two increments of each factor, sixty-four if I wanted to test three) and required a notebook and a calculator. I wanted tasty bread, not a contribution to the archives of human knowledge, so my multiply-confounded one-shot was enough. In a large society with writing and institutionalized science, the cost of an exponential number of tests is repaid by the benefit of the resulting laws to a large number of people. That is why taxpayers are willing to fund scientific research. But for the provincial interests of a single individual or even a small band, good science isn’t worth the trouble. A third reason we are so-so scientists is that our brains were shaped for fitness, not for truth. Sometimes the truth is adaptive, but sometimes it is not. Conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition (see Chapters 6 and 7), and we are apt to want our version of the truth, rather than the truth itself, to prevail.

- The humorist Robert Benchley said that there are two classes of people in the world: those who divide the people of the world into two classes, and those who do not. ([Location 5916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=5916))

- Occasionally I receive lengthy manuscripts from theoreticians who have discovered that everything in the universe falls into classes of three: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; protons, neutrons, and electrons; masculine, feminine, and neuter; Huey, Dewey, and Louie; and so on, for page after page.

- No, the mind has to get something out of forming categories, and that something is inference. Obviously we can’t know everything about every object. But we can observe some of its properties, assign it to a category, and from the category predict properties that we have not observed. If Mopsy has long ears, he is a rabbit; if he is a rabbit, he should eat carrots, go hippety-hop, and breed like, well, a rabbit. The smaller the category, the better the prediction. Knowing that Peter is a cottontail, we can predict that he grows, breathes, moves, was suckled, inhabits open country or woodland clearings, spreads tularemia, and can contract myxomatosis. If we knew only that he was a mammal, the list would include only growing, breathing, moving, and being suckled. If we knew only that he was an animal, it would shrink to growing, breathing, and moving. ([Location 5936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0042XA2XG&location=5936))
