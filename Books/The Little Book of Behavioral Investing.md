    - Note: book to read
- There are clear psychological challenges to maintaining a clear head during a sharp sell off. One way Uncle John used to handle this was to make his buy decisions well before a sell off occurred. During his years managing the Templeton Funds, he always kept a “wish list” of securities representing companies that he believed were well run but priced too high . . . he often had standing orders with his brokers to purchase those wish list stocks if for some reason the market sold off enough to drag their prices down to levels at which he considered them a bargain. This prime example of pre-commitment in the face of a known empathy gap is exactly what you should seek to emulate in your investment strategies. Sir John knew that on the day the market or stock was down say 40 percent he wouldn ’t have the discipline to execute a buy. But, by placing buy orders well below the market price, it becomes easier to buy when faced with despondent selling. This is a simple but highly effective way of removing emotion from the situation.

- We see this kind of self-serving bias rear its head regularly when it comes to investing. For instance, stockbroker research generally conforms to three self -serving principles: Rule 1: All news is good news (if the news is bad, it can always get better). Rule 2: Everything is always cheap (even if you have to make up new valuation methodologies). Rule 3: Assertion trumps evidence (never let the facts get in the way of a good story).

- We should get used to asking “Must I believe this?” rather than the far more common “Can I believe this?” ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=526))

- Many of these investors generally run concentrated portfolios, with the default question being “Why should I own this investment?” Whereas for fund managers who are obsessed with tracking error and career risk, the default question changes to “Why shouldn’t I own this stock?” This subtle distinction in default questions can have a dramatic impact upon performance. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=530))
- “An early mentor of mine started out during the Depression and used to always say we were in the rejection business—that we’re paid to be cynical and that a big part of success in investing is knowing how to say no.” ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=533))
- “Don’t question authority. They don ’t know the answer either!” ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=607))
- I play this game to try to illustrate how hard it is to be just one step ahead of everyone else, to get in before everyone else, and to get out before everyone else. Yet despite this fact, it seems that this is exactly what a large number of investors spend their time doing—trying to be the smartest person in the room. So if we can’t outsmart everyone else, how on earth can we invest? The good news is that we don’t need to outsmart everyone else. We need to stick to our investment discipline, ignore the actions of others, and stop listening to the so-called experts. So, the next time a financial talking head tries to talk you into anything, do yourself a favor, put your fingers in your ears, and start humming to yourself!

- “Those who have knowledge don’t predict. Those who predict don’t have knowledge.” ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=711))
- Instead of any self-insight, Tetlock uncovered five frequently used excuses as to why the experts ’ forecasts were wrong (which reminds me of the old description of an economist being an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn ’t happen today). The most common excuses were: 1. The “If only” defense—If only the Federal Reserve had raised rates, then the prediction would have been true. Effectively, the experts claim that they would have been correct if only their advice had been followed. 2. The “ceteris paribus” defense—Something outside of the model of analysis occurred, which invalidated the forecast; therefore it isn’t my fault. 3. The “I was almost right” defense—Although the predicted outcome didn’t occur, it almost did. 4. The “It just hasn’t happened yet” defense—I wasn’t wrong, it just hasn’t occurred yet. This is my personal favorite. 5. The “Single prediction” defense—You can’t judge me by the performance of a single forecast. These excuses allowed the failed forecasters to continue making outrageously poor forecasts without any acknowledgment that they really got it wrong. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=762))
- Indeed, I wound up thinking that forecasting is to the market what gravity is to the earth. As much as we like to poke fun at faulty predictions, we can ’t function without them. Even if we disagree with, say, the analysts’ consensus on Cisco, that consensus gives us a basis that helps us to form our own judgments about whether it is overvalued or undervalued. Without forecasts, the market would no longer be grounded to anything. Now, I doubt that we do actually need forecasts to help us invest. But Nocera inadvertently points us to one of the reasons why people keep using forecasts: When given a number we tend to cling to it, even subconsciously—a trait known as anchoring.

- One final approach with which I have much sympathy is best represented by Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital. As he succinctly puts it, “You can’t predict, you can prepare.” Marks shares my scepticism towards the use of forecasts. In a memo written to Oaktree ’s clients in November 2001 he wrote: There are a few things I dismiss and a few I believe in thoroughly. The former include economic forecasts, which I think don’t add value, and the list of the latter starts with cycles and the need to prepare for them. “Hey, ” you might say, “that’s contradictory. The best way to prepare for cycles is to predict them, and you just said it can’t be done.” That ’s absolutely true, but in my opinion by no means debilitating. All of investing consists of dealing with the future . . . and the future is something we can’t know much about. But the limits on our foreknowledge needn ’t doom us to failure as long as we acknowledge them and act accordingly. In my opinion, the key to dealing with the future lies in knowing where you are, even if you can’t know precisely where you ’re going. Knowing where you are in a cycle and what that implies for the future is different from predicting the timing, extent and shape of the cyclical move. This echoes Ben Graham’s words that you don’t need to know a person’s exact weight to know whether they are overweight or underweight. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=839))
- So, when trying to overcome this behavioral pitfall, remember what Keynes said, “I’d prefer to be approximately right rather than precisely wrong.” ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=855))
- WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING, WE SEEM TO BE ADDICTED TO INFORMATION. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=860))
- As Daniel J. Boorstin opined, “The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge.” ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=862))
- Sadly, as more and more information was made available, two things happened. First, accuracy flat-lined. The bookmakers were as accurate when they had five pieces of information as when they had 40 items to help them. So much for more information helping people make better ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=874))
- decisions. Secondly, the degree of confidence expressed in the forecast increased massively with information. With five pieces of information the bookmakers were around 17 percent confident; by the time they had 40 items of information, confidence had exploded up to more than 30 percent (without any improvement in accuracy, remember!). So ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=875))
- all the extra information wasn ’t making the bookmakers any more accurate, but it was making them increasingly overconfident. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=878))
- A similar outcome was found among financial analysts.28 The task they were given was to forecast fourth-quarter earnings in 45 cases. In fact, there were 15 firms, but each firm was presented in one of three different information formats. The information formats were: 1. Baseline data consisting of the past three quarters of EPS, net sales, and stock ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=904))
- price. 2. Baseline data plus redundant or irrelevant information, that is, information that was already embodied in the baseline data such as the PE ratio. 3. Baseline data plus nonredundant information that should have improved forecasting ability, such as the fact that the dividend was increased. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=907))
- None of the participants realized that they had all seen the same company in three different formats, perhaps because each presentation was separated by at least seven other profiles. Each respondent was not only asked for his or her forecast but also for their confidence in their forecast. Both redundant and nonredundant information significantly ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=911))
- increased the forecast error. However, guess what? The self-reported confidence ratings for each of the forecasts increased massively with the amount of information that was available. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=914))
- patients—what can investors learn from all of this? Simple: It is far better to focus on what really ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=966))
- matters, rather than succumbing to the siren call of Wall Street’s many noise peddlers. We would be far better off analyzing the five things we really need to know about an investment, rather than trying to know absolutely everything about everything concerned with the investment. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=966))
- Larry Summers provides us with the outside view. He co-authored a paper32 in 1989 that explored the 50 largest moves in the U.S. stock market between 1947 and 1987. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1022))
    - Note: LARRY SUMMERS PAPER
- To put it another way, more than half of the largest moves in markets are totally unrelated to anything that might be classed as fundamentals. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1027))
- This behavioral pitfall of looking for confirming rather than disconfirming evidence is in direct violation of the principles outlined by Karl Popper, the philosopher of science. He argued that the only way to test a hypothesis was to look for all the information that disagreed with it—a process known as falsification. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1068))
- So, what can we do to defend our finances against this insidious tendency to look for the information that agrees with us? The obvious answer is that we need to learn to look for evidence that would prove our own analysis wrong. Robert Williamson, one of the many successful offspring from Julian Robertson’s Tiger and co-manager of Williamson McAree Investment Partners, affirms, “Julian Robertson was always adamant about seeking out the opposite point of view and then being completely honest with yourself in deciding whether your analysis overrides that. That’s something we try to practice every day.” ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1125))
- I should also point out that it appears that people are particularly bad at spotting regime changes. Researchers 37 have shown that in a series of experiments using urns like in the question above, people tend to underreact in unstable environments with precise signals (turning points), but overreact to stable environments with noisy signals (trending markets). This helps explain why economists and analysts tend to miss turning points in the market. They get hung up on the stable environment and overreact to it; hence they miss the important things that happen when the environment becomes more unstable (a recession starts) and underreact to such developments. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1235))
- Earlier I talked about the way in which one of my former team had analyzed our asset allocation decisions. Rather than hanging onto our views, what we should have done is give ourselves a blank sheet of paper, imagine our positions were zero, and say to ourselves “Given what we now know, would we open a fresh long or new short?” If the answer is yes and it corresponds to a position, then fine. However, if the answer is no, but the position is still running, then it should be closed out. ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1261))

- We should all be encouraged to revisit our investment cases and approach them with a blank slate. Are they built on bad assumptions (i.e., continued margin expansion)? Do we still believe them to be true? Or did we miss something? If it is the latter, perhaps an analyst amnesty, with no recriminations for changing recommendations, might help remove the conservatism bias. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1264))
- The market never failed to overpay for the long-term realized successes of the growth companies, even though the market chose which companies deserved the premium multiples with remarkable accuracy. . . . Nearly half of the price-implied relative growth expectations of the growth and value stocks failed to materialize, so investors were paying twice the fair premium for growth stocks relative to value.

- Focusing on the cold hard facts (soundly based in real numbers) is likely to be our best defense against the siren song of stories. ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1399))
- Put bluntly, we simply don’t expect to see what we are not looking for. The classic experiment in this field47 shows a short video clip of two teams playing basketball. One team is dressed in white, the other dressed in black. You are asked to count how many times the team in white passed the basketball between themselves. Now half way through this clip a man in a gorilla suit walks on and beats his chest and then walks off. At the end of the clip, you are asked how many passes there were, and the normal range of answers is somewhere between 14 and 17. You are then asked if you saw anything unusual. About 60 percent of people fail to spot the gorilla! When the researcher points out the gorilla, and re- runs the tape, people always say you switched the clip, and the gorilla wasn’t there in the first version. Basically, this study demonstrates that people get too caught up in the detail of trying to count the ([Location 1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1462))
- passes. I suspect that something similar happens in finance; investors get caught up in all the details and the noise, and forget to keep an eye on the big picture. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1468))
- “If something can’t go on forever, it won’t.” ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1472))
- “The market may remain irrational, longer than you can remain solvent. ” ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1532))
- Investors should remember bubbles are a by-product of human behavior, and human behavior is all too predictable. The details of each bubble are subtly different, but the general patterns remain eerily similar. As such, bubbles and their bursts are clearly not black swans. Of course, the timing of the ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1545))
- eventual bursting of the bubble remains as uncertain as ever, but the patterns of the events themselves are all too predictable. As Jean Marie Eveillard observed, “Sometimes, what matters is not so much how low the odds are that circumstances would turn negative, what matters more is what the consequences would be if that happens.” In other words, sometimes the ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1547))
- potentially long term negative outcomes are so severe that investors simply can’t afford to ignore them, even in the short term. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1549))
- John Kenneth Galbraith, an unusually insightful economist, said the markets are characterized by: . . . extreme brevity of the financial memory. In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten. In further consequence, when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again, sometimes in a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and larger economic world. There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1559))

- Sadly, few of us are as introspective as Einhorn. So to combat the pervasive problem of self-attribution we really need to keep a written record of the decisions we take and the reasons behind those decisions—an investment diary, if you will. Keeping an investment diary may sound daft, but George Soros did exactly that. In his Alchemy of Finance he writes “I kept a diary in which I recorded the thoughts that went into my investment decisions on a real-time basis. . . .

- from it), or was I wrong for the right reason? (After all, bad luck does occur and price volatility dwarfs fundamental volatility in our world.) Only by cross- referencing our decisions and the reasons for those decisions with the outcomes, can we hope to understand when we are lucky and when we have used genuine skill, and more importantly, where we are making persistent recurrent mistakes.

- At a one -year time horizon, the vast majority of your total return comes from changes in valuation—which are effectively random fluctuations in price. However, at a five-year time horizon, 80 percent of your total return is generated by the price you pay for the investment plus the growth in the underlying cash flow. These are the aspects of investment that fundamental investors ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1644))

- Sadly, as Keynes appositely observed, “Human nature desires quick results, there is a peculiar zest in making money quickly . . . compared with their predecessors, modern investors concentrate too much on annual, quarterly and even monthly valuations of what they hold, and on capital appreciation.” Regrettably, the quarters and months that Keynes alluded to have become days and minutes for some investors today.

- every pitch and forego batting selectivity for frequency.” As such, he urges money managers to act almost like a couch potato; ultimately you only want to put things to work when you see very good opportunities, and you should have the patience to sit on it.

- Fortunately, although painful, a strategy of being contrarian is integral to successful investment. As Sir John Templeton put it, “It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority,” or as Keynes pointed out “The central principle of investment is to go contrary to the general opinion on the grounds ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003GY0K6Q&location=1798))

This is the wolf in sheep’s clothing that allows for one-time success but almost always cripples any chance of sustained success—the player hitting on 17 and getting a four.
