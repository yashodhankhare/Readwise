## Highlights
- There is protection only in a clear perception of the characteristics common to these flights into what must conservatively be described as mass insanity. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=116))

- For built into this situation is the eventual and inevitable fall. Built in also is the circumstance that it cannot come gently or gradually. When it comes, it bears the grim face of disaster. That is because both of the groups of participants in the speculative situation are programmed for sudden efforts at ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=131))

- Those who had been riding the upward wave decide now is the time to get out. Those who thought the increase would be forever find their illusion destroyed abruptly, and they, also, respond to the newly revealed reality by selling or trying to sell. Thus the collapse. And thus the rule, supported by the experience of centuries: the speculative episode ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=134))

- So much, as I’ve said, is clear. Less understood is the mass psychology of the speculative mood. When it is fully comprehended, it allows those so favored to save themselves from disaster. Given the pressure of this crowd psychology, however, the saved will be the exception to a very broad and binding rule. They will be required to ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=137))

- resist two compelling forces: one, the powerful personal interest that develops in the euphoric belief, and the other, the pressure of public and seemingly superior financial opinion that is brought to bear on behalf of such belief. Both stand as proof of Schiller’s dictum that the crowd converts the individual from reasonably good sense to the stupidity against which, as he also said, “the very Gods Themselves contend in vain.” Although only a few ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=139))

- observers have noted the vested interest in error that accompanies speculative euphoria, it is, nonetheless, an extremely plausible phenomenon. Those involved with the speculation are experiencing an increase in wealth—getting rich or being further enriched. No one wishes to believe that this is fortuitous or undeserved; all wish to think that it is the result of their own superior insight or intuition. The very increase in values thus captures the thoughts ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=143))

    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- This is particularly true of the first group noted above—those who are convinced that values are going up permanently and indefinitely. But the errors of vanity of those who think they will beat the speculative game are also thus reinforced.

- Before going on to look at the great speculations of the past, I would like further to identify the forces that initiate, sustain, and otherwise characterize the speculative episode and which, when they recur, always evoke surprise, wonder, and enthusiasm anew.

The larger the capital assets and income flow controlled, the deeper the presumed financial, economic, and social perception.

- Only after the speculative collapse does the truth emerge. What was thought to be unusual acuity turns out to be only a fortuitous and unfortunate association with the assets. Over the long years of history, the result for those who have been thus misjudged (including, invariably, by themselves) has been opprobrium followed by personal disgrace or a retreat into the deeper folds of obscurity. Or it has been exile, suicide, or, in modern times, at least moderately uncomfortable confinement.

Nothing is more remarkable than this: in the aftermath of speculation, the reality will be all but ignored. There are two ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=287))

- reasons for this. In the first place, many people and institutions have been involved, and whereas it is acceptable to attribute error, gullibility, and excess to a single individual or even to a particular corporation, it is not deemed fitting to attribute them to a whole community, and certainly not to the whole financial community. Widespread naiveté, even stupidity, is manifest; mention of this, however, runs drastically counter to the earlier-noted ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=291))

- The second reason that the speculative mood and mania are exempted from blame is theological.

- internal dynamic of error. This is the classical faith. So there is a need to find some cause for the crash, however farfetched, that is external to the market itself. Or some abuse of the market that has inhibited its normal performance. Again, this is no matter of idle theory; there are very practical consequences, and these, as we shall see, are especially evident and important in our own time.

Thus impressed, it becomes bemused by the two further influences operating ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=788))

The first, as sufficiently noted, is the ease with which any individual, on becoming affluent, attributes his good fortune to his own superior acumen. And there is the companion tendency of the many who live in more modest circumstances to presume an exceptional mental aptitude in those who, however evanescently, are identified with wealth. Only in the financial world is there such an efficient design for concealing what, with the passage of time, will be revealed as self- and general delusion. There are, however, exceptions to any rule. While the 20-year cycle from illusion to disillusion and back to illusion had a superb regularity in the United States in the last century, some of the more violent episodes of irrationality—those of John Law, the South ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=791))

- Sea Bubble, and the crash of 1929 being examples—did remain more vividly in the financial as well as the general public memory. The result was a somewhat longer period of doubt, caution, and comparative sanity. The crash of 1929 ushered in the dismal years of the Great Depression, for which, indeed, the stock-market debacle should rightly be held sharply responsible. In the weeks that immediately followed, demand for a wide range of consumers’ goods weakened, business confidence was shaken, and, as a direct manifestation, business investment fell and business failures rose. Economists, as I have noted, then as later sought to exculpate the market, holding deeper factors, including now insufficiently relaxed Federal Reserve policy, responsible for the business decline. This was evasion bordering on nonsense. In fact, the market crash broke into an exceptionally fragile financial, banking, and general economic structure. There can be no plausible doubt that it had a substantial and ultimately devastating economic effect. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=797))

- The only remedy, in fact, is an enhanced skepticism that would resolutely associate too evident optimism with probable foolishness and that would not associate intelligence with the acquisition, the deployment, or, for that matter, the administration of large sums of money. Let the following be one of the unfailing rules by which the individual investor and, needless to say, the pension and other institutional-fund manager are guided: there is the possibility, even the likelihood, of self-approving and extravagantly error-prone behavior on the part of those closely associated with money. Let that also be the continuing lesson of this essay. A further rule is that when a mood of excitement pervades a market or surrounds an investment prospect, when there is a claim of unique opportunity based on special foresight, all sensible people should circle the wagons; it is the ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AFYCI1U&location=958))
