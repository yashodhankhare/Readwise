## Highlights
- Fuller was renowned for his avowed optimism that technology could “make the world work” for everyone by lifting entire nations out of poverty. His message centered on the figure of a generalist known as the comprehensive designer, “an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist, and evolutionary strategist” capable of grasping whole systems. In an era that was skeptical of politics, his argument for a radical science of design, which emphasized universal housing and the efficient use of resources, offered a seemingly plausible program for achieving change outside conventional institutions. To an ambitious individualist like Jobs, it was a model of what was possible, and no one embodied it like Fuller, who had been inescapable in the Bay Area of the seventies. Fuller had been given a crucial push by the Whole Earth Catalog, an oversized guide to books and tools for the counterculture that Jobs, who avidly read it in college with Kottke, described as “one of the bibles of my generation.” Copies were kept in the Apple lobby, and its first edition, published in 1968, opened with a spread devoted to the man whom editor Stewart Brand credited as its inspiration: “The insights of Buckminster Fuller are what initiated this catalog.” At the heart of the Catalog, which Jobs once called “Google in paperback form,” was Fuller’s determination to change the environment rather than human beings. “That definitely comes directly from Fuller,” Brand noted decades later. “Fuller said that a lot: that changing human nature is hard, and when you try, you mostly fail, and it’s discouraging. Changing tools and technology is relatively easy.” This perspective was warmly received in Silicon Valley, which Brand thought was why the microcomputer revolution happened at that specific time and place: “The stuff ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=83))

- Fuller died a month later, a half year before the release of the Macintosh, but his legacy at Apple endured. On September 28, 1997, a television commercial debuted during the network premiere of the animated film Toy Story. Steve Jobs had recently returned in triumph to Apple, and over a montage of luminaries—from Martin Luther King Jr. to Pablo Picasso—the actor Richard Dreyfuss offered a declaration of principles: “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.” ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=155))

- One of the seventeen icons was Buckminster Fuller, who had been featured at the request of Jobs himself. Fuller had crossed paths with many of the other personalities in the commercial, including Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, Martha Graham, and Frank Lloyd Wright, and he appeared after John Lennon and Yoko Ono and before Thomas Edison—a suitable place for a man who had been revered by both the counterculture and the establishment. The “Think Different” campaign was meant to sell computers, but it also spoke to an authentic vision personified by Fuller, who thought differently—for better or worse—than just about anyone else. “You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them,” Dreyfuss concluded. “About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=159))

- In the last decades of his life, Fuller appeared on the cover of Time, lectured around the globe, and collected honorary degrees and awards that culminated in the Presidential Medal of Freedom. At Disney World, the iconic Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center was named for his most celebrated metaphor, and after his death, Fuller received an even greater accolade in a newly identified type of carbon with striking affinities to a geodesic sphere. His ideas had provided crucial insights to the scientists responsible for its discovery, who called it buckminsterfullerene, or the buckyball.

- His most enduring idea was the concept of “ephemeralization.” At first, it simply meant doing more with less, but Fuller took it infinitely further. Just as compression yielded to tension, the physical would give way to the visual, which would be replaced in turn by total abstraction. When asked what would come after the dome, Fuller replied, “Nothing—an electromagnetic field.” This sequence paralleled the stages in his career, which started with concrete and ended with geometry, and its final phase sounded like a paradox: “Ephemeralization trends toward an ultimate doing of everything with nothing at all.” More recently, the venture capitalist Paul Graham defined it as “the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced by what we would now call software,” noting that phones and tablets “have effectively drilled a hole that will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.” The same trend can be seen in cloud computing, the invention of the blockchain, and the inexorable ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=217))

- integration of technology into everyday life. Before they became part of our collective future, Fuller independently arrived at the principles of online education, remote working, and universal access to data, which he developed without any computers at all. On a more pragmatic level, Fuller used ephemeralization to sustain his virtual company, which he ran for years as a perpetual start-up. He made most of his money from lecturing, and, as the original digital nomad, he minimized his physical needs. The chord factors for an undergraduate dome project could fit on a page in his wallet, and he was capable of lecturing extemporaneously for hours using slides and a suitcase of visual aids. His models often drew on a principle that he called tensegrity, based on lightweight sculptures where the solid parts never touched, which Fuller utilized to further reduce the bulk of his mobile operation. As his geometry grew into a product division in itself, he often depended on words and images alone. Fuller was notorious for talking past his scheduled time, speaking in his New England accent at seven thousand words per hour, and his lectures were compared to a geodesic dome—or, more precisely, a tensegrity sphere—that made sense only after the last piece was in place. As the Swiss designer Yves Béhar has pointed out, Fuller was among the first to realize that a reputation for visionary architecture could be achieved without any tangible artifacts whatsoever: “We owe the notion of architect as statement maker to Buckminster Fuller—the idea of creating photographically accurate renderings of an architectural intervention at a gigantic scale.” Ephemeralization was also the engine of his program for change. Fuller paired technological innovations, including automation, with a universal basic income, which would distribute the benefits of efficiency to all mankind. He observed that progress tended to occur as a by-product of war, or “emergence through emergency,” which he aimed to replace with a peaceful design-science revolution. Unlike a government or company, a single person could work on something that might not be needed for fifty years: “The individual can simply start to think.” ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=225))

- To make it possible, he found himself living permanently in the world of tomorrow, until the vision that he used to advance his goals became an end in itself. Fuller has been voted the most influential futurist of all time, but he wanted his ideas to be realized, even if it took a half century, which allowed him to insist that he was right on schedule.

- Above all else, Fuller needed the young. In the sixties, he saw the hippies as an extension of his research team, but his skepticism toward politics—he described the civil rights movement as “Blacks skillfully persuaded into activism”—led him to recommend design solutions instead: “I tell students to stop using their feet and start using their heads.” This conveniently overlooked how technology could reinforce existing systems of oppression, and while inventions could undoubtedly change the world, the consequences were hard to plan in advance.

- As a result, despite the dozens of books about Fuller, many of which are riddled with errors, he has never been the subject of a comprehensive biography that covered his full career using the best available sources. Given the vast claims that have been made for his ideas, he deserves the exhaustive, respectful, but unsentimental treatment accorded to any prominent figure of the twentieth century, which is an indispensable part of the case for his importance. Fuller’s archives reveal aspects of his personality that his fans never saw, while the surviving witnesses can testify firsthand to his strengths, flaws, and contradictions. Until now, the lack of an authoritative survey has only made it harder to take him seriously. All the pieces need to be in place before the overall shape of his life can be seen, and in the aftermath, he emerges, if anything, as even more prophetic than before. Fuller perceptively diagnosed the world’s unrealized ability to care for all of its population, and he warned that capitalism favored the concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny minority, leading to a succession of crises—from inequality to climate change—that he foresaw a generation ago. When contextualized properly, the tools that he provided are as essential as ever. Fuller emphasized whole systems, interdisciplinary thinking, and intuition, and his fascination with structure, which was driven by his need ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=292))

- Part One Origins 1895–1927 It is one of the strange facts of experience that when we try to think into the future, our thoughts jump backward. It may well be that nature has some fundamental metaphysical law by which opening up what we call the future also opens up the past in equal degree. —BUCKMINSTER FULLER, SYNERGETICS ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=315))

- Towards a New Architecture advised the serious architect to seek “the majesty of solutions which spring from a problem that has been clearly stated.” Fuller adopted this as a guiding principle, and he often paraphrased it without attribution: “A problem adequately stated is a problem solved.” ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=1645))

- After the final bracket, the name that remained was Dymaxion. This word, which would follow Fuller throughout his life, was later described as a combination of dynamism, maximum, and, implausibly, ion. It was more credibly derived from his notion of “the dynamically balanced home,” and he loved it: “It seemed at first mouthing a bit uncomfortable but has improved constantly with use.” After Fuller was granted the rights, it became his personal brand, which he defined retroactively as the most efficient use of available technology.

- His lectures at Marshall Field’s were equally formative. On April 6, 1929, he took up residence in the Interior Decorating galleries on the ninth floor to speak six times a day for the next two weeks. It was Fuller’s first extended attempt at a lifelong performance that he learned to adapt to different audiences. At the store, he emphasized that his ideas would cut housework to just fifteen minutes a day, and he claimed that the architects Howard Fisher and George Fred Keck had been inspired by his presentation to start housing projects of their own. Another attendee, the Polish-American philosopher Alfred Korzybski, struck the model with his cane and asked, “What’s this?” As the founder of the arcane cognitive discipline known as general semantics, Korzybski identified a principle that he called “time binding,” which allowed humans to build on the discoveries of previous generations, and said that it demanded a language that was structured to precisely reflect the events that it described. Korzybski extended Fuller an invitation to a lecture that he was giving at the University of Chicago, and the pair met on several other occasions.

- By 1931 two distinct themes had emerged in the coverage of Fuller’s ideas. One was exemplified by the magazine The Nation, which listed him on its honor roll for “developing the potentialities of mass production, new materials and new engineering principles for housing that is practical, cheap and of good design.” The other was typified by a caption that had appeared more than a year earlier in the New York Daily News, under a photo of Fuller alongside his model of the Dymaxion House, “which he predicts will be all the rage in the twenty-first century.” ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09KRX8NDM&location=1977))
