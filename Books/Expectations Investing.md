## Highlights
- Assets producing cash flows will ultimately return the owner’s investment without depending on the whims of other investors. Even if those cash flows are some distance in the future, their prospects endow them with a present value. Financial markets are nothing more than arenas where investors who need cash today can obtain it by selling the present value of future cash flows to other investors willing to wait for the cash payoffs from their capital. The payment medium in this transaction is money. The crucial point: If you invest without expecting future cash flows, then you might as well collect art or play the slot machines. The tension in this book demands our attention. It focuses on future cash flows, but we never know for certain what the future holds. We cannot even count on the cash flows from U.S. Treasury obligations—perhaps less uncertain than other cash flows, but uncertain nevertheless. The fundamental law of investing is the uncertainty of the future. How, then, can a rational investor derive the value of a future stream of cash, even a contractual one such as promised in a debt instrument? Rappaport and Mauboussin walk their way around this question by telling their readers not to answer it. I kid you not. Instead, the authors advise readers to let other investors answer the question! And their answers come through, loud and clear, in the prices paid for financial assets in the capital markets. As Rappaport and Mauboussin remind us repeatedly, stock prices (and bond prices, too) are a gift from the market, a gift of information about how other investors with money on the line are estimating the value of future cash flows. If the market’s generosity in providing key information were the whole story, then the authors would have written a pamphlet instead of a plump volume. But the market price is only the beginning, not the end. Investors still have hard work to do. We may be able to glean what other investors expect, but we should not accept those expectations without qualification. We must test the beliefs of the market, and here Rappaport and Mauboussin are at their best. They set forth a systematic testing process to guide the investor toward a reasoned judgment about both the company involved and the market’s expectations, ultimately to determine whether to buy, sell, or hold. Long experience in the capital markets reveals few lessons valid for all times; but, in half a century as a professional investor, I have found one particularly robust: The secret of success in maximizing the treasures of instruction in this book is silence. This important piece of advice to investors applies especially to Expectations Investing. You need no ears to carry out the method recommended by Rappaport and Mauboussin. You can easily find everything you need, in print or on the Internet, specifically in market prices that reflect the views of investors willing to put their money where their mouths are, in publicly available corporate financial… ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=115))

- The key to successful investing is to estimate the level of expected performance embedded in the current stock price and then to assess the likelihood of a revision in expectations. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=147))

- Although investors invariably talk about expectations, they’re usually talking about the wrong expectations. The errors fall into two camps. Either investors don’t appreciate the structure of expectations, or they do a poor job of benchmarking expectations. An example of a faulty structure is a near-messianic focus on shortterm earnings. As it turns out, short-term earnings are not very helpful for gauging expectations because they are a poor proxy for how the market values stocks. Yet even the investors who do embrace an appropriate economic model often miss the mark because they fail to benchmark their expectations against those of the market. Without knowing where expectations are today, it is hard to know where they are likely to go tomorrow. The central theme of this book is that the ability to properly read market expectations and anticipate revisions of these expectations is the springboard for superior returns—long-term returns above an appropriate benchmark. Stock prices express the collective expectations of investors, and changes in these expectations determine your investment success. Seen in this light, stock prices are gifts of information—expectations—waiting for you to unwrap and use. If you’ve got a fix on current expectations, then you can figure out where they are likely to go. Like the great hockey player Wayne Gretzky, you can learn to “skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.”1 That’s expectations investing.

- Why do institutional investors underperform passive benchmarks? Does active management really pay? If so, then what approach offers the best chance of superior returns? Before we address these questions, here’s the bottom line: The disappointing performance of professionally managed funds is not an indictment of active management; rather, it reflects the suboptimal strategies that active pros use. Expectations investing offers the best available process to achieve superior returns. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=263))

- Does expectations investing offer insightful, dedicated investors a reasonable probability of achieving superior returns? We think so. In 1976, Jack Treynor distinguished “between ideas whose implications are obvious” and those “that require reflection, judgment, and special expertise for their evaluation.” The latter ideas, he argued, are “the only meaningful basis for long-term investing.”8 When companies announce earnings surprises, mergers and acquisitions, a new drug, or a government antitrust action, the long-term valuation implications are rarely obvious. Investors quickly assess the effects, favorable or unfavorable, on current price, and they trade accordingly. Not surprisingly, trading volume typically increases after these announcements. Volatile stock prices and increased trading volume affirm ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=302))

- that investors quickly respond to such information. But what distinguishes the winners from the losers is not how quickly they respond, but how well they interpret the information. Different investors interpret the same information differently, and some interpretations are much better than others. In other words, stock prices quickly reflect revised but perhaps misguided expectations; therefore, to succeed, investors must first skillfully read expectations and then use the best available tools to decide whether and how today’s expectations will change. Welcome to expectations investing. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=309))

- But three pervasive misconceptions in the investment community deserve special mention: 1. The market is short-term. 2. Earnings per share (EPS) dictate value. 3. Price-earnings multiples determine value. These fallacies lead investors to chase the wrong expectations, frequently resulting in poor performance. Let’s examine each.

- The only investors who earn superior returns are those who correctly anticipate changes in a company’s competitive position (and the resulting cash flows) that the current stock price does not reflect. Finally, commentators frequently point to short (and shortening) investor holding periods to support their belief that the market is shortterm. John Bogle notes that the average holding period for funds has plummeted from about seven years in the mid-1960s to just over a year by 2000.11 How can investors who hold stock for months, or days, care about a company’s long-term outlook? This conundrum has a simple solution: Investor holding periods differ from the market’s investment time horizon. To understand the horizon, you must look at stock prices, not investor holding periods. Studies confirm that you must extend expected cash flows over many years to justify stock prices. Investors make short-term bets on long-term outcomes. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=360))

- The shortcomings of earnings include the following: • Earnings exclude a charge for the cost of capital. • Earnings exclude the incremental investments in working capital and fixed capital needed to support a company’s growth.

- In a discounted cash-flow model, value increases only when the company earns a rate of return on new investments that exceeds the cost of capital. However, a company can grow earnings without investing at or above the cost of capital. (See the appendix at the end of this chapter for a detailed example.) Consequently, higher earnings do not always translate into higher value. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=387))

- An analysis of cash flow as a percentage of net income for the thirty Dow Jones Industrial Average companies shows a similar result: Cash flow was about 80 percent of earnings for the group, and earnings exceeded cash flow for twenty-three of the thirty companies.13 Finally, companies can use a wide range of permissible methods to determine earnings. How accountants record a business event does not alter the event or its impact on shareholder value. Enlightened accountants readily acknowledge that neither they nor their conventions have a comparative advantage in valuing a business. The role of corporate financial reporting is to provide useful information for estimating value. Two fundamental steps—revenue recognition and matching expenses with revenue—determine earnings. A company recognizes revenue when it delivers products or services and can reasonably establish the amount that it will collect from customers. It then expenses the costs needed to generate that revenue during the period in which it recognizes the revenue. In other words, it matches expenses with revenues. This matching principle is easy to grasp in concept but hopelessly arbitrary in implementation. Accounting standards give companies latitude in revenue recognition, depreciation methods, and inventory accounting, to name a few. Multibillion-dollar restructuring charges create “cookie jar” reserves that companies can use to fuel future, illusory earnings. Finally, earnings exclude ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=394))

- Companies have two levers in this game. They can manage expectations, manage earnings, or do both. To manage expectations, they guide analysts to an earnings number that the company can beat. And to beat expectations easily, companies often downplay their near-term prospects. If a company can’t meet or beat expectations, then it can either manage expectations downward or manage earnings. Flexible accounting conventions often allow managers to avoid unfavorable earnings surprises even amid an unexpected slowdown in business.

- consequences. First, it induces security analysts to fixate on quarterly earnings estimates at the expense of independent analysis. This fixation reduces the value of Wall Street research. Second, it causes managers to mislead themselves in a misguided attempt to please investors. The smooth progression of reported earnings can mask fundamental business problems that require urgent managerial attention. Left unattended, these problems inevitably lead to downward revisions of market expectations. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=424))

- BELIEF: Price-Earnings Multiples Determine Value REALITY: Price-Earnings Multiples Are a Function of Value The investment community’s favorite valuation metric is the priceearnings (P/E) multiple. A measure of what investors will pay for a stock, the multiple equals the stock price (P) divided by a company’s earnings (E).16 Investors incorporate it in a deceptively simple valuation formula: Shareholder value per share = (Earnings per share) × (P/E) ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=428))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Since an estimate of earnings per share (EPS) is available, investors must decide only on the appropriate multiple to determine a stock’s value, then compare the result to the stock’s current price and determine whether it is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued. The calculation is easy, but the results will surely disappoint. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=433))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Look at the formula closely. Since we know last year’s EPS or next year’s consensus EPS estimate, we need only to estimate the appropriate P/E. But since we have the denominator (earnings, or E), the only unknown is the appropriate share price, or P. We are therefore left with a useless tautology: To estimate value, we require an estimate of value. This flawed logic underscores the fundamental point: The price-earnings multiple does not determine value; rather, it derives from value. Price-earnings analysis is not an analytic shortcut. It is an economic cul-de-sac. ESSENTIAL IDEAS • Investors who can read the market’s expectations and anticipate changes in those expectations will more likely generate superior investment returns. • The expectations investing approach harnesses the powerful discounted cash-flow model but starts with price and then solves for expectations. • Investors who play the earnings expectations game are in a losing game because short-term earnings do not reflect how the market prices stocks.

- EGI’s shareholder value is now $82.5 million ($9.9 million divided by 12 percent) minus the $7.5 million investment, or $75 million ($82.5 –$7.5 = $75). Note that despite 10 percent earnings growth, shareholder value remains the same because the $7.5 million investment increases annual after-tax cash flow by $900,000 which, when discounted at 12 percent, is worth exactly $7.5 million. So when the present value of incremental cash inflow is identical to the present value of the cash outflow (investment), shareholder value doesn’t change.

- Stock prices relate tenuously to earnings growth. Instead, changes in expectations about future cash flows drive changes in shareholder value and stock price. So reported earnings growth, even when accompanied by increases in shareholder value, can trigger reduced investor expectations and a fall in the stock price.

- With traditional discounted cash-flow analysis, you forecast cash flows to estimate a stock’s value. Expectations investing reverses the process. It starts with a rich, underutilized source of information—the stock price—and determines the cash-flow expectations that justify that price. Those expectations, in turn, serve as the benchmark for buy, sell, or hold decisions. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=489))

- Should you use book (balance-sheet) value or market value to calculate weights for target capital structure?

- that the market expects a company to generate returns on incremental investment that exceed its cost of capital. According to market-validated economic theory, companies that generate excess returns attract competition that eventually drives industry returns toward the cost of capital. Analysts typically choose a forecast period that is too short when they perform discounted cash-flow valuations. If you believe that a forecast beyond two or three years smacks of sheer speculation, then you’re missing the point. Market prices do reflect long-term cash-flow expectations. In fact, prices in the stock market suggest a marketimplied forecast period of between ten and fifteen years. Of course, market-implied forecast periods for various industries can differ: In early 2001, for example, the market-implied forecast period for the personal computer hardware industry was shorter than ten years, whereas the period for the pharmaceutical industry exceeded twenty years. Furthermore, implied forecast periods for companies cluster within an industry, although these periods can change over time. In chapter 5, we will show precisely how to estimate the market-implied forecast period. The key thing to remember is that the stock market takes a long-term view.

- Investors and corporate managers widely accept that the stock price reflects expectations for a company’s future financial performance. However, investors devote scant attention to the idea that the stock price itself can affect that performance. An important feedback mechanism materializes when stock prices affect business fundamentals, which is important to consider in expectations investing—particularly for young, high-technology companies, which depend heavily on a healthy stock price.17 George Soros calls this dynamic feedback loop reflexivity. He sums it up this way: “Stock prices are not merely passive reflections; they are active ingredients in the process in which both stock prices and the fortunes of companies whose stocks are traded are determined.”18 We now consider the impact of reflexivity for start-ups in two critical activities—the ability to finance growth and the ability to attract and retain key employees.

- In neither case do the earnings per share affect the shareholder-value-added potential of the merger. So how do acquirers create value in mergers and acquisitions, if not by adding to earnings per share? They do so by investing at a rate of return greater than the cost of capital. To determine how much shareholder value the acquiring company will generate, estimate the present value of acquisition benefits or synergies and subtract the acquisition premium. The premium is the amount in excess of the seller’s stand-alone value that the acquirer offers to pay. This formula is simple, but generating synergies is not.

- So what should you do when a company announces a share-buyback program? First, you must decide whether management is providing a credible signal that the market should revise its expectations. Just as expectations investors find reasons to revise their expectations, so too do corporate managers. If management sends a credible signal that investors need to revise their expectations, then you need to revisit the expectations investing process (chapters 5–7). A positive signal conveys management’s conviction that expectations about consensus value drivers are too low.

- When is a buyback program a negative signal? It is a negative sign in at least two cases. The first is when a buyback indicates that management has run out of value-creating projects. When a company would rather return cash to its shareholders than invest in its business, you can infer that the market’s expectations for the company’s value-creating opportunities are too high. The second case is when management repurchases stock to achieve announced earnings-per-share targets. In other words, since the company’s operational performance is coming up short, it turns to financial engineering to achieve its objectives.

- The golden rule also has two noteworthy corollaries: • The rate of return from a buyback depends on how much the market is undervaluing the stock. If a company’s shares trade below its expected value and exiting shareholders are willing to sell at that price, then continuing shareholders will earn a return in excess of the cost of equity. The greater the undervaluation, the higher the return to continuing shareholders.4 The shareholder rate of return— the return that continuing shareholders can expect— equals the cost of equity capital divided by the ratio of stock price to expected value.5 For example, say that a company has a 10 percent cost of equity and is trading at 80 percent of expected value. Dividing 10 percent by 80 percent gives a 12.5 percent rate of return for the continuing shareholders. Managers and investors can compare this return with alternative investments and rank its relative attractiveness. This formula also shows that buybacks above expected value generate returns below the cost of equity. • A buyback can be more attractive than an investment in the business. Shareholder-value-oriented management teams understand that they should fund all investments that promise to create value. But what if a company has no excess cash or borrowing capacity and, to finance a prospective share buyback, must partially or wholly forgo value-creating investments in the business? A company should consider a share buyback only when its expected return is greater than the expected return from investing in the business.6 ([Location 3145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=3145))

- We now have a way to assess management’s share-buyback decision. But even if management has all the right intentions, we must judge whether it has based its decisions on a proper understanding of the market’s expectations. Beware, too, of management overconfidence. Managers almost always believe that the shares of their company are undervalued, and they rarely have a full understanding of the expectations embedded in their stock.7 History is littered with companies that bought back “undervalued” shares only to see business prospects deteriorate and their stocks plummet.

- Likewise, companies often announce buybacks, but they do not always follow through. In fact, companies fail to complete about 25 percent of authorized open-market buyback programs within three years of the announcement.8 Just as voters are wary of the politician’s pledge, investors realize that an announced program is not the same as a completed program. Another reason that the buyback signal is weaker relates to the three methods that companies use to buy back their shares: • O pen-market purchases. In this buyback method, the most widely used by far, companies simply repurchase their own shares in the open market, as any other investor would. Although open-market purchases have legal restrictions—such as a limit to the daily volume that a company can purchase—this method offers the company the greatest degree of flexibility. On the other hand, open-market purchases convey the weakest signal of management conviction, particularly when these purchases merely offset the dilution from employee stock options. • Dutch auction. In a Dutch auction, management defines the number of shares it intends to buy, an expiration date, and a price range (generally a premium to the market) within which it is willing to buy. Shareholders may tender their shares at any price within the range. Starting at the bottom of the range, the company sums the cumulative number of shares necessary to fulfill the program. All tendering shareholders at or below the “clearing price” receive the clearing price for their stock. Dutch auctions are generally strong signals, and management can execute them relatively efficiently.9 • Fixed-price tender offers. With this buyback method, management offers to repurchase a set number of shares at a fixed price through an expiration date. The price is often a significant premium to the market price, and companies generally tender for a sizable percentage of the shares outstanding. Shareholders may or may not elect to tender their shares. Fixed-price tenders, especially debt-financed ones, tend to be powerful, positive signals to the market.10 Open-market purchases emit the weakest signal, whereas Dutch auctions and fixed-price tenders tend to convey decidedly stronger signals.

- Whether a buyback program increases or decreases earnings per share is a function of the price/earnings (P/E) multiple and either (1) the company’s forgone after-tax interest income or (2) the after-tax cost of new debt used to finance the buyback. More specifically, when the inverse of the price-earnings multiple [1/(P/E) = E/P] is lower than the after-tax interest rate, a buyback adds to earnings per share. When E/P is greater than the after-tax interest rate, a buyback reduces earnings per share. But we would be wrong to judge the merits of an investment, including a buyback, by its immediate impact on earnings per share.

- The sharp increase in ESO programs has also blunted dividends. Since ESO holders do not typically receive dividends, the value of their options decreases when their companies pay dividends.17 Not surprisingly, managers in options-laden companies have little incentive to pay dividends.

- ESSENTIAL IDEAS • Share buybacks were much more prominent by the year 2000 than they were twenty years before. • Buybacks can be a prime signal that investors need to revise expectations for a company’s value drivers. • You can rely on the following golden rule to measure all buyback announcements: A company should repurchase its shares only when its stock is trading below its expected value and when no better investment opportunities are available. • Companies cite four primary reasons for buying back stock: 1. To signal the market that shares are undervalued 2. To manage earnings per share 3. To return cash to shareholders ([Location 3300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=3300))

- efficiently 4. To increase financial leverage • Investors must critically assess management’s motivation for buying back stock. Managers often serve interests other than those of their continuing shareholders. ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01J0FP7JE&location=3310))

- ESSENTIAL IDEAS • Understanding executive and employee incentive compensation programs is essential to anticipating changes in market expectations. • Standard executive stock options depart from the pay-for-superior-performance ideal because they reward any increase in share price— even when a company lags its competitors or the overall market. • Indexed options appropriately reward executives for superior performance in bull and bear markets alike. • Appropriate pay plans reward operating-unit executives for delivering superior shareholder value added, that is, value above market expectations.
