- This is what thinking is: not the decision itself but what goes into the decision, the consideration, the assessment. It’s testing your own responses and weighing the available evidence; it’s grasping, as best you can and with all available and relevant senses, what is, and it’s also speculating, as carefully and responsibly as you can, about what might be. And it’s knowing when not to go it alone, and whom you should ask for help. The uncertainties that necessarily accompany predicting the future—not only do you not know what will happen but you don’t even know how you’ll feel about what happens, whether you’ll eventually stop noticing that uncomfortable seat or will want to drive the car off a cliff because of it—mean that thinking will always be an art rather than a science. (Science can help, though; science is our friend.) My father had an almost unerring ability to buy bad cars, for a simple reason: He never actually thought about it. He acted always on impulse and instinct, and his impulses and instincts, like mine and yours, weren’t very reliable. But he liked acting impulsively, and I believe he would rather have owned a lousy car than devoted research and planning to the task of purchasing one. (Verily, he had his reward.) But I was always annoyed with him because it seemed obvious to me ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=84))

- that buying a decent automobile isn’t that hard. Yes, no matter what you do, you can end up with a lemon, but with due diligence you dramatically reduce the likelihood of that happening. It’s a matter of observing the percentages and refusing to heed your immediate impulses—a bit like playing poker, in that respect. The problem is, as things-we-think-about go, buying a car is one of the simpler and more straightforward cases. It contains all the key elements, but it’s considerably less complicated than the issues and questions—political, social, religious—that really befuddle us and set us at odds with our fellow residents of this vale of tears. If everything we have to think about were as easy as buying a car, then I’d need only to write a blog post or a few tweets to set us all on the right path. Instead, I’ve had to write this book.

- It is perhaps presumptuous of me to think that I can offer a more hopeful picture than the great Daniel Kahneman, but I truly believe that there are some insufficiently explored ways to understand and ameliorate the problems we have in thinking. We have thought too much in recent years about the science of thinking and not enough about the art. There are certain humanistic traditions, some of them quite ancient, that can come to our aid when we’re trying to think about thinking, and to get better at it. But it would be foolish to neglect what people like Kahneman have studied and learned. In the passage I just quoted, he talks about “intuitive thinking”: this is the “fast” kind. It’s what provides us with snap judgments, instantaneous reads on a given situation, strong predispositions toward approving some ideas and disapproving others. Kahneman calls this System 1, and says that it is supplemented and sometimes corrected by System 2, which is conscious reflection. We go through life basically running System 1; System 2 kicks in only when we perceive a problem, an inconsistency, an anomaly that needs to be addressed. This is why another psychologist who has researched thinking, Jonathan Haidt, uses a different set of terms when he’s describing essentially the same distinction: he thinks of intuitive thinking as an elephant, and conscious decision-making as the rider. The idea is that our intuitive thinking is immensely powerful and has a mind of its own, but can be gently steered—by a rider who is truly skillful and understands the elephant’s inclinations. It’s a hopeful image, and indeed Haidt is more cheerful about the possibility of better thinking than Kahneman is. In this book I will be writing largely about the rider rather than the elephant, System 2 rather than System 1. I will certainly draw a great deal from major scholars like Kahneman and Haidt, and several others, but I will also suggest that they do not always frame our problems with thinking in the most useful and constructive ways. In particular I’m going to argue that we go astray when we think of our task primarily as “overcoming bias.” For me, the fundamental problem we have may best be described as an orientation of the will: we suffer from a settled determination to avoid thinking. Relatively few people want to think. Thinking ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=110))

- troubles us; thinking tires us. Thinking can force us out of familiar, comforting habits; thinking can complicate our lives; thinking can set us at odds, or at least complicate our relationships, with those we admire or love or follow. Who needs thinking? Moreover, conscious thinking is, as Kahneman indicates in his book’s title, slow. Jason Fried, the creator of the popular project-management software Basecamp, tells a story about attending a conference and listening to a talk. He didn’t like the talk; he didn’t agree with the speaker’s point of view; as the talk went on he grew more agitated. When it was over, he rushed up to the speaker to express his disagreement. The speaker listened, and then said: “Give it five minutes.”*2 Fried was taken aback, but then he realized the point, and the point’s value. After the first few moments of the speaker’s lecture, Fried had effectively stopped listening: he had heard something he didn’t agree with and immediately entered Refutation Mode—and in Refutation Mode there is no listening. Moreover, when there is no listening there is no thinking. To enter Refutation Mode is to say, in effect, that you’ve already done all the thinking you need to do, that no further information or reflection is required. Fried was so taken by the speaker’s request, he adopted “Give it five minutes” as a kind of personal watchword. It ought to be one for the rest of us too; but before it can become one, we should probably reflect on the ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=128))

- ways that our informational habits—the means (mostly online means) by which we acquire and pass on and respond to information—strongly discourage us from taking even that much time. No social-media service I know of enforces a waiting period before responding, though Gmail allows you to set a delay in sending emails, a delay during which you can change your mind and “unsend.” However, the maximum delay allowed is thirty seconds. (Twenty-four hours might be more useful.)*3 Does it seem to you that I’m exaggerating the problem? Or just blaming social media? Could be. But as soon as I read Fried’s anecdote I realized that I too am regularly tempted to enter Refutation Mode—and the more passionate I feel about a topic, the more likely I am to succumb to that temptation. I know what it’s like to become so angry at what someone has written online that my hands shake as they hover over the keyboard, ready to type my withering retort. Many are the tweets I wish I could take back; indeed many are the tweets I have actually deleted, though not before they did damage either to someone else’s feelings or to my reputation for calm good sense.

- Robinson further comments that this kind of usage “demonstrates how effectively such consensus can close off a subject from inquiry,” which may be the most important point of all. The more useful a term is for marking my inclusion in a group, the less interested I will be in testing the validity of my use of that term against—well, against any kind of standard. People who like accusing others of Puritanism have a fairly serious investment, then, in knowing as little as possible about actual Puritans. They are invested, for the moment anyway, in not thinking. Robinson’s analysis is acute, and all the more so given that it was written before the Internet became a culturewide phenomenon. Why would… ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=169))

- one’s attitudes is so much easier to acquire, in the currency of likes, faves, followers, and friends? And to acquire instantaneously? Robinson concludes this reflection with the sobering comment that in such an environment “unauthorized views are in effect punished by incomprehension,” not because we live in a society of conscious and intentional heresy hunters, though to some extent we do, “but simply as a consequence of a hypertrophic instinct for consensus.” If you want to think, then you are going to have to shrink that “hypertrophic instinct for consensus.” But given the power of that instinct, it is extremely unlikely that you, dear reader, are willing to go to that trouble. That instinct for consensus is magnified and intensified in our era because we deal daily with a wild torrent of what claims to be information but is often nonsense. Again, this is no new thing. T. S. Eliot wrote almost a century ago about a phenomenon that he believed to be the product of the nineteenth century: “When there is so much to be known, when there are so many fields of knowledge in which the same words are used with different meanings, when everyone knows a little… ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=176))

- thoughts.”*5 This is another idea that seems more incisive as a diagnosis of our time than of its own. And it dovetails disturbingly with Robinson’s analysis. People invested in not knowing, not thinking about, certain things in order to have “the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved” will be ecstatic when their instinct for consensus is gratified—and wrathful when it is thwarted. (Social bonding is cemented by shared emotion, shared emotion generates social bonding. It’s a feedback loop from which reflection is excluded.) Between them, Robinson and Eliot explain a great deal about the constant frantic agita of life online—and, increasingly I think, offline. Anyone who claims not to be shaped by such forces is almost certainly self-deceived. Human beings are not built to be indifferent to the waves and pulses of their social world. For most of us the question is whether we have even the slightest reluctance to drift along with the flow. The person who… ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=187))

- The title of Harding’s essay is “Representing Fundamentalism: The Problem of the Repugnant Cultural Other,” and the phrase repugnant cultural other is one that we will have cause to employ in the pages to come. In fact, it will turn up so often that we’d best give it an initialism: RCO. As I hinted earlier, if fundamentalist or evangelical Christians tend to be the RCO for secular academics, the reverse is true as well—and that mutual suspicion is something I’ve been trying to navigate my whole adult life. And now I live in a political order that, taken as a whole, has assumed the lamentable traits—willful incomprehension, toxic suspicion—that I’m used to seeing in those smaller mutually antagonistic communities. Everyone today seems to have an RCO, and everyone’s RCO is on social media somewhere. We may be able to avoid listening to our RCO, but we can’t avoid the realization that he or she is there, shouting from two rooms away. This is a profoundly unhealthy situation. It’s unhealthy because it prevents us from recognizing others as our neighbors—even when they are quite literally our neighbors. If I’m consumed by this belief that that person over there is both Other and Repugnant, I may never discover that my favorite television program is also his favorite television program; that we like some of the same books, though not for precisely the same reasons; that we both know what it’s like to nurse a loved one through a long illness. All of which is to say that I may all too easily forget that political and social and religious differences are not the whole of human experience. The cold divisive logic of the RCO impoverishes us, all of us, and brings us closer to that primitive state that the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes called “the war of every man against every man.” We can do better; we should do better. And I believe, thanks in part to my years of negotiating mutually hostile communities, I can help. I know what it’s like to make common cause with people who are in some ways alien to me; I know how such experiences can expand my understanding of the world; I know how they can force me to confront the narrowness of my vision and my tendency to simplistic thinking—sometimes to not thinking at all. And, with apologies to Daniel Kahneman, I really do believe that I’ve gotten considerably better at thinking over the years. And I don’t want to keep what I’ve learned to myself.

- Much of what follows will be simply diagnostic, and there’s a good reason for that. Once, years ago, I started having chest pains, and my doctors couldn’t isolate the problem: I exercised regularly, my heart seemed healthy, nothing was evidently wrong. But the pains kept coming back, and that scared me. Finally, one doctor asked some probing questions and discovered that I had had, before the pains began, a lingering heavy cough. It seemed that coughing had strained a muscle in my chest, and that was the source of the pain; and when I started worrying about it, the resulting anxiety tensed the muscle and increased the pain—which then led to more anxiety. It was the classic vicious circle of reinforcement. When I asked the doctor what treatment he thought best, he replied, “The diagnosis is the treatment. Now that you know you don’t have a life-threatening illness, you won’t worry so much, and less stress in your mind will mean less stress on your chest muscles. That’ll give them a chance to heal.” Similarly, while I will offer positive prescriptions in the pages to come, simply knowing the forces that act on us to prevent genuine reflection, making an accurate diagnosis of our condition, is the first course of treatment. Beyond that: I would love to offer you a set of invariable instructions that you could follow step by step to become a better thinker, but thinking isn’t like that. Again, while science is our friend, thinking is fundamentally an art, and art is notoriously resistant to strict rules—though there are good practices to follow, and I will describe those practices in the pages to come. (Indeed, I’ve already hinted at almost all of them in describing the buying of an automobile.) But whoever it was who first said that happiness is something one cannot aim straight at, but rather can achieve only by focusing on other good things, could have said it about thinking and been equally correct.

- To think, to dig into the foundations of our beliefs, is a risk, and perhaps a tragic risk. There are no guarantees that it will make us happy or even give us satisfaction. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=391))

- To think independently of other human beings is impossible, and if it were possible it would be undesirable. Thinking is necessarily, thoroughly, and wonderfully social. Everything you think is a response to what someone else has thought and said. And when people commend someone for “thinking for herself” they usually mean “ceasing to sound like people I dislike and starting to sound more like people I approve of.” This is a point worth dwelling on. How often do we say “she really thinks for herself” when someone rejects views that we hold? No: when someone departs from what we believe to be the True Path our tendency is to look for bad influences. She’s fallen under the spell of so-and-so. She’s been reading too much X or listening to too much Y or watching too much Z. Similarly, people in my line of work always say that we want to promote “critical thinking”—but really we want our students to think critically only about what they’ve learned at home and in church, not about what they learn from us.*4 When we believe something to be true, we tend also to see the very process of arriving at it as clear and objective, and therefore the kind of thing we can achieve on our own; when we hold that a given notion is false, we ascribe belief in it to some unfortunate wrong turning, usually taken because an inquirer was led astray, like Hansel and Gretel being tempted into the oven by a wicked witch. And yet even the briefest reflection would demonstrate to us that nothing of the sort is the case: there is no connection between independence and correctness, or social thinking and wrongness.

- This should not in any way lessen our admiration for the boy’s ingenuity; but it should remind us that all of us at various times in our lives believe true things for poor reasons, and false things for good reasons, and that whatever we think we know, whether we’re right or wrong, arises from our interactions with other human beings. Thinking independently, solitarily, “for ourselves,” is not an option. ON REASON AND FEELING (DIVIDED OR JOINED) While we’re clearing away misconceptions about thinking, let’s tackle another pervasive one: that in order to think well, one must be strictly rational, and being rational requires the suppression of all feelings.*6 ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=422))

- The first is that bringing analytical power to bear on a problem is not enough, especially if one’s goal is to make the world a better place. Rather, one must have a certain kind of character: one must be a certain kind of person, a person who has both the ability and the inclination to take the products of analysis and reassemble them into a positive account, a structure not just of thought but also of feelings that, when joined to thought, can produce meaningful action.

- The second component is this: when your feelings are properly cultivated, when that part of your life is strong and healthy, then your responses to the world will be adequate to what the world is really like. To have your feelings moved by the beauty of a landscape is to respond to that landscape in the way that it deserves; to have your feelings moved in a very different direction by the sight of people living in abject poverty is to respond to that situation in the way that it deserves. The latter example is especially relevant to someone like Mill who wishes to be a social reformer: if your analysis leads you to the conclusion that is it unjust that people suffer in poverty in a wealthy country, but your feelings do not match your analysis, then something has gone awry with you. And it may very well happen that if the proper feelings are not present and imaginatively active, then you will not even bother to do the analysis that would reveal unmistakable injustice. If the feelings are not cultivated the analytical faculties might not function at all. (This is a point to which we will return.)

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- My point is simply that an account of rational thinking, and a resulting set of judgments about irrational thinking, that can’t account for the power and the value of relational goods is a deeply impoverished model of rationality. So just as we do not “think for ourselves” but rather think with others, so too we think in active feeling response to the world, and in constant relation to others. Or we should. Only something that complete—relational, engaged, honest—truly deserves to be called thinking. In a preface to his novel The Princess Casamassima, Henry James writes, “But there are degrees of feeling—the muffled, the faint, the just sufficient, the barely intelligent, as we may say; and the acute, the intense, the complete, in a word—the power to be finely aware and richly responsible.”*8 This is thinking: the power to be finely aware and richly responsible. We just need to learn how to be more aware, how to act more responsibly. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=541))

- In his 2012 book The Righteous Mind, Jonathan Haidt tries to understand why we disagree with one another—especially, but not only, about politics and religion—and, more important, why it is so hard for people to see those who disagree with them as equally intelligent, equally decent human beings. Central to his argument is this point: “Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. Moral intuitions arise automatically and almost instantaneously, long before moral reasoning has a ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=622))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- chance to get started, and those first intuitions tend to drive our later reasoning.” Our “moral arguments” are therefore “mostly post hoc constructions made up on the fly, crafted to advance one or more strategic objectives.” Haidt talks a lot about how our moral intuitions accomplish two things: they bind and they blind. “People bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind to alternative moral worlds.” “Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence, or even existence, of other matrices.” ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=626))

- So the question remains: What triggers the formation of a “moral matrix” that becomes for a given person the narrative according to which everything and everyone else is judged? ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=636))

- “I believe that in all men’s lives at certain periods, and in many men’s lives at all periods between infancy and extreme old age, one of the most dominant elements is the desire to be inside the local Ring and the terror of being left outside.” And it is important for young people to know of the force of this desire because “of all passions the passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.” The draw of the Inner Ring has such profound corrupting power because it never announces itself as evil—indeed, it never announces itself at all. On these grounds Lewis makes a “prophecy” to his audience at King’s College: “To nine out of ten of you the choice which could lead to scoundrelism will come, when it does come, in no very dramatic colours….Over a drink or a cup of coffee, disguised as a triviality and sandwiched between two jokes…the hint will come.” And when it does come, “you will be drawn in, if you are drawn in, not by desire for gain or ease, but simply because at that moment, when the cup was so near your lips, you cannot bear to be thrust back again into the cold outer world.”*3 It is by these subtle means that people who are “not yet very bad” can be drawn to “do very bad things”—by which actions they become, in the end, very bad people. This, I think, is how our “moral matrices,” as Haidt calls them, are formed: we respond to the irresistible draw of belonging to a group of people whom we happen to encounter and happen to find immensely attractive. We may be acting under the influence of strong genetic predispositions, but how those dispositions are activated seems largely to be a matter of what particular people one happens to bump into and when. The element of sheer contingency here is, or ought to be, terrifying: had we encountered a group of equally attractive and interesting people who held very different views, then we too would hold very different views.

- And it’s worth noting, as Avery Pennarun, an engineer at Google, has commented, that one of the things that makes smart people smart is their skill at such rationalization: “Smart people have a problem, especially (although not only) when you put them in large groups.

- In “The Inner Ring” Lewis portrays this group affiliation in the darkest of terms. That’s because he’s warning people about its dangers, which is important. But there are healthier kinds of group affiliation, and one of the primary ways we can tell the difference between an unhealthy Inner Ring and a healthy community is by their attitudes toward thinking. The Inner Ring discourages, mocks, and ruthlessly excludes those who ask uncomfortable questions. This can be seen most clearly in extreme cases, as, for instance, when people participate in some kind of mass political movement, as Eric Hoffer has explained in his classic study The True Believer: ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=672))

A couple of years ago I started corresponding with Christopher Beha, an editor at that venerable American institution Harper’s Magazine, about whether I might write an article on the decline of the Christian intellectual in America. This possibility was profoundly attractive to me: Harper’s is, after all, one of the most prestigious of American periodicals, and not one where I’d expect to see a long and detailed reflection on Christianity in America, written by a Christian. So I made every effort to present my ideas in a way that would be attractive and convincing to Chris, and to the other editors there. But I also thought, Don’t sell yourself out. I didn’t think I would actually lie about what I think to get into the pages of Harper’s, but there are ways to be dishonest that fall short of actual lying. You can stress certain points more than you believe, in your heart of hearts, they really deserve; you can gently steer your mind away from genuine convictions that might prove too controversial.

And where is the line that separates (a) matching my writing to my audience from (b) telling people what they want to hear so that I can get into the pages of an influential magazine? I didn’t know where the line was—I still don’t know where the line is—but I know it exists. In the end, the article appeared, and I feel pretty good about it; but when I think about it, I can hear a little voice piping from the deep recesses of my skull: Did you speak your heart’s truth? Or did you merely seek to please? Self-knowledge is hard. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=752))

- The task of this chapter is to suggest ways of recognizing the power of animus and strategies for overcoming it. One of the classic ways to do this is to seek out the best—the smartest, most sensible, most fair-minded—representatives of the positions you disagree with. If your first thought on reading that sentence is that smart, sensible, and fair-minded people are extremely rare among your opponents, I would ask you to reflect on whether you think they are any more common among those who agree with you. And if you say they are, then I would encourage you to reflect on one of the lessons of the previous chapter: You have a large emotional investment in thinking that. We’ll discuss some of the ways we could figure out who counts as a “typical” representative of a position, and how important that is; but my chief mission in the latter part of this chapter will be to show you how to find the people who are really worth reading or hearing—even ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=902))

- when you disagree with them. “But,” someone may well be saying right about now, “you write as though finding some people and some ideas repulsive is always wrong, intrinsically wrong. But there are some ideas, some points of view, that genuinely are repulsive—and the people who hold them, especially if they hold them vigorously, can be pretty damned repulsive too. Remember GOD HATES FAGS? DEATH PENALTY FOR FAGS?” Indeed. And yet, as we’ve seen in our look at the transformation of Megan Phelps-Roper, at least one person who once carried those banners pretty clearly wasn’t a monster. And it’s highly likely that the number of non-monsters holding monstrous views is greater than one. Over the years, I’ve had to acknowledge that some of the people whose views on education appall me are more devoted to their students than I am to mine; and that some of the people whose theological positions strike me as immensely damaging to the health of the church are nevertheless more prayerful and charitable, more Christlike, than I will ever be. This is immensely disconcerting, even when it doesn’t mean that those people are right about those matters we disagree on. Being around those people forces me to confront certain truths about myself that I would rather avoid; and that alone is reason to seek every means possible to constrain the energies of animus.

- So this chapter and the previous one have been about how attractions and repulsions affect our thinking. One response to these problems might be to say: Let’s eliminate attractions and repulsions and make our decisions purely rationally, by assessing the available evidence. We discussed this idea earlier, but our argument has moved further, and on the basis of what we’ve seen so far, we may now revisit the issue and get a little deeper into it. It’s a vital topic, and by exploring it further we’ll be able to tie together several threads of what it means to think well.

- What System 1 does for us is to provide us with a repertoire of biases, biases that reduce the decision-making load on our conscious brains. These biases aren’t infallible, but they provide what Kahneman calls useful “heuristics”: they’re right often enough that it makes sense to follow them and not to try to override them without some good reason (say, if you’re someone whose calling in life is to help homeless people). We simply would not be able to navigate through life without these biases, these prejudices—the cognitive demands of having to assess every single situation would be so great as to paralyze us. That’s why the English essayist William Hazlitt wrote, “Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life. Reason may play the critic, and correct certain errors afterwards; but if we were to wait for its formal and absolute decisions in the shifting and multifarious combinations of human affairs, the world would stand still.” So we need the biases, the emotional predispositions, to relieve that cognitive load. We just want them to be the right ones. As a wise man once said, one of the key tasks ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1034))

- of critical reflection is to distinguish the true prejudices by which we understand from the false ones by which we misunderstand.*11 System 1 works on its own, without conscious direction, but it can be changed, trained; it can develop new habits. This is what Mill meant when he spoke of the power of rightly ordered affections to shape the character. Learning to feel as we should is enormously helpful for learning to think as we should. And this is why learning to think with the best people, and not to think with the worst, is so important. To dwell habitually with people is inevitably to adopt their way of approaching the world, which is a matter not just of ideas but also of practices. These best people will provide for you models of how to treat those who disagree with them: think back to the story of Megan Phelps-Roper, and the contrast between how David Abitbol handled her attacks on him and how the people of Westboro dealt with any dissent from their views. Phelps-Roper didn’t just change ideas, she changed communities, and she did so by following certain instincts, certain feelings, about human behavior. (Recall my earlier argument that in thinking about whom to associate with we should consider not just beliefs but also, and perhaps more important, dispositions.) Before she could have made a rational argument for her change she was already changing, and that was in response to what she saw in the character, good and bad, of the people she interacted with. A model of rationality that can’t embrace this kind of change—from one set of biases to another, a set that is better because it draws on healthy ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1044))

- feelings—is impoverished indeed.*12 And maybe worse than impoverished. A hundred years ago G. K. Chesterton wrote, “If you argue with a madman, it is extremely probable that you will get the worst of it; for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker for not being delayed by the things that go with good judgment. He is not hampered by a sense of humour or by charity, or by the dumb certainties of experience. He is the more logical for losing certain sane affections. Indeed, the common phrase for insanity is in this respect a misleading one. The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason.”*13 ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1056))

- Burke doesn’t believe we have a choice about whether or not to employ terministic screens: “We can’t say anything without the use of terms.” But for that very reason we need to work hard to understand how our terms work, especially how they “direct the attention”: What does this language ask me to see? What does it prevent me from seeing? And—perhaps most important of all: Who benefits from my attention being directed this way rather than that?*3 ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1144))

- The sociology of deploying keywords is complicated and fascinating, and not as mindless as it might look to outsiders. I’m reminded here of an ancient joke about a man who is sent to prison, and discovers that his fellow prisoners have a habit of saying numbers to one another—“Four!” “Seventeen!”—and then laughing uproariously. When he asks what’s going on his neighbor explains that they pass the time by telling jokes, but they’ve all been there so long, and with a limited repertoire of jokes, that they’ve found it easier to number the jokes and just call out the numbers. This makes sense to the new prisoner, so after a few moments of silence he says, “Eleven!” But no one laughs. He turns to his neighbor in puzzlement, and the neighbor shrugs and says, “It’s how you tell it.” Similarly, we’ve all seen newcomers to a social group suffering through a kind of linguistic struggle: they’ve paid attention to how the group converses, they’ve picked up a few keywords, but when they try to use them they don’t get the expected response. They’ve used one of the approved words, but not at the right time, or in the right context. There’s a curiously musical element to the sociology of keywords, a kind of group harmony that develops: the newcomer is prone to missing her cue or singing off-key. It takes a while to find your way into the Inner Ring, and the socially tone-deaf person may never get it right, and may be forever confined to the group’s periphery, or excluded from it altogether.

- This is one of the great themes of that seminal book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By. In an especially important passage, they discuss the consequences of one of the most deeply embedded metaphors in our common discourse, the one that identifies argument as a form of warfare. Their examples: Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I’ve never won an argument with him. If you use that strategy, he’ll wipe you out. He shot down all of my arguments.*6 The identification of argument with war is so complete that if you try to suggest some alternative way of thinking about what argument is—It’s an attempt to achieve mutual understanding; It’s a means of clarifying our views—you’re almost certainly going to be denounced as a wishy-washy, namby-pamby sissy-britches. We fixate so immovably on this notion of argument as war in part because human beings, generally speaking, are insanely competitive about everything; but also because in many arguments there truly is something to be lost, and most often what’s under threat is social affiliation.

- Fish points out that this is true of many communities of conspiracy theorists, those who believe that the Holocaust didn’t happen, or that Lyndon Johnson was behind the Kennedy assassination. “The question is, ‘Could you show to those people a set of facts that would lead them to abandon what we consider to be their outlandish views?’ ” said Fish. “The answer to that question is no, because all people who have a story to which they are committed are able to take any set of counter-evidence and turn it back, within the perspective of the story they believe in.”*9 ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1292))

- The myths we choose, or more likely simply inherit, do a tremendous amount of intellectual heavy lifting for us. Even more than the empty words and phrases of Orwell’s “tired hack on the platform,” these myths do our thinking for us. We can’t do without them; the making of analogies is intrinsic to thinking, and we always and inevitably strive to understand one thing in relation to another thing that we already know. (When we call this process the “association of ideas”—association from social, society—we’re engaging in this kind of mythmaking, treating ideas as though they’re little communities. See?) And every analogy helps—but also, as Kenneth Burke reminds us, if it directs our attention one way it also turns our attention aside from other things. To consider the brain as a computer is to ignore its biochemical character and its embodied state—and such a metaphor encourages us to believe that we understand the brain better than we do.

- Take, for example, one of the most common and least appealing defensive strategies I know: what I call “in-other-wordsing.” We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, “In other words, you’re saying…” And inevitably the argument, when put in other words, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked. Now, there’s no doubt that writers can use words evasively, to indicate or suggest things that they wouldn’t dare to say straight out. This is what “Politics and the English Language,” that Orwell essay I mentioned earlier, is all about. But often—astonishingly often, really—the “other words” people use to summarize an opponent’s argument grossly distort or even invert that argument.*13 Even worse, perhaps, is the Twitter version, which begins like this: “Shorter David Brooks,” or “Shorter Pope ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1349))

- This kind of thing is closely related to the building of a straw man. The straw man is an evidently stupid argument that no one actually holds: refuting the ridiculous straw-man argument is easier than refuting the argument that someone actually made, so up in flames goes the figure of straw. And straw-manning is a version of in-other-wordsing. But it’s also possible to in-other-words someone’s argument not to make it seem that she holds simplistic views but rather to indicate that she holds views belonging to your adversary, to your outgroup.*14 In-other-wordsing is a bad, bad habit, but anyone who wants to resist it can do so. (Again, as we have had cause to remember throughout this exploration, many people don’t want to avoid it, they want to use it to win political or social or religious battles. And again: this book is not for such people.) Robin Sloan, author of the wonderful novel Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, has described attending debates sponsored by the Long Now Foundation. He was struck by the debate format, which, he says, is “nothing like the showdowns on cable news or the debates in election season.” There are two debaters, Alice and Bob.

- Robin Sloan’s post on the Long Now debates draws together many of the themes of this chapter, indeed of this whole book. I want to expand now on two of his metaphors. The first is “method acting.” The method actor tries to become the character she is to portray, to work her way into that alien sensibility. And yet on some level, method acting—perhaps all acting—brings one to see that that sensibility is not so completely alien after all. My friend Mark Lewis, an actor and longtime teacher of acting, tells his students that the key to playing a really nasty character, and saying and doing the really nasty things that make up that character, is to realize that in different circumstances you could be that person. Similarly, the life-transforming ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1404))

- transforming event in the life of the Soviet writer and dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn came when, in prison, he looked at the guard who treated him cruelly and realized that had their circumstances been reversed, had by some turn of fate he been a guard, he would have treated prisoners cruelly too. Solzhenitsyn, like a method actor, projected himself into the life of another and discovered that they had far more in common than he would ever have wanted to believe. Sloan’s second metaphor is “dual booting,” which means having two operating systems, say Windows and Linux, installed on the same computer, so that you can use the computer with either one or the other. If you do this, and alternate between the two systems, you’ll learn that most of what you can do on one you can also do on the other, though using different techniques, and in a different style. You won’t end up thinking that both are the same, but you won’t see them as totally incompatible ways of getting things done either. After switching back and forth for a while, you may find one of them philosophically or practically superior to the other, but the one you like less won’t be totally alien to you. It’ll be a world you could live in if you had to, even if you don’t particularly want to. And we should notice how all of this is made possible by a format that absolutely prevents immediate entry into Refutation Mode. It’s a clever twist on the “give it five minutes” rule: you can speak right away, but you have to speak someone else’s thoughts, and for that time forgo ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1410))

It’s often said that when you learn a foreign language you haven’t succeeded in mastering it until you can think in it—which is to say, perceive the world from within that language: and within that language the world looks and feels different than it does in English. Something similar happens when you try out someone else’s vocabulary: you experience the world from within that mode of describing it, with a new set of “terministic screens,” and some things you’re used to seeing disappear from view while new and different ones suddenly become visible. Moreover, if, as is also often said, you don’t fully understand the resources and tendencies of your native language until you learn another one, the same is surely true of moral and political languages. To experience the world in this more complex and less dichotomous way—in this way that promotes empathy and even, yes, love, “woo-woo” though that may be—is to give yourself a chance to think.

- In biology, taxonomy is the study of classification—the classification of living things. We need to sort them out so that we can think more clearly about them—there are just too darn many of them for us to function otherwise. But it has not always been obvious how living things should be classified. Should creatures with wings all go in one category? Those with two legs? But what about birds, which have wings and two legs? We are blessed that taxonomy got its start with Aristotle, who, while not perfect, was rather more systematic and sensible about these matters than most would have been. But even when there’s general agreement about what the best system of categorization is, as there has been among biologists more or less since Linnaeus in the eighteenth century, the problems of taxonomy are scarcely solved: for one thing, it can be hard to know when to place something in an existing category and when to create a new one. Charles Darwin thought often about this problem, and commented in a letter that taxonomists tend to have strong tendencies in one direction or the other. The ones who like to put organisms in existing categories he called “lumpers”; the ones who like to create new categories he called “splitters.” These reflections matter not just for biology but for everyday life, because we are all inveterate taxonomists, and go through our days lumping and splitting like crazy. And we tend to taxonomize according to the heuristics—the strategies of simplification that relieve cognitive load—that I’ve been discussing throughout this book: identifying ingroups and outgroups, deploying keywords, and the like. The hashtags I mentioned in the previous chapter (#cuckservative, #whiteprivilege) are essentially quick-and-dirty classifications, Instant Taxonomy.

- Lumping is a powerful strategy for information management, and a certain filtering out of individuality is the price we simply have to pay to get our choices under some kind of control. But lumping can also be desirable for a very different—indeed, almost the opposite—reason, as a strategy of inclusion. Consider, as an example, the rise in the past half century of the movement in America for gay and lesbian rights. First, people spoke of the common interests of lesbian women and gay men. Then someone asked, “But what about bisexuals?” And someone else said, “You’re forgetting the transgendered.” After which a yet another person said, “But some of us prefer to identify as ‘queer.’ ” Thus an initialism was born: LGBTQ. Of course, this was not the end of it. There are strong advocates now for LGBTQIA, in order to make room in the community for those who describe themselves as “intersex” and those who identify as “asexual.” Other add-ons have been suggested. But the point is, these initialisms exemplify lumping not for dismissal or ruling out but for solidarity, for the making of common cause. The implicit argument behind the idea of “the LGBTQIA community” goes something like this: “We may be a highly diverse group of people in most ways but in one major way we belong together: our sexuality is not treated fairly or respectfully in mainstream culture.” ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1526))

- Lenin—whom Orwell satirizes in Animal Farm and condemns elsewhere—got one important thing right when he asked a question: Kto kovo? “Who whom?” The question has general relevance: Who, we might ask in any given situation, controls whom? Who is sovereign over whom? Who benefits from adopting these categories—and who is victimized by them? In this light we can see that the creating of social taxonomies is a form of the mythmaking described in the previous chapter. Just as we cannot do without our metaphors and myths, we cannot do without social taxonomies. There are too many people! But we absolutely must remember what those taxonomies are: temporary, provisional intellectual structures whose relevance will not always be what it is, or seems to be, today. Of course, some people govern their whole lives by such taxonomies. And we need to formulate a particular kind of response to them. Consider the example of John C. Calhoun and the college at Yale University named for him. Why, when Edward Harkness gave Yale a pile of money to build residential colleges, did the university decide to name one of them after John C. Calhoun, a passionate defender of slavery? Possibly the thinking went no further than this: that Calhoun was a Yale graduate who went on to become a famously powerful and influential senator and a vice president of the United States. There could have been few better-known graduates of the university. And Calhoun, when Calhoun College opened in 1933 and for decades afterward, was widely believed to be a great American. Indeed, in 1957 a committee overseen by a young senator named John F. Kennedy named Calhoun one of the five greatest senators in American history. So even after Brown v. Board of Education and at the outset of the civil rights era, few people of influence in American government thought Calhoun’s pro-slavery commitments were sufficiently troublesome to prevent him from being honored as one of the greatest of senators. Perhaps they thought, Ah well, people didn’t really know better in those days. But here I think we need to make a vital distinction: between those who held what we now believe to be a profoundly mistaken view, or tolerated such a view, simply because it was common in their time, and those who were the architects of and advocates for such a view. The general forgiveness of society has been extended to millions of members of the Soviet Communist Party, and the Nazi Party, but the places once named for Adolf Hitler have had their names changed, as have Stalingrad and Leningrad. Similarly, to those who would excuse Margaret Sanger’s support of eugenics as merely a product of her time and place, I say: Sanger did not just “hold eugenicist ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1559))

- ideas,” as some have claimed; she was one of our nation’s most passionate and widely respected advocates for those ideas. It is this ceaseless, tireless, and very successful advocacy for some very nasty beliefs and practices that sets Sanger apart from others who happened to “hold eugenicist ideas.” If we were to apply this same logic to John C. Calhoun, he wouldn’t come off very well. Calhoun did not merely accept slavery, he was the single most passionate and influential advocate for slavery in his era. He believed that slavery is a “positive good,” railed against “the fell spirit of abolition,” and called those who believe that slavery is sinful “this fanatical portion of society” who wish to perform their insidious “operations” on “the ignorant, the weak, the young, and the thoughtless.” In brief: Calhoun devoted his life to arguing for and politically implementing a taxonomy that radically separated free and superior white people from enslaved and inferior black people; Margaret Sanger did the same for the binary opposition between those worthy to reproduce and those unworthy. Calhoun and Sanger did not just hold the views of their time that most of us now find deplorable; they made those views.

Again, this is not to say that we can live without them, but rather that we need to cultivate skepticism as a first response. Though group solidarity matters to almost all of us in one way or another—it is the stuff of which both Inner Rings and genuine membership are made—on some fundamental level, as Dorothy Sayers once wrote, “What is repugnant to every human being is to be reckoned always as a member of a class and not as an individual person.”… ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1597))

- There is a kind of blessed selfishness to this cry—a celebration of the “eccentric individual” who doesn’t give a fig about what other supposed members of her class do. But there is also a blessed universalism, a blessed humanism, if I may dare so beaten-up a word. The Roman poet Terence wrote a line that was once famous: Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto—“I am human, and nothing human is alien to me”—and I think this strikes precisely the right note. Terence doesn’t say that everything human is fully accessible to him, that there are no relevant divides of race or class or sexual orientation or religion; he doesn’t say that everyone else is instantly or fully comprehensible to him. He says, rather, than nothing human is alien to him: nothing human is beyond his capacity to understand, at least in part. Many years ago I spent a summer teaching rhetoric to pastors in Nigeria. The seminary was in a village in the heart of Yorubaland, and many of the pastors were Yoruba, but a significant minority were Hausa, from the north of the country, and Igbo, from the southeast. For me the experience of living and working among them, and thinking alongside them, was exhilarating but also disorienting. Sometimes I felt that we understood one another perfectly, other times that we didn’t understand one another at all. The latter feeling was especially strong the day that one of my students, whom I will call Timothy, spoke passionately and at great length about the challenge he had recently faced when a woman in his congregation gave birth to a demon baby. Clearly Timothy wanted me to assess his handling of the situation, but I was speechless. The proper pastoral response to the birth of demon babies did not lie within my sphere of competence or knowledge. I walked away from class that day reflecting that I simply did not know how to bridge the sometimes enormous gap between American and African Christianity. I was troubled, and after dinner, when evening came on and the air began to cool, I took a walk through the seminary compound and the village. On my return I saw two of my students, walking along hand in hand, as Nigerian friends often do. As I passed, one of them, apparently having read my face, said, “Professor, please do not worry too much about Timothy. He is very excitable.” And then he said, as an afterthought, “He is Igbo, you know.” To which his ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1612))

- friend replied, with a smile, “Timothy is not like that because he is Igbo. He is like that because he is Timothy.” And at that moment I realized how utterly my habits of lumping—“American” versus “African”—had misled me. Terence’s great line is a motto worthy of any thinking person. Our social taxonomies are useful, but if we think of them as something more than that, if we employ them to enforce strict separation between one person and another, if we treat them as solid and impermeable barriers that make mutual understanding impossible, they serve us poorly. Our age is so dedicated to its various lumpings that it has, I think, lost sight of these dangers, and of the possibilities that may be found in judicious contemplation of Terence’s wise statement. Let a billion eccentric individuals bloom. Even Timothy. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1630))

- Why you can’t have an open mind, and why it wouldn’t be good if you could There’s a famous and often-told story about the great economist John Maynard Keynes: once, when accused of having flip-flopped on some policy issue, Keynes acerbically replied, “When the facts change, sir, I change my mind. What do you do?” The story appears not to be true, alas: no one has ever been able to track down its source. But it’s too good a story not to use, and it’s always used in the same ways and for the same reasons: to denounce ideologues and to commend open-mindedness. To be open-minded!—a condition to aspire to. To be closed-minded!—a condition to fear and shun. The contrasting terms are so deeply embedded in everyday usage that they’re almost impossible to avoid, but they really should be avoided. They’re nonsensical and misleading. The primary problem is that, of course, we really don’t want to be or want anyone else to be permanently ([Location 1643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1643))

- and universally open-minded. No one wants to hear anyone say that, while there is certainly general social disapproval of kidnapping, we should keep an open mind on the subject. No one wants an advocate for the poor to pause in her work and spend some months reflecting on whether the alleviation of poverty is really a good idea. About some things—about many things!—we believe that people should have not open minds but settled convictions. We cannot make progress intellectually or socially until some issues are no longer up for grabs. Chesterton said of H. G. Wells—with whom he disagreed about almost everything but remained in cordial relations—that “he thought that the object of opening the mind is simply opening the mind.” Chesterton, however, was by contrast “incurably convinced that the object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.”*1 I like Chesterton’s gustatory metaphor: it suggests that when the mind is governed by properly settled convictions, only then can it be truly nourished. The problem, of course, and sadly, is that we all have some convictions that are unsettled when they ought to be settled, and others that are settled when they ought to be unsettled. To understand this problem and begin addressing it, we need to think in terms of the old Aristotelian language of virtue and vice, in which a virtue lies midway between two opposing vices. We don’t want to be, and we don’t want others to ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1651))

- be, intractably stubborn; but we don’t want them to be pusillanimous and vacillating either. Tommy Lasorda, the onetime Los Angeles Dodgers manager, used to say that managing players was like holding a bird in your hands: grip it too firmly and you crush it, too loosely and it escapes and flies away. In the life of thought, holding a position is like that: there’s a proper firmness of belief that lies between the extremes of rigidity and flaccidity. We don’t want to be paralyzed by indecision or indifference, but like the apocryphal Keynes, we want to have the mental flexibility and honesty to adjust our views accordingly when the facts change.*2 All that is difficult enough to manage, but there are further complications: we need to be able to make reliable assessments about the state of our knowledge, in such a way that when necessary we can hold back from taking any position until we learn more; and we need to accept that while knowledge may be analog, decision making is often digital, that is, binary.

- the weight of evidence,” but sometimes the evidence is insufficient or contradictory, especially when we’re trying to predict the future consequences of today’s actions, and yet policy must be made all the same. In the laboratory you can and should wait to announce your findings until the evidence is all in and has been carefully assessed, following the best protocols of double-blind testing; but in many arenas of human life, including the political, it’s not possible to do any of those things. We must muddle along as best we can, and we must always be honest… ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MR8V850&location=1676))
