## Highlights
- Evolutionary biology, as the name suggests, is the study of the causes and nature of the evolution of organisms since the beginning of life on Earth. Investing, unlike the name suggests, is all too often a euphemism ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=82))

- The biggest difference, though, is that the two are moving in opposite directions. Evolutionary biologists continue to become better at their craft, whereas investors continue to get worse. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=91))

- Nalanda’s investment philosophy can be summarized in ten words: We want to be permanent owners of high-quality businesses. Let me repeat that: We want to be permanent owners. We don’t invest unless we think we can own a business forever. A bad business that is dirt cheap? Pass. A mediocre business at a low price? Thanks, but no thanks. A high-quality business at a fair price? Give me more so I can never let go. We invest almost exclusively in businesses owned and run by entrepreneurs of which the entrepreneur is typically the largest shareholder, and we are usually the second largest. Nalanda’s approach to investing comprises three straightforward, sequential steps: 1. Avoid big risks. 2. Buy high quality at a fair price.

- As you can see, I haven’t done anything. I haven’t been responsible for meeting production deadlines, managing a sales team, turning around troubled companies, or launching and managing brands. What I have done, though, for almost three decades of my consulting and investing career is observe. Not being in a day-to-day operational role has afforded me the luxury of stepping back to think about what works in the corporate world and what doesn’t.

- It was only after I had read dozens of books on evolution that I realized why I was so deeply absorbed in the subject. Almost every topic I studied in evolutionary biology has parallels to investing in general and to the Nalanda way of investing in particular. The more I studied Darwinian evolution, a new hobby, the more I learned about investing, an old passion. This book is about how we can derive the core investment principles of long-term and patient investing from the basic concepts of evolutionary biology, the very epitome of a long-term process.

- This book is about adopting a new mindset for investing—about reimagining investing by applying the time-tested principles of biological evolution. I will deliberate the counterintuitive Darwinian evolutionary principles that can be called upon to understand the business world, thereby helping investors excel at their craft. What you will discover in the following pages is a description, not a prescription. It’s a description of our strategy of investing at Nalanda and its uncanny parallels to evolutionary theory. Instead of saying, “This is what you should do,” this book says, “This is what we have done.” As mentioned, most investors have a poor long-term track record. The implication of this is obvious: Most investment methods don’t work over the ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=173))

- Have you noticed that almost every book on investing provides strategies and tactics that encourage you to do things a certain way? Some advise you to trade based on market signals, some recommend buying value stocks, and some urge you to bet on AI and biotech start-ups. These books are about making money. You do not see books telling you how not to lose money. The sad reality is that unless an investor learns to avoid losses, their investment career is likely to be short and brutal.

- The problem with our investment community is that we don’t take investing seriously. Seriously. Those of you who are in the investing profession are probably bristling with indignation right now.

Well, if you are so angry, answer this question for me: Would you bet your life on your next investment? In this chapter, I discuss how “betting your life” is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this approach has led to the spectacular success of all living organisms over millions of years. All the investment advice from well-known books, investment gurus, and finance academics centers on making investments. This chapter is about not making investments. I will argue that learning the skill of not investing is harder and more important than learning how to invest.

Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 3, “Struggle for Existence” We have written in past reports about the disappointments that usually result from purchases and operation of “turnaround” businesses. Literally hundreds of turnaround possibilities in dozens of industries have been described to us over the years and, either as participants or observers, we have tracked performance against expectations. Our conclusion is that, with few exceptions, when a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.

- I hope to convince you that an essential prerequisite for making money is the ability not to lose money. Almost everyone—and I say “almost” because this statement does not apply to my wife—makes mistakes. These errors fall into two broad categories: We do things we are not supposed to, and we don’t do things we are supposed to. For me, buying a hot fudge sundae at McDonald’s falls ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=268))

- into the first category, and not keeping in regular touch with my school and college friends falls into the second. All investors, too, make these two mistakes. Let me borrow from the field of statistics to describe them. The first kind—dubbed a type I error1 by statisticians who can never be blamed for being creative—occurs when I make a bad investment because I erroneously think it is a good one. It is the error of committing self-harm and is also called a false positive or error of commission. A type II error occurs when I reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. This is the error of rejecting a potential benefit and can be termed a false negative or error of omission. Every investor, including Warren Buffett, makes these two errors on a regular basis. They either harm themselves or walk away from a great opportunity. As any statistician will tell you, the risk of these two errors is inversely related.2 Minimizing the risk of a type I error typically increases the risk of a type II error, and minimizing the risk of a type II error increases the risk of a type I error. Intuitively, this seems logical. Imagine an ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=272))

- overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment. This individual will make several type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments. On the other hand, an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments. Investors can’t have their cake and eat it, too! They need to choose to be more sensitive to making one type of error while living with the consequences of making more errors of the other kind. What should one do? What should you do? In other words, which of the following investment strategies should you use: (1) making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities and, as a result, living with some failed investments, or (2) being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments? Let’s turn to evolution to seek the answer. The goal of all animals is to survive for as long as possible, at least until they reproduce. In the animal world, everyone is both prey and predator. Yes, even we, the Homo sapiens. How are we prey? Remember COVID-19? ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=282))

- The bottom line is that the stags’ evolutionary success, at least in part, can be attributed to their instinct to preserve life and limb—to minimize the risk of committing a type I error. But there is a significant trade-off to the approach of minimizing the risk of type I errors: the deer make many more type II errors. A type II error, or the error of omission, means avoiding a watering hole where no predator is waiting. Stags also too often withdraw from a rutting duel ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=333))

- when they have a good chance of winning the harem. The cost is the lost opportunity to drink water or to mate. In some cases, a type II error may turn out to be a fatal mistake. A thirsty deer may not be able to run quickly enough to escape a predator, and an overcautious stag may not get to pass his genes on to the next generation. But on average, making this trade-off in favor of reducing the number of errors of self-harm while tolerating a higher number of errors of rejecting potential benefit has worked quite well for the species. Committing a type I error can be and has been deadlier than the loss of a single animal—it can lead to the extinction of an entire species. The flightless dodo bird, a native of Mauritius, was first spotted by sailors in 1507 and went extinct by 1681.5 Dodos were bigger than turkeys, and since they had no natural predators on the isolated island, they were not afraid of the human invaders. They committed the cardinal type I error—they did not avoid the humans when they should have—which led to their extinction.

- The fact the species has been successful for eons demonstrates that cheetahs, as a species, have not committed too many type I errors. A type II error for a cheetah would mean not chasing prey it should have. This would leave the cheetah and maybe even her babies hungry, but they would all live to see another day. Deer and cheetahs do not manufacture complex decision-tree diagrams with associated probabilities to make decisions in their lives. These animals do what they do because natural selection has honed their instincts over countless generations. Natural selection among animals is incessant and merciless and has produced millions of species, all of whom adhere to this simple principle: Minimize the risk of committing type I errors to curtail the risk of injury or death, and learn to live with type II errors or foregone benefits.

- But when there is an insect attack, to reduce the risk of a type I error (erroneously investing in growth instead of preparing defenses), we should expect the plant to start making trichomes. And this is what we see. For example, scientists have observed that when adult leaf beetles attack the willow plant, new leaves grown after the attack develop higher trichome density. The willow plant redirects its resources from growth to defense as a result of sensing a predator. Trichome density also increases in other species like pepperwort and wild radish after an insect attack. When a butterfly species attacks a black mustard plant, the trichome density of the plant’s leaves increases, as does the production of pungent chemicals called glucosinolates. Within a few days or weeks following an insect attack, trichome density can increase from 25 to 1,000 percent! ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=383))

- What I have described are direct defenses against pests. But many plants also resort to indirect defenses, which are rarely seen in animals. An indirect defense works on the simple principle that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend.”9 It works simply—and beautifully—like this. When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases some chemical compounds from its leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere. These chemical compounds attract predators of the insects attacking the plants. For example, plants like lima beans and Arabidopsis release a chemical called methyl salicylate to attract insect predators like big-eyed bugs, ladybird beetles (commonly known as ladybugs), and green lacewings. This ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=394))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- trick is not limited to the aerial parts of plants. Roots, too, can release chemicals that attract underground predators to underground pests. For example, when western corn rootworm threatens maize plants, the maize roots release a chemical that attracts a nematode species that preys upon the rootworm. When aphids attack, many plants emit a chemical called beta-farnesene. It does not appear to be a coincidence that when predators attack aphids, the aphids release this chemical, presumably warning other aphids to stay away. Thus, a plant releasing beta-farnesene is equivalent to a deer mimicking a lion roar when attacked by a leopard! Plants, like animals, have found a way to their spectacular evolutionary success by focusing on reducing their errors of commission. In other words, like their animal counterparts, they avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up some potentially juicy opportunities.

- As one should expect, Warren Buffett figured out this lesson from evolutionary theory before almost everyone else. He famously coined his two rules of investing as follows: Rule number 1: Never lose money. Rule number 2: Never forget rule number 1.10 But wait a minute. What does he mean by commanding us to “never lose money”? How can one choose not to lose money? Isn’t that what every investor wants? Why would any investor deliberately wish to lose money? In fact, Buffett seems to have violated his own two rules on many occasions. For example, in 1993, Berkshire bought Dexter Shoe for $433 million in Berkshire stock. As he detailed in his 2007 annual letter, “What I had assessed as a durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years. . . . That move made the… ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=409))

- In his 2014 annual letter, he admitted his mistake in Berkshire’s Tesco investment, “We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and now are out of this position. Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million. . . .” More recently, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic market meltdown, Buffett sold all his airline stocks. He had invested between $7 billion and $8 billion for large stakes in four airlines: American, Delta, Southwest, and United. Berkshire’s position was worth a bit more than $4 billion at the time of his sale.11 “It turned out I was wrong,” he said. Back to Buffett’s two rules. Despite losing money occasionally, what is he asking us to do when he orders us not to lose any? Buffett has never explicitly explained this (at least I have never found an explanation), but this is what I think he means: Avoid big risks. Don’t make type I errors. Don’t commit to an investment in which the probability of… ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=419))

Finance theory claims that risk is the chance that the actual investment return will differ from the expected investment return.12 Thus, if an asset is highly volatile, it will be classified as riskier than an asset that is not as volatile.

- We at Nalanda never bring stock price volatility into a risk discussion. We define “risk” as the probability of capital loss. The higher the probability of loss, the higher the risk. If my investment in Company A is likely to lose more money over my investment in Company B, I will deem Company A to be “riskier” than Company B irrespective of past or future volatility in their stock prices. As Buffett’s diktat shows, he is focused on minimizing risk and, in doing so, has become the envy of the entire investment world, which seems obsessed with running after every half-baked business idea. Buffett and the natural world are fixated on minimizing the risk of type I errors. Should we follow them blindly? Will the explicit lesson from Buffett and the implicit one from leopards and legumes work for ordinary mortals like us? Why or why not?

- Let’s say you encounter a savvy investor who claims that he is right 80 percent of the time in his investment decisions (it is usually a “he”; we men are evolutionarily programmed for empty exaggerations). Stated differently, if he encounters a bad investment (i.e., one in which he will not make any money), he rejects it 80 percent of the time. If he sees a good investment (i.e., one in which he will make money), he makes a favorable investment decision 80 percent of the time. Thus, his rates of type I and type II errors are both 20 percent. If this star investor makes an investment decision, what is the probability that it is a good investment? You’d say 80 percent, right? Wrong. The answer is 57 percent. But why? Isn’t he right 80 percent of the time? How can we go from 80 percent to 57 percent? Here is how.

- There are 1,000 good investments in the market, and since this investor makes a type II error 20 percent of the time (i.e., he mistakenly rejects 20 percent of these), he will select only 800 companies from his list. The market also has 3,000 bad investments, and since he makes type I errors 20 percent of the time (i.e., he mistakenly accepts 20 percent of these), he will mistakenly select 600 companies from this list, thinking that they are good investments. Thus, his universe of what he thinks are good investments will be 1,400 companies (800 + 600). Are you with me? Good. Now to the most interesting part. Of these 1,400 businesses that the investor thinks are good investments, how many do you think are good investments? Only 800. Hence, the probability of his making a good investment will be 800 ÷ 1,400 = 57 percent. So here is the unfortunate conclusion. Even if an investor is endowed with the divine power of being right 80 percent of the time, the probability that he will select a good investment is only 57 percent. Even though he is “right” 80 percent of the time, 43 percent of his investments will turn out to be bad! The reason is simple, especially when we incorporate our prior knowledge of the business world: There are very few good investments in the market. Let me repeat this statement, which is the bedrock of our philosophy and that of the rest of this book: There are very few good investments in the market. As we have just seen, the prevalence of type I and type II errors can lull us investors into thinking that we are better than we really are. But these errors carry a deeper meaning for our profession. Given a choice, which error would you like to reduce, and why? Let’s say that our investor, Investor A, decides to become better at rejecting bad investments and reduces his rate of type I errors from 20 percent to 10 percent. Thus, from the 3,000 bad investments in the market, he will select only 300 businesses (10 percent × 3,000). As his type II error rate remains 20 percent, he will erroneously reject 200 of the 1,000 good investments, thereby selecting 800 investments. Thus, Investor A has selected 1,100 investments (300 + 800), but only 800 of these are good. In this scenario, Investor A’s probability of selecting a good ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=467))

Investor B, unlike Investor A, is more focused on not missing out on good opportunities. He chooses to reduce his rate of type II errors from 20 percent to 10 percent and keeps his rate of type I errors at 20 percent. Thus, of the 1,000 good investments, he will select 900 (90 percent × 1,000), and of the 3,000 bad investments, he will mistakenly assume that 600 are good (20 percent × 3,000).

On the other hand, reducing the rate of type II errors by the same amount improves performance by only 3 percentage points. Guess what happens if another investor, Investor C, improves his rate of both type I and type II errors from 20 percent to 10 percent. I was flabbergasted when I first saw the answer: 75 percent. This is barely above the 73 percent achieved by Investor A, who was focused only on reducing type I errors. A dramatic improvement in performance comes only when the rate of type I errors—errors of making bad investments—is reduced.

Our reasonable success of staying away from trouble is the result of the follies of the first three to four years of my career. In my case, nothing has succeeded like a failure. Most investors will keep making type I errors (making bad investments) throughout their careers. At least I have, and I will. It’s inevitable. So when I say that we need to avoid type I errors, I am proposing that we try to avoid the avoidable type I error. By not taking on big risks. What is a big risk?

As permanent owners, we at Nalanda have no interest in a business owned or run by someone who defrauds customers, suppliers, employees, or shareholders. When we come across such a person, we don’t ask if the business is cheap enough for the risk to be mitigated; we don’t ask if we could persuade this individual to change; we don’t ask if their crimes are trivial enough to ignore. We simply walk away. I don’t know about other countries, but the Indian capital market, I am sad to admit, teems with dodgy and deceitful promoters (Indian parlance for the largest or controlling shareholders). As a result, we are highly vigilant and do not even start assessing the business fundamentals until we have convinced ourselves that the promoters have impeccable integrity.

We always hire a forensic diligence expert to assess if the owner or senior managers have a dubious past. During this period, we conduct our parallel diligence on the promoters and managers by scouring the media, studying past annual reports, listening to their conference call recordings, reading their interviews, and talking to people who have had personal and business dealings with them. In almost half the cases, we ask the external firm to further probe issues that have arisen during our diligence (for example, money leakage for large capex contracts or a cash payment to senior managers). This dual check provided by outsourcing and insourcing has prevented a lot of heartburn for us over the years.

But if we ever do, it will not be because we didn’t do our best. Some investors may object that if the company’s survival is not under threat owing to the bad behavior of the promoter, investing in a somewhat shady business at a very cheap valuation may be a good way of making money over the medium to long term. The fact remains that there are some well-known dodgy businesses in India whose stock prices have done reasonably well over the past few years. But we have never played this game and never will.

- blame neither managements nor McKinsey because optimism is not a crime. But I do get baffled at investors who, despite having access to data that amply demonstrate the incompetence of incumbent management, are willing to bet their clients’ money on the hope that this management will suddenly morph into an industry beater in the near future. More often than not, the dream scenario hyped up by the management morphs into a nightmare. Occasionally, the board or the owner fires the previous CEO and brings in a new one to turn around a struggling business. The new CEO usually comes with an impressive resume, and many are highly qualified. But we don’t bet on these turnarounds either. An exceptional CEO was impressive in a certain context with a certain business—this context and this business are different. How are we to know that the new CEO, faced with a set of challenges they have almost certainly never met before, will do what they are promising to do? We don’t. I know what you are thinking. The upside, if we were able to detect a genuine turnaround, would be significant. Agreed. Let’s assess the following two situations. Case 1: A company that has been very profitable over many decades has recently fallen prey to smaller and more nimble competitors. It has suffered massive losses over the past two years. The company sells its highly engineered products to medium and large businesses. The board starts searching for a new CEO and identifies a promising candidate. There are, however, a few worrying problems with this choice: The candidate does not understand technology, he does not understand how to sell to businesses because he has run a company that sells biscuits to consumers (!), and he has had no experience turning around any business, let alone a complex engineering one like this. Would you invest in this business once this CEO takes over? Case 2: A venerated hundred-year-old department store has been struggling with falling sales. Over the past four years, sales have fallen 10 percent from $20 billion to $18 billion, and the operating income has plummeted about 65 percent ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=576))

He also struck several designer partnerships that were a huge hit with shoppers. His next job was at a large company where he was responsible for opening retail stores. He hit the ball completely out of the park. The sales per square foot at these stores now exceeds even luxury retailers like LVMH.

The first business is IBM, and its famous turnaround in the late 1990s was led by Lou Gerstner, the ex-CEO of RJR Nabisco.16 Previously called International Business Machines, IBM was a behemoth that ruled the world of technology in the latter half of the twentieth century. In the early 1990s, about half its revenues came from huge mainframe computers sold to businesses. These mainframes had hardware and software bundled into one system. The world, however, was fast shifting to smaller and midsized machines running on microprocessors. The technology universe was witnessing the unbundling of hardware and software with different vendors specializing in each segment. Companies like HP, Sun, Compaq, and Dell were eating IBM’s lunch on hardware, and Microsoft… ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=601))

- hobbled decision-making. From being the second most profitable company in the world in 1990, IBM lost $16 billion between 1991 and 1993. Lou Gerstner seemed like a strange choice for the board to make. But it worked wonders. Gerstner resorted to a massive cut in expenses by laying off staff, sold many assets to raise cash, transformed the organizational culture to encourage business units to cooperate and not compete, linked the compensation of senior managers to overall company performance, created a single brand message for all units of IBM, and much more. IBM’s stock price jumped seven times from $13 to $77 during his tenure from April 1, 1993, to December 31, 2002. If you want to learn more about Gerstner’s miracles, I urge you to read his book Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance? Inside IBM’s Historic Turnaround.

In 2012, sales dropped 25 percent, from $17 billion to $13 billion, as customers abandoned the stores en masse. More worryingly, the company suffered an operating loss of $1.3 billion. The board fired Johnson in mid-2013, just seventeen months after installing him as CEO. The stock price had dropped 60 percent during his short tenure. JCPenney never recovered from this fiasco and filed for bankruptcy in May 2020. If we could not predict the fate of turnaround efforts at what appeared to be slam-dunk cases (IBM and JCPenney), what hope do we have in situations that don’t seem so clear cut? The corporate world is brutally competitive. Even the best companies have to run hard just to stay in the same place. How could the probability of success at a troubled company be anything but minuscule? And if so, why would we indulge in the fantasy?

But it’s one hell of a correlation. As a long-term investor in a business, I don’t want the company ever to go bankrupt—whether the times are good or bad. I can live with a slightly lower return on equity and lower earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, but at least I will live. Not having high leverage probably makes sense to everyone. But the following may not: I am an advocate of no leverage. More than 90 percent of our portfolio companies have—and have always had—excess cash. Only three businesses out of about thirty in our portfolio have some debt. But even this debt is quite small—the maximum debt/equity ratio among these three is 0.3. Why would I demand zero debt when a modest level would not compromise the survival of the business? The answer lies in the following Business Insider headline: “No Layoff, Asian Paints Will Give Salary Increments to Boost Employees Morale.”21 ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=648))

I could go on and on. None of these issues is hypothetical—I have seen all of these happen to our portfolio companies over more than two decades of investing. Occasionally, two or more problems can arise simultaneously, putting significant pressure on businesses. While worrying about market share loss, low supplier commitment, competitor aggression, and employee dissatisfaction, the last thing management should worry about is interest payments. In my experience, only when the financial risk is low can management focus on mitigating business risks. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=685))

- But they don’t point out the single biggest reason we detest M&A: opportunity cost. Let’s visit the German giant Bayer to understand this reason. Dr. Marijn Dekkers, the chair of Bayer AG, had every reason to be proud in 2015. During his five years as chair, this life sciences company has grown revenue from €35 billion to €46 billion, and its EPS had more than tripled from €1.6 per share to €5 per share. It continued its reign as the largest company on the German stock exchange with a market value of about €140 billion. The 2015 annual report was replete with good news. Without being boastful, Dr. Dekker’s excellent commentary made it evident that the company was one of the world’s leading life sciences businesses. The only piece of bad news was tucked away on page seven of the report. Dr. Dekkers wrote, “This is my last Chairman’s Letter to you as CEO of Bayer.” How bad was Dr. Dekker’s revelation for Bayer? In 2020, its sales had fallen to €41 billion from €46 billion in 2015; from being a highly profitable business with a return on equity of 18 percent in 2015, it declared a net loss of €10 billion; and its dividend per share was 20 percent lower than in 2015. Oh, and by June 2021, less than six years after the glorious year of 2015, Bayer’s market value had declined by 65 percent to €50 billion. What happened? Within ten days of Dr. Dekker’s departure, Bayer made a bid to acquire Monsanto, the U.S. agrochemical giant. Bayer ended up paying $63 billion for the acquisition, which was more than Bayer’s market value in June 2021! If you read reports on the reasons for this disaster, most will focus on Bayer losing multiple lawsuits and incurring billions in damages because plaintiffs were able to convince the U.S. courts that Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The reports aren’t wrong, but they missed the real value destroyer invisible in the Bayer–Monsanto transaction, and the reason we abhor almost all M&A: opportunity cost. Stated simply, most analyses of M&A failure focus on the bad things that happened, rather than on the good things that didn’t happen.

- Let’s see what Bayer may have missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition. These actions (and inactions) fall into three categories: divestiture of attractive businesses, reduced focus on existing businesses, and missed opportunities. After acquiring Monsanto, Bayer had to divest many of its core businesses for two reasons. First, regulators forced them to do so because both companies were large players in the agrochemical sector. Second, Bayer had to pay down the huge debt they had incurred to finance the deal. Bayer’s net debt had gone up ten times from €3.6 billion in 2017 to €36 billion in 2018! In 2017, Bayer divested large parts of its seed and herbicide businesses for €6 billion. In 2018, it sold its 60 percent stake in a highly lucrative business called Currenta for €1 billion and sold the consumer brands Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s. In 2020, Bayer exited its leading and highly profitable Animal Health business for €7 billion. If we add up the sale value of these divestitures, that’s at least €15 billion, or about 30 percent of Bayer’s market value in mid-2021. These businesses had been owned and run by Bayer for decades, and so it is possible that the ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=747))

- market was assigning a much higher value than €15 billion to them when they were inside Bayer. The future benefit from these attractive businesses was lost forever. The geese laying golden eggs were slaughtered to buy a hen that refused to lay any eggs. The second major opportunity cost is a reduced focus on existing businesses because of the distraction of a bad acquisition.

And then COVID strikes in early 2020. Do you think the senior management assembled around the table at corporate headquarters and said, “Let’s bet billions on developing a vaccine that we do not even know is possible”? Would the Bayer management have been willing to take a bet on an uncertain outcome given their dire operating and financial condition? We will never know for sure, and your guess is as good as mine, but a shot in the dark for an uncertain payoff by this long-suffering company? Unlikely. Bayer’s 2020 annual report mentions that they signed an agreement with a biotech company to develop and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine that would be launched in 2022. Meanwhile, four competitors of Bayer—AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer—had administered about five billion doses by July 2021.

- I don’t know anything about Bayer’s management, but presumably they are world class given their outsized success before 2016. If that’s the case, how did they get lulled into making such an acquisition? Because like most acquirers across the world, they genuinely believed that this time, it’s different. Managers—especially high-performing ones—and their advisers have a sense of invincibility and arrogance when evaluating a target. They firmly believe that they will buck the trend the corporate world has witnessed for a century. Most of them don’t realize their folly until it’s too late. If a business is a serial acquirer, we stay away. We know we can’t price the risk. If we had been evaluating Bayer as a new investment in 2016, we would have passed until we were convinced that management would not repeat its mistakes. Some of our portfolio companies do occasionally make acquisitions. Our counsel to them is to be deeply skeptical of the potential value creation in all cases. I will admit that the success rate of our advice has not been very high.

If you want to be charitable, you could add eBay and Priceline (now called Booking Holdings). But that’s it. Just step back and think about this for a moment. Only a handful of businesses from the 1995–2000 bubble have prospered. To give you a sense of the scale of destruction, 546 IPOs successfully raised $69 billion in 1999 alone. What would have been the probability of finding the next winner? The path to creating wealth in rapidly evolving industries is treacherous, and we refuse to walk on it.

In fast-changing industries, I have no idea who will win, when, or how. And to draw the parallel with hockey, since I don’t know where the puck is going to be, I refuse to play.

They are almost always cheap, and, for a value investor, they have been unhappy hunting grounds for as long as I can remember. I say “unhappy” because most of these cheap businesses almost always stay cheap. Some fund managers may have figured out a way to invest successfully in government-owned businesses, but we will not invest in a government-owned enterprise at any price.

- It is not that the government objectives are “wrong”—they make sense in the light of the multiple constituencies whose needs they are trying to meet. Their objectives are just different from ours. The second category of owners we avoid religiously is the listed subsidiaries of global giants. A few decades ago, the Indian government forced all Indian subsidiaries of global multinational companies (MNCs) to list in the domestic market. Global MNCs like Cummins, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Siemens, Unilever, and many others have locally listed subsidiaries. Some are fairly large by Indian standards. For example, ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=876))

- the Unilever subsidiary in India, Hindustan Unilever, is valued at about $70 billion. At first glance, it may appear that these MNCs should be aligned with the Indian minority shareholder. But there have been many instances when they weren’t. A few decades ago, a large global MNC with a listed company in India set up a separate fully owned subsidiary. This makes no logical sense because the global giant has only one listing in its home market. For a minority shareholder of the listed Indian business, this was a stab in the back because the fully owned subsidiary now does a significant amount of business. So why would the parent company do this? Isn’t it interested in value creation? Yes, it is. But it is more interested in the value creation of the parent, not the Indian-listed child. By creating a separate fully owned business, the global MNC has ensured that value accrues to the shareholders in its home market at the cost of the Indian minority shareholder. It gets worse. My friends who have worked for many years in this MNC have told me that its best managers are sent to the privately held business, not the listed company. What can a minority shareholder do? Absolutely nothing. Not all MNCs resort to such shenanigans, but enough do. Even if an MNC has behaved well in the past, there is no reason it wouldn’t change its mind in the future. There is a structural problem with an arrangement in which a parent also has a listed subsidiary. We have better things to do than to participate in this inherent conflict. Last, we are not fans of the Indian conglomerates. The best known is the Tata Group, which Jamsetji Tata established in 1868.29 The group had twenty-nine listed businesses with combined revenues of $128 billion and a market value of $311 billion as of March 2022. They manufacture steel, gold jewelry, air conditioners, tea, and cars. Oh, and they also own and operate five-star luxury hotels from Mumbai to New York. There are many others, like Adani, Aditya Birla, L&T, Mahindra, and RP-Sanjiv Goenka. All typically run a gamut of unrelated businesses across a wide range of industries. We believe that value creation is possible only through sustained focus. However, while focus is necessary, it does not guarantee success in a competitive world; most focused businesses aren’t successful. So how does one achieve excellence in multiple entities across entirely different industries? It’s hard but not impossible. One of the world’s leading technology services businesses is a Tata Group company called TCS, whose market value of around $150 billion was about 25 percent more than that of IBM in mid-2022. You may have seen its name splashed across Manhattan in November in the years it sponsored the New York City Marathon. TCS is the exception that proves the rule. Maybe the Indian conglomerates will succeed in creating great businesses across their entire portfolios one day. But we are unwilling to wait for that glorious future.

- A bumblebee is a hairy insect that barely measures an inch in length.31 The species—there are about three hundred of them—have been around for about thirty million years. They are preyed upon by crab spiders and birds. Their survival strategy was beautifully demonstrated in an experiment conducted by Dr. Tom Ings and Professor Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London, whose work was published in Science Daily in 2008. The scientists created a garden of artificial flowers that also contained some robotic crab spiders. They hid some spiders and made others visible. Whenever a bumblebee landed on a flower with a crab spider, the spider “captured” the bumblebee between its foam pincers. Within a few seconds, the robotic spider released the bee. The team found that the bumblebees soon started committing more type II errors: they started avoiding flowers even where there were no spiders, thereby reducing their foraging efficiency. In the wild, this instinct to avoid danger at the cost of going hungry must have played a significant role in the tremendous success of the species over millions of years.

Living things prioritize survival over everything else. In the animal world, this applies to prey and predator. Plants give up on opportunities to grow by redirecting resources when survival is at stake. 2. Millions of years of evolution have programmed the organic world to minimize errors of commission in favor of errors of omission. 3. Buffett’s two rules of investing (never lose money, and don’t forget to never lose money) are essentially a diktat for eliminating significant risks.

I challenge you to find me a fund manager who professes to buy poor-quality businesses at high prices. Then why does the performance of professional investors vary so widely? One reason—not the only one, but a crucial one—is that our community has wildly different opinions on the meaning of “high,” “quality,” and “fair.” In this section, with many evolutionary theory elements as a backdrop, I will clarify the meaning of these words as they apply to Nalanda. I will discuss what we buy in chapters 2 to 4 and how we buy in chapters 5 to 7. Let’s begin. In Siberia. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=965))

Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth.

- In short, where do you begin? One option would be to analyze each listed business after you have cast aside the high-risk ones. The problem is that you do not have unlimited time. The number of companies may be in the hundreds, and you may need to spend months, if not years, to go through the entire list. One alternative would be to use a two-step process that we use at Nalanda. In the first step, we use one selection criterion that filters out low-quality or average-quality businesses and yields a preliminary list of high-quality companies.

- the second step, we do more work on this preliminary list to further whittle it down to a final list. Our investable universe is around 800 Indian businesses (with a market value of more than $150 million). Of these, we have rejected close to 350 companies to minimize the risks outlined in the previous chapter. About 450 businesses remain. We then apply a single filter to cut down this list to about 150 firms. Let me call this single filter “F.” Remember that F simply gives us the preliminary list on which we need to work further to reject or choose businesses. After doing this work, our final list has only about 75 to 80 businesses. F gave us an excellent head start. And it continues to do so because we don’t spend any time analyzing a business unless F has cleared it. This chapter is about the F filter: what it is and why. What, in your opinion, is F? To do its job, it needs to satisfy three criteria. First, it should be easily measurable. Second, it should remove most, if not all, low-quality businesses. Last, it should select most, if not all, high-quality businesses. Let’s start with some guesses. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1026))

- Okay, let’s recap. We want to use a single filter, F, to select businesses for further analysis. This should hopefully save us a lot of time and effort. We wondered if we could use “quality management teams” or “fast growth” as our starting point. We rejected both as good candidates for F because it is tough to assess the former, and the latter can end up causing heartburn. A third guess for a criterion for short-listing businesses for further analysis could be margins. Is a high-margin business a high-quality business? Many seem to think so. Margins can mean many things: gross margin (sales minus cost of goods sold divided by sales), EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization divided by sales), or EBIT margin (earnings before interest and tax divided by sales). Which of these, if any, should we choose for F? Let’s start with gross margin, which measures the direct cost of producing the product or service being sold; accountants call this the “cost of goods sold.” If a bar of bath soap retails for $1 ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1093))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and costs 30 cents to make, then the gross margin is 70 percent. Does a high gross margin tell us anything about the quality of the business? Not really. Several internet businesses boasted a gross margin of more than 90 percent in the dot-com era, but almost all experienced huge losses because of their marketing spends. What about EBITDA margin or EBIT margin (also called operating margin)? Measuring EBIT margin would be more sensible because it accounts for depreciation, which is a real cost of doing business. But just because it is a better measure does not mean it is a good measure. Take this example of two real-world businesses: Business C has had an operating margin of about 3 percent over the past fifteen years. Business T has delivered an operating margin of 19 percent over the same period. Would you reject Business C and select Business T because T is “better” than C? If you did so, you would have spurned Costco, one of America’s best-run businesses. Business T is Tiffany & Co., a reasonably well-run business but not as well run as Costco. What makes Costco at a margin of 3 percent a better company than Tiffany at 19 percent?9 I ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1101))

- will get to that shortly. Suffice it to say that using margins as a starting point to narrow our list of companies may lead us astray. It fails our second and third criteria (removing most, if not all, low-quality businesses and selecting high-quality businesses). We haven’t yet considered macro factors for building the short list. But which single piece of macro data should we consider for short-listing individual businesses? For example, if “experts” believe that inflation will rise, should we short-list only consumer goods businesses able to pass on the increased cost to their customers? If we do so, should we then completely revise the list if the inflation expectations get reversed within six months? I don’t know how to account for macro factors for short-listing high-quality businesses. I am not suggesting that it is the wrong… ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1110))

- Dmitri Belyaev wanted to answer two questions: (1) How had the domestication of animals (e.g., dogs, pigs, goats, and cows) started, and (2) Why did most domestic animals have similar characteristics, including floppy ears, curly tails, a piebald coloration (patches of black and white), and babyish faces? He believed that the domestication of animals resulted from underlying heritable genetic changes that had occurred during the course of selection over millennia. The big unanswered question was, What was being selected? Natural and artificial selection can occur only if something is selected for generation after generation. For example, whereas both cheetahs and lions are ferocious predators, ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1140))

- among many other factors, cheetahs have been selected for speed and lions for their size and strength. In other words, a slow cheetah is unlikely to leave any offspring, but a big, strong lion is likely to leave many. Dmitri hypothesized that the key factor selected when our ancestors domesticated wild animals was tameness. Thus, the unit of selection was not related to an animal’s physical attributes but to its behavior. This was an audacious guess since most scientists then assumed that physical morphology was the unit of selection. How could Dmitri test his bold theory? Only by going back to the time when animals first started becoming domesticated. For dogs, this would have meant experimenting on wild wolves. But getting a supply of wolves would have been very hard in Siberia, so he chose the silver fox. He designed a selective breeding experiment that focused only on tameness as the selection factor. As described earlier, he recruited Lyudmila Trut, an undergraduate student at the prestigious Moscow University, to lead and manage the experiment in Siberia. Lyudmila would forever ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1146))

She chose a large commercial farm (that sold fox fur) called Lesnoi, more than 350 kilometers from Novosibirsk, where she and her family lived. She began the experiment in the fall of 1960 with about a dozen foxes. She also hired several women from nearby villages to be caretakers and experimenters. Here is how it worked. The experimenters gave the foxes a series of tests from the time they were one month old to their sexual maturity at six to seven months. When a fox pup was one month old, the experimenter extended her hand to offer it food while trying to stroke it. She tested the fox pup twice: once in the cage and once while the pup was roaming freely with other pups in a larger enclosure. She repeated this test monthly until the pup reached… ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1154))

- pups were caged with their mothers until they were about two months old and then with their litter mates. At about three months of age, they were put into their own cages. When the pups were about seven months old, the experimenters assigned them to one of three categories based on their tameness. Class III foxes were unfriendly toward the handlers and either ran away from them or were aggressive. Class II foxes behaved neutrally and displayed no emotional response toward the handlers. Class I foxes were the friendliest and seemed to want to engage with the handlers. Lyudmila and her team selected a few of the calmest Class I foxes for mating and repeated the experiment with the next generation of pups. By the third generation in 1962, Lyudmila noticed that some of the tamer foxes had started mating a few days earlier than usual and were producing slightly larger… ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1163))

No other pup of his generation did so, but even a single fox radically altering its behavior to mimic a dog was significant news. Dmitri had told Lyudmila in their first meeting that he wanted to make a dog out of a fox. Had the process begun? In 1966, many of the sixth-generation pups that Ember had sired started wagging their tails at the handlers. Ember had not been an anomaly—he was a trailblazer. Lyudmila had categorically demonstrated that tail wagging was genetically heritable. By this time, the researchers had to add another class of foxes called Class IE: the elites. These foxes were extremely friendly, were eager to establish human contact, and, like dogs, whimpered to attract attention. In the sixth… ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1171))

- This is a breakneck pace of evolution: In less than forty years, Dmitri and Lyudmila’s experiment had essentially converted a population of wild foxes who avoided humans into dog-like creatures that could be kept as pets in any of our homes. These foxes were very docile, competed for human attention, and formed deep emotional bonds with their handlers. It had become hard to distinguish their behavior from that of dogs. Lyudmila and her team had erased their wildness almost completely. But don’t raise your eyebrows in astonishment just yet. I haven’t even told you the most interesting result of the experiment. The experimenters noticed that the eighth generation of these tamer foxes also started displaying some novel physical traits. The first change was in coat color: Some of the foxes’ fur had a piebald pattern, which is common among domesticated animals like sheep, dogs, horses,… ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1180))

- the generations, they started showing this coloration. Further physical traits to appear were floppy ears and rolled tails—again, common among many domesticated species, especially dogs. In 1974, Lyudmila decided to raise the experiment’s stakes by living with the foxes in the same house. To start, she chose a friendly fox called Pushinka. One evening, Lyudmila was sitting on a bench outside her home with Pushinka relaxing next to her as usual. Suddenly, Pushinka got up as if she had heard something and started barking. It turned out to be the night guard, and Pushinka stopped her aggressive posturing and barking when she realized that the guard posed no imminent danger to Lyudmila. This guard-dog-like behavior—rushing to protect a human from a potential threat—had never been observed before by Lyudmila. In the early 1990s, the team also started noticing that the skulls and jaws of the domesticated foxes had started diverging from those of their wild brethren. The cranial height and width of the domesticated foxes’ skulls had shortened. Their snouts had become shorter and wider giving them a baby-like appearance—almost exactly mimicking the differences between a dog and a wolf. Let’s consider this for a moment. Remember, Dmitri and his team were selecting for only one trait: the willingness of foxes to be tamed. They weren’t interested in body size, coat color, skull shape, ear stiffness, or anything else. The experimenters took great care to ensure selection based only on tameness. But this single filter of a behavioral characteristic had triggered many physical changes in the animals. How could this have happened? There were no new mutations in the domesticated silver foxes, but their gene expression had changed owing to the… ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1188))

- no oxytocin is released. Although it’s the same gene in question, the gene expression is different in different situations. Scientists have demonstrated that gene expression needs to change only a little to have a significant impact on an animal’s body and behavior. As Lyudmila and her team selected tamer foxes, they unknowingly impacted the expression of a select set of genes. This selection altered the amount and timing of release of certain neurochemicals and hormones that regulated the developmental and physical traits of the foxes. For example, the hormone melatonin is known to manipulate the timing of mating in many species. The researchers found that the elite females released a lot more melatonin than their Class II and III peers and were ready for mating a few days earlier than normal. The hormonal change was so extreme that some females were ready to mate twice a year, a phenomenon… ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1205))

- in shaping the early development of an animal and its increase is likely to have changed the physiology and behavior of the domesticated foxes. The researchers also discovered that the tamed foxes had much lower levels of adrenaline than their wild cousins. Adrenaline regulates the production of melanin, which determines the coloration of skin and fur. The silver fox experiment also solved the centuries-old puzzle of the numerous physical similarities among domesticated animals discussed earlier. Dmitri had rightly hypothesized that since mammals share similar hormonal and neurotransmitter regulatory systems, selecting for tameness would unleash broadly similar developmental and physical changes in them as well. Dmitri and Lyudmila’s experiment, now running for more than sixty years, has demonstrated that evolution does not occur piecemeal. The behavior and physiology of animals are intimately connected.

- The first word first. Historical. I devote an entire chapter to this important and oft-ignored word, but for now I wanted to clarify that the ROCE number is what a business has delivered in the past. We don’t listen to stories about how ROCE will improve in the future. We want to assess a company purely on its historically delivered ROCE. Now let’s look at some definitions. ROCE is simply the operating profit of the business as a percentage of total capital employed. As defined earlier, operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. Why do we not use profit after tax (PAT) instead? Remember, we want to understand a business’s operating performance, and mixing it with financial measures like tax and interest will muddy the waters. We do not ignore tax or interest charges in our overall evaluation of the business, but for calculating ROCE, we limit ourselves to operating performance.

- than debt) because extra cash is not an operating asset. Also, high-ROCE companies generate a lot of cash, and incorporating cash into the capital employed number will unnecessarily reduce ROCE. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can include a portion of cash in capital employed. For an acquisitive company, we also include the capital invested in acquiring businesses, but let’s keep things simple for the moment. Thus, ROCE for nonfinancial companies can be defined as follows: EBIT ÷ (net working capital + net fixed assets) Do you now see why using operating margin to filter businesses may not be the best approach? Margins do not tell us what we had to invest to get those margins. The advantage of measuring ROCE is that it accounts for the quality of P&L (in the numerator) as well as the balance sheet (in the denominator). Let’s return to Costco and Tiffany.

Let’s take the example of just one important part of its capital employed: inventory. Costco keeps about 31 days of inventory in its warehouses and retail stores. Guess the same number for Tiffany. It is 521 days, or almost a year and half! Tiffany’s operating margin is impressive, but Costco’s dramatically better management of its inventory and other assets ensures it earns a higher ROCE than Tiffany. Many investors prefer return on equity (ROE). I don’t. ROE is calculated after taxes and interest payments, and hence mixes operating performance with financing strategy and tax structure.

- What does a high ROCE of, say, 20 percent tell us? A simple fact: This business earns $20 for every $100 it invests. This is equivalent to making a bank deposit of $100 and earning $20 on it after a year. No, you are not in a hyper-inflationary Latin American economy but in the “normal” world. I assume you would be on the moon if you owned a high-ROCE business like that. They are rare, but they do exist, and when you find them, they will tell you a lot. High ROCE is a lot like tameness in the Siberian silver foxes. Just as tameness brings with it a curly tail, piebald fur, and floppy ears, a high-ROCE business ushers in many attributes relevant for an owner like us at Nalanda. Here are some examples.

Similarly, in my view, an excellent—but not the only—indicator of the quality of the management team is their historical track record on the quantity of ROCE.

- The median historical ROCE of our portfolio of thirty businesses—most of which are more than thirty-five to forty years old—is about 42 percent. I am obviously biased since I am an investor in these businesses, but I do think the management teams of these businesses are excellent. Are they exemplary, or am I just calling them first rate because they happen to have high ROCE? I don’t know. Does it matter? We should expect the following from a quality management team. That they deliver products and services to their customers that are superior to those of their competitors, allocate capital prudently, attract and retain quality employees, manage their cost structure (which is commensurate with their size and revenue), maintain a quality balance sheet, and continuously innovate by taking calculated risks. All this should—and does—correlate with high ROCE. A Consistently High-ROCE Business Is Likely to Have a Strong Competitive Advantage All long-term investors, mentored by more than five decades of Buffett’s letters and annual meetings, demand that companies have a “sustainable competitive advantage” (SCA). But how does one go about assessing whether a company has an SCA? If you peruse business and investment books, the sources of SCA turn out to be the usual suspects: brand, intellectual property, network effect, economies of scale, and low cost.13 Let’s analyze “brand” as a source of competitive advantage. Almost every investor I know justifies a consumer-focused company’s stock market success by touting brand and distribution as the sources of competitive advantage. One of the great consumer-focused investment success stories began more than thirty years ago in 1988 and 1989 when Buffett purchased Coke and Gillette shares.

Almost three decades after this letter, Coke and Gillette continue to be enormous successes and, given their increasing market share, continue to have a solid competitive advantage. But did Buffett conclude that they had a strong competitive advantage because they had strong brands and product attributes, or was his claim based on the empirical fact that these businesses had high ROCE and an increasing market share over a long period? We will never know of course. My guess (contention?) is that it was the latter. The reality is that most brands don’t have any—forget about “sustainable”—competitive advantage.

If something as simple to understand as a “brand” does not necessarily confer a competitive advantage (and even if it does, it is probably very tough to definitively say so), how do we know if a company has a competitive advantage? No prizes for guessing. Yes, a sustained high ROCE is a good starting point to conclude that the company may have some kind of competitive advantage.

Havells is India’s largest consumer electrical equipment business and sells fans, lights and lighting fixtures, circuit breakers, wire, water heaters, and kitchen appliances like blenders and toasters.15 Havells delivered 52 percent ROCE (!) from 2007 to 2017 under its exceptional leader, Anil Gupta. Its annualized revenue growth was about 15 percent during this period, and Havells was sitting on a cash balance of $230 million in March 2017. This was about 28 percent of revenue that year. In May 2017, Havells acquired the consumer… ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1352))

- balance was larger than the acquisition price, it was taking a risk that was outside our comfort zone. The biggest issue, we thought, was the difference in culture and company mindset. Havells sells high-quality products at a premium to the discerning Indian consumer. It does so by setting up high-tech manufacturing plants, customizing product features to the needs of the consumer, staying ahead of the technology curve, and creating brand pull by advertising on TV and the internet. Lloyd seemed to be the exact opposite of Havells in many ways: It had gained market share over the past decade by aggressively pushing low-priced air conditioners imported from China. While Havells “pulled” consumers, Lloyd “pushed” its products by offering large dealer incentives and product discounts. Lloyd seemed singularly focused on growth at any price, whereas Havells’ growth was an outcome of… ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1362))

- company has built a loyal and high-performing dealership network over many decades. This symbiotic relationship has allowed Havells to manufacture and sell an extensive range of consumer durables from fans to circuit breakers to toasters. However, for the first time, with the Lloyd acquisition, Havells was unable to use the strength of its dealer network because the air conditioner sales channel was completely different from the consumer electricals channel in India. Unsurprisingly, the company immediately began facing problems with the acquisition. It started with the resignation of the CEO of Lloyd and many senior managers within a few months of the change in ownership. Havells found that Lloyd was selling its products through only a few dealers who had grown quite powerful over the years. These dealers were demanding higher margins and a greater share of Lloyd’s business. When Havells refused, many of these dealers left, adversely impacting the sales and profitability of the business. There was also some level of dissonance while the Havells management tried to reconcile two radically different brand positioning approaches: the premium positioning of Havells versus the aggressive price warrior stance of Lloyd. Within two years of the acquisition, research analysts downgraded Havells as Lloyd’s numbers continued to disappoint. At this stage, Gupta could have taken the easy route of allowing Lloyd to revert to its old business ways. This would have preserved revenue and profit momentum and created two different kinds of business under the same umbrella. But he decided to take the much tougher road of instituting long-term fundamental changes to Lloyd’s organization and business model. Gupta repositioned the Lloyd brand from being a low-priced, average-quality product that offered only basic… ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1370))

One key reason Havells was able to withstand short-term pain to achieve its longer-term goals was the availability of cash on the balance sheet. And the reason it had accumulated cash was its exceptionally high ROCE over many years. It’s easy for any company to claim that it is “working for long-term value creation,” but these words are worthless without the courage provided by a cash cushion. We will never know what would have happened if Havells had had a lot of debt and interest to repay, but I doubt it would have had the same determination to continue on a challenging, lengthy, and uncertain path with bankers breathing down its neck. Havells made a moderately risky… ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1387))

After the companies have been through the risk filter, as I discussed in chapter 1, we reject companies with long-term historical ROCE lower than 20 percent. Our preliminary short list of about 150 companies consists only of those that have delivered ROCE of more than 20 percent over the past five to ten years or more. I have not claimed that we look only at ROCE to arrive at our conclusion on a business. That would border on being reckless and foolish. What I have said, though, is that we start the evaluation of a business by studying the record of its delivered historical ROCE.

- Buy one, get many free. As you may have guessed, there are two problems with the approach of choosing ROCE as the first filter. First, a consistently high ROCE in the past does not guarantee that ROCE will be high in the future. For example, if a business has a monopoly in its industry, say, of operating local bus services or a copper mine, even a poor-quality management team would probably be able to earn a decent return on capital. When the monopoly ends, however, we may see ROCE trend downward. Similarly, if there is high tariff protection for a product or commodity, domestic companies manufacturing the same product or commodity may earn decent profits without breaking a sweat. And then there is luck. A company can make decent ROCE for a few years if its key competitors get in trouble of their own making. While making the preliminary short list, we can easily… ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1404))

- the founder gets distracted, the company decides to change its strategy, the management bets the company on a failed acquisition, or an aggressive new competitor makes life difficult for the company. While high ROCE can provide some cushion in the face of these mishaps, there are limits to which it can safeguard a business hell-bent on destroying itself. But remember this chapter is about where you start looking for great businesses, not what guarantees great investment return (spoiler alert: nothing does). The second problem with making a preliminary list of only high-ROCE businesses is that it rejects companies that may become hugely successful in the future. Take Netflix. If we had evaluated Netflix in early 2018, its median ROCE for the previous ten years (2008 to 2017) of 10 percent would have been too low for us to include it on our preliminary list.

- One of the greatest wonders of this world is this: Living things are highly resistant to internal and external changes while simultaneously possessing the ability to evolve.2 Let me call this ability to function well despite internal and external disturbances “robustness.” If the first proto-single-celled organism were too robust, it would have remained unchanged over 3.5 billion years, and we would not have had mushrooms or meerkats or Manhattan. On the other hand, if it were not robust enough, it would have gone extinct quite quickly in the volcanic and violent days of the early earth. You and I and all the living things we see around us are here because organic life has been able to strike a delicate balance between maintaining the status quo and evolving when the need arises. How does this happen, and what can we learn from it as investors? This dual trick—of changing while remaining unchanged—results from two separate but intimately linked phenomena.

- Let’s now go one level up from proteins to the body by taking the example of sea urchins. Sea urchins evolved 250 million years ago and comprise about 1,000 species. For now, we will focus on just two found in shallow waters in Australia: Heliocidaris tuberculata and Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Let’s call them species T and E. Their body plans are conserved; in other words, they look the same but have dramatically different modes of development. T produces larvae (called pluteus) that bear no physical resemblance to the adult, and these free-swimming pluteus feed on plankton as they grow into adulthood. E, on the other hand, develops directly from an egg with no larval stage in between. But T and E are quite closely related and diverged only about five million years ago (almost the same time that chimpanzees and humans diverged; it would be as if chimps produced larvae that did not look like adult chimps!). The entire development programs—the shape and size of eggs, the location of cell formation for various body parts, the activation of genes that control development—of these two species differ so significantly that it is almost unbelievable that the two species have a common ancestor from only five million years ago. Despite these massive developmental changes, if you do a Google search for images of T and E, you will notice that they look almost the same. How have the sea urchins maintained their body plans while changing many fundamental aspects of their development? And what have they achieved by maintaining highly robust body plans while evolving drastically different routes of development? We will get to these questions in a moment, but for now, let me summarize what we have learned. We have seen that the stability of living organisms and species is maintained through robustness at multiple levels: at the levels of genetic code, proteins, and even body plan. For the sake of brevity, I have chosen to omit details of robustness at many other levels: changes in the secondary structure of RNA, changes in the regulatory regions of a gene, and drastic changes in enzyme activity, just to name a few. A mutation changes the DNA sequence of a gene? No problem. It produces the same amino acid. The amino acid sequence changes owing to mutation or recombination? No problem. It produces the same protein. There is a change in the arrangement of proteins? No problem. The same enzyme activity continues. And so on. Living things are built to be resilient and resistant to change. ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1600))

- We need to make a brief foray into one aspect of the history of molecular biology to unravel the paradox. In 1968, the Japanese geneticist Motoo Kimura proposed the “neutral theory” of molecular evolution.8 Kimura contended that most changes at the level of DNA and amino acids do not impact the function of a molecule and hence the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. He contended that a small number of mutations are favorable, and natural selection preserves them. Some mutations are rejected because they are harmful, but most mutations don’t really affect the organism. According to Kimura, most mutations are neutral, which causes robustness in the organism. So how does neutral mutation lead to evolution? While a neutral change does not alter the primary function, it can alter a secondary function, thereby becoming the source of a future innovation. Let’s say gene A has primary function F. Owing to a mutation, gene A becomes gene B, but since it’s a robust system, gene B continues to perform function F. But gene B affects a secondary ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1622))

You will notice that, unlike in chapter 2, where we used the quantitative criterion of ROCE to select businesses, many factors contributing to robustness are qualitative.

For example, they help their clients close the books of accounts, manage payables and receivables, perform timely consumer analytics, process mortgage applications, and address customer issues. We had been tracking WNS since we started Nalanda in 2007.

The stock crashed to $13 in early 2008. However, we concluded that the company would become more robust with a more fragmented customer base. We bought about 6 percent of the business from January to March 2008. Fast-forward thirteen years, and in 2020, WNS’s top five clients accounted for only 25 percent of revenue.

- In a robust business, just as in a living organism, evolvability comes free. Take the example of two businesses in an industry. Company A is the leader, and on sales of $100, it earns a margin of 20 percent. Let’s assume its capital employed (in fixed assets, receivables, and inventory) is $50. Company A’s ROCE is quite healthy at 40 percent (100 × 20% ÷ 50). If a company’s growth is lower than its ROCE, it will also keep generating free cash flow, and so Company A has no debt. Company B is a weak player in the industry with half the sales of Company A, $50, and a margin of 15 percent. Since it does not have enough bargaining power with suppliers (who demand early payment) or customers (who pay late), its capital employed is the same as that of Company A ($50). Company B’s ROCE is 15 percent (50 × 15% ÷ 50). Company B has a debt of $10 (which is not much, given its… ([Location 1700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1700))

- COVID-19 strikes, and the country goes into a lockdown. Sales at both companies fall by half, and so do the operating margins. Company A, being a leader, can collect cash and liquidate inventory so that its capital employed falls to $25. Company B, on the other hand, while suffering the same drop in sales and margins as Company A, is rebuffed by its customers while asking for money and is also unable to sell its finished goods in a demand-poor environment. Its capital employed stays flat at $50. Company A’s ROCE is now 20 percent (50 × 10% ÷ 25), and Company B’s is 4 percent (25 × 7.5% ÷ 50). Thus, even during the pandemic, Company A earns a respectable ROCE, allowing it to invest in growth. Fortified by its ROCE of 20 percent, Company A can also borrow in the market if it needs to, since the cost of debt is just 5 percent and the company is debt free. From being comfortably mediocre during the pre-pandemic era, Company B risks oblivion because it no longer has the money to invest in production, marketing, and distribution. At 4 percent ROCE, it would struggle to pay its debt at 5 percent. Given its precarious balance sheet and declining profits, lenders would also hesitate to lend it more money. At least in the near term, a likely outcome is that Company A gains market share and Company B further loses its position. Since Company A had a higher degree of robustness owing to its high ROCE, it could adapt and evolve in an adverse external environment. What I have outlined is not a theoretical construct. We have seen this story play out in many of our businesses. When the pandemic began, the general opinion was that all Indian businesses would suffer. Sharp stock market declines in March and April 2020 mirrored this opinion.

In a not dissimilar manner, I have discovered over more than two decades of investing that more levels of robustness lead to more evolvability.

- these seven for now. My aim is to point you in a certain direction, not to spoon-feed. We want our companies to tilt toward the left side of table 3.1 across all factors. Thus, we want the business to be robust at the level of ROCE and concentration of customer base and degree of leverage and strength of competitive advantage, and so on. Is this asking for a lot? You bet. We are permanent owners—the key word here being “permanent.” If a business can’t last permanently, we don’t want to own it. Without several levels of robustness, how will we be sure that the business will survive over the long term? I wish I could categorically answer the question, Is this a robust business? As a practicing investor, I know that assessing robustness is a matter of judgment and that there is no shortcut to this process. I have arrived at a certain heuristic after many years of investing. There clearly are black-and-white extremes to robustness (e.g., a business with just two customers) but in many, maybe even most, businesses, it is the gray zone that stares at us. For example, is a company with a debt/equity ratio of 2.0 robust? Probably not. What about a ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1746))

Despite the company having debt—which was small to begin with—we concluded that the company was robust because it was the clear industry leader, had been gaining market share over its competitors, had a return on capital of more than 30 percent, had successfully designed and launched many products over the past decade, had thousands of distribution points across India, was able to negotiate the best terms with its suppliers, and had not wasted time and money on unnecessary… ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1756))

Apart from Sam Walton being the founder, though, I don’t know what other factors have led to its success. I can rattle off a list of things from various business books and articles written on Walmart, but I don’t know if they were the cause or the effect of its success.

- Robustness Is a Proxy for Evolutionary and Business Success but Doesn’t Guarantee It Dinosaurs, a diverse group of more than a thousand reptilian species, dominated our planet for 180 million years.17 As a matter of comparison, we Homo sapiens have been around for less than 0.2 million years. Dinosaurs couldn’t have survived and thrived for so long unless they were highly robust and adaptable. Molecular evidence has shown that many modern mammalian orders—Carnivora, Primata, Proboscidea—coexisted with dinosaurs for at least 30 million years during the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), and maybe even earlier. The mammals during the era of dinosaurs were small, squirrel sized, and probably insectivores. If aliens had landed on our planet 65 million years ago, they never could have predicted that a small offshoot of the insignificant mammalians would reign supreme one day. The cataclysmic aftermath of an asteroid strike in the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. But the mammals survived. No one is sure why. The extraordinary robustness of dinosaurs did not guarantee their evolvability. In general, the greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability. But sometimes, robustness ceases to help businesses adapt. We can see this in Gap’s failure to grow despite the company being very robust. Its revenue stayed flat at about $16 billion from 2005 to 2020, although it delivered ROCE of 20 percent or more for more than a decade and had no leverage. In general, multiple levels of robustness are better than a ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1861))

- single level. But sometimes, even multiple levels of robustness can’t safeguard the future of a business, as has been the case for thousands of newspapers across the world. In general, highly robust businesses evolve by taking calculated risks. But sometimes, very rarely, businesses can succeed by taking huge risks, as shown by Netflix. We at Nalanda never bet against the odds. And so, despite some rare counterexamples, we have kept and will continue to keep robustness at the front and center of our investment approach. As permanent owners, we seek robustness in companies as the best available benchmark to assess if they are likely to adapt and survive over the long term. A better measure may exist, but I don’t know what it is. We invest only in highly robust companies. Many of them have stayed robust and have grown their sales and profits over decades. But our track record is not perfect. We have witnessed two key problems with this approach. First, a business can lose its robustness. We saw this happen to one of our consumer-focused companies; we still don’t know how or why it lost its way. We invested in this business almost twenty years after its creation.

When we invested, the company had no debt, its sales had grown 20 percent annually for the past five years, and it had delivered ROCE of more than 50 percent. Within a few years of our investing, the company’s inventory and receivables started climbing steeply, a leading indicator of potential sales issues. While the company continued to show profits, it had begun consuming cash—while having been a cash generator in earlier years. As a result, it had to start borrowing money just as its ability to repay the loans declined. Being a permanent owner, we are tolerant of declining sales or margins or market share. But we will not risk survivability. As the company’s robustness nose-dived, we exited the business at a loss. The company survives but is a pale reflection of its former glory. This unexplained decline of… ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=1883))

- unwilling to implement any neutral strategies to expand its customer base, product segments, or geographies. As a result, the company has grown its sales at less than 5 percent annually for a decade, and its profits have stayed flat during this period. To be fair, its industry has gone through a vicious downcycle, and this business is the only one among its peers that continues to generate profits and free cash flow, and it remains debt free. It is also the only business in our portfolio that has taken robustness to its extreme by eschewing calculated risks. Maybe it is in an industry in which it can’t or shouldn’t. Perhaps when the industry upcycle arrives, it will finally see growth. Or maybe not. We will continue to remain owners in the business. While our returns have been positive, they have been below par. But I love them—they are a class apart in a very tough place. We are willing to sacrifice growth for robustness. We have made almost forty investments to date, and in all of them, robustness was a primary—but not the only—selection criterion. We have worked on the assumption that robustness will lead to growth and evolution. This assumption has failed us on two occasions: one in which the company lost robustness and another in which the company’s excessive focus on robustness compromised growth. I am surprised at our strategy’s low failure rate. We have been quite lucky, and while robustness should continue to reward us across our portfolio, we will continue to encounter failures of the first or second kind over time.

We have sought a margin of safety on business quality by demanding high ROCE and a wide competitive moat, on the strength of the balance sheet by requiring it to be debt free, on the bargaining power of customers and suppliers by requiring them to be fragmented, and on the sustainability of economics by insisting that the industry be slow-changing.

They are now at the starting line of the Boston Marathon. What would you expect their coach to do before the race starts? If I were the coach, I would advise them to withdraw from the race, rest and recover for a few months, and slowly build their mileage back up. Maybe your advice would be different—you might counsel them to take it easy and just finish the race without worrying about a podium finish to minimize damage to the body.

There is a paradox in the living world: Organic life is highly complex but not fragile. Organisms have survived hundreds of millions of years despite living in constantly changing external environments and undergoing a barrage of internal mutations. This is because they are robust at multiple levels. 2. Thus, an accidental change in DNA sequence does not affect which amino acids are made; a change in amino acids or their sequence does not impact the synthesis of proteins; and a change in proteins need not affect the body plan of an organism. 3. Neutral mutations permit new functions and adaptations to arise without disrupting current functioning. 4.

A robust business has high ROCE, minimal or zero debt, a strong competitive advantage, fragmented customer and supplier bases, a stable management team, and is in a slow-changing industry. 6. Just because a business is robust today does not mean it will continue to be so. Our only protection against the loss of robustness of a business is to be price sensitive.

- them before I saw them. They scurry noisily at a surprisingly brisk pace. The males have impressive-looking horns, and the eight thousand species have almost as many different kinds of horns. Their shape resembles rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, deer antlers, and even a serrated knife; their size varies from very small to massive. Some are even larger than the entire dung beetle’s body. What explains these horns? One way evolutionary biologists describe them is through hormonal, developmental, and genetic mechanisms. For example, a 2019 Science article provides evidence that dung beetles use wing genes to grow their horns.2 The wing genes get turned on in the early stages of the growth of the horns. Later, these genes switch off, and a new set of genes grows and shapes the horns.

- Another route of exploring the cause of horns is to understand the adaptive nature of them. These are “why” questions: Why did horns arise? Why do they increase the fitness of the beetle? Why can horns be considered an adaptation? The selectionist explanation contends that the horns of male dung beetles allow the bearer to garner more resources, defend their nests, and compete for the best females, thereby reproducing more than the males without horns. For example, an article in the Journal of Insect Behavior describes an experiment providing evidence that males with larger horns get preferential access to females and thus can be considered adaptive. The same article also describes the adaptive value of small horns in some males. These males have greater mobility and can sneak around the larger males to mate with the females! The first category of explanations for the dung beetle’s horns—addressing the “how” question—are called proximate causes, and the second—addressing the “why” question—are ultimate causes. Proximate mechanisms explore immediate, physical influences on a trait. The history of the organism determines ultimate causes, specifically the role played by natural selection to favor one trait versus another. To elaborate further, let’s talk about sex. Or more precisely, polyandry in the predatory mite species Neoseiulus californicus.4 Polyandry implies multiple matings by the female of a species and is the opposite of polygyny, wherein a male succeeds in mating with multiple females. Bateman’s principle, named after an English geneticist, argues for the prevalence of polygyny in the animal kingdom. He contended that since females invest much more in offspring than do males, they are the limiting factor over which males compete, leading to polygyny. However,… ([Location 2078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2078))

- sets of explanations: one “proximate” and one “ultimate.” The scientists discovered that the ultimate cause of polyandry in N. californicus consists of both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Females that mated multiple times produced more offspring than females that mated just once, and these offspring also survived longer. As for the proximate cause, the authors identified a key one: first mating duration. If the females’ first mating period was below a certain threshold (150 minutes), the likelihood of their continuing to seek male partners increased. The immediate cause of females seeking more sex was a lack of sex. Who says science is boring?

- We want the businesses we own to increase in value over the long run. And the only way for this to happen is for the company to perform well over many years, preferably decades. Investment success may not correlate with business success for a day trader or short-term investor. But for us, the ultimate success of an investment is almost entirely dependent on the ultimate success of the business. If you accept this premise, then as permanent owners, we should focus exclusively on the quality and performance of the business over the long run. And that is what we do. However, this is easier said than done. In today’s world of Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, WhatsApp, and other soul-destroying inventions, it is not easy to escape the din of proximate noise that can drown out the desire to seek sources of ultimate success. When there is a specter of a Greek default, an announcement of reduced jobs growth in the United States, OPEC negotiations break down, the Federal Reserve hints that the days of low interest rates are over, or company revenue falls, stocks can fall. Similarly, a bullish projection by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on world growth, the recapitalization of banks in China, the success of a new product launch, or the increased pace of vaccination for a global pandemic can lead to higher stock prices. All these are proximate causes of price movement. And all are divorced from what could ultimately lead to the business success or failure—and hence a higher or lower market value—of a company. The question we investors don’t ask often enough but should is relatively straightforward: Does this proximate cause have anything to do with the cause of ultimate business success?

He switched to picking stocks and, like Buffett, eschewed diversification.

- Here is my question for you: What do you think Nikola’s market value was at the end of December 2020, three months after the Hindenburg exposé? Remember that the company had no battery or fuel cell technology, had no prototype, its founder had exited ignominiously, GM had terminated the partnership, and the government had begun investigating fraud. My answer would be close to zero. Nope. It was $6 billion! The Hindenburg report appeared to be fact based: They backed up almost all their assertions with documents, photographs, text messages, videos, and interviews. I am in no position to double-check their research. However, the facts that Milton resigned and GM terminated the partnership seem to indicate that a reasonable portion—if not all—of the report was credible. If so, how does one explain a $6 billion valuation for a company like Nikola? That’s an unfair question because I doubt anyone fully understands how companies are valued. But in this case, I want to offer a two-word answer. Thematic investing. The theme being “new-age automotive companies will rule the world.” Automotive tech start-ups have been a rage since 2020.15 According to an article in the Financial Times in January 2021, these companies had amassed a market value of $60 billion, but most had not generated a single dollar of revenue. And why didn’t they have any revenue? Because, like Nikola, they didn’t even have a product! The popular saying “fact is stranger than fiction” is tailor made for the valuation of new-age automotive start-ups.

- First, TAM. Every theme I have encountered since the start of my investing career in 1998 plays on the enormous size of the addressable market. And the size is usually so large that it dwarfs the businesses currently operating in that industry or theme. No wonder it is usually the most salient proximate cause of a theme gone wild. In March 2021, a UBS report touted the zero-emission trucking market as potentially $1.5 trillion in size, and current manufacturers and start-ups raced to grab dominance. Tesla, which did ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2434))

It makes astrology-based forecasts look respectable. TAM is pointless because it does not tell us whether any profits will be made, and even if a business can be profitable, TAM is silent on who will make that moolah.

- The second reason for the seductiveness of a proximate theme is its simplicity. Even a casual reader of business news will be aware of themes like e-commerce, renewable energy, electric vehicles, fintech, food delivery, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, infrastructure, and biotech. Unlike economic forecasting, which is full of jargon like “GDP” and “monetary supply,” a layperson can relate to themes. Anyone can understand what renewable energy is and that the country needs a lot more infrastructure investment. For the automotive tech start-ups, the simple argument goes as follows. Electric and autonomous vehicles will conquer the world, and since Tesla’s market value is $700 billion, shouldn’t this theme capture trillions of dollars of value in the near future? And if so, why shouldn’t a start-up be valued at billions of dollars? The premise is seductive because it is straightforward. Third, it is actionable. If you believe in the theme that consumers will order more food sitting at home because it is cheaper and easier than dining out, you can invest in DoorDash or Deliveroo. Are you interested in an electric vehicle company with actual revenues? Hail Tesla. Do you believe in the providers of technology rather than the car? Velodyne Lidar beckons. Do you think trucks are a bigger opportunity? Nikola is pining for you. Why does it matter that its founder was probably a charlatan? I don’t know where the theme of automotive start-ups will end up in 2025 or 2030. What I do know, based on the history of capital markets and new-age technologies like railways and the internet, is that this theme will face its comeuppance someday.

- The Indian market is no different. At various times since the start of my investing career in 1998, I have witnessed the following themes create and then destroy billions of dollars of value in the capital markets: real estate, infrastructure, education, microfinance, consumer lending, and technology services. In addition, until early 2022, on paper, the following themes have created (but not yet destroyed) a lot of value in Indian private markets: edtech, fintech, e-commerce, software-as-a-service (SaaS), logistics, and social media. Based on history, many of these concepts will crater; I just don’t know which ones or when. How should we separate the proximate causes from the ultimate ones when there is euphoria or bearishness in a theme? Unfortunately, I am not aware of a foolproof method for doing so. But here is what we do. We define our unit of analysis clearly as the company. Not the economy, not the market, not a theme. We care about the fundamentals of the company—nothing else. We have never invested in a theme and never will. ([Location 2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2472))

- We are permanent owners in businesses and do not sell unless there is irreparable damage to a business. Were these lapses temporary, or would the company be able to overcome this adversity? As I have discussed in this chapter, we ignore proximate problems related to the economy, the market, and even the industry. But the dilemma is much trickier to address when the proximate cause of problems relates to the company itself. Suppose the sales growth and profitability of the company has declined in the past few quarters, whereas its main competitors showed no such struggle. How would you decide if the performance issues are related to proximate (and hence temporary) causes or ultimate (and hence more permanent) causes? In my experience, developing a method and an instinct to separate proximate and ultimate causes of failure or success when they relate to a company event is invaluable for a long-term investor. I have been an investor for more than two decades, and this is where I stumble most often. As usual, at the extremes, the decision is straightforward. If the share price declines owing to a downturn in one or two quarters, we ignore the decline, considering it a proximate event. But if the decline results from a loss of market share for three years in a row, we ask if there is something fundamentally wrong with the business. It is the gray area in between these extremes that creates the worst headaches for us. I do not know of any foolproof method of cracking the conundrum; the answer is almost always very company specific.

Evolutionary biology explores natural phenomena by searching for proximate and ultimate causes. Proximate mechanisms explain immediate influences on a trait. The role played by natural selection explains the ultimate cause of an organism’s success or failure in an environment. 2. Thus, to understand the impressive size and variety of dung beetle horns, evolutionary biologists ask the proximate question (e.g., which network of genes was switched on?), as well as the ultimate question (e.g., what is the adaptive value of the horns?).

The investing world, too, must differentiate between proximate and ultimate causes. Proximate causes of share price changes can result from the macroeconomy, the markets, the industry, or the company itself. Since proximate causes are highly salient (e.g., the Fed announcing an interest rate cut or a company announcing a slowing of sales growth), investors may erroneously overweight them in their decision-making process. 4. We ignore all proximate causes when analyzing businesses. We focus exclusively on the business fundamentals, or the ultimate causes of the success or failure of businesses. 5. We were aggressive investors during the financial crisis of 2008 and the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic because proximate worries compelled the markets to overlook the ultimate causes of the success of many high-quality businesses.

- Have you heard the saying that no one gets fired for hiring IBM? Something similar seems to be going on in the fund management industry. If a fund manager has a low active share, they are unlikely to get beaten by the market by a significant margin, and since everyone else is in the same boat, their risk of getting fired is relatively low. At least one thing fund managers have learned from herbivores in the wild is that there is safety in numbers. There are many other reasons for fund managers’ underperformance. For example, poor performance also correlates with higher portfolio turnover, owning stocks with greater liquidity, investing in growth stocks, higher expense ratios, and many other factors. You can find all these and many more reasons for the dismal performance of fund managers in numerous research articles in prestigious finance journals. What you will not find in these articles is the crux of this chapter. I believe a crucial reason for the continued underperformance of fund managers is their focus on future rewards while ignoring the treasures of the past. We at Nalanda pursue the profession of investing the same way evolutionary biologists do: We interpret the present in the context of history. Evolutionary biology does not make predictions as physics and chemistry do. Nor do we. Instead, our investment approach attempts to explain the present by interpreting what occurred in the past.

In this chapter, I want to focus on only one aspect of his method, which is evident in his groundbreaking book On the Origin of Species: his focus on historical information to make deductions about ongoing evolutionary processes. Darwin proposed not one, not two, but three revolutionary theories in Origin: natural selection, sexual selection, and common ancestry. Let’s briefly see what these theories are and how he used history in all of them to arrive at his radical explanation of all organic life. First, let’s discuss his best-known theory: natural selection. In my layperson’s view, the reason Darwin’s crowning achievement—the theory of natural selection—was not discovered earlier and remained unaccepted by many stalwarts during and after his lifetime was that few understood the powerful effect of small changes accumulated over very long periods of time. But for those who understood the relevance of history, the theory was so powerful and straightforward that the famous biologist Thomas Huxley remarked, ([Location 2703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2703))

- “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.”8 Natural selection requires three key ingredients.9 First, there needs to be random variation among the progeny of an organism. Note the word “random.” Variation does not seek any goal. Second, there needs to be differential fitness among these variants such that injurious variations get rejected and favorable ones are preserved. Last, the favorable traits must be heritable so that they are passed on to the next generation. Then, these three elements repeat ad infinitum over millions, even billions, of years. Resulting in a pangolin from a protozoan. In Darwin’s own words, “This preservation of favorable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called natural selection.” Let’s look at giraffes to understand Darwin’s insight.

This long-necked creature may have had better nutrition on reaching adulthood than its herbivore competitors because it could reach taller trees to eat more succulent shoots and leaves. Better and more food could have made this giraffe healthier and more robust, helping it evade predators. Consequently, it could have mated more frequently and produced more offspring than its shorter-necked competitors. These offspring would generally have had long necks, but neck length would have varied. The longer-necked ones would be likely to have better nutrition, be subject to lower predation, and have more mates than their shorter-necked siblings. And because long necks are heritable (Darwin did not know that genes are responsible for heredity, but he knew that something was), some of the… ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2723))

- for millennia, and voilà, we have the current-day giraffe. Darwin collated a vast range of historical clues to arrive at his theory of natural selection, and this is not the place to list all of them. So instead, let me share just a few. Darwin was a creationist when he started his journey aboard HMS Beagle. “Whilst on board the Beagle, I was quite orthodox,” he writes in his autobiography.11 At Cambridge, Darwin had studied the books of Reverend William Paley, who had made the famous watch analogy to prove the existence of God.12 Paley’s argument ran as follows. He asserted that if someone were to find a watch with all its complex machinery lying on the ground, one would conclude that someone knowledgeable had produced it. The various parts of the watch, working in perfect unison, could not have been assembled by accident. Hence, Paley argued that since nature is infinitely more complex than a watch, we must conclude that an intelligent designer is behind the universe’s creation. As Darwin sailed around the world observing nature, collecting specimens, and writing copious notes, he started harboring doubts. Then, in 1832, he found his first fossil remains in an Argentinian bay called Punta Alta. The fossilized thigh bone and teeth seemed to be from an extinct giant sloth. Georges Cuvier, the founder of paleontology, showed that the earth had witnessed many extinction episodes and presented two indisputable facts.13 First, the fossil remains of the past have no living peers; second, the older the fossil, the greater the divergence from living species. However, Cuvier explained these facts by invoking God, claiming that God repopulated the earth with new species after each extinction. If this were so, Darwin wondered, why… ([Location 2731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2731))

Instead, they seemed closely allied with the organisms on the mainland of South America. As he wrote in Origin, “The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same.”14 Darwin’s ornithologist friend, John Gould, informed him in March 1837 that twenty-five of the twenty-six birds from Galápagos were endemic to the islands and found nowhere else.15 Creationism’s contention had always been that God created species individually and that all species remained unchanged following their creation.16 But then, how did one explain the diversity of the Galápagos bird species? All were similar to, but also quite different from,… ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2751))

- To me, one of the best examples of Darwin’s remarkable ability to view history in a new light is his discussion of domestic pigeons in the first chapter of Origin. He studied the pigeons closely for many years. He bought every breed he could lay his hands on and reared them himself. He also procured pigeon skins from as far away as Persia. He made friends with many well-regarded London breeders and joined two pigeon clubs. Pigeons were big business in nineteenth-century England, and they obsessed Darwin as well. Over six pages of Origin, Darwin outlines the distinctiveness of various breeds. He starts, “Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls.” Next, he described various breeds’ diversity of beaks, sizes, shapes, colors, and flight patterns. Like most naturalists of the era, he believed that all these varieties had descended from an ancestral rock pigeon (Columba livia). In Origin, he also provides ample evidence for this belief. His friend Professor Lepsius had informed Darwin that humans had been domesticating pigeons for thousands of years—there were records of pigeons in the fifth Egyptian dynasty in 3000 BCE. Pigeons also had high prestige and monetary value in the time of the Romans and Mughals in India. It was evident that humans had altered pigeons over many years to suit their unique tastes. He called this phenomenon “artificial selection.” And then he took the bold leap that no one else had taken before him. He asserted, “Slow though the process of selection may be if a feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the infinite beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations… ([Location 2762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2762))

- pigeons, dogs, or plants to the ubiquitous natural heterogeneity of the natural world. The Puzzle of the Peacock’s Tail Darwin’s second bold conjecture in Origin was sexual selection. “The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick,” Darwin wrote.18 He felt that a male ornament like the resplendent peacock’s tail contradicted the theory of natural selection because it was a handicap to the peacock’s survival. Why would a peacock evolve to endanger its chances of a long life? Darwin concluded that the currency of natural selection is not just survival but reproduction. Any character trait that allows an animal to produce more offspring is a winner in the long run because those offspring, in turn, are able to produce more of themselves. A peacock with a showier tail will attract more peahens to sire more offspring over his lifetime. Consequently, there would be a race for even more elaborate tails. In Origin he writes, “This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex.” Male peacocks struggle with each other through the beauty of their tails. The struggle is not for existence but sexual partners. Darwin also shocked his Victorian-era readers by giving agency to the females, contending, “I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect.” He was claiming that the beauty of the peacock’s tail was under the control of the peahens. It was the peahens who arbitrarily decided… ([Location 2780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2780))

Just as with natural selection, Darwin formulated his theory of sexual selection by examining well-established facts in a new light. We Are One Darwin’s third assertion of common ancestry in Origin was his most significant intellectual leap in my layperson’s view. In his words, “I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead me one step further, namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some prototype.” Many Victorians did not even accept that Black and White humans descended from a common stock, and… ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2799))

- called this phenomenon “descent with modification.” He starts by pointing out the obvious: Organic beings are nested within groups.19 The hierarchy levels, in ascending order, are as follows: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Thus, dogs are the species Canis familiaris and belong to the genus Canis. When grouped with wolves and jackals, they belong to the family Canidae. When Canidae is grouped with other families like Felidae (cats), Ursidae (bears), Mustelidae (weasels), and many others, we get to the order Carnivora. Carnivora brackets along Cetacea (whales and dolphins), Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs), Sirenia (dugongs), Lagomorpha (rabbits), and others to form the class Mammalia. Mammalia, Amphibia, and other classes merge to form the phylum Chordata. Chordates, mollusks, nematodes, and numerous other phyla cluster to create the kingdom Animalia.

Amazingly, the modern organization of the living world follows Linnaeus’s system with only a few modifications. As you can see, there seems to be a particular natural order to this system; dogs appear rightly classified along with jackals; Canidae and Felidae are at the same level of family; and how else does one group horses and dugongs except under the class of mammals? But, as Darwin writes in chapter 14 of Origin, “Some deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance. I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent—the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings—is the bond, which though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially revealed to us by our classifications.” Darwin was… ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2818))

A tadpole that breathes on land but has useless gills should have a common ancestor with waterborne animals. The hidden hind limbs in a boa constrictor unite it ancestrally with animals that have legs; fused wings in beetles show that it has descended from an ancestor that gave rise to insects with wings, and so on.

- Let me take the example of Berger Paints, India’s second-largest paint business. We have owned Berger since 2008. When Berger declares its quarterly results, we perform two broad historical analyses: absolute and relative. For example, why has revenue growth declined to 10 percent over the past year compared to its longer-term average of 15 to 16 percent? What could be the reasons for high margins for the third year in a row? Has the company started spending less than usual on sales and marketing? What has led to a significant decline in receivables this quarter? Is the capital expenditure over the past year higher than usual? What has driven the increase in ROCE over the last two years versus the five years before? We don’t stop at analyzing Berger’s results in the context of its long-term history. As permanent owners, we want to invest in a business that performs well on a relative basis; that is, one that performs better than the overall competition. We compare Berger’s quarter, last twelve months, and longer-term performance against the competition on parameters like revenue and profit market share, ROCE, and free cash flow, among ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2911))

- many others. We track Berger primarily against four competitors: Asian Paints (the industry leader), Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel, and Indigo. In addition, we seek market feedback on smaller or private businesses that may have started growing aggressively. This competitive analysis through the financials can lead us to ask if Berger has lost or gained market share this quarter and last year. What has driven Kansai’s increased revenue share over the past two years? Who is gaining the most from Akzo’s share loss? Has Indigo been able to expand outside Kerala? What is the trend in Berger’s advertising expenses relative to its competitors? As you can see, there is a lot we do with historical financial information. What I have outlined here are the sample issues we raise for a portfolio company. The analysis is no different when evaluating a new business.

- “Strategy” is a loaded word. For our purpose, let me just define it as “whatever companies do to achieve their goals under conditions of uncertainty.” Purists will quibble on the definition of “tactics” versus “strategy.” Let them. As folks investing real money, we can move on to more practical problems. By now, I assume you can “predict” what I am about to write! Yes, we assess historical strategies to understand businesses. A small sample of strategic issues we focus on: Which customer segments have you targeted? How have your products or services served the needs of customers? In what ways have you been different from the competition? How have you allocated capital historically? What has been your capital structure, and why? Two things may be evident to you as you read these questions: They are about the company’s strategic steps in the past, and these are issues that even a first-year undergrad could raise. What’s so great about these questions? Nothing. We ask these questions not to evaluate the answers objectively but to subjectively assess if they fit our preexisting hypotheses of success or failure. Yes, we know the answer we want before we have asked the first question. If we have done a decent job over many years, it is not a result of asking these mundane questions but because our underlying bias demands the answers fit our template. We have our templates for success and failure, and we aim to assess if the company’s strategy fits a pattern. Very few do—more on this in chapter 6. This approach is not very different from Darwin’s, who famously wrote in a letter to one Henry Fawcett in 1861, “How odd it is that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view… ([Location 2929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2929))

Further, Malthus wrote that unless humans started having fewer children, the inevitable food shortage would curse humanity to an eternal struggle for existence—only famine, war, and disease would check population growth. It was a dark and pessimistic view of humanity. Darwin read Malthus’s essay in 1838, and he extended the domain of applicability of Malthus’s principle to the entire living world.26 No one had done this before. I can’t do better than the master’s own words: “Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year[;] otherwise, on the principle of geometric increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product.

- Like everyone around him, Darwin saw that no animal or plant species dominated our planet, although many produced hundreds or thousands of seeds or offspring. However, no one else interpreted history the way he did. With Malthus’s inspiration, he explained the current state of the organic world by invoking the hypothesis of the unimaginable historical destruction and annihilation of organisms. His observations fit the template of the struggle for existence. There is probably no better way to explain this than with a real example from the world of investing. We are shareholders in a company called NRB Bearings. Its owner and CEO, Harshbeena Zaveri, is an anthropology graduate from Wellesley. She is probably the best strategic thinker in our portfolio. NRB manufactures needle roller bearings for the automotive industry and has about 65 to 70 percent market share in India. The global giant Schaeffler accounts for the rest. Bearings account for just 1 to 2 percent of the cost of a vehicle but are critical components—failure can lead to severe accidents. We avoid the automotive component space because, in general, its clients, the automotive companies, do not allow them to make money. In the United States, for example, the top five car companies controlled about two-thirds of the market in 2021.27 This concentration allows them to drive a tough bargain with their suppliers: the automotive component companies. Unsurprisingly, not many parts suppliers can consistently earn a decent profit. India is even more consolidated than the United States—the dominant car company, Maruti Suzuki, controls half the Indian market. The Indian motorcycle market is an oligopoly of just three companies. It is not unusual for a parts supplier to have a huge customer concentration—a top customer typically accounts for 30 to 50 percent of revenues. Hence, our bias is to reject almost every automotive component business. There can be an exception, though. But that exception must fit the following template. First, the parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring proprietary technology and have a low customer concentration over many years. It should have only one or two competitors, and the competitive dynamics in the industry should be stable over the long term. Finally, there should ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2958))

NRB ticked every box, and so when the company valuation came to the level we liked, we swooped in to buy 10 percent of the business. We studied history, built hypotheses, did not bother predicting, and have been happy owners in the business since 2013. Assessing the strategy of a business is useless unless we have a strategy to comprehend the strategy. ([Location 2975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=2975))

I can understand if some investors project earnings over one or two years since that’s not too far in the future. It’s not ideal, but I get it.

Thus, in the case of Nokia, while most historical signals would have led one to conclude that the company had been truly outstanding, the very nature of the technology industry, in which rapid change is the norm, should have made any investor pause. We have avoided fast-changing industries like the plague, and many are not even in the technology space.

- We can summarize the second problem of historical analysis in one word: Starbucks. In this case, relying on history would not have helped us identify a spectacular turnaround, thereby depriving us of potentially a substantial money-making opportunity. Howard Schultz bought Starbucks in 1982, and from a mere four stores in Seattle, he grew it to about $2 billion in revenue by 2000. Unfortunately, he left Starbucks in 2000 owing to exhaustion, and not long after, Starbucks started underperforming. When Schultz returned to the company in 2008, there was bad news all around.32 Sales had been flagging for some time. McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had dramatically increased pressure on the company by launching their own gourmet coffee brands. As a result, the stock price had fallen by almost half over the previous year. From 2008, Schultz led a dramatic turnaround in Starbucks’ fortunes by cutting back on expansion, closing hundreds of stores, creating a new instant coffee brand, and refocusing on the consumer. Investors fell in love with the company again—the stock price jumped more than eighteen-fold from December 2008 to December 2019. Let’s take ourselves back to 2008 when everything seemed to be falling apart at Starbucks. All the historical signals—customer feedback, market share, same-store sales growth—pointed to a company struggling to regain its lost glory. Schultz may have been the CEO eight years previously, but the company had changed a lot since then; there were thousands of new stores, the management was different, and customer and competitor behavior were different, too. Schultz may have revived the company, but there is no evidence that founders are the best turnaround artists. In 2008, given the lack of historical data pointing to a turnaround, I would not have invested in the company and lost out on a huge potential gain. What is the solution? I don’t know a way, but if you can somehow figure out a company’s future in a fast-changing industry or bet on a turnaround, all power to you. For the rest of us who are mere mortals, relying on history is a time-tested way to keep the odds firmly in our favor. Of course, it will not guarantee a win every time—no investment approach can—but it will allow us to win often enough.

But a behavior has converged among them that has led to the success of each of their species: the females of the species guard their eggs. One of the best examples of convergent behavior is observed in humans and—hold your breath—ants! And I have witnessed this convergence with my own eyes.

- ant, who purposefully disappeared underground to pass on the booty to her specialist sisters. These ants chew the leaves to grow a fungus garden used for food for the entire colony. Not unlike human farmers, these ants produce fertilizers (amino acids and enzymes) to aid the fungal growth, remove contaminants that can hinder the agricultural output, are highly selective in what they grow, and continuously tend to their enormous gardens.8 And just as agriculture helped us become the dominant species on this planet, leafcutter ants have become the dominant herbivores of the New World: They consume close to one-sixth of all leaves produced in tropical forests. Humans and leafcutter ants have solved their food problems by converging toward a similar solution, crossing time and species boundaries. Let’s move on to plants. Most of us have had coffee, tea, and chocolate (derived from cacao). The Brazilians among us will be familiar with the drink Guaraná Antarctica, made from the guaraná plant in the Amazon rainforest. All four plants produce the same chemical desired by humans: a purine alkaloid called 1,3,7-trimethylpurine-2,6-dione—in short, caffeine.9 These four plants may seem to be closely related, but they aren’t. The common ancestor of tea and coffee dates back a hundred million years. Cacao is more closely related to maple and eucalyptus trees than to tea and coffee. Bizarrely, the ancestor of coffee gave rise to potatoes and tomatoes but not tea! Plants have many defense mechanisms against predators, and it appears that some have converged toward the same solution: producing caffeine. Many plants rely on birds to pollinate their flowers.

- I should have demanded a convergent template, but I didn’t. Let’s see what happens when we do. We invested in Info Edge in late 2013. It runs India’s leading job site, Naukri.com, and is led by Sanjeev Bikhchandani and Hitesh Oberoi, two of the most well-regarded entrepreneurs in India. We did not invest in Naukri because of Sanjeev and Hitesh ([Location 3365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3365))

- but because of the convergent patterns Naukri represents. Naukri allows job-seeking candidates to post their résumés for free and charges companies a subscription fee to access these and list job vacancies. When we invested in 2013, Naukri had a dominant 65 percent traffic share and was four times larger than the second player, Monster India. Given Naukri’s dominance, if you are a job seeker in India, you would almost certainly post your résumé there. If you are a company trying to hire, you are almost compelled to subscribe to Naukri because it has the most extensive and diverse pool of candidates. It is emblematic of the classic network effect: Naukri is number one because it is number one. Our confidence in Info Edge was high because it represents not one but two convergent patterns. First, the erstwhile Yellow Pages business. Many of you have probably never heard of this life-saving invention, but they were my lifeline until the early 1990s. Yellow Pages were a fixture in every home, just like a television or a refrigerator, in the era of rotary landline phones before the age of the internet and mobile phones.

- Pages were ungainly, thick telephone directories usually printed on yellow paper that listed local businesses and their goods or services on offer. Yellow Pages could give you a list of tens, even hundreds, of options, whether you were looking for a language teacher, a plumber, a wedding planner, a car dealer, or a recording studio. The directory was distributed free to the consumers, and businesses paid a fee to be listed. As a result, the largest Yellow Pages business in any city or region was usually highly profitable because of the virtual monopoly enjoyed by their network effect: Consumers went to them because they listed the largest number of businesses, and businesses subscribed to them because they attracted the largest number of consumers. They were highly defensible businesses, and for the leading companies, the network effect ensured high profits over long periods. It was not unusual for leading… ([Location 3377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3377))

- The second convergent pattern we noted was the performance of the leading internet job boards in other countries. This pattern was even more powerful than that of Yellow Pages. We found at least seven other job boards globally with obscenely high operating margins (more than 30 to 40 percent) and infinite ROCE, just like Naukri; for example, Seek in Australia, Dice and CareerBuilder in the United States, 51Job in China, EN in Japan, 104 Corp in Taiwan, and JobStreet in Singapore and Malaysia. These dominant franchises became more dominant each year. Their margin and return profile kept improving; they were all cash machines; the number two in any of these markets showed no signs of catching up; and LinkedIn and offline competitors had no impact on them. In other words, they were indistinguishable from Naukri.

- We invested in Naukri not just because Sanjeev and Hitesh are impressive folks (which they are), or because Naukri makes gobs of money (which it does), or because it has annihilated the competition (which it has). Instead, we invested in Naukri because the convergent models of Yellow Pages and global job board businesses gave us the confidence to believe that the Naukri template is tough to beat. Make that almost impossible to beat. I will state two counterfactuals to highlight the importance of this method of investing. First, what if Sanjeev and Hitesh, impressive as they are, were operating the number 2 or 3 job board in India? We would not have touched the business.

- In this case, applying the outside view to investing yielded us two significant benefits. First, we avoided investing in a company and in an industry in which the odds of making money are very slim indeed. I am not suggesting that it is impossible to make money by investing in airlines—if you bought an airline stock at a low enough price (no, I can’t define what is “low enough”) and then were lucky enough to sell it at some profit, good for you. But “I will find a greater fool for my crappy asset” is another way to say “speculating,” not investing. It’s not for us. The second benefit was the time, money, and effort saved. Instead of conducting lengthy and unproductive management meetings, schmoozing the investor relations person, paying fat fees to consultants, and spending weeks to construct a multimegabyte Excel spreadsheet, we spent a few hours on the internet, downloaded a few reports, and made our decision within a few minutes with enough time left to go home early to our families.

- This discussion on airlines should not lead anyone to believe that all will be well just by applying the principle of convergence or the outside view to a specific investment situation. Convergence is not a panacea, nor is it a substitute for thoughtful analysis and synthesis. But when applied wisely, it can be a powerful investment tool. I don’t know about the rest of the world, but in India, a married person inherits their spouse’s family. Whether they like it or not. The likelihood of getting along with your spouse over the long term is relatively low if you don’t like your spouse’s first, second, and occasionally, even third cousins. For the record, my in-laws are the best. Investing in companies is no different. Buying into a business means also buying into the industry of that business. For example, while I may think I am investing in a company that makes and sells sanitaryware, I am inheriting all the good and the bad of the sanitaryware industry. No company is an island. We can never ignore the kinds of businesses that surround it. One of our principles of convergence investing is that if the industry allows its companies to make money consistently, we love it; if not, we better have a perfect reason for spending even one minute analyzing a business like an airline. Life is too short. There are three potential answers to the question of an industry’s attractiveness and profitability. First is that the companies in the industry struggle to keep their heads above water, just as we saw in the case of airlines. Industries like telecom towers, garment manufacturing, and commodity chemicals are notorious value destroyers. Most companies in these industries barely earn their cost of capital. As I have said repeatedly, one of the immensely underappreciated values of any strategy—including an investment strategy—is what it advises us not to do. The principle of convergence demands that I avoid investing in these industries. If most companies in the industry can’t hack ([Location 3510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3510))

- it, why should I believe that this company is unique? The second conclusion could be that the industry is uniformly attractive for its participants. For example, companies like Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and TCS in the information technology (IT) outsourcing industry earn more than 40 to 50 percent ROCE and have been doing so for decades. If you accept convergence investing as we do, you should love assessing companies in the IT industry. For example, when we evaluated an investment in Mindtree, India’s leading midtier IT services business, we knew that the company had been very profitable for many years. But how could we be sure that it would continue to be successful? By witnessing the convergent outcomes of other businesses in the industry, all of which had been able to scale their revenues over many decades without sacrificing profitability. In other words, it happened there, so all else being equal, there was a high probability that it could happen here. My optimistic view does not mean that I will invest in any company in the IT services industry. Instead, my actual investment will depend on factors like valuation, financial risk, management track record, capital allocation, customer concentration, market share, and so on. But the companies in this industry would be right on top of my radar as Mindtree was. You may think these industries that churn money spinners would be rare—at least that is what microeconomic theory would espouse. But they aren’t. Our portfolio is full of companies in desirable industries: enzymes, paints, cookers, business process outsourcing, bearings, compressors, consumer electricals, sanitaryware, and steam turbines, to name just a few. Last, convergence can inform us that only some companies make money in specific industries, whereas most others don’t. For example, walking along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, I am dazzled by the brilliance and splendor of fashion stores. But fashion is a brutal place to be in—very few companies grow revenues and profits steadily. Most are shooting stars that shine for a few moments and then disappear into oblivion. The same is true for retailers and restaurants. These are the trickiest companies for us to assess. Should we bet on a single business in an unattractive industry, or should we just walk away? If we evaluate a company in these industries, which we rarely do, we are exceptionally… ([Location 3526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3526))

- 4. M&A junkies 5. Those in fast-changing industries 6. Those with unaligned owners How did I arrive at this list? Through a combination of reliving bad experiences (1, 2, and 5), doing some factual data analysis (4, 5, and 6), watching others stumble (2, 3, and 6), and learning from owners of portfolio companies (4 and 5). The common thread through all of these was the hunger for detecting patterns and seeking a convergence of outcomes. Investors can detect (or manufacture) a vast range of patterns across businesses. This is not the place to discuss all of them. Instead, this chapter intends to make the simple claim that one of the most important questions an investor can ask is, “Where else has this worked?” Before moving on, let me discuss one more aspect of convergence investing that (I think) has been critical to our success. We are price sensitive. The median trailing price/earnings (PE) ratio for our portfolio at the time of our investment is less than 15 when the Indian ([Location 3551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3551))

- market has been about 19 to 20. We have rarely ever paid more than twenty times trailing PE. Most importantly, we have never said, “This is such a great business that even 30 PE is justified.” As I have made clear in previous chapters, we have no interest in investing in low-quality or mediocre businesses at any price. Our portfolio companies are truly stellar based on verifiable empirical data on historical financials, industry market share, balance sheet quality, and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the markets are generally quite efficient—businesses like these are rarely available at a throwaway price. Since we have chosen to invest exclusively in world-class businesses, we have two options: 1. Invest at a high valuation hoping that the price will rise further, or 2. Stay inactive for long periods until we get the price we want. We have always chosen option two. Why? Convergence.

- on sophisticated quantitative analysis, we do in-depth qualitative research on industries and businesses. As a result, we know a lot about our portfolio companies and their industries. Given that we have an informed view of them, should we not be willing to pay up when the opportunity arises? No. Why? Because I have more respect for the convergence theme with respect to valuation and potential returns than my intellect. I wish I were more intelligent. But I am not. We now arrive at an obvious question. Under what situations should we not apply the principle of convergence? Not as Straightforward as It Sounds Someone wise—reputed to be Einstein, but there is no agreement—once remarked, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” Life is complicated, and so is investing. The principle of convergence may seem intelligible (I hope) and its implementation a cinch. Sorry to disappoint you, but this seemingly easy-to-use tool generates its own set of thorny issues. Give me a conclusion you desire, and I am reasonably confident that I would rationalize it based on the principle of convergence. A couple of anecdotes may masquerade as a pattern, one pattern can be ignored in favor of another, or one can simply resort to telling a story that seems to weave in an outside view where there is none. If you are an investor or choose to be one, you will need to learn your lessons the hard way. However, here are some pointers based on my experience.

Let me take the example of three types of businesses to explain the complications of applying the principle of convergence. Assume that I am evaluating an investment in a company that builds residential properties in Germany. To incorporate an outside view, I would start with developing an understanding of the dynamics of the German residential property market—the industry participants, track record of growth and profitability, extent of consolidation, and anything else that would get me smart on the overall German residential market. I would prefer not to draw parallels with Germany’s commercial or retail real estate market… ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3603))

- markets have a similar industry structure to that of Germany (e.g., is the industry fragmented or consolidated?) or whether the regulations are primarily comparable (e.g., if a government subsidizes mortgage payments for its citizens, it will dramatically affect consumer behavior). Intuitively, given the cultural and historical affinity of the French and Spanish residential markets, I would be more inclined to draw lessons from those markets and not Brazil’s. But maybe someone can find a way to draw lessons even from Brazil. What about the U.S. residential real estate market? I am not sure. I would need to do some work to understand if there are any parallels between Germany and the United States. Take the case of a German company manufacturing industrial robots. These robots are supplied to manufacturing businesses across the world. Since this is a global… ([Location 3610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3610))

- profitability, and trends in market share. I would also go one level “higher” to analyze the performance of global businesses that supply sophisticated industrial machinery. I may not assign as much weight to this second analysis, but I would study it to discern any apparent trends if available. Some of you may argue that I was too quick to dismiss the German engineering businesses in general. Maybe something about German engineering strength can serve as a template for an industrial robot business. I am skeptical. But perhaps you are right. So go ahead and do the work. Third, take the case of a German hospital business. Should we use convergent investing by assessing the economics and industry structure of hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Netherlands? Health care in most markets is heavily regulated, and this may significantly impact the economics of a hospital. It would be too cumbersome to assess the impact of local laws on the hospitals in each country. Instead, we could use a shortcut to see if the overall hospital economics—or those of the top five to ten hospitals if industry data are unavailable—are comparable across countries. Since hospitals are a services business, can we use the information from other German services sectors (say, hotels) to refine our assessment? Think about it. One situation in which we never apply convergence is when the industry is new or fast-changing. Convergent evolution is more evident in plants and insects since they have been around on Earth longer than birds and mammals.16 It takes time for convergence to emerge. This fact is equally applicable to the world of business. We have noticed greater convergence in older industries (e.g., paint, garments, engines, turbines, cars) and less in newer ones (e.g., virtual reality, robotics, electric vehicles, biotechnology). Industries converge toward similar fates after the companies have had enough time to plan and execute their strategies, after winners and losers have been (essentially) decided, and when the pace of change has declined. Thus, if we are exploring an investment in a paint company in Germany, it would be helpful to study the paint industry in the Western world. But if we were in the year 2000, drawing parallels from the U.S. e-commerce industry for an investment in a Chinese e-retailer may have been taking things a bit too far.

Second, unlike the artificial selection experiments on foxes (or dogs or wheat), in which the experimenter chooses who (or what) reproduces, Lenski wanted the experimental environment to choose. When the experiment started, all twelve flasks had genetically the same E. coli since all cells came from the same mother cell. Each flask contained hundreds of millions of bacteria, so there was ample opportunity for mutations to emerge.

But the general trend was unmistakable: On average, the population grew 70 percent faster than their founding ancestors. In addition, the researchers found another example of convergent evolution. All twelve populations of bacteria had lost the ability to synthesize a sugar called D-ribose because all had undergone the same set of genetic changes. Unlike Gould’s prediction, the replaying of the tape of life was yielding the same result. Until one day, fifteen years after the start of the experiment, Tim Cooper found that it didn’t.

However, at the time of the beginning of the experiment, E. coli was explicitly known not to synthesize citrate in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, this inability was used to identify whether a type of bacteria was E. coli or not! The 33,127th generation of Lenski’s bacteria had deviated drastically from the clean and simple story of inevitable convergence. It was as big a case of divergence as biology had ever seen experimentally.

Convergence is the dominant pattern in the business world. 2. On rare occasions, it isn’t. I have been singing the praises of convergence as a powerful investing tool, which it is. Of course, there are only a few ways for businesses to succeed. As investors, identifying a convergent pattern of success or failure has helped us make (what we think are) some excellent investments and avoid many bad ones. But I have also reached a painful realization that patterns can break, and a successful Ara-3-type mutant can arise occasionally. Unfortunately, we would miss an opportunity to invest in it. If one replays the tape of business history across periods and countries, the overwhelming convergent pattern would be that business focus leads to success. Most of our portfolio comprises businesses with only one product or service or a small set of related products and services. We refuse to invest in diversified companies or conglomerates. We also express disappointment when any of our management teams try to deviate from their course.

Convergence—unrelated organisms developing the same solutions to similar problems—is ubiquitous in nature. It is seen across animals, plants, fungi, and even bacteria. In nature, every problem seems to have only a small set of solutions. 2. For example, Australia’s flora and fauna has been evolving independently of those of the rest of the world for more than thirty-five million years (when Australia became a separate continent), but for every Australian marsupial, there seems to be a placental counterpart. 3. The business world, too, is convergent. There are definitive patterns to the success and failure of companies. We exploit this property of the corporate world to select outstanding businesses and reject lousy ones by asking a simple question: “Where else have we seen this?” 4.

A signal can take myriad forms: touch, sound, color, motion, light, odor, or some combination of these. No organism could live without emitting and receiving signals, but a misdirected or misread signal can also lead to death.

- snakes have successfully evolved through natural selection to mimic coral snakes, thereby ensuring their survival. I want to present a necessary qualifier here, which I will assert a few more times to avoid anthropomorphic confusion. The words “honest” and “dishonest” in the discussion so far do not communicate the intent of the signaler. They point to the effect of the signal on the receiver. When a signal fools the receiver, it is dishonest; when the receiver understands the signal for what it is, it is honest. Neither the guppy nor the milk snake possesses the ability to dictate its body color. The orchid is not deliberately releasing pheromones, nor is the fiddler crab consciously building a large fake claw. These creatures are all products of natural selection honed over millions of years. For example, an ancestor of the harmless milk snake may have developed the coloration of the poisonous coral snake through a random mutation. These mutants would have had a higher survival rate than their nonmutated peers, thereby giving birth to more baby milk snakes ([Location 3812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3812))

- But how is an investor supposed to distinguish between an honest signal and a dishonest one? Let’s turn to the Israeli evolutionary biologist Amotz Zahavi for an exquisitely elegant answer. But first, a brief background on signals. In the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, ethologists (ethology is the study of animal behavior) believed that signals were essentially honest indicators of senders’ underlying motives. However, in the 1970s, two British scientists, Richard Dawkins and John Krebs, took an almost diametrically opposite view claiming that signals were best seen as a deceitful manipulation by a sender to alter the behavior of the receiver for the sender’s benefit.10 On the other hand, the receiver was trying to fathom the… ([Location 3836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3836))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, Amotz Zahavi rejected this pessimistic view of signals. In 1975, he proposed his famous “handicap principle,” which explains how and why honest signals can evolve in the natural world where animals are presumably trying to deceive one another.11 Zahavi’s profound observation was that when signals for a particular trait are costly to produce—he rightly termed such signals “handicaps”—and cannot be matched by another with a lower quality of that trait, they can be deemed “honest.” That may sound logical, but science, unlike the investment profession, needs empirical evidence to support its tall claims. The scientific community did not fully accept the handicap principle until fifteen years after the publication of the article in which Zahavi presented it.12 In 1990, two articles by the Scottish biologist Alan Grafen finally turned the tide in its favor. The best route to understanding the handicap principle is through carotenoids. Carotenoids are a class of pigments ranging from yellow to orange to red. They also provide health benefits by acting as antioxidants and strengthening the immune system. Animals can’t synthesize carotenoids within their bodies and must procure them by eating plants, bacteria, or fungi. Carotenoids play a strong signaling role, and scientists have studied their effect extensively in three species: the house finch (a bird), the three-spined stickleback (a fish), and the guppy. If the handicap principle is accurate, we should be able to confirm the following three hypotheses: 1. Females are differentially attracted to males with redder or brighter hues, 2. Males with a redder coloration are… ([Location 3844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3844))

- to bright red. Experiments clearly show that female house finches prefer to consort with redder males whether this redness results from natural diet or artificial dyes. This finding supports the first hypothesis: receiver response. To provide support for the second hypothesis (signal honesty), scientists demonstrated that well-fed house finches developed a deeper red coloration compared to those fed less nutritious food. When researchers exposed three-spined sticklebacks to parasites, the ones with a higher load of infectious ciliate had a significant decrease in red coloration. Other experiments like the one by Godin and McDonough described earlier have found evidence for the same phenomenon in guppies. Thus, deeper carotenoid pigmentation does seem to indicate better overall health. Let’s now deal with the last and most crucial hypothesis: whether… ([Location 3862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3862))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- with the amount of carotenoid in the animal’s gut. Thus, the more time an animal spends eating nutritious food, the redder the pigment but also the greater the cost incurred. Second, since carotenoids have health benefits and are needed to ward off disease and parasites, redirecting them from the gut to dead tissues like scales or feathers for display purposes is a costly maneuver for the animal. Third, displaying carotenoid pigmentation involves the cost of processing carotenoids in the gut and then transporting them to the feathers or scales. Hence, only those animals that have eaten enough nutritious food are up to the task. The fourth obvious cost is the risk of death: A deep red coloration charms females and foes alike. In laboratory experiments, trout have been shown to be more likely to attack redder sticklebacks, and blue acara cichlids are more likely to kill guppies with greater carotenoid pigmentation.… ([Location 3870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=3870))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- suicidal for a weak or diseased house finch to produce more carotenoid pigmentation given the diversion of resources required. Obviously, male house finches do not consciously “decide” to produce redder colors; the healthier ones simply have enough nutritional resources to produce the pigmentation, and the weaker ones don’t. Ditto for the brightly colored male guppy in the example mentioned earlier. Or the dude with the shiny red Ferrari. All of them show off ornaments that are very expensive to produce or procure and hence accurately communicate the signaler’s well-being. And herein lies Zahavi’s lesson for us investors: Lend credence only to those signals from companies that are costly to produce. That, however, is easier said than done. What does “costly to produce” mean in the context of a corporate environment? What is the equivalent of a peacock’s resplendent tail?

- A press release is probably the most used—or should I say “abused”?—signal given out by companies. The reason? It does not cost anything for the company to be in the press regularly apart from the retainer for the PR agency, which is usually an annual fixed expense. Many companies resort to regular press releases and interviews to share news of product launches, management changes, strategy shifts, and organization changes. First, I am deeply suspicious of companies regularly in the press. (Don’t they have anything better to do?) But even those that are not professionals at managing the press through their public relations consultants rarely have anything helpful to say for a long-term investor. Second, press releases can be—and frequently are—more insidious than the harmless MacBook Pro announcement. Many press releases appear to reveal significant information that a long-term investor must absorb but turn out to be empty boasts at best and deliberate obfuscation at worst.

I haven’t. But the fact remains that most of the businesses I have encountered in my life as a consultant and as an investor have been deeply flawed in more ways than one. They either don’t know it or won’t admit to it. Excellence is rare in this world, including the business world. You just won’t know it if you are relying on management interviews. I am not saying I don’t read (or listen to or watch) interviews of business leaders. I do.

- I know I am exaggerating, but not by much, I can assure you. And I don’t blame them. If I were them, I would behave the same way. A conference or a road show is a dishonest signal because it does not cost the management team anything to present an overly optimistic view of their company, and so that is what they do. It is a chest-thumping marketing jamboree, not a forum to evaluate investment opportunities dispassionately. Do we at Nalanda attend conferences and meet management teams during road shows?

But we employ a stratospheric level of discounting to company presentations and treat these conferences and road shows as a starting point for evaluating interesting businesses, not as a shortcut to building robust investment theses.

You will remember that when many events are supposed to occur simultaneously (X and Y and Z), the cumulative probability is arrived at by multiplying all the individual probabilities. Let’s assume that the management you are evaluating is truly unique in its ability to forecast, and their predictive accuracy is 80 percent. Thus, the probability of hitting the right earnings number, if it is to be broken into just five component parts (revenues, discounts, employee expenses, manufacturing expenses, and sales expenses) would be less than 33 percent (0.8⁵)! In reality, the number of line items before we arrive at the earnings number is much more than five. So how would it be possible, even for a world-class management team, to keep hitting its earnings guidance numbers every quarter or every year? It is almost a mathematical impossibility.

- In mid-2015, Valeant, a pharmaceutical company run by a McKinsey alum called Mike Pearson, was the darling of the stock market and had a market value of about $90 billion. Just five years before, in 2010, its market value was only about $5 billion. There was no business magazine that had not covered the stupendous success of Valeant. Nothing could stop this juggernaut acquiring pharma companies and cutting costs to the bone to enhance profits. Investors loved Mike and his seemingly unbeatable strategy, and marquee investors like Pershing Square, Sequoia, and ValueAct were big fans. Charlie Munger, however, was having none of it. He rightly spotted that Valeant’s debt-fueled acquisition spree was a recipe for disaster. Combined with Valeant’s numerous unethical business practices (e.g., raising the prices of life-saving drugs many times after acquiring them), he opined that Valeant would fail spectacularly sooner or later. In a May 2016 interview with Fox Business, Munger called the company worse than a sewer!19 Munger’s views irritated some of Valeant’s largest shareholders, including Bill Ackman, the CIO of Pershing Square. He wrote a lengthy letter to Munger in April 2015 requesting him to meet with Mike Pearson, but Munger refused. Munger did not need a meeting to detect the “honest” signals of Valeant’s corruption and incompetence. Valeant had its comeuppance soon after and by mid-2016 had lost 90 percent of its value. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square took a loss of $3 billion on Valeant. ([Location 4078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4078))

As an investor, we have used this well-proven human quality to solicit positive and negative signals on companies. A good reputation is a very costly signal—and hence an honest one—because building a name for oneself in any industry consumes enormous management time and effort over many years, if not decades. Therefore, before we make an investment, we spend many months speaking to dealers, competitors, ex-employees, suppliers, and industry experts to get a holistic understanding of a company and its industry. We consider these “scuttlebutt” signals to be sincere for two reasons. First, in general, I have found that few people have an incentive to lie unless they bear a serious grudge against a company. If a competitor is impressed with the company you are evaluating, it will say so and give you many reasons for saying so. Second, once we have performed enough interviews with people connected to the company (but not necessarily from the company), we start to get a good sense of the management’s reputation and quality.

The signals here are the size, shape, and color of the cuckoo egg, which match those of the eggs of some other bird species. However, scientists have found that some of the parasitized bird species have not allowed themselves to be exploited—they have evolved to produce eggs that are distinctly different, even compared to eggs of their own species.24 As a result, they recognize cuckoo eggs as interlopers.

All these signals attempt to favorably impress investors and are generally quite easy to produce. We ignore all of them. 5. We rely exclusively on honest signals from businesses that, as in the natural world, are costly to produce. These include past operating and financial performance and scuttlebutt signals from suppliers, customers, competitors, ex-employees, and industry experts.

- When it comes to buying and selling businesses, we are not just lazy. We are very lazy. We rarely buy and seldom sell. Many—probably most—longterm investors ultimately sell their investments, especially when the price is egregious. We don’t. We are permanent owners. We will not sell a single share in a business we love. There are some minor caveats to this (which I will get to), but while some of you may accept the notion of buying rarely, the thought of never selling may seem wrong—even foolish—to you. That’s all right. My task in this book is not to tell you what you should do but to share what we do. Chapters 8 and 9 invoke two relatively unknown tenets of evolutionary theory to bolster the case for buying rarely and selling even more rarely. Chapter 10 focuses on selling, or rather not selling, by elaborating on a well-known but underappreciated concept that unites evolution and long-term investing. Finally, I conclude the book by highlighting a key lesson for investors ([Location 4251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4251))

- It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.

- In 1959, exactly a century after the publication of Darwin’s Origin, a Finnish scientist named Björn Kurtén published this article in a biology journal.2 Instead of celebrating Darwinism’s centenary, Kurtén poked a seemingly large hole in it. To comprehend Kurtén’s stunning claim, we need to revisit Darwin’s assertion in Origin: I do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally only on a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. I further believe that this prolonged, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed. As we learned in chapter 5, Darwin was inspired by the famous geologist Charles Lyell who proposed the theory of uniformitarianism. Lyell contended that the earth has slowly and uniformly changed over the millennia and that ([Location 4527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4527))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- understanding the present is key to interpreting the past. He directly contradicted the prevailing theory of catastrophism, which suggested that the features of the earth, like mountains, resulted from extensive and sudden changes or catastrophes. Darwin applied Lyell’s theory of geological evolution to the biological world. He believed that just as the earth evolves slowly over very long periods, so does the world of animals and plants. The upshot of Darwin’s insight is that if we were to measure the pace of evolution, it would correlate proportionately with the measurement period: It would be slow over brief periods and fast over long periods. Darwin’s theory stressed that species evolve slowly. This idea was gospel until Kurtén’s article was published in 1959. ([Location 4536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4536))

- Do you see a trend here? Kurtén’s data show that evolution appeared to occur quite quickly when measured over short periods and slowly when the measurement period was prolonged. Thus, when measured over 400,000 years, the rate of change of the molar was 0.41 Darwins, but over 8,000 years, the rate of change was an astounding 13.8 Darwins. He demonstrated a similar trend in other fossilized mammalian species, including horses. I was incredulous when I first read about Kurtén’s conclusion. Suppose we accept the Darwinian notion that the current diversity of the world is the result of species transforming slowly (but surely) throughout the eons. How is it possible that the pace of evolution is slower over more extended periods and faster over shorter periods? Kurtén’s article was not an outlier. In a 2009 article titled “Rates of Evolution,” Philip D. Gingerich, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, also supported Kurtén’s claim.3 He demonstrated mathematically and empirically that phenotypic change (i.e., changes in the bodily characteristics of a species) could be rapid from one generation to the next. In contrast, evolution can be slow on long time scales. Does this inverse correlation between the rate of change of bodily parts and the time interval of measurement also apply to genes? It does. Simon Ho, an Australian evolutionary biologist, and his colleagues provide an excellent overview of this seemingly un-Darwinian phenomenon in their 2011 article, “Time-Dependent Rates of Molecular Evolution.”4 They summarize the research done by several scientists on the genomes of humans, insects, birds, fish, and even bacteria and ([Location 4556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4556))

- The Grants published the results of their long-term study of the evolution of the two species of finches—fortis and scandens—in Science in April 2002 under the title “Unpredictable Evolution in a 30-Year Study of Darwin’s Finches.”8 Before starting their research, they had hypothesized that the body traits of the finches would vary within a narrow band over the period of the study. But as they say at the beginning of the article, “The data do not support the expectation of no change.” If you examine the graphs of the body size, beak size, and beak shape of fortis and scandens in the Grants’ article, you will notice the inverse correlation between the measurement period and the pace of evolution pointed out by Kurtén in brown bears. Thus, while the body size of fortis fluctuated a lot between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, the overall change over those two decades was small. Similarly, the annual variation of the beak size of scandens appeared to be much greater than the variation from the mid-1970s until the early 2000s. The beak shape of fortis was practically the same when measured ([Location 4649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4649))

- When we find high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term, we should exploit the inevitable short-term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling. GKPI requires us to own high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term. “High-quality businesses” is a loaded term and can mean different things to different investors. If you have come this far, I assume you know our definition. For us, the critical character traits of a high-quality business are stellar operating and financial track records, a stable industry, a high governance standard, a defensible moat, increasing market share, and low business and financial risk. How do we use GKPI for buying? By exploiting short-term fluctuations. We are highly demanding. We want a company to be run by an honest management team, and show solid operating and financial track records over many years. It needs to stay ahead of the competition and be debt free, and we also want it to keep taking calculated risks while not unduly burdening the business. And, as if all these demands were not enough, we dare to insist on a fair price for these rare gems! How is this even possible? The market should almost never offer us an attractive price for such a business, and it doesn’t. However, on rare occasions, investors who don’t subscribe to GKPI succumb to the pressure of temporary macro, industry, or company issues, and we can then swoop in to buy a piece of an exceptional company. It doesn’t—and shouldn’t—happen often, but when it does, we go all in. Take WNS, one of our largest investments to date. It is one of India’s leading business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and is… ([Location 4668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4668))

- 2008. The management at WNS had done a stellar job of diversifying away from British Airways and the travel industry. By outsourcing back-office functions like finance and accounting, mortgage processing, and customer analytics, WNS’s clients typically get higher-quality service (e.g., faster turnaround times, lower error rates) at a much lower cost. In January 2008, the stock price of WNS fell sharply from a previous high of $35 to $13. Three factors seemed to have contributed to this steep correction. First, one of its large mortgage lender clients, First Magnus, declared bankruptcy in late 2007 owing to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. First Magnus had contributed to about 5 percent of WNS’s revenue, so the management lowered its revenue guidance for the next year. Second, the management indicated that it may lose Aviva, a large insurance client… ([Location 4685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4685))

- was in India. (A stronger rupee could make WNS less competitive and squeeze margins.) The question for us was this: Was this a temporary blip, or was it a more permanent decline of achievable revenue and profit growth? We decided it was the former. The loss of First Magnus wasn’t WNS’s fault, and even the potential loss of Aviva would be due to Aviva’s change of strategy, not because WNS wasn’t serving it well. Also, we didn’t believe WNS’s long-term competitive advantage would be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. WNS’s annualized revenue growth of 64 percent from 2004 to 2007 was proof that it offered high-quality back-office processing services to its clients at competitive prices. Also, we love the Indian BPO industry. It is lucrative for well-established incumbents because it has high entry barriers for new entrants (businesses are extremely wary of outsourcing their… ([Location 4693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4693))

By March 2022, the stock price ($85.5) had gained 462 percent, whereas the Indian indexes (the Sensex as well as the Midcap Index) had gained only 97 percent in dollars.

It has led to some decent outcomes for us. In June 2022, excluding purchases during the previous two years, we owned twenty-eight businesses. In one of these businesses, we made more than one hundred times our money (Page); in two of them, we multiplied our money more than twenty-five times (Berger and Ratnamani); and in six of them, we made more than ten times our money (in Indian rupees). Unfortunately, all nine have suffered small but significant setbacks, some of which lasted many years (e.g., Ratnamani and Page). However, our adherence to GKPI ensured that we didn’t panic, exercised patience, and stayed lazy. ([Location 4777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4777))

- We sell under the following three conditions (the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of businesses sold): 1. A decline in governance standards (0) 2. Egregiously wrong capital allocation (3) 3. Irreparable damage to the business (6) We have sold ten businesses since 2007 (the nine listed here plus the mistake). I am excluding three businesses that strategic buyers acquired. This translates to one exit every one and a half years. How’s that for laziness? As you can see, six of our nine exits occurred because we believed the business had been damaged beyond repair. And how did we come to that conclusion? An example can clarify. We had invested in an old-world manufacturing business that was the leader in an oligopolistic industry in India. It ticked all the boxes—enviable governance standard, impeccable financials, stable industry, zero leverage, and we were able to buy at what we thought was an attractive price. Everything was hunky-dory for the first couple years. However, in the third year of our ownership, we were surprised to see that the business lost market share for two quarters in a row. We spent time with the management to understand the reasons, and after some initial resistance, they agreed that there might have been some temporary share loss. However, they were confident that this was a transitory phenomenon. But it wasn’t. The company kept losing market share, and in one of the smaller (but highly profitable) segments, its share loss accelerated over the next few quarters. Again, the management seemed to have a compelling set of explanations, all of which sounded logical. They claimed they had made many changes to their manufacturing, sales, and marketing practices and that we would see the trend reverse soon. But the loss of market share continued. We waited for three more years after spotting the initial trouble ([Location 4788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4788))

- and finally decided to pull the plug. Since we want to be permanent owners, we demand a high performance standard in both absolute and relative terms. When we exited, this business was delivering decent results: about 35 percent ROCE with modest revenue and profit growth. But we did not want to be owners in a business that consistently fell behind the competition. During those three years of waiting for the business to improve, several positive and negative news reports were made about the company. We ignored the news and focused on the trend in actual market share. Why did we hold the business for three more years after detecting the problem? Why did we not sell sooner? Because GKPI tells us that we should expect ups and downs in every business. There isn’t a single business in our portfolio that has gone up in a straight line. Not one. Over the long run, most businesses in our portfolio have done well, but every business has gyrated wildly in both directions when measured over weeks or quarters. Our default option is to overlook these temporary business upheavals. ([Location 4803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG99WS31&location=4803))

Hence, my estimation of a 55 to 60 percent failure rate over sixty years (as calculated earlier) is probably on the higher side. Anyway, let’s stick with it. We can safely assume that the 1955 Fortune 500 businesses were high-quality businesses. Of course, they may not have been high quality strictly according to our definition (e.g., some may have had modest debt levels).
