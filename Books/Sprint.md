## Highlights
- This book is a DIY guide for running your own sprint to answer your pressing business questions. On Monday, you’ll map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. On Tuesday, you’ll sketch competing solutions on paper. On Wednesday, you’ll make difficult decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. On Thursday, you’ll hammer out a realistic prototype. And on Friday, you’ll test it with real live humans. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=261))

- Before the sprint begins, you’ll need to have the right challenge and the right team. You’ll also need time and space to conduct your sprint. In the next three chapters, we’ll show you how to get ready. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=279))

- Get that surface right, and you can work backward to figure out the underlying systems or technology. Focusing on the surface allows you to move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution, which is why any challenge, no matter how large, can benefit from a sprint.

- Sprints are most successful with a mix of people: the core people who work on execution along with a few extra experts with specialized knowledge. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=443))

- In a sprint, time is precious, and we can’t afford distractions in the room. So we have a simple rule: No laptops, phones, or iPads allowed. No virtual-reality headsets. If you’re reading this book in the future, no ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=537))

- holograms. If you’re reading it in the past, no Game Boys. These devices can suck the momentum out of a sprint. If you’re looking at a screen, you’re not paying attention to what’s going on in the room, so you won’t be able to help the team. What’s worse, you’re unconsciously saying, “This work isn’t interesting.” ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=539))

- Going without devices can be uncomfortable at first, but it’s freeing. And don’t worry. You won’t be completely cut off. To make sure nobody misses anything important, there are two exceptions to the no-device rule: 1. It’s okay to check your device during a break. 2. It’s okay to leave the room to check your device. At any time. No judgment. Take a call, check an email, tweet a Tweet, whatever—just take it outside. We also use devices for some specific purposes: when we need to show something to the whole team, ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=542))

- Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=620))

- When a big problem comes along, like the challenge you selected for your sprint, it’s natural to want to solve it right away. The clock is ticking, the team is amped up, and solutions start popping into everyone’s mind. But if you don’t first slow down, share what you know, and prioritize, you could end up wasting time and effort on the wrong part of the problem. If Mission Control had worried about the air filter first, they would have missed their window to fix the trajectory, and the Apollo 13 spaceship might have careened off toward Pluto.I Instead, NASA got organized and sorted their priorities before they started on solutions. That’s smart. And that’s the same way your team will start your sprint. In fact (with the luxury of unlimited oxygen) you’ll devote the entire first day of your sprint to planning. Monday begins with an exercise we call Start at the End: a look ahead—to the end of the sprint week and beyond. Like Gene Kranz and his diagram of the return to planet earth, you and your team will lay out the basics: your long-term goal and the difficult questions that must be answered. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=637))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Starting at the end is like being handed the keys to a time machine. If you could jump ahead to the end of your sprint, what questions would be answered? If you went six months or a year further into the future, what would have improved about your business as a result of this project? Even when the future seems obvious, it’s worth taking the time on Monday to make it specific, and write it down. You’ll start with the project’s long-term goal. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=645))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To start the conversation, ask your team this question: “Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be six months, a year, or even five years from now?” ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=649))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Okay, time for an attitude adjustment. While writing your long-term goal, you were optimistic. You imagined a perfect future. Now it’s time to get pessimistic. Imagine you’ve gone forward in time one year, and your project was a disaster. What caused it to fail? How did your goal go wrong? Lurking beneath every goal are dangerous assumptions. The longer those assumptions remain unexamined, the greater the risk. In your sprint, you have a golden opportunity to ferret out assumptions, turn them into questions, and find some answers. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=663))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- List sprint questions You’ll list out your sprint questions on a second whiteboard (if you have one). We have a few prompts for getting teams to think about assumptions and questions: • What questions do we want to answer in this sprint? • To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true? • Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused that? An important part of this exercise is rephrasing assumptions and obstacles into ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=672))

- The common elements? Each map is customer-centric, with a list of key actors on the left. Each map is a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And, no matter the business, each map is simple. The diagrams are composed of nothing more than words, arrows, and a few boxes. So now that you know what a map looks like, you’re ready to make your own. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=761))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Make a map You’ll draw the first draft of your map on Monday morning, as soon as you’ve written down your long-term goal and sprint questions. Use the same whiteboard you wrote your goal on and dive in. When we’re drawing our maps, we follow these steps (keep in mind, there’s a checklist at the back of the book, so you don’t have to memorize this): 1. List the actors (on the left) The “actors” are all the important characters in your story. Most often, they’re different kinds of customers. Sometimes, people other than customers—say, your sales team or a government regulator—are important actors and should be listed as well. And sometimes, of course, there’s a robot. 2. Write the ending (on the right) It’s usually a lot easier to figure out the end than the middle of the story. Flatiron’s story ended with treatment. Savioke’s story ended with a delivery. And Blue Bottle’s story ended with buying coffee. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=764))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 3. Words and arrows in between The map should be functional, not a work of art. Words and arrows and the occasional box should be enough. No drawing expertise required. 4. Keep it simple Your map should have from five to around fifteen steps. If there are more than twenty, it’s probably too complicated. By keeping the map simple, the team can agree on the structure of the problem without getting tied up in competing solutions. 5. Ask for help As you draw, you should keep asking the team, “Does this map look right?” You should be able to make the first quick draft of your map in thirty to sixty minutes. Don’t be surprised if you continue to update and correct it throughout the day as you discuss the problem. We never get ours right the first time, but you have to start somewhere.

- At WalrusCo, the CEO was certain we had covered everything. But Wendy changed almost every part of our map. Now, before you start thinking that WalrusCo’s CEO was a goofball, we should explain that the map was accurate before Wendy came in. It was just more accurate afterward. Wendy put the basic facts into a real customer’s context. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=811))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Nobody knows everything What Wendy taught us was that big challenges have a lot of nuance, and to understand it all, you need to incorporate information from many sources. Nobody knows everything, not even the CEO. Instead, the information is distributed asymmetrically across the team and across the company. In the sprint, you’ve got to gather it and make sense of it, and asking the experts is the best and fastest way to do that. Deciding who to talk to is a bit of an art. For your own team, you probably have a hunch about the right people already. We think it’s useful to have at least one expert who can talk about each of these topics: Strategy ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=814))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Start by talking to the Decider. If the Decider is not going to be in the sprint the whole time, be sure she joins you on Monday afternoon. Some useful questions to ask: “What will make this project a success?” “What’s our unique advantage or opportunity?” “What’s the biggest risk?” Voice of the Customer Who talks to your customers more than anyone else? Who can explain the world from their perspective? Wendy is a prime example of a customer expert. Whether this person is in sales, customer support, research, or whatever, his or her insights will likely be crucial. How Things Work Who understands the mechanics of your product? On your sprint team, you’ve got the people building your product or delivering your idea—the designer, the engineer, the marketer. Savioke interviewed roboticists, Blue Bottle interviewed baristas, and Flatiron interviewed oncologists. Think about bringing in the money expert, the tech/logistics expert, and the marketing expert as well. We frequently talk with two, three, or four “how things work” experts to help us understand how everything fits together. Previous Efforts Often, someone on the team has already thought about the problem in detail. That person might have an idea about the solution, a failed experiment, or maybe even some work in progress. You should examine those preexisting solutions. Many sprint teams get great results by fleshing out an unfinished idea or fixing a failed one. Savioke, for instance, had nearly all the pieces of their robot… ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=820))

- begin executing your successful solutions, the experts you brought in will probably be among your biggest supporters. Ask the Experts Allow half an hour for each conversation, although you likely won’t use all of that time. Once the expert is ready, we follow a simple script to keep things moving. 1. Introduce the sprint If the expert isn’t part of the sprint team, tell her what the sprint is about. 2. Review the whiteboards Give the expert a two-minute tour of the long-term goal, sprint questions, and map. 3. Open the door Ask the expert to tell you everything she knows about the challenge at hand. 4. Ask questions The sprint team… ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=836))

- already know. And most important, ask the expert to tell you where you’ve got it wrong. Can she find anything on your map that’s incomplete? Would she add any sprint questions to your list? What opportunities does she see? Useful phrases are “Why?” and “Tell me more about that.” 5. Fix the whiteboards Add sprint questions. Change your map. If necessary, update your long-term goal. Your experts are here to tell you what you didn’t know (or forgot) in the morning, so don’t be shy about making revisions. That’s it. Your experts don’t have to prepare a slide deck. If they already have something to show, that’s fine, but off-the-cuff discussion about the map and the customers is often more efficient. This need for improvisation is a little unnerving, but it works. If they’… ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=844))

- solutions, a lot of the interesting details will have faded from your short-term memory. The whiteboards will be helpful, but they’re not enough. You’re going to need some additional notes. Imagine that every person on the team took his or her own notes. That would be nice, but if one person alone had an interesting observation, the rest of the group wouldn’t benefit from it. Each person’s notes would be trapped in his or her notebook. Now imagine that you are a wizard. You wave your magic wand. Sheets of paper fly out of everyone’s notebooks and organize themselves into one big collection. Then the pages tear themselves into scraps. Then—remember, this is magic—the most interesting scraps separate from the rest and stick themselves onto the wall for all to see. Nice job, wizard!

- The method is called How Might We. It was developed at Procter & Gamble in the 1970s, but we learned about it from the design agency IDEO. It works this way: Each person writes his or her own notes, one at a time, on sticky notes. At the end of the day, you’ll merge the whole group’s notes, organize them, and choose a handful of the most interesting ones. These standout notes will help you make a decision about which part of the map to target, and on Tuesday, they’ll give you ideas for your sketches. With this technique, you take notes in the form of a question, beginning with the words “How… ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=860))

- Now, some folksI will bristle at the slightly unnatural “How might we” phrasing. After all, most people don’t talk like that in real life, and, combined with writing on sticky notes, it can feel a little silly. We had the same concerns ourselves when we first learned about the How Might We method. When we tried it, we came to appreciate how the open-ended, optimistic phrasing forced us to look for opportunities and challenges, rather than getting bogged down by problems or, almost worse, jumping to solutions… ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=867))

- 5. Peel off the note and set it aside. Each person will end up with a little stack of notes—you’ll organize them later. There’s no denying that this method is awkward at first, but every team we work with figures it out once they start writing. To better illustrate how all this Ask the Experts and How Might We stuff works, let’s look at part of an actual interview, and the notes that came out of it. In this scene from Flatiron’s sprint, we’re interviewing Dr. Bobby Green, their VP of clinical strategy. This is roughly the first two minutes of his fifteen-minute interview. •  •  • “All right, Bobby,” said Jake. “What’s missing on our map?” “Well, I can talk a little more about this part.” Bobby pointed to the whiteboard, where the diagram said Search for… ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=879))

- we’re trying to decide if a patient might be a match, we’re comparing what we know about the patient to lists like this.” The pages were filled with requirements. There were fifty-four in all, everything from “Age 18 or over” to “At least four weeks since prior sargramostim (GM-CSF), interferon alfa-2b, or interleukin-2.” For Jake, Braden, and John, it was tough to decipher. But the point was clear: It was a long list. Alex Ingram, Flatiron’s product manager, looked up from his printout. “The clinics don’t have all of this information about their patients, right?” Bobby nodded. “Some of these criteria are in the electronic medical record, but a lot aren’t.” “Remind us how it works when the info isn’t in the medical record,” Amy Abernethy, Flatiron’s chief medical officer, said. It was obvious that she already knew the answer, but she also knew the rest of us would benefit from hearing it. “Well, it depends,” said Bobby. “For example, many trials call for ‘no uncontrolled cardiac disease.’ That’s pretty vague, but it probably means the patient hasn’t had a recent heart attack. That kind of thing won’t be easy to find in the electronic medical record. So someone from the clinic has to talk to the patient or to the patient’s cardiologist. At the end of the day, the oncologist might have to make a judgment call.” Bobby set his own stack of papers on the table. “To match a patient to a trial, we’ve got to answer a dozen or two dozen open questions. Now multiply that by the number of new patients every week, and the number of trials at each clinic.” He gave a tired smile. “And as an oncologist, you were already busy anyway.” Around the room… ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=888))

- another. That’s okay. Covering it again refreshes everyone’s memory and reveals new details. The “Remind us” phrase is also a nice way to make your expert feel comfortable. Bobby didn’t need that—he’s a confident public speaker—but by asking questions in this way, you can draw out great information from even the quietest person on your team. Let’s talk about note-taking. Here’s a basic outline of the problems Bobby presented: • The information required to screen patients is hard to find in their medical records. • Filling in missing information requires a lot of time and effort. • The number of patients, trials, and requirements is overwhelming.

- Reading the How Might We list feels a lot better than reading the problem list. It was exciting when the interviews ended and we saw each other’s notes on the wall. Each How Might We note captured a problem and converted it into an opportunity. What’s more, each question could be answered in many different ways. They weren’t too broad (“How might we reinvent health care?”) or too narrow (“How might we put our logo in the top right corner?”) Instead, Flatiron’s How Might We notes were just specific enough to inspire multiple solutions. On Tuesday, they would provide the perfect inspiration for our sketches. Bobby’s interview illustrates the basic formula for Monday afternoon.

Bingo. You’ve got a theme. As the organization goes on, it’ll be useful to label the themes.

- By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.

- Earlier in the week, you recruited and carefully selected participants for your test who match the profile of your target customer. Because you’ll be talking to the right people, we’re convinced you can trust what they say. And we’re also convinced that you can learn plenty from just five of them. Five is the magic number Jakob Nielsen is a user research expert. Back in the 1990s, he pioneered the field of website usability (the study of how to design websites that make sense to people). Over the course of his career, Nielsen has overseen thousands of customer interviews, and at some point he wondered: How many interviews does it take to spot the most important patterns? So Nielsen analyzed eighty-three of his own product studies.II He plotted how many problems were discovered after ten interviews, twenty interviews, and so on. The results were both consistent and surprising: 85 percent of the problems were observed after just five people. ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2055))

- Testing with more people didn’t lead to many more insights—just a lot more work. “The number of findings quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns,” Nielsen concluded. “There’s little additional benefit to running more than five people through the same study; ROI drops like a stone.” Instead of investing a great deal more time to find the last 15 percent, Nielsen realized he could just fix the 85 percent and test again. We’ve seen the same phenomenon in our own tests. By the time we observe the fifth customer, we’re just confirming patterns that showed up in the first four interviews. We tried testing with more customers, but as Nielsen says, it just wasn’t worth it. Remember the door frame in One Medical’s prototype family clinic?

- bounce out of their strollers as they rolled into the office, the problem was obvious. The team didn’t need to gather a thousand data points before they fixed it. The same thing with crowding in the lobby and desks in the exam room. When two or three people out of five have the same strong reaction—positive or negative—you should pay attention. The number five also happens to be very convenient. You can fit five one-hour interviews into a single day, with time for a short break between each one and a team debrief at the end: 9:00 a.m. Interview #1 10:00 Break 10:30 Interview #2 11:30 Early lunch 12:30 p.m. Interview #3 1:30 Break 2:00 Interview #4 3:00 Break 3:30 Interview #5 4:30 Debrief This condensed schedule allows the whole team to watch the interviews together, and analyze them firsthand. This means no waiting for results, and no second-guessing the interpretation. One-on-one interviews are a remarkable shortcut. They allow you to test a façade of your product, long before you’ve built the real thing—and fallen in love with it. They deliver meaningful results in a single day. But they also offer an important insight that’s nearly impossible to get with large-scale quantitative data: why things work or don’t work. That “why” is critical. If you don’t know why a product or service isn’t working, it’s hard to fix it. If One Medical had put desks in their family exam rooms, parents would have been frustrated. But it would have been difficult to pinpoint the problem. By showing families a prototype clinic and interviewing them about the experience, One Medical found out the why behind the problem: Parents needed reassurance from the doctor, and even a tiny bit of distraction was too much. When all… ([Location 2069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2069))

- Michael Margolis is an excellent conversationalist. He smiles easily and asks lots of questions, brimming with a natural curiosity about what it’s like to live where you live, work where you work, and do whatever it is that you do. It’s only afterward that you realize you were talking the whole time and learned little about him. Michael’s friendliness and curiosity are genuine, but his conversational skills aren’t just a natural gift. Michael is a research partner at GV, and when you watch him interviewing customers—which we’ve seen him do hundreds of times—you realize it’s a practiced art. Everything from the structure of his questions to his body language helps people think aloud and express themselves honestly.

- For more than twenty-five years, Michael has conducted research for all kinds of companies—Electronic Arts, Alcoa, Sun Microsystems, Maytag, Unilever, Walmart.com, and Google. Since 2010, he’s been at GV, working with the startups in our portfolio. Over the years, Michael has adapted his research methods to be fast enough for startups, and learnable for the people who work there. Michael has trained product managers, engineers, designers, salespeople, and countless others in how to conduct these interviews. Anyone can do it—even a CEO. In this chapter, we’ll let you in on some of Michael’s secrets. Back on Tuesday, you learned his shortcuts for recruiting the perfect target customers (see pages 119–123). In this chapter, you’ll learn how to interview. These interviews can teach you about the people who use your product, reveal hidden problems with your solutions, and uncover the “why” behind it all. No matter what kind of customer he’s talking to, or what kind of prototype he’s testing, Michael uses the same basic structure: the Five-Act Interview. The Five-Act Interview This structured conversation helps the customer get comfortable, establishes some background, and ensures that the entire prototype is reviewed.

In the sprint room, the team watches the interviews over live video. (Nothing sneaky here. You’ll get the customer’s permission to record and play the video.) The interview itself takes place in another, smaller room—which we cleverly call the “interview room.” There’s no special tech setup… ([Location 2115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2115))

- Sometimes the Interviewer or the customer are in another building, another city, or out in the field (Michael has conducted interviews at hospitals, hotels, and truck stops), but since the sprint team is watching over video, that doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the Interviewer and the customer are sitting side by side, talking comfortably. The interview is not a group exercise; it’s a conversation between two people. One person from your team can be the Interviewer for the entire day, or two people can… ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2128))

- It turns out it was an amazing idea, but to make it work, they had to do those interviews. “There’s this gap between the vision and the customer,” Joe says. “To make the two fit, you have to talk to people.” Airbnb’s interviews showed the founders how the product looked through their customers’ eyes, revealing problems the founders themselves couldn’t see. Listening to customers didn’t mean abandoning their vision. Instead, it gave them the knowledge they needed to combine with that vision, so they could close the gap and make a product that worked for real people.

- INTERVIEWER TIPS With a Five-Act script, your interviews are sure to be effective. However, there are a few more techniques Michael uses to make them even better. 1. Be a good host For just a moment, imagine you are the target customer who comes in for an interview. You’ve shown up to try some new product (you’re not quite sure what) in a building you’ve never been to before, and you’ll be watched by some person you just met. This encounter might have seemed like a good idea a couple of hours ago, but now you’re not so sure. The Interviewer is the host, and the customer is the guest. Michael makes sure the customer is comfortable before the interview begins. He smiles a lot. He’s mindful of his body language. He munches on mints so his breath will be fresh.… ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2231))

- Some leading questions are obvious and easy to avoid (we’re sure you won’t say “You like this, right?”). But sometimes, you’ll ask a leading question without meaning to do so. Let’s say you’re interviewing a customer who’s looking at your website—you want to know what the customer thinks, and whether she would be likely to sign up for a demo of your product. Interviewer: “Now that you’ve seen the site, would you be ready to sign up now, or do you need more information?” Customer: “Um, I guess I’d need more info . . . Oh, here’s the FAQ. I’ll check it out.” This exchange looks okay at a glance, but the multiple-choice question (“ready to sign up” versus “need more information”) has influenced the customer’s response. You’re assuming that the customer wants to do one of those two options. It’s tough to do, but you should avoid asking… ([Location 2239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2239))

- Customer: “I dunno, I mean . . . I don’t think it’s right for my company.” Interviewer: “Why is that?” Customer: (Insert fascinating reason here.) We just made this scenario up, but it’s something we’ve seen play out dozens of times. When you ask an open-ended question, you’re more likely to get an honest reaction and an explanation of why. All of this may sound a little complicated, but Michael’s advice to avoid leading questions comes down to just two rules: DON’T ask multiple choice or “yes/no” questions. (“Would you . . . ?” “Do you . . ?” “Is it . . . ?”) DO ask “Five Ws and One H” questions. (“Who . . . ?” “What . . . ?” “Where . . . ?” “When . . . ?” “Why . . . ?” “How . . . ?”) As with everything… ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2249))

- Michael Margolis is the master of broken questions. The idea behind a broken question is to start asking a question—but let your speech trail off before you say anything that could bias or influence the answer. Customer: “Hmm!” Michael: “So, what . . . is . . .” (Trails off into silence.) Customer: “Well, I was just surprised to see that the prices were so high.” Michael got an honest, useful response out of the customer without even asking a real question. And because the question was so vague, she didn’t feel pressure to tell Michael what she thought he wanted to hear. In a situation like the example above, where the customer is reacting to something but not saying what, it’s tempting to ask a leading question like “Were you looking at the pricing there?” With a broken question, you can encourage people… ([Location 2260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2260))

- 4. Curiosity mindset Our final bit of advice on how to be a great Interviewer is not a technique, but a state of mind. On Thursday, the team has to be in a prototype mindset. On Friday, the team, and especially the Interviewer, should work hard at adopting a curiosity mindset. Being in a curiosity mindset means being fascinated by your customers and their reactions. You can develop this mindset by focusing on the surprising details of what your customers say and do. Always ask “why?” Never assume or jump to conclusions. Before each interview, anticipate how interesting the information will be that you’ll learn from the customer. Use your own… ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2269))

- Throughout the book, you learned a handful of unconventional ideas about how to work faster and smarter: • Instead of jumping right into solutions, take your time to map out the problem and agree on an initial target. Start slow so you can go fast. • Instead of shouting out ideas, work independently to make detailed sketches of possible solutions. Group brainstorming is broken, but there is a better way. • Instead of abstract debate and endless meetings, use voting and a Decider to make crisp decisions that reflect your team’s priorities. It’s the wisdom of the crowd without the groupthink. ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2445))

- Instead of getting all the details right before testing your solution, create a façade. Adopt the “prototype mindset” so you can learn quickly. • And instead of guessing and hoping you’re on the right track—all the while investing piles of money and months of time into your ideas—test your prototype with target customers and get their honest reactions. At GV, we invest in startups because we want them to change the world for the better. We want you to change the world, too. To that end, we’ll leave you with one more thought about the Wright brothers, this one from their friend John T. Daniels, who was present at their famous flight on December 17, 1903. “It wasn’t luck that made them fly; it was hard work and common sense,” said Daniels. He went on: “Good Lord, I’m a-wondering what all of us could do if we had faith in our ideas and put all our heart and mind and energy into them like those Wright boys did!” We’re a-wondering, too. We think you can accomplish a lot, and we know just how you should start. ([Location 2450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH1DAQ&location=2450))
