- When people are uncertain about a course of action, they tend to look outside themselves and to other people around them to guide their decisions and actions. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=216))

- Although there’s little doubt that other people’s behavior is a powerful source of social influence, when we ask people in our own studies whether other people’s behavior influences their own, they are absolutely insistent that it does not. But social psychologists know better. We know that people’s ability to understand the factors that affect their behavior is surprisingly poor.

- In Arizona, visitors to the state’s Petrified Forest National Park quickly learn from prominent signage that the park’s existence is threatened because so many visitors have been taking pieces of petrified wood from the grounds: “Your heritage is being vandalized every day by theft losses of petrified wood of 14 tons a year, mostly a small piece at a time.” Although these pronouncements and depictions may indeed reflect reality and are well intentioned, the designers of these campaigns may fail to realize that by using negative social proof as part of a rallying cry, they might be inadvertently focusing the audience on the prevalence, rather than the undesirability, of that behavior. In fact, we became aware of the wood theft problem at the Petrified Forest as a result of a ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=334))

- story that a former graduate student told. He had visited the Petrified Forest with his fiancée—a woman he described as the most honest person he’d ever known, someone who had never borrowed a paper clip without returning it. They quickly encountered the aforementioned park sign warning visitors against stealing petrified wood. He was shocked when his otherwise wholly law-abiding fiancée nudged him in the side with her elbow and whispered, “We’d better get ours now.” ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=339))

- Besides asking visitors not to steal the wood, the park management should have focused attention on the huge number of people who don’t take any wood, to influence the few who do. This can often be done by simply reframing the statistics. For example, although fourteen tons of wood are stolen each year at the park, the actual number of thieves is minuscule (less than 3 percent of the visitor total) compared to the massive number of people who respect the park’s rules and choose to preserve its natural resources.

- The Petrified Forest study shows that people have a natural tendency to do what most other people are doing, even when that behavior is socially undesirable. Although we recommended trying to reframe the message to focus on the many people who are behaving in a more desirable way, unfortunately, that is not always possible.

- What are the implications of these findings? Suppose that you work for an organization that sells many different variations of a similar product. Although it may seem against your intuition at first, it may be worth considering a reduction in the number of options provided by your business in order to drum up maximum interest in your offerings. This could be especially true if you have customers and clients who are uncertain of exactly what they might want. Of course, there could be additional benefits of offering less, such ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=473))

- as making more storage space available, requiring reduced spending on raw materials, and a reduction in the production of marketing and point-of-sale materials to support a smaller portfolio. A worthwhile exercise would be to review the extent of your product portfolio and ask yourself the following question: Where we have customers who may not be clear about their requirements, might the number of choices we offer be causing them to seek other and potentially fewer alternatives elsewhere?

- The lessons of this research can also be applied to home life. Giving children choices in what books they’d like to read or what dinner they’d like to eat can undoubtedly be beneficial, but too many choices might be overwhelming and ultimately demotivating. The old saying may well assert that variety is the spice of life, but as the scientific research demonstrates, in some circumstances, too much variety, like too much spice, can be the ingredient that spoils the dish and, as a result, spoils your efforts at persuasion.

- To test the idea that the value of an item declines when it’s offered as a gift, Raghubir had participants view a duty-free catalog that featured liquor as the target product and a pearl bracelet as the bonus gift. One group of participants was asked to evaluate the desirability and value of the pearl bracelet in the context of the gift, and another group was asked to evaluate the pearl bracelet by itself. The results confirmed the hypothesis: People were willing to pay around 35 percent less for the pearl bracelet when they saw it bundled with the target product as an add-on than when they saw it as a standalone product.

- Raghubir suggests that one way of preventing the offer of gifts or services from backfiring is to inform or remind customers about the true value of the gift. For example, imagine that you work for a software company. One way that you attract new business is to offer a free piece of software, let’s say a security program, to new customers. If in your advertising and your mailings you offer this free product and fail to point out what it would cost customers if they had to pay for it themselves, you’re losing out on an effective way of positioning your offer as valuable and significant. After all, if you write down “free,” numerically the number is $0.00—not a message you would want to send to prospective customers about the worth of your products. To ensure that your offer is seen as the valuable proposition it actually is, the customer needs to be shown the true value of your offer. So, no longer should your message read, “Receive a free security program.” Instead, it becomes, “Receive a $250 security program at no cost to you.” ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=503))

- A number of years ago, the kitchen retail store Williams-Sonoma started offering a bread-making machine that was far superior to a best-selling bread maker that they stocked. Yet, when they added this new product to their inventory, sales of their existing best-seller nearly doubled. Why?

- According to decision researcher Itamar Simonson, when consumers consider a particular set of choices for a product, they tend to favor alternatives that are “compromise choices”—choices that fall between what they need, at a minimum, and what they could possibly spend, at a maximum. When consumers must make a decision between two products, they often compromise by opting for the less-expensive version. However, if a third product were to be offered that was more expensive than the other two choices, the compromise choice would shift from the economy-priced product to the moderately priced product (which is no longer the highest-priced product in the set of choices). In the case of the Williams-Sonoma bread makers, the introduction of a more expensive bread maker made the original bread maker seem like a wiser and more economical choice in comparison.19 ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=529))

- You would be well advised to recognize that your company’s highest-end and highest-priced products provide two very important potential benefits for your business. The first is straightforward: These top-of-the-line products meet the high-end needs of a small group of current and future customers. As a result, you’ll see greater revenues injected into your business by offering them. But the second is perhaps under-recognized: The next-highest-priced model will more likely be considered attractively priced, as a compromise.

- In his first inaugural address, the thirty-second U.S. president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, uttered the following famous words to anxious, Depression-era Americans: “So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself…which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” But was Roosevelt correct? When trying to persuade an audience to behave a certain way, does fear paralyze, as he suggested, or does it persuade and motivate? For the most part, research has demonstrated that fear-arousing communications usually stimulate the audience to take action to reduce the threat. However, this general rule has one important exception: When the fear-producing message describes danger but the audience is not told of clear, specific, effective means of reducing the danger, they may deal with the fear by “blocking out” the message or denying that it applies to them. As a consequence, they may indeed be paralyzed into taking no action at all. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=559))

- world threats that a company’s goods or services can alleviate should always be accompanied by clear, specific, effective steps they can take to reduce the danger. Simply scaring customers into believing that a product or service can help with a potential problem might have the opposite effect, potentially cementing them into inaction if there is a failure to provide specific, achievable steps that they can take to avoid such a threat.

- Given the necessity of pairing a message conveying the potential threat faced by the audience with a clear, specific, easy-to-follow plan, perhaps Roosevelt’s statement should be amended to say “the only thing we have to fear is fear by itself.” ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=588))

- standpoint, there may be no better orientation for those who wish to be influential among friends, coworkers, and customers. We often make the mistake of asking, “Who can help me here?” This may be a shortsighted approach to influencing others. It is far more productive to ask ourselves, “Whom can I help?” or, “For whom can I do a favor?” If management is about getting things done through others, then a healthy web of indebted colleagues, who have benefited from a manager’s useful information, concessions, attention, and perhaps a friendly listening ear, can stand that manager in good stead for the future. Similarly, our friends, neighbors, and partners will become more responsive to our requests when we have first provided for them.

- Paper clips, pens, pencils, pads, protractors, planners, and paperweights. Your office desk is full of practical items. But is there one common office item that can help make your influence attempts stick? Social scientist Randy Garner wondered whether sticky notes, the best-known being Post-it Notes, made by the 3M Corp., ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=652))

- might have the power to enhance compliance with a written request made to another person. In an intriguing study, he sent out surveys to people with a request to complete them. The survey was accompanied by either (a) a handwritten sticky note requesting completion of the survey, which was attached to a cover letter; (b) a similar handwritten message on the cover letter; or (c) the cover letter and survey alone. That little yellow square packed quite a persuasive punch: More than 75 percent of the people who received the survey with the sticky note request filled it out and returned it, whereas only 48 percent of the second group and 36 percent of the third group did so. Why was it so successful? Could it be the simple fact that sticky notes are attention-grabbing in all their neon glory?

- To test this possibility, Garner sent out a new batch of surveys. This time, a third of the surveys came with a Post-it Note with a handwritten request, a third came with a blank Post-it Note, and a third had no Post-it Note at all. If the benefits of using sticky notes come mainly from their ability to attract attention, then response rates should be equally high for both sets of Post-it Note surveys. That turns out not to be the case, however. The handwritten sticky note outperformed its competition, with a response rate of 69 percent compared to 43 percent for the surveys with the blank sticky note and 34 percent for the surveys with no sticky note… ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=661))

- Garner suggests that people recognize the extra effort and personal touch that this requires, and that they feel the need to reciprocate this personal touch by agreeing to the request. After all, reciprocity is the social glue that helps bring and keep people together in cooperative relationships—and you can bet that it’s a stronger adhesive than the kind on the back of a sticky note. The evidence supports this reciprocity-based explanation. Garner found that placing a personalized sticky note on the survey did more than just simply persuade people to respond to the survey at higher rates: Those who filled out the survey with the handwritten sticky note message returned it more promptly and… ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=666))

- Along with data from other research studies, these findings make it clear that when we’re trying to solicit cooperation from other people—be they coworkers, clients, students, or acquaintances—we should offer help to them in a way that’s unconditional and no-strings-attached. Approaching the potentially cooperative relationship in this way should not only increase the likelihood that you’ll secure their cooperation in the first place, but also ensure that the cooperation you do receive is built on a solid foundation of trust and mutual appreciation, rather than on a much weaker incentive system. You’ll also find this approach to be much longer lasting. Otherwise, the moment the incentive you’ve been promising or awarding can no longer be offered or is no longer desired by the other person, the brittle foundation of the relationship may crack, and the cooperative bridge you’ve built up may come crashing down.

- There are two important psychological steps involved in the success of this technique. First, when people are asked to predict whether they’ll engage in a socially desirable behavior in the future, they feel compelled to say yes because that’s the socially desirable thing to say. Considering the value that society places on voting, it’d be difficult for the respondents ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=893))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- to say something like, “Voting? That’s this Tuesday, right? Can’t do it. There’s a really important History Channel special on civic responsibility that I don’t want to miss.” It’s no surprise, then, that in this study, 100 percent of all the survey respondents asked to make a prediction about their voting behavior claimed that they would indeed vote. Second, after most (if not all) of these people have publicly stated that they’ll perform the socially desirable behavior, they’ll be motivated to behave consistently with the commitment they just made. For instance, one restaurant owner greatly reduced the percentage of no-shows (people who booked a table but didn’t honor the reservation and didn’t call to cancel it) by having his receptionist change what she said when taking a reservation from, “Please call if you have to cancel,” to, “Will ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=895))

- Why are commitments that are written (and therefore active) so much more successful at eliciting participation? People make judgments about themselves based on observations of their own behavior, and they infer more about themselves based on their actions than on their nonactions.

But how does the aging process alter this inclination? Along with lead researcher Stephanie Brown and another colleague, one of us conducted a study showing that people’s preference for consistency becomes greatly strengthened as they get older. This is likely the case because inconsistency can be emotionally upsetting, and older people have greater motivation to avoid emotionally upsetting experiences.34 This finding has important implications for how we try to influence older people.

As a politician, perhaps more than any other, he encouraged the very idea of an American nation. As a diplomat during the American Revolution, he secured the French alliance that helped to make independence possible.

But it’s what he discovered about how to win over respect of his opposition—by inconveniencing them, no less—that might be most electrifying of all.35 When Franklin was in the Pennsylvania legislature, he was deeply bothered by the staunch political opposition and hostility of another legislator.

We know from other studies that people are strongly motivated to change their attitudes in ways that are consistent with their behavior. When Franklin’s opponent found himself doing a favor for someone he didn’t care for, he probably had to say to himself, “Why am I going out of my way to help out this person I don’t even like?

- need of assistance from a coworker, colleague, or neighbor who, for one reason or another, doesn’t view us in a particularly favorable light. We might be reluctant to ask for the favor because we’re afraid this person will like us even less. Rather than ask for such a favor, a more typical tendency is to put off the request, potentially delaying a timely accomplishment of the task at hand. The results of this research indicate that such hesitation is unwarranted. Now, in the case of some objectionable people, asking for a favor might seem to be a rather brave thing to do. But consider the following: If you currently have nothing to show from your communications (or noncommunications) with this person, the worst thing that will happen is that you’ll end up with the same nothing.

- lower. Yet, they wondered whether the increase in perceived value that comes along with a high starting price would actually lead to a higher final sale price. Instead, based on their research, they suggest that lower starting prices can actually lead to a higher final sale price, for three reasons. First, because the starting prices for auctions act as somewhat of a barrier to entry, lower starting prices are better for encouraging participation by as many people as possible in the bidding process for an item. Second, the increase in traffic—reflected in the total number of bids as well as the number of different bidders—afforded by these lower initial prices acts as social proof for new potential bidders. In other words, prospective bidders considering an item that started ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1076))

- off at a low price would find social validation that the item is of value because so many more people were also bidding on the item, and this validation would spur them to bid on the item as well. Third, bidders for items with low starting prices, especially those who get in early, are likely to spend more time and effort updating their bids. In an effort to justify the time and energy they’ve already spent on the bidding process, these bidders are more likely to stay committed to winning the auction by continuing to bid and raising their bids even higher.39 These research findings suggest that if you are in the business of offering goods or services through any kind of competitive bidding process, starting the bidding at a fairly low price can be a ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1082))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- way of enhancing the final sale price. However, there is one very important caveat to consider: The researchers found that the social proof component was a critical factor in the enhanced effectiveness of the lower starting price. So, when the traffic for a particular item was constrained (for example, due to a misspelling of the product name, which limits the number of prospective bidders who are likely to find the item through a typical eBay search), the lower starting price was less effective. This means that a lower starting price is likely to be most effective when there’s a possibility that many bidders will join the bidding fray for your product but is likely to be least effective when the bidding is limited to only two potential parties.

The agency concerned has both a sales and a rental division.

As a result, customers who want further information about rentals are now told, “Oh, rentals, you need to speak to Judy, who has over fifteen years’ experience renting properties in this neighborhood. Let me put you through now.” Similarly, customers who want more information about selling their property are now told, “I’m going to put you through to Sheldon, our head of sales.

Second, it doesn’t seem to matter that the introduction comes from someone who is clearly connected to Judy and Sheldon, who will both obviously benefit from such an introduction. The third notable feature is how effective it is.

To take a real-life example, when U.S. president Ronald Reagan was up for re-election in 1984, some voters were concerned that he was too old to have an effective second term in office. During the U.S. presidential debate against opponent Walter Mondale, Reagan acknowledged that he was very old, but stated: “I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” Although Mondale’s immediate response was to let out a laugh, he was certainly not laughing when he was later routed in one of the biggest landslide losses in U.S. presidential history.

For example, people who move to Florida are disproportionately likely to be named Florence, and people who move to Louisiana are disproportionately likely to be named Louise. People move to cities with numbers in them that match their own birthdate numbers. For example, cities with the number 2 in their names, like Two Harbors, Minnesota, have a disproportionate number of residents who were born on February 2 (2⁄2), whereas cities that have the number 3 in their names, like ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1478))

No surprise, then, that we’re left sitting at the table wondering whether the cheeseburger we ordered will arrive at our table reincarnated as a chicken sandwich. Some research by Rick van Baaren tested the idea that food servers who match their customers’ verbalizations after receiving the order will increase their tip size. No paraphrasing, no nodding, no “okays”—just repeating back word for word the customer’s order. In one study, they found that the food servers at one restaurant increased their tip size by nearly 70 percent simply by matching their customers’ verbalizations after receiving the order, as opposed to saying “okay!” or “coming up!”56 ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1508))

- may very well frown back. But how can we have, and encourage others to have, more authentically positive experiences? One possibility for managers of service-oriented companies might be to provide emotional skills training to service workers to help them better regulate and elevate their moods. After all, unhappy employees, when forced to smile for their customers, may engage in lower-quality interactions, which will ultimately lead to reduced customer satisfaction. But that kind of emotional training often requires a great deal of time, effort, and cost. A second, more general approach is to try to follow the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin: “Search others for their virtues.” Many of us spend too much time finding faults in the people we deal with in our everyday lives. If, instead, we try to search their character for what we like about them, we’ll like them more; and, as a result, they’ll like us more. Everyone comes out ahead.

- On April 23, 1985, the Coca-Cola Company made a decision that Time magazine later dubbed “the marketing fiasco of the decade.” In response to data that more people preferred Pepsi’s sweeter taste, they decided to pull their traditional formula for Coke off the market and replace it with a sweeter “New Coke.” Many of us remember that day. In the words of one news report, “The Coca-Cola Company failed to foresee the sheer frustration and fury its action would create. From Bangor to Burbank, from Detroit to Dallas, tens of thousands of Coke lovers rose up as one to revile the taste of the new Coke and demand their old Coke back.”61 Perhaps the most extreme example of this combined outrage and yearning comes from the story of a retired Seattle investor named Gay Mullins, who became something of a national celebrity by establishing a society called Old Cola Drinkers of America. This was a widespread group of people who worked tirelessly to get the traditional formula back on the market by using any civil, judicial, or legislative means available to them. For instance, he set up a hotline where angry consumers could vent their rage and register their feelings, which received over sixty thousand calls.

- He distributed anti–New Coke buttons and T-shirts by the thousands. And he even tried to bring a class-action lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company, which was quickly dismissed by a federal judge. What’s most astonishing about Mr. Mullins’s behavior is that it didn’t matter to him that in two separate blind taste tests, he either preferred New Coke over the original or couldn’t tell the difference between them.

As Donald Keough, then president of the Coca-Cola Company, said about consumers’ diehard loyalty to the original Coke, “It’s a wonderful American mystery, a lovely American enigma. And you can’t measure it any more than you can measure love, pride, or patriotism.” We disagree. First off, it’s no mystery, not if you understand the psychology of the scarcity principle, and particularly how it relates to people’s sensitivity to losing something they already have. This is especially the case for a product that’s as wrapped up in a person’s history and traditions as… ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1634))

Although most of these tests were blind, some of them were not conducted with unmarked samples. In those tests, the participants were told which was the old Coke and which was the new Coke beforehand. Under those conditions, the preference for the new Coke increased by an additional 6 percent.

- Yes—and the single word is because. Behavioral scientist Ellen Langer and her colleagues decided to put the persuasive power of this word to the test. In one study, Langer arranged for a stranger to approach someone waiting in line to use a photocopier and simply ask, “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?” Faced with this direct request to cut ahead in the line, 60 percent of the people were willing to agree to allow the stranger to go ahead of them. However, when the stranger made the request with a reason (“May I use the Xerox machine, because I’m in a rush?”), almost everyone (94 percent) complied. This kind of boost may not seem very surprising. After all, providing a solid reason for the request justifies asking to jump ahead.

You’re certainly not going to use it to sharpen your pencils, are you? Despite the hollowness of the “reason” the stranger provided, it generated nearly the same elevated levels of compliance as when the reason was wholly legitimate (93 percent).65 The Xerox study demonstrates the unique motivational influence of the word because.

For example, when booking a meeting with a customer or when asking a coworker to cooperate on a new project, be sure to state the reasoning behind your request. That may sound obvious, but too often we mistakenly assume that other people understand the reasons behind our requests. This strategy is also likely to pay dividends at home. Rather than demanding that your children “come to the table for dinner now,” “do their homework,” or “go to bed immediately,” a more effective strategy would be to provide a reason why you are asking them to take that action—and not just “because I said so!” ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F51X64&location=1723))

- According to social scientists Adam Alter and Daniel Oppenheimer, people tend to have a greater affection for words and names that are easy to pronounce (that is, those that have a high degree of fluency) than those that are hard to pronounce. They argued that people would feel more positively toward company names and stock symbols that are relatively easy to read and to pronounce, leading to higher stock prices. To first test this hypothesis in a controlled study, they generated names of fictitious stocks that were either very easy to pronounce or very difficult to pronounce. They told study participants that these were real companies and asked them to estimate the future performance of each of the stocks. The results were clear: Not only did participants predict that the easily pronounceable stocks (e.g., Slingerman, Vander, Tanley) would outperform the others (e.g., Sagxter, Frurio, Xagibdan), they also predicted the latter would go down, while the former would rise. To find out if this effect happened in the real world, Alter and Oppenheimer randomly picked eighty-nine companies whose shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and had their initial public offering between 1990 and 2004. They then looked at the relationship between the fluency of a stock name and its performance one day, one week, six months, and one year after the initial public offering for that stock. The researchers found that if a person invested a thousand dollars in the ten most fluently named companies on the list versus the ten least fluently named companies on the list, the investment in the first group would have outperformed its counterpart for each of the designated time periods, including a $333 difference just one year after the initial public offering. What’s more, in a separate study, the authors separated over 750 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange by whether their stock ticker symbol was pronounceable (e.g., KAR) or unpronounceable (e.g., RDO). They found similar results.69 So, are we recommending that you go right out and trade in your shares of Mxyzptlk Holding Corp. for Yahoo! stock, fire your financial advisor, or have a garage sale to rid yourself of your stock-picking monkeys and dartboards?

If you are asked to pick up a ten-pound weight in a gymnasium, it will appear lighter if you had first picked up a twenty-pound weight and heavier if you had first picked up a five-pound weight. Nothing has actually changed about the ten-pound weight—except your perception of it. This psychological process is not limited to weight; it holds for almost any type of judgment you could make.

- What’s interesting to note is that perceptual contrast offers us a very efficient means of persuasion. Often we don’t have the luxury of changing our products, services, or offerings—it would be far too costly and time-consuming. But using perceptual contrast, we can change how others think about our initiatives, goods, services, and requests. To give just one real-world example, a home improvement company was able to increase the sales of one of its top-of-the-range backyard hot tubs by over 500 percent simply by (a) telling prospective customers, honestly, that many buyers of the top-of-the-range model reported that having it was like adding an extra room to the house and then (b) asking them to consider how much it would cost to build another room onto the side of their house. After all, a fifteen-thousand-dollar spa seems much less expensive when compared with construction that would cost at least twice as much.
