## Highlights
- People deserve better than this. Let capitalism function as it should without the manipulation of bureaucrats. As a doctor who practiced for a total of nearly 35 years, I abided by the Hippocratic Oath that charged me to do no harm and not get in the way of the body’s natural ability to heal itself. The government must do the same and allow the market’s natural homeostatic process to work. This goes to the heart of the message of The Dao of Capital, which shows people how to achieve harmony with the market process, distorted or not.

- Unfortunately, politicians hold the conviction that money growth gives us economic growth. They are blind to the fact that government cannot create anything. Government cannot make man richer, but it can make him poorer. It is extremely naïve to think otherwise. We should all heed the lesson of “That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen,” the keen essay by nineteenth-century economist Frédéric Bastiat, to look beyond the immediate to the less direct results that can and should be foreseen—another of Mark’s big themes in The Dao of Capital.

- To tamper with a nation’s money is to tamper with every economic aspect of people’s lives: earnings, savings, how much one pays in nominal terms for every purchase made. When money is manipulated at will by politicians, it always leads to chaos, unemployment, and political upheaval. For this reason it is imperative that we identify a money that cannot be abused, that prohibits inflation, and allows responsible working citizens to prosper. As The Dao of Capital clearly shows, with an inflating fiat currency, capital investment in a market economy becomes very difficult. As money is destroyed, there ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=314))

- is an increase in government power and interference in the markets to attempt to maintain order. Government officials throughout history have refused to admit that economic planning does not work until it’s too late. And then when governments have tried to compensate for “printing too much money” it has only made things worse. This should sound all too familiar to Americans concerning the functions of the Federal Reserve. Ironically, there is a consensus in America against government price controls in favor of free markets, until it comes to the most important price of all—the price of time, or interest rates. This is how the government controls the value of money. Through this price control, the government also distorts the market’s elaborate coordinating function between consumers and producers. Thanks to the work of the Austrian economists, we know that the loss of this coordination gives us boom and bust cycles—due solely to the manipulation of the supply of money and credit by the central bank. Therefore, the rate of unemployment and the general standard of living are all a reflection in large part of the monetary policy a nation pursues.

- This path is notable in that it is exceedingly and purposefully circuitous—the keyword throughout this book is roundabout—the “going right in order to then go left” that leads first to the means, those strategic intermediate waypoints from which it becomes all the more possible and effective to arrive at the ultimate ends. As evident and ubiquitous as this process is all around us, from the natural world of the boreal forest to the business world of the entrepreneur, all too often we fail to perceive it. We tend to see the destination, ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=361))

- Following The Dao of Capital, we will build new habits of awareness regarding the mechanisms of capital and of capitalistic investing—the means and methodology of the market process itself. By aligning ourselves with these mechanisms, we find an intellectual and (far more importantly) practical discipline I call Austrian Investing, which does not directly pursue profits, but rather the roundabout means of profits.

- This book offers, eventually, an introduction to Austrian Investing. I will marshal data to illustrate the effectiveness of my approach. However, these revelations will occur in the final two chapters of the book. The bulk of my discussion will focus on the all-important thinking behind Austrian Investing. It is fitting that I structure the book in this fashion, for as we’ll see, the whole point of my approach to investing is that we must be willing to adopt the indirect route to achieve our goals.

- Without the thinking, though, the acting is baseless. The reasoning is paramount, first and foremost. When I was a young trader starting out in the pit (in fact the bond pit’s youngest), Klipp made sure I understood why I was at the Chicago Board of Trade—which was not to learn how to make money (as I relate in Chapter 1). If that were the case, he told me, “you wouldn’t even be in here. You’d be in a long line all the way down LaSalle Street, still waiting to get in.” And so I say the same to you: If there were a book that could teach you how to make money, you would be at the end of a long line down the street from any bookstore (what few still exist).

- The intention of this book is to teach you how to think and provide you the discipline of the roundabout. Like learning as an adult to swing a golf club or to ski, the intention is to understand the underlying mechanisms in order to coordinate our actions with them. With that foundation, you can engage in the necessary circuitous aspects required by this strategy and the intimately related roundabout process of capital. If and when we lose our way, we reorient ourselves with our Austrian compass that leads us right to go left, along a circuitous path as old as strategic thought itself.

- “You’ve got to love to lose money, hate to make money, love to lose money, hate to make money. . . . But we are human beings, we love to make money, hate to lose money. So we must overcome that humanness about us.” This is “Klipp’s Paradox”—repeated countless times by a sage old Chicago grain trader named Everett Klipp, and through which I first happened upon an archetypal investment approach, one that I would quickly make my own. This is the roundabout approach (what we will later call shi and Umweg, and ultimately Austrian Investing), indeed central to the very message of this book: Rather than pursue the direct route of immediate gain, we will seek the difficult and roundabout route of immediate loss, an intermediate ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=511))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- How do we resolve this paradox? How is it that the detour could be somehow more effective than the direct route, that going right could be somehow the most effective way to go left? Is this merely meant to confuse; empty words meant to sound wise? Or does it conceal some universal truth? The answers demand a deep reconsideration of time and how we perceive it. We must change dimensions, from the immediate to the intermediate, from the atemporal to the intertemporal. It requires a resolute, forward-looking orientation away from what is happening now, what can be seen, to what is to come, ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=524))

- what cannot yet be seen. I will call this new perspective our depth of field (using the optics term in the temporal rather than the spatial), our ability to sharply perceive a long span of forward moments. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=529))

- As Klipp’s Paradox requires, let’s think of time entirely differently, as intertemporal, comprised of a series of coordinated “now” moments, each providing for the next, one after the other, like a great piece of music, or beads on a string.

- not know it, his paradox reached back in time more than two and a half millennia to a far distant age and culture, as the essential theme of the Laozi (known later as the Daodejing, but I will refer to it by its original title, after its purported author), an ancient political and military treatise, and the original text and summa of the Chinese philosophy of Daoism. To the Laozi, the best path to anything lay through its opposite: One gains by losing and loses by gaining; victory comes not from waging the one decisive battle, but from the roundabout approach of waiting and preparing now in order to gain a greater advantage later. The Laozi professes a fundamental and universal process of succession and alternation between poles, between imbalance and balance; within every condition lies its opposite. “This is what is called the subtle within what is evident. The soft and weak vanquish the hard and strong.”1 ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=541))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The central concept permeating the Laozi is referred therein as wuwei, which translates literally as “not doing,” but means so much more; rather than passivity, a common misperception, wuwei means noncoercive action—and here we see the overwhelming ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=588))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- laissez-faire, libertarian, even anarchistic origins in the Laozi, thought by some to be the very first in world history8 (as in “One should govern a country as one would fry a small fish; leave them alone and do not meddle with their affairs”9—a cardinal Laozi political credo most notably invoked in a State of the Union address by President Ronald Reagan). The Laozi also has been deemed a distinctive form of teleology, one that emphasizes the individual’s self-development free from the intervention of any external force. This leads to the paradox of what has come to be known as wei wuwei (literally “doing/not doing,” or better yet “doing by not doing,” or “do without ado”10). “One loses and again loses / To the point that one does everything noncoercively (wuwei). / One does things noncoercively / And yet nothing goes undone.”11 ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=590))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Perhaps the most tangible representation of wuwei can be seen in the interplay of softness and hardness in the Chinese martial art taijiquan—not surprising as it is a direct derivative of the ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=619))

- There is a saying among soldiers: I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest; I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot. This is called marching without appearing to move, Rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm, Capturing the enemy without attacking, Being armed without weapons.18 ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=626))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Taijiquan is a physical manifestation of the importance of waiting and exploiting another’s urgency through softness in a clash. This is most apparent in the two-person taijiquan competitive exercise known as tuishou, or “push hands,” in which two opponents engage in what looks to the casual observer like a choreographed series of synchronized movements. In actuality tuishou is a cunning contest with highly constrained rules, in which each tries to throw the other to the ground (or outside a boundary) during a sequence of subtle alternating feints and attacks. The real force is not in the pushing, but in the yielding. (In tuishou is an ideal roundabout and investing metaphor, one that I will return to again and again.) ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=644))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is the essential tuishou sequence of yielding, neutralizing, and sticking. Yielding and neutralizing—zou or zouhua, “leading by walking away”—is the sneaky retreating rout, followed by converting and redirecting a force to advantage; that advantage is exploited by sticking and following—nian or niansui—and thus eventually advancing back in a decisive counterattack. (Taken together, as we will see in Chapter 3, this sequence describes shi, the strategy of wuwei.) ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=654))

- The great frustration—the unfairness—is that the harder you push, the harder you fall. Chairman Mao knew these words from the Laozi: “If a small country submits to a great country / It can conquer the great country. Therefore those who would conquer must yield / And those who conquer do so because they yield.”21(We will encounter this again with the guerilla warriors of the north in the Epilogue.) In the wuwei of taijiquan, the advantage comes not from applying force but from circular yielding, from directing the course of events rather than forcing them; from the Laozi, “Hence an unyielding army ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=668))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is destroyed. An unyielding tree breaks.”22 The patience of the intermediate steps of loss and advantage defeats the impatience of the immediate gain; the direct force is defeated by the counterforce. Thus there are always two games being played in time, one now and one later, against two different opponents. As the great tuishou practitioner Zheng Manqing observed, one must first “learn to invest in loss” by leading “an opponent’s force away so that it is useless,” and which will “polarize into its opposite and be transformed into the greatest profit.”23 In taijiquan is the essence of The Dao of Capital. So much of waiting and ignoring present circumstances, of willingness to be in an uncomfortable place, is understanding the sequential instead of only seeing the immediate. There is a definite brand of epistemology at the root of the Laozi. To the Laozi, much of the exterior world is but exterior diversion, much perception is a distraction from a hidden reality—though one which requires diligent attention. It states this most succinctly in “Venture not beyond your doors to know the world / Peer not outside your window to know the way-making. . . . The farther one goes / The less one knows.”24 ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=674))

- From then on, whenever I would see Klipp I always peppered him with questions (often with handy graphs and USDA reports in tow) on price trends, world grain supplies, Soviet demand, Midwest weather patterns—basically on where the markets were headed. His response was always a variation on: “The market is a completely subjective thing, it can do anything. And it is always right, yet always wrong!” His abject disdain for data and information left me bemused, even skeptical of this stubborn old Chicago grain man with the gravelly voice, ever speaking in fortune-cookie prose. How could he have done so well as a speculator without knowing—or even caring—where the market was heading? How could it be that “guys who know where the market is heading are no longer at the Board of Trade. They are either retired or ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=717))

- broke. And I can’t think of any that are retired.” Classic Klipp. If trading wasn’t about predicting price movements, then what was it all about? After all, profiting was buying (or selling) at one price and then eventually selling (or buying) it back at a higher (or lower) price. How could this be done without any ability to forecast? The answer, which took this teenager some time to understand, was that the edge to pit trading was in the order flow—the succession of mini-routs, as I always called them—and in the discipline; it was in a patient response to someone else’s impatience, someone else’s urgency. The edge was a process—an intertemporal process—an intermediate step to gain an advantage, rather than any direct analytical acumen or information. And its monetization—its roundabout production—required time. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=723))

- When it came time to ask Klipp what to study in college to best prepare me for a career in the bond pit, he advised, “Anything that won’t make you think you know too much” (alas, my economics major would have to remain a dirty secret).

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For the first month or so, my day started and ended with Klipp standing next to me, feeding me trades and testing to see how I managed them. Klipp made it perfectly clear: “You’re not here to make money, you’re here to learn how to trade. If you could walk into the pit to make money, you wouldn’t even be in here. You’d be in a long line all the way down LaSalle Street, still waiting to get in.” This was an imminently roundabout start down a roundabout path. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=747))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Klipp’s methodology was exceedingly simple—almost dubiously so—conveyed as a parent would to a child, not as principles, but as privileges: “As a pit trader, you have two privileges and two privileges only: One, you can demand the edge—buy at the bid price, sell at offer price; two, you can give up that edge when you’ve made a mistake.” The “edge” of Klipp’s allotted privileges is that of the market makers, known as “locals” at the Chicago Board of Trade. (The bond pit was occupied by both locals, virtually all of whom, like me, traded independently for their own accounts, and brokers, whose ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=752))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- job was to execute orders on their clients’ behalf.) What locals do is provide immediacy to those who demand it, meaning they offer prices (a bid price and an ask price) at which they are willing to transact immediately, and in so doing they provide immediate liquidity. In exchange, the locals require a price concession, reflected in their bid and ask prices, a profit they expect to monetize as demands for immediacy flow in from both sides, from buyers as well as sellers. Locals stand in the pit all day waiting for that flow, specifically to trade against an impatient counterparty. It’s not up to the locals to determine when they trade; rather, they wait and, if necessary, wait some more. The price concessions, the “rents” extracted from urgent counterparties (who pay for not having to wait), are the local’s ultimate edge. But, upon receiving such a price concession, the local’s game is not over; he has the advantage, but he must act yet again, either by stepping aside (taking his loss) or following the market back. He accumulates inventory (a position) by transacting against urgent order flow,… ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=757))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- So the sooner he gets out the better, but in so doing his aim is to transact better than his urgent counterparty, from whom he received his position in the first place. The late legendary bond local Charlie DeFrancesca (“Charlie D.”) put it best: “The question is: Can you be more efficient than the market?”28 Klipp liked to think about the local’s role in more standard business terms, such as the inventory markup of the wholesaler or the retailer, or, more generally, the price spreads that exist in different phases of production for any economic good (including futures contracts). Both involve exploiting intertemporal imbalances between raw material and output, providing immediacy to end users, and the intermediation of waiting, carrying intermediate inventory (including capital goods and other factors of production), and providing a final good at just the right time and place (and, as we will see in Chapter 5, the more roundabout this process, typically the greater these spreads). The second allotted privilege was “cruel,” as Klipp would say, because it meant immediately closing… ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=767))

- I was officially in Klipp’s Alpha School of Trading, as everyone called it, after the name of his firm, Alpha Futures. (We were the guys in the aqua jackets who loved to lose money.) Who could argue with this logic? If, as Klipp said, “There’s only one thing that can hurt a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, and that’s a big loss,” then, for God’s sake, “never take a big loss.” As his own mentor said to him some 40 years before, “Any time you can take a loss, do it, and you will always be at the Chicago Board of Trade.” (To which Klipp always added with a smile, “Well, I’ve been losing money since 1954, but he was right, I’m still at the Chicago Board of Trade.”) Naturally, this meant taking many small losses. Hence ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=785))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- you had to “love to lose money,” otherwise you’d just stop doing it. Impatience and intolerance for many such small losses, as well as urgency for immediate profits, Klipp believed, dealt a death blow to traders, an easy and common one. The well-known disposition effect in finance, an observation that goes back at least a century, states that people naturally fall victim to these tendencies, and thus do the opposite of Klipp’s approach: We sweat through large losses and take small profits quickly. Going for the immediate gain feels so right, while taking the immediate loss feels so wrong. The pressing need for consistent and immediate profits is hardwired into our brains; we humans have a shallow depth of field (as we will see in Chapter 6). And nothing is better at amplifying this natural humanness about us than trading too big and having excessive carrying costs. These are the great external magnifying lenses on the immediate. All is decisive when all is at stake, whether through an excessive loss (because of too much leverage)—a loss that you can’t afford to take immediately—or an insufficient gain (because of too much debt). No one trade need ever be decisive. As Klipp said, “One trade can ruin your day. One trade can ruin your week. One trade can ruin your month. One trade can ruin your year. One trade can ruin your career!” ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=791))

- Exploiting others’ immediacy was the logic of the roundabout approach, the fundamental edge—the ultimate edge of trading and investing. In baseball the difference between minor leaguer and major leaguer is generally thought to be in hitting the curve ball, as opposed to just a linearly extrapolated fast ball, and so too is the difference in investing in playing the curve, the roundabout intertemporal bends which deviate from the straight course. My mantra has always been like that of Milwaukee Braves pitcher Lew Burdette, who once said, “I earn my living from the hungriness of hitters.”31 I earn my living from the hungriness of investors, from their decisiveness, their forcefulness, from their great urge for immediacy. And this immediacy was not just the bid-ask spread; it was even more so, as we will see, in the larger routs. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=817))

- The question was: Where should Crusoe fish, or, in the trading pit, how big of a profit was I after—when to grab a winner? Answering this question was necessary to the second step in the roundabout process of pit trading. While Klipp’s methodology, his privileges, defined the edge and the downside of monetizing that edge, it left wide open the size of the profit to wait for. He explained the size of a “good loss,” but said nothing about the size of a “good profit.” He would always say, “While there’s no such thing as taking a loss too quick, you can take a profit too quick—but I can’t tell you when to take a profit.” (The term “scalper” typically meant a local looking to make one tick on every trade. Klipp was the antiscalper.) With Klipp, there was no settling for minnows. The question of profit size was, of course, not about trade size, which was a simple function of account size, and which, of course, would impact both losses ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=853))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and gains proportionately. This was about the size of profits relative to the size of losses, the payoff. In Klipp’s basic asymmetric strategy, the bigger the gain I waited for, the less frequently it would occur, and the more asymmetric (or “positively skewed”) my payoff would be. For example, taking profits only after they reached ten ticks in my favor would naturally happen less frequently, and would be accompanied by more frequent losses, than after just three ticks. (I would often watch a profit of seven, eight, nine ticks come right back and become a one-tick loss. Not fun!) This could be extended to the absurd: I could shoot for hundreds of ticks, which might not happen for many years, perhaps never at all, with nothing but countless one-tick losses until then. On its own, a very potent strategy, but not necessarily very effective, in the end. While Klipp was not a scalper, neither was his approach about hitting the jackpot on one lucky trade; it was about incremental gains, exploiting a systematic edge through time. But, indeed, as the profit objective increased, the trade became the equivalent of holding a basket of long option positions (or convex payoffs). Klipp had an intuitive understanding that the market tended to experience infrequent, large moves—what we call “fat tails,” for mass in the extremes of the frequency distribution of market returns—and that replicating such a basket, in its simplest and most elegant form, was a good way to play it.

- As a young pit trader, ever squeezing my profits, indeed, I was Marco, waiting for the big unknown trophy. It turned out to be a rather productive approach for me (particularly from the limit down bond collapse of 1994), and such asymmetrical casting is a useful idea when the waters are murky, when you don’t know anything (and you don’t even know what you don’t know). But it seemed to be conflating two edges, one systematic and one fuzzy, the local’s edge and some kind of presumed underpriced tendency for large deviations. These were really very much the same, though on different scales. Indeed, all moves in the market, big and small, ultimately have immediacy at their source.

- Economics in One Lesson is an expansion on the essay, “That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen,” by nineteenth-century French economist Frédéric Bastiat (who plays a leading role in Chapter 4 of this book). Hazlitt’s proclamation would become a central tenet for me (wherein I would equivalently swap the words “economics” with “investing” and “act or policy” with “capital and production process”): “The whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=906))

- And overcoming this natural urge was the necessary key to productivity—roundabout production—“the harvesting of the physically more abundant fruits of production processes consuming more time” and, thus, the significant “role played by taking account of waiting time.”36 (Mises rightfully credited this central notion of the roundabout to his predecessor, the great Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, the subject of Chapter 5.) Degrees of impatience—what the Austrians call time preference, the singular source, in Mises’s view, of interest rates—in waiting and forgoing immediate profits (or consumption) and even bleeding capital (such as through costly capital expenditures), was a logical part of our humanness—indeed, part of that humanness which we had to overcome to do certain propitious things (things which cumulatively amounted to the very progress of civilization). This was Klipp’s Paradox, writ large, on the grandest scale, formalized and temporalized in the Austrian economic language.

- Principal among Mises’s praxeological precepts (in addition to the aforementioned time preference) was the notion of the market’s state of rest (or what he called the plain state of rest). The state of rest is essentially an occurrence in a market when “the brokers ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=971))

- have carried out all orders which could be executed at the market price. Only those potential sellers and buyers who consider the market price too low or too high respectively have not sold or bought.”40 It is a “lull” that will end with any new initiating order in the market, any new demand for immediacy, be it in response to news or perceptions of traders, and so forth. The state of rest is an intermittent end to all immediacy, a waypoint at which order flow is exhausted by mutually advantageous exchange, and it reoccurs in the markets over and over again. Mises added another layer to this concept with the hypothetical continuous, yet ever elusive, aim of the market, the final state of rest. This was the price at which all transactions continually balanced and cleared, where no change ever occurred again in a particular market—truly an imaginary construction never attained, the intended destination never arrived at. Every state of rest was the result of a searching, bargaining process, a Preiskampf, or “price duel” as the Austrians called it, by which the markets were guided toward the final state of rest—though, naturally, something would change and it would never be reached. Mises’s description of the market’s ongoing “temporal succession of events,”41 then, was of ever moving from one state of rest to another, ever estimating the inestimable final state of rest.

- Here was Mises’s whole description of the market process, “always disquieted by a striving after a definite state of rest,”42 with each resulting price an error around the final state price; and these errors, what Mises called “false prices,” were the local’s edge. The local needed to perceive as quickly as possible these false prices, the wedges between each successive state of rest and the final state, visible only in the constant entrepreneurial urge to immediately modify and correct them—through an auction process that ultimately exhausted that urgency through overcorrection. Thus the local responded to a force by guiding the price to a new imbalance, a new and brief false state of rest.

- Understanding this process of liquidity is basically about understanding that any market exchange must be perceived as mutually beneficial to both parties. A failure to understand this, particularly in a market dislocation like a crash, is the source of much angst directed toward high-frequency traders, for instance, who cease their liquidity-providing activities (and thus create liquidity holes) when markets get too volatile. Why should we expect anything else? Why shouldn’t the price of immediacy jump to infinity along with perceived demands for immediacy? Why should anyone be expected to accommodate a counterparty at prices that are strongly believed to be in error? After all, to assume anything else would be to assume that liquidity providers are charities. Klipp’s lectures to me as a teenager were spot-on (albeit, expressed in different terms): In ever searching for and finding a new state of rest, the market was always intermittently and provisionally right in correcting an error, though, in never arriving at a final state of rest, in never achieving a synchronized balance in all orders for immediacy, it was always wrong. And the greater the imbalance, the more wrong it was. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1040))

This is a common approach, contained even in the most basic of elementary school lessons. In this axiomatic construct, too, is enduring wisdom, readily found in the ancient texts that embrace metaphors such as the tree yielding to the wind, as from the Laozi, “A tree as great as a man’s embrace springs from a small shoot.”1 Another quintessential Daoist image is the uncarved block known as pu, a state of pure potential. In its uncarved state, the wood appears useless, and it takes tremendous imagination as well as patience to see what it can become; “When the block is carved, it becomes useful. When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler.”2 Time bridges the two—the temporal aspect of means—after which the advantage ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1238))

We look to the conifer and its logic of growth, and we learn from one of the truly great success stories of natural history. Through its adaptive strategy that has allowed it to survive over hundreds of millions of years, the patient and persistent conifer teaches us that it is far better to avoid direct, head-on ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1267))

- For conifers, growth is a patient process that takes tenacity and grit, and most successful with (and even requiring) a roundabout strategy, with slow early stages that create the structure for subsequent fast and efficient development. The conifers’ progress exhibits the teleology of purposeful “behavior” that shows a goal-oriented mechanism in action from their adaptation, as they retreat to the rocks as the means toward an end. In other words, conifers pay now for productivity gains later. In building efficiencies, they aim first toward means (step one), whereas the angiosperms, in their immediate fast growth, aim straight toward ends (the final step). Such purposeful indirectness, focused on means to the attainment of a desired end, does not occur just within the growth of a single conifer. It also governs the growth patterns of conifer stands within the forest. (Of course, my intention is not to infer that conifers are capable of cognition; their strategy is but an optimized product of evolutionary adaptations.) In order to better their overall chances of survival, conifers cede to their competitors the immediate advantage in the most obvious areas, so that they can seed more opportunistically and effectively later on. For their nourishment and survival, conifers do not head directly to the source; rather, like Robinson Crusoe, ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1306))

- It’s not that the forest needs disorder to further its growth, nor does it want major fires such as the infamous inferno that ravaged Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Such massive destruction is as devastating to the forest as war is to civilization (and war is never good for a civilization). Civilizations advance through the accumulation of highly configured capital, which does not thrive amid extreme volatility and destruction; on the contrary, capitalism wants stability—but also the free competitive transferral of resources (through failures, bankruptcies, and the opportunity for profits) to where they are most suited to the needs of consumers. However, when there is a suppressed free market, then even a crash can indeed bring about good because it eliminates unhealthy “growth” or malinvestment. The parallel to the forest is an obvious one: smaller wildfires enable the turnover of resources, transferring them between competitors, from what we might view as a lower order of production (the fast-growing angiosperms) to more roundabout, higher-order production (the conifers). While small natural wildfires destroy with precision (by definition), great unnatural forest fires destroy indiscriminately. This is the unfortunate price paid for the necessary succession. Seeing the configuration of the forest in this way requires an appreciation that it is not a uniform blob of vegetation, but a highly heterogeneous temporal structure. The efficacious growth of the conifers, then, is but a test case of the roundabout strategy in the process of capital deployment, The Dao of Capital and its destination of Austrian Investing.

- Conifers, obviously, cannot send their seeds to a specific place; however, their seeds are, in a sense, directed. For example, strong winds generated by wildfires suck the wind-borne seeds from trees on the periphery into the ravaged areas. Serotinous cones that open only after exposure to high heat and flame also provide seed to regenerate growth after a fire. Even the trees’ intermittent seed dumps may be attuned to wildfire occurrences. All these factors point to the logic of nature. Although the conifer is a dominant metaphor in this chapter and throughout the book, in the real world of the forest a universal strategy is at work that makes these trees among the most successful forms of organic life.

- As a result, over millions of years, conquering armies of conifer species that survived a “great winnowing,” which left only those species that could adapt to the harsh conditions and short growing season in the taiga, built vast empires in the permafrost of the northern climate in Eurasia and North America, the most extensive forests on earth.12 Despite such an unforgiving environment, conifers can conceivably exist forever, to the point that perhaps after 200 years they will dominate completely, edging out all but the occasional angiosperm. But that is not the conifer’s only refuge. Outside of boreal and high-elevation montane regions, “islands” of conifers can even grow among a sea of angiosperms by taking advantage of pockets of poor soil or other spaces with unfavorable growing conditions.

- strategy—in gaining by losing—they are strong. Here, again, we see our two-step process, a strategy of intermediate objectives attained by a group of individual trees in pursuit of an edge, an eventual gain for the species. The conifer’s indirect growth mirrors a central evolutionary mechanism of mate selection, in which the desirable objective sought is not for the direct material advantage of the parent, but rather to improve the fitness of the offspring. Indeed, conifers may be among the most indirect in all of nature when they forego direct material advantage by growing on the rocks, so that, following an intergenerational strategy, they might survive the competition and predators (especially fire) and thus enable their offspring to one day take advantage of better growing conditions (postwildfire). In fact, given the long history of conifers’ evolution, the adaptations and genetic mutations that have enabled them to survive and thrive in the most desolate areas have been ultimately focused on progeny, the untold generations in the future, which one day will gain the advantage during the succession of the forest and seed in the… ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1447))

Here, too, the conifer blazes a trail for The Dao of Capital: “Insight into the ‘wholeness’ of the process that we discern in nature where everything in due course gives rise to its opposite can be instructive in guiding the human experience.”15 For the conifers, their roundabout strategy allows them to withdraw to inhospitable places, all the while producing innumerable pinecones loaded with seeds that can be… ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1458))

- While conifers growing on the rocks may appear to be nature’s outcasts, theirs is truly the false humility of the Daoist manipulator-sage: They withdraw to where others cannot go and then act when conditions suddenly shift and an opportune moment arises, such as after a wildfire. Then we can see the wei wuwei—or what we might call here “seeding by not seeding”—of the conifers: By growing on the rocks they avoid mal-seeding in the fertile areas and thus establish a defensive position that, in time, becomes an offensive vantage point from which they can disperse seeds to be wind-borne to the fire-cleared areas—the same fertile ground from which they originally retreated. In nature’s demonstration of tuishou (or “push hands”), conifers pose no resistance to the angiosperms in the obvious, fertile places, yielding to the rout that sends them up into the craggy, isolated places. But when the angiosperms extend too far and produce dense overgrowth that leads to wildfires, the conifer follows them back, dumping their seeds on the newly vacated ground.

- In this scenario of forested Schadenfreude, fire is friend, not foe, to the patient conifer—nature’s greatest opportunist. Although some angiosperms will also move into the cleared area and spring up quickly, conifers can often gain a roothold over this initial competition and, in time, develop into a largely homogeneous forested stand. Thus, as biologist and conifer expert Aljos Farjon wrote, it is the nature of the conifers “to outlive their neighbours and occupy their living space . . .”17 The very strategy of their growth exploits opportunities brought about by shifting ecology, climate, and the system’s mechanism of adaptation through internal adjustment and discovery, in pursuit of homeostasis.

- Shi can also serve as a tool in the same way that a handle makes an axe so much more effective.12 The intermediate advantage is in both the tools and their assembly—their “purchase” (another meaning for shi)—the configuration of assets into the means of an ultimate objective. (An asset need not be physical or material; it can be a state, as in an advantageous readiness.) Strategic positional advantage is never fixed, but emerges intertemporally through roundabout means amidst fluid and shifting factors—the enemy’s strategic position, the rise and fall of the terrain, light and dark, cold and heat, sun and fog. With awareness of all these elements, the commander must move only when they are in optimal alignment—and actively seek a position of their optimal alignment.13 The shi of Sun Wu was to “make the most of the strategic advantage” and “if there is no advantage, do not move into action.”14 This may mean “occupying the key passes and lying in ambush”; when there is no such terrain, one must “hide in the shadows and the mist” and “go by way of places that would never occur” to the enemy, and thus catch him off guard.15 Just as in ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=1655))

A report from the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, while noting a lack of a direct Western translation, defined shi as a “strategic configuration of power” and as roughly equivalent to an “alignment of forces,” as well as potential and propensity, which “only a skilled strategist can exploit.”27 To summarize, a shi strategy boils down to acquiring positional advantage and superiority for an easier, if not assured, victorious fight to follow. Shi is always focused more on the future than the current moment, an emphasis on “upstream,” intermediate aims, or intermediate foci within the field, becoming means, and by which the ultimate ends can be more readily achieved.

Then there is the yet unseen, what comes next as the consequence of the former, realized in the latter—which can, indeed, become the foreseen. Herein, we find a time sequence, a sequential seen and unseen—not to be confused with the concurrent seen and unseen, one visible and one hidden. To emphasize, our focus is on the temporal, on an extended depth of field from the immediate to the intermediate and beyond. With the foreseen—a key concept that comes to us from Frédéric Bastiat, a proto-Austrian economist and a key figure of ([Location 2219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=2219))

- this chapter—moving from proximate to ultimate, the future becomes clearer, even obvious, but not because of prediction, the stuff of naïve data analyses and mathematical models. One cannot learn from history, a posteriori, because causal relationships are deceptively veiled from our perception (what is unfortunately termed the “teleological fallacy”). Rather, in many cases the foreseen emerges through the logical rigor of deduction, based on what one knows (and, to some degree, what one observes and experiences) as a sentient human being. The bridge from the seen to the foreseen is crossed purposefully, via a teleological path of means and ends—our familiar Ziel as Mittel to achieve a Zweck, the common thread of the Clausewitzian strategy. Means are teleological; that is to say, means are tools used in service of a telos, an end or goal. The more disparate these means and ends, the more roundabout and circuitous the route as opposed to direct, often the more efficient and efficacious—a fundamental conviction and investment theme of this book. In this thought paradigm of seen and unseen, and the teleology of means to a purposeful end, we find the Austrian School of Economics and its unique methodology that is grounded in deduction, a priorism, and the subjectivity of human preferences.

- Through a series of economic parables, using counterfactual comparisons of free trade and interventionism, Bastiat draws the reader’s attention from only the seen to what is yet unseen, but which can be foreseen. As Bastiat wrote, “In the department of the economy, an act, a habit, an institution, a law, gives birth not only to an effect, but to a series of effects. Of these effects, the first only is immediate; it manifests itself simultaneously with its cause—it is seen. The others unfold in succession—they are not seen: It is well for us if they are foreseen.”14 The dilemma, as Bastiat correctly pointed out, arises when favorable or unfavorable ends, whose obvious means (and their natural time element) are neglected, are thus not foreseen. This ability to look beyond the obvious of the immediate seen and to foresee its later outcomes was, in Bastiat’s view, the true differentiator. “Now this difference is enormous, for it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the ultimate consequences are fatal, and the converse. Hence it follows that the bad economist pursues a small present good, which will be followed by a great evil to come, while the true economist pursues a great good to come, at the risk of a present small evil.”15 In his language of “series of effects” and “a small present good” that is followed by “a great evil to come,” Bastiat elevates the temporal, and with it the disdain ([Location 2355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=2355))

- for immediacy, the atemporal. Coupled with this is the importance of deductive foresight, a “more gentle teacher” than the far rougher one of inductive experience, which “teaches effectually, but brutally.” The key is to free oneself from a tyranny of first consequences, overvaluing what comes first at the expense of what inevitably comes later. As Bastiat warned, “The sweeter the fruit of habit is, the more bitter are the consequences.”16 As we will see later in the book, in this we glean the very essence of Austrian Investing.

- The gospel of this book, which should be obvious by now, is the strategic positional advantage gained in the roundabout way, in the relation of indirect means and conditions to ultimate ends and consequences—that is, in intentionally (and counterintuitively) going right in order to better go left, rather than taking the direct route (the “false shortcut”1). We have approached the roundabout by way of synonymous concepts across the historical foundation of strategic thought, from the Daoists’ shi to the Prussians’ Ziel, Mittel, und Zweck, culminating now with a core tenet of the great Austrian economic tradition: Umweg. Umweg, like shi, is a lowly and mundane term, which disguises its philosophical and practical significance. It translates literally as “detour,” “indirect,” or “roundabout route,” and its economic meaning springs from a pillar of the Austrian School, a man who was truly a cofounder with Carl Menger: Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk. Building upon Menger’s theories, Böhm-Bawerk clarified and popularized them, and then cumulatively postulated more of his own—crucial to the study of value, capital, and interest. Indeed, had it been left to Menger, sequestered in his library and consumed with constant revisions of his previous works, the Austrian tradition would have surely died on the vine. It was under Böhm-Bawerk, who was no mere disciple, that the Austrian approach acquired the rigor to be considered a school of economic thought.

- It is important to understand that Produktionsumweg is not simply about having production take longer, not just indirectness for the sake of it; taking the roundabout route is not the same as merely taking more time. There is no advantage or virtue in delays, procrastination, meandering, or going out of one’s way for no reason. In Produktionsumweg, one amasses the tools of one’s trade, the intermediate goods that will add proficiency and efficiency to the pursuit, the result of which is realized in the future. As Böhm-Bawerk observed, “That roundabout methods lead to greater results than direct methods is one of the most important and fundamental propositions in the whole theory of production.” ([Location 3010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3010))

The same process, we recognize, is occurring with our conifers of Chapter 2 that seed into the rocky, inhospitable places where they initially will fall behind—growing slowly and hungry for nutrients—but from which they will realize greater growth and opportunism later, thanks to their buildup of advantageous efficiency, position, and vantage point.

- Faustmann sought to correctly answer a simple and pressing question: How economical is an area of forestland? Specifically, how do the expected future forestry economics of that land, viewed in the present (what Faustmann called Bodenerwartungswerte, which we’ll refer to as the land expectation value—LEV), jibe with the current market value of bare land (the land replacement value, or LRV, of forestland in operation)? That is, is available land affordable for use in or for conversion into forestry, or is it better off used for something else? Essentially, Faustmann was trying to calculate the premium or discount of the appraised capitalized present value of forestry land, relative to the market’s current appraisal of such available land in a fallow state (or, say, under agricultural use).

- Suffering through the slow-growth present is but a means to the future fast-growth end, but first the forester must overcome the external constraint on his patience: the opportunity cost of capital. And to German foresters’ credit, this was an idea hinted at by Frédéric Bastiat but not yet discovered or formalized until Menger, and ultimately coined in 1914 by Menger’s pupil, Wieser. In opportunity cost the Austrians recognized not only what one must pay, but the foregone opportunity of what that same amount of capital invested elsewhere (with similar risk) could have earned. An entrepreneur who, for example, invests a sum of money in land must consider not only what he will get from whatever he builds or plants on that property, but also what he could have gotten from alternatives—including leaving it in the bank. The interest rate, therefore, becomes an objective way of determining the true economic costliness of Produktionsumweg.

- When the physical growth of the forest and the expected future price of timber are such that they yield a greater return than the market interest rate, the opportunity cost of cutting the timber and selling at the spot price is too high; the forester should stay his axe. However, when the physical growth and expected future price yield a lower return than the interest rate, then the benefit of today’s revenue exceeds the opportunity cost of cutting; the forester should chop away.

- Clearly, then, an increase in the interest rate, with all else equal, reduces the optimal r rotation period—in other words, increase the interest rate and you shorten the profitable period of production. (This could be taken right out of an Austrian textbook.) The intertemporal decision of when to cut the forest was thus solved: Taking the price of timber and the interest rate as given, as well as the relation between the period of rotation and the revenues to be received from each cutting on this schedule, Faustmann showed foresters how to maximize the LEV by finding the optimal r. From there, the true economic discounted value was solved. ([Location 3259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3259))

- He does, however (along with, most notably, his Swedish disciple Johan Gustav Knut Wicksell), repeat Faustmann’s conclusion, the axiom of the axe: that timber is economically viable (and thus immature) as long as new growth in tree value as a percentage of the current land and stand value (the return on invested capital, ROIC) exceeds the compounding opportunity cost of owning that land and stand value (the opportunity cost of capital, i).

- What does this mean when growth is slow at first and fast later—as in our accelerating-tortoise and hare fable of the conifer? Is it really ideal to chop down the slow-growing (young tree) at its first hint of life, or to call the race before our tortoise finds his legs? This is the paradox of the roundabout (which we recall as Klipp’s Paradox): You cannot simply measure the economics in the immediate stage, as that would make you Bastiat’s “bad economist”; the immediate may show a loss that is but the means for a later exceedingly profitable stage bestowed by a longer period of production. Faustmann’s ratio, as a rule of thumb, holds for all capital, beyond only trees and dirt. Thus, we can see the common ground of Faustmann’s discovery of the obvious in forestry and, right behind him, Böhm-Bawerk’s theory of capital and interest: Lower interest rates—or, more precisely, lower time preference (saving now to consume later)—lead to more Produktionsumweg, whether in a pine stand or any other capital goods.

- As the concentric rings illustrate, the production process and value emanate cumulatively from the core. The process flows outward over time, through successive rings as more factors of production are added to the previous inputs, turning them into intermediate goods. The more intermediate layers there are the more roundabout production becomes. Then, at the outermost ring, a final, finished good is pushed out into the marketplace. (Unlike a tree’s static rings, however, the area between each ring is constantly being expanded or contracted.)

- Böhm-Bawerk pointed out that capital structures are cumulative (indeed, autocatalytic); what comes before leads to and is contained in what comes later. In effect, we might think of all the previous capital and inputs congealing (or becoming encapsulated, if that’s a more palatable term) in the next ring. For instance, a most elemental capital good dating back some 10,000 years is a goat, which can be consumed at once as meat or (if female) can become an intermediate “tool” ([Location 3341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3341))

- which produces milk to consume. Furthermore, that milk (when recombined with a goat’s stomach and rennet) can become a factor of production of cheese; the cheese can become an ingredient, perhaps to make fondue, and so forth. Each of these consumer goods, in turn, becomes a sequential intermediate good for (and, thus, is “contained” in) the next subsequent consumer good, and each adds another ring to an increasingly roundabout production process. Not butchering the goat now—sparing the golden goose, as it were—and instead waiting, hungry, for months for a great many (hopefully) exquisite goat’s milk tommes is the capitalistic intertemporal tradeoff in a nutshell, the very source of humanity’s emergence from its historical hand-to-mouth existence.

- For Ford, the Ziel of increased efficiencies and lower production costs drove toward a Zweck of lower prices for consumers (and, ultimately, a more productive business), believing that the ultimate beneficiary ought to be the public—a postulate that would have put him in good stead with the Austrian School. (If it were within my power to go back in time to arrange a meeting, it would surely be between Ford, Böhm-Bawerk, and Mises, whose lives overlapped.) Ford stood for the “buying public” and its right to goods and services at the lowest possible cost. He believed it was far better to “sell a large number of cars at ([Location 3468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3468))

- a reasonably small margin than to sell fewer cars at a large margin of profit.” With this attitude, he viewed a profit as “far more a fund to insure future progress than it is a payment for past performance.”33 Paying out profits in the form of dividends, particularly on preferred stock with burdensome payouts, put profits into a few hands rather than back into more roundabout production. As Ford said, “The owners and the workers will get their reward by the increased amount of business the lower prices bring. Industry cannot exist for a class.”34 (Insufficient capital reinvestment, as we will revisit later on, is essentially capital consumption in lieu of the roundabout.) Focusing on profits over productivity, ends over means, was, in Ford’s words, “trying to drive with the cart before the horse.”35 Ford warned against “the most common error of confusing money and business,” which he blamed on the stock market for leading people to believe that “business is good if there is lively gambling upward in stocks, and bad if the gamblers happen to be forcing stock prices down.” He eloquently viewed the stock market as a “side show,”36 and little did he know how increasingly true this would be—as so much of investing today is the domain of “punters” over seekers of productive capital. To Ford, like in taijiquan and at the weiqi board, there were two distinct games going on between the stock market and true investment, the former a mere shadow of the latter. Disdainful of finance and suspicious of banks all his life (his abominable stereotypes and prejudices aside), Ford made the “shortsighted finance” of Wall Street his nemesis, viewing it as “strings on a business” in stark ([Location 3473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3473))

He exposed what he called the “fallacy which has steered our country and other countries wrong on so many matters touching industry—the fallacy that business is money, and that big business is big money.”38 Make no mistake: Ford was a true-blue capitalist, who… ([Location 3489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3489))

- Our focus on Ford, though, is not for his political or monetary ideas, but for those in which he showed genius like none other, as a roundabout entrepreneur who rightly regarded capital as the lifeblood of a progressing business and economy. His was an inherently intertemporal orientation, and his depth of field stretched beyond any one year or season (like the good farmer he was at heart). It was no coincidence, then, that the more successful Ford became the more he embraced his agrarian roots, which he had never really abandoned. He immortalized the rural ideal in his Greenfield Village near Dearborn, Michigan, where more than 80 historic structures are preserved, from the Wright Brothers’ cycle shop to Edison’s Menlo Park laboratory where he experimented with the electric light. (Wandering the grounds gives insight into Ford’s resolve for authenticity, simplicity, and patience—one can imagine him, in his later years, reveling in threshing hay by hand; indeed, in these he gained ([Location 3538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3538))

- Much of human activity, particularly in endeavors that are more strategic (and I use the Clausewitzian Ziel-Zweck, “means of gaining greater superiority” definition) or higher-order versus those that are less so, benefits from roundaboutness and a decidedly indirect means-end approach. Despite the strategic advantage of being Umweg, it is extremely difficult to think and act in this way (as we will address in the next chapter); most people just can’t do it. (If roundabout were easy, then everyone would do it, and no doubt the strategic advantage derived from it would be eliminated altogether.) Moreover, the roundabout route may very well be overlooked because all we tend to see is the final product, the ultimate end—while we are blind to what came before, the remote means to that end. And yet, there are enough examples in life that demonstrate the advantages of roundaboutness (even outside of the obvious martial applications). Once again, like good Daoists, we turn to nature. The evolutionary mechanism of mate selection often employs a strategy whose aims are indirect benefits in the form of better adaptive genetic characteristics for the offspring, as opposed to direct and immediate benefits realized by the mates. This is a pretty extraordinary thing, the same intertemporal, intergenerational strategy of the conifers growing on the rocks, where what happens in this moment is but a means to a strategic advantage for the progeny. Selection for offspring fitness in this way shapes the very mechanisms that enable this roundabout process to persist.

A very real and deeply encoded impediment acts as a natural, built-in barrier—that humanness about us. We are not made with a predilection toward shi, roundaboutness, and capitalistic production and investment. We are adaptively designed to favor the tactical li—immediate, direct, decisive—over the strategic shi—intermediate, indirect, roundabout. It is no wonder, then, that having an intertemporal perspective and perception is such an underestimated and overlooked advantage, and yet it is also one of the most influential, a distinct intelligence, and key to our success.

- Our perception of time is central to this book and to our ability—or far more likely inability—to implement its methodology of Austrian Investing. You see, the roundabout runs afoul of the very way we perceive the ticking of the clock, and, more specifically, all the moments in all those ticks and tocks. As we will see, our perception of time is diametrically opposed to our appreciation of and our ability to engage in the roundabout. And yet, because the direct, the li, is endemic to humans, we have within our grasp the means to exploit it in others—that is, if we can overcome the seemingly insurmountable. To do so, we must make the turn toward shi by going against the grain of our very nature. This requires a complete inversion of a behavioral pattern known as time inconsistency (and generally expressed mathematically with a hyperbolic discounting model). This pattern, present in all of us and distorted to extreme and even dangerous levels in the cases of addictions, is to be impatient now, all the while holding fast to the self-delusion of being able to be patient later. (And, of course, when later becomes now, we are just as impatient.) We expect to act very differently through time than we actually do, predictably throwing a wrench in our best-laid plans, especially the more roundabout ones. This phenomenon plagues us, in all aspects of life; not just in financial decisions, but also things such as weight loss, learning a foreign ([Location 3725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=3725))

Unless we find a way to deal effectively with our skewed time expectations, everything we have discussed up to this point becomes moot—a mere intellectual flight-of-fancy with no chance of ever being implemented. In Austrian Investing, we must plan to do and then actually do the complete opposite of these ingrained time expectations; we must, instead, become strategically patient now—but not as the practice of some virtue toward realizing a platitude-laden future. Rather, we are patient now for the sole purpose of becoming intensely and rapaciously impatient later; though difficult to perceive, this is the teleological, causal arrow of time in roundabout investing. This calls to mind Henry Ford who exhibited tremendous patience as he waited for months if not years all the while spending profits on a production plant and equipment to become more roundabout; then, when production started, he stood there impatiently with a stopwatch, counting the seconds until each finished car rolled off the assembly line. This roundabout ideal is a temporal two-step, a dance of duality that defies the reality of how we really think and act over time. (Just ask any dieter, who absolutely must have a slice of Schokoladenkuchen now, but is completely convinced of having the ability to start and stick to a diet tomorrow.)

- Austrian Investing is about an intertemporal exchange as the very source of profit—now for an anticipated later. This exchange was central to the wisdom of our old grain trader Everett Klipp at the Chicago Board of Trade, where demands for immediacy in the pit bestowed an edge on those able to provide it—the basis of virtually all bonefide investment edges. For this task, we embrace the circuitousness of wuwei, of “doing by not doing,” and “gaining by losing” (and of Klipp’s “loving to lose”). All the while, we keep in mind that the patience and “false humility”2 of wuwei are neither procrastination nor passive waiting.

If it were that easy then everyone would do it and, as we said about Produktionsumweg in Chapter 5, any advantage from it would no doubt disappear. (There would be a great many Henry Fords foregoing profits to build more tools.) The key is in the human brain and what we know about those gray-matter structures that govern our thoughts, impulses, desires, and behaviors. But before going to the scientific and empirical, we again follow the lead of the Austrians by taking a logical, deductive approach that starts with the individual.

- The prospective is not the only span of time slices altered by perception; its mirror image, the retrospective, has its own brand of myopia, called static gestalt characteristics: We tend to remember things based on singular moments—how they come to a close (in addition to the peak intensity moment), their most temporally adjacent moment that marks the end of the past and the beginning of the future. Researchers have explained this phenomenon with a metaphor inspired by writer Milan Kundera, that “memory does not take film, it takes photographs.”14 We can see this as a “focusing illusion,” whereby, as Daniel Kahneman wrote, our mistake is one of “attention to selected moments and neglect of what happens at other times.”15 We just don’t process and perceive time very well, neither forward nor backward. Our mental time travel, forward and back, is imperfect. (Interestingly, amnesiacs and schizophrenics, who experience memory losses and deficiencies, struggle with planning for and imagining the future.) All of us, to some degree, experience, perceive, and recall time very differently than the linear movement of the clock, and downright erroneously.

- The general tendency toward time inconsistency was later concisely illustrated in an example that we’ll call “Thaler’s apples” (named for the University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler who hypothesized it), which presents the following choices:26 A1. One apple today A2. Two apples tomorrow B1. One apple in one year B2. Two apples in one year plus one day The typical impatient human would likely opt for one apple today (A1) over two apples tomorrow (A2). As the old adage goes, we prefer the “bird in the hand” instead of multiple birds in the bush. Acting like preschool children, we seize even the smallest enjoyment in the current moment, regarding it as outweighing, as Bohm-Bawerk observed, “the greatest and most lasting advantage.”27 On the basis of time preference alone, and the general present-bias, this makes sense—we want the smaller sooner rather than wait for the larger later. (It appears we change from preschoolers less than we think.) Where the time inconsistency revealed itself was in the projection a year hence. In his experiment, Thaler found that no one would settle for only one apple in a year (B1) when waiting an extra day would yield two ([Location 4029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4029))

- Bombarded by technology, they exist in a faux present in which everything is accelerated, creating a “present shock,”30 as termed by Douglas Rushkoff, which references the view of Alvin Toffler’s 1970 Future Shock that we struggle with processing change itself, made worse by today’s ever faster (from an ever-autocatalytic) pace. (As modern as these concepts may seem, they are anchored firmly in Böhm-Bawerkian thought.) As we might expect, research shows that children and young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit more pronounced hyperbolic discounting and a stronger preference for immediate rewards than those who do not have the disorder. If we extrapolate these findings, how might they apply to adults who do not have attention deficit disorder (ADD), but experience “pseudo-ADD” because of the pressure of multitasking? Is modernity with its ubiquitous productivity-enhancing technology tools turning us into a society of hyper-hyperbolic discounters? These questions are worth considering given the findings of Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist who, in his superb book CrazyBusy, discussed the plight of adults who did not have ADD, but for whom a “severe case of modern life” gave them ADD-like symptoms (what he calls “F-state” for “frantic, frenzied, ([Location 4094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4094))

- forgetful, flummoxed, frustrated, and fragmented”). Although there are variations in severity, the empirical propensity of heightened hyperbolic discounting among those with these conditions reinforces the importance of awareness and metaknowledge to rein in impulses and prevent actions in the moment from jeopardizing the future.31 (It also reinforces my long-held suspicion that PDAs—particularly those with stock tickers—are akin to spikes through the head.) Hallowell’s findings would seem to make self-regulation as enabled by the cool shi system all the more important; without it people cannot pursue distal goals instead of succumbing to the temptation of “proximal stimuli.”32 Unless the shi system functions, intertemporal choice is ineffective—even to the extreme in Phineas Gage’s case of being completely eliminated. Research is increasingly showing that a restorative for what I’m calling the shi system is time spent in the woods, particularly in children, for whom exposure to nature seems to mitigate the impact of ADHD (or, as Richard Louv calls it, “Nature Deficit Disorder”).33 By the same token, why wouldn’t leisurely, contemplative exposure to a coniferous forest with its edifying successions over time help to stretch out our time perception?

This brings the forward back to the present to where we can best process it and feel it. Fortunately (for the persistence of the Austrian Investing edge), no such pill is yet available to economists or investors. But the trick of time compression has also been used to motivate other behaviors impacted by myopic time inconsistency and the chronic tendency among people not to maximize utility over intervals of time. Merrill Lynch’s “Face Retirement” feature is an online tool that ages pictures of consumers, thus enabling them to “see” how they will appear in the future. What might be dismissed as a clever marketing gimmick is actually based on a Stanford University experiment that showed such age-enhanced pictures helped people to save more.37 In ([Location 4141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4141))

- effect, they gained more salience for their forward selves by looking eye-to-eye at them. The Merrill Lynch tool might even be seen as playing off the theme of Aesop’s fable of the “Ant and the Grasshopper,” which extols the virtue of planning for the future. During the warm summer months, the grasshopper, unconscious of the lean winter months to come, spends all his time and energy singing in the sun. The industrious ant, meanwhile, with a better grasp of what is to come, works all summer to “save” for the future—storing up food to eat in the winter. When the weather turns bitter cold, the ant is prepared while the grasshopper is sorely in need. Or consider a staple of bedtime fairytales, that of the “Three Little Pigs”: one who quickly builds a house of straw in order to maximize his time for pleasure and relaxation now; another who spends just a bit more time to make a house of sticks, but quickly joins the straw-builder in play; and the third who foregoes all recreation now and constructs a sturdy house of bricks. When the big, bad wolf huffs and puffs, straw and sticks cannot stand; fortunately for these two high-time preference pigs, their industrious (and no doubt Austrian-read) friend safely ensconced in brick does not bar the door. My favorite such cultural reference to seeing beyond the present self is the short 1945 children’s book The Carrot Seed by Ruth Krauss. “A little boy planted a carrot seed,” and then had to withstand a ([Location 4149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4149))

If such cautionary tales of intertemporal-swapping insects, pigs, and gardening babes are lost on us, there are other cultural threads to follow—the Protestant work ethic and the godliness of industriousness, which is found in many denominations (as well as some other faith traditions). Like their Puritan forebears, the Protestants saw work not just as a means to earn a wage, but as “an absolute end in itself—a ‘calling’.”39 Working, saving, moderating pleasure today, and preparing for tomorrow (secularly and spiritually) encourage a low time preference, enhance a depth of field perspective (indeed, all the way to kingdom come). When our forward perception sharpens, we can, in effect, invert the hyperbolic curve—thus becoming more patient in the present so that we allow ourselves the advantage to act opportunistically impatient in a coming slice of time. By establishing a forward-leaning means-ends framework we put the teleology of time on our side, which enables us to pursue greater exploits in the future. Importantly—and this is where Umweg and time preference work together—inverting our present versus future patience allows a… ([Location 4160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4160))

And it is insidious, malleable, and manipulated by circumstance. It gets worse, so much worse. Böhm-Bawerk’s calls for lower time preference as a prescription to the advantage of roundaboutness are not without their own serious pitfalls. As we will see from Mises in Chapter 8, our perception of time, distorted as it is by our cognitive and emotional equipment, is highly vulnerable to other, more insidious (though seemingly benign) and far more destructive monetary distortions. This is the provenance of the acutely distorted world we live in today—the avoidance of which is a requisite component of Austrian Investing.

- pleasure and success now. Therein lies a systematic, universal source of edge to the Austrian Investing approach—perhaps the main takeaway of this chapter. But, as Klipp always said, “This is easy for me to say, very difficult or even impossible for you to do.” To exploit this edge is to escape our temporal shackles, requiring nothing less than deliberate and continuous mindfulness and self-discipline. With the metaknowledge of the workings of our own minds we can better attempt to consciously invert our time inconsistency, becoming patient now in order to be strategically impatient later. This critical step is the only way to link the knowledge accumulated thus far along The Dao of Capital with its application and implementation. Much of the investment success I’ve had has resulted unequivocally from a constant practice and plodding, with the early, indispensable prodding of Klipp, to deal with time inconsistency—developing an ability to keep the whole sequence of the slices of time as fully part of the game, and not just maximizing an arbitrary slice at each beginning. With awareness and then some degree of mastery (it is a lifelong journey) we can thus move to the next phase in the Austrian tradition—where the market is a process and we, freed of our inborn temporal biases, can recognize and take our place within it.

- It should be noted that the MS index is similar to the well-known Tobin’s Q ratio (and in fact my calculated values of the MS index used in Chapter 9 are essentially the same as the Equity Q ratio), as discussed by Nobel laureate James Tobin in 1969. Strictly speaking, Tobin’s Equity Q calculation nets assets against corporate debt in the denominator; this is equivalent to our treatment of the Faustmann ratio, because debt and interest expenses can be subtracted from the LRV and LEV, respectively, without any impact or change in meaning. (Faustmann assumed no debt in his forestry operation, but accounting for it is trivial.) However, I will reserve the honor of its “discovery” to Mises, not Tobin, because Tobin’s work on the Q ratio came much later and also because Tobin patently misunderstood its meaning and the consequences of using it as a monetary policy gauge of effectiveness. (The significance of the index lies entirely in the concepts—not the accounting or empiricism—behind it.) Not only did Tobin arrive at his measure via a different path from the one taken in this book, but his policy recommendations—what Tobin did with his analysis—were also quite different. Tobin recognized, as we ([Location 4723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4723))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- have here, that loose monetary policy could cause the valuation of assets to exceed their replacement value, which would cause the Q ratio to exceed 1. Yet, Tobin, operating within the simpler Keynesian view of the capital stock of the economy, thought this would be a good thing, drawing forth (as one would expect) real physical investment in new capital goods and making the economy more productive. (As if to help me underscore this very point, just as I was finalizing this manuscript, Paul Krugman in his New York Times blog admitted that the economy presented some “real puzzles.” Krugman wondered, “Why, with profits so high, don’t businesses invest more?” and he explicitly brought up Tobin’s Q. Making it all the more fitting for my point here, Krugman dismissed these “real-side” puzzles as having nothing whatsoever to do with the Fed’s monetary policies, and saw no “signature” of an asset bubble.26) So heretofore, the MS index is what matters most, not only among the entrepreneurs in the Nibelungenland but also among the rest of us, in the real world of capitalistic investing.

People are scaling back their purchases of consumer goods such as goat’s milk and saving more, perhaps with the intention of buying lumber (or even more goat’s milk) in the future. In other words, consumers’ time preferences have fallen: Savings are increasing and, as a result, interest rates are declining.

- In this Nibelungen scenario, in which interest rates naturally respond, without intervention, to changes in time preference, Siegfried knows that lower interest rates mean that the present value of the expected cash flows from forestry rise because their more-distant profits are discounted to a lesser degree. (He might possibly also consider that consumers who are saving now could be expected to buy more things like lumber in the future.) What he knows intuitively (smart guy, that Siegfried) is that his Faustmann ratio ([Location 4768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4768))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is greater than 1—at least for now—as consumer spending is being diverted from now until later, while future expenditures are now discounted by a lower interest rate. Bottom line: the aggregate value of owning his land operations has increased. Siegfried knows exactly what to do: divert more land out of pasture and into the roundabout production of timber. (Keep in mind that, in a forest, the growing stock of trees is capital goods, not land, in an economic classification. Given a plot of suitable land, a forest can be “built” by humans, but it takes time. Thus, the amount of trees of a certain age available at a given time is not a fact of nature’s endowment; it is a product of human intervention, just as surely as a tractor.) To the extent that bringing new land under cultivation requires the investment of real resources—using labor and tools to clear the land, till the soil, dig irrigation trenches, install irrigation, and so forth—the transformed product is new “capital,” too, even though it might initially sound odd to describe a parcel of land as “capital.” ([Location 4771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4771))

- In this section, we have been walking through the implications of a sudden and unexpected change in consumer time preference. Their sudden desire to save more will help some producers and hurt others. Milk prices fall because consumers are cutting back their purchases in order to save more. In the short run, the return on land devoted to pasture falls. On the other hand, return on more roundabout timberland rises. Siegfried makes a profit on his timber holdings, but, alas, poor Günther is once again left behind as he suffers a further decline in the profitability of his pastures. In the aggregate, though, Siegfried’s gains outweigh Günther’s losses because in this scenario there is genuine saving and investment. It is a classic example of what Mises called a progressing (no longer stationary) economy, as defined by a period of capital accumulation. Now, we could imagine some other changes in Nibelungenland in response to the lower consumer time preference. One of our three Unternehmer might decide to invest in cheese production, a roundabout process of intermediate length, longer than selling goat’s milk every day, but much shorter than growing trees ([Location 4785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4785))

- for lumber. And, thanks to lower interest rates, it is now more profitable. In our progressing economy, the MS index, as stated, would rise, but the effect would be fleeting. The numerator goes up because aggregate profits from timber producers would be greater than aggregate losses from milk producers (Mises and subsequent Austrians have argued that genuine savings from consumers are the source of the aggregate net profit). However, the denominator would go up quickly, too, because the new savings would be immediately channeled into financing net capital acquisitions, such as land and equipment for timber or cheese production. Therefore, there is no reason to expect a genuine, savings-driven drop in interest rates (which causes a brief, intermittent move out of stationarity) to trigger a systematic change in the MS index. The increase in aggregate profits (measured in monetary terms) that causes the numerator to increase would be counterbalanced very quickly by an increase in the market value of the actual assets owned collectively. The same underlying cause—namely, a drop in time preference and, hence, increased savings by consumers—would drive increases in both the numerator and denominator. As we can see, the numerator would never get ahead of the denominator (or vice versa) for very long, because even roundabout production would entail immediate transactions to acquire more factors of ([Location 4794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=4794))

- production. (To expect otherwise is to expect “greedy entrepreneurs” to fully recognize higher profits in their operations—through a higher LEV—yet refrain from exploiting them.) In Nibelungenland, there is a hum of activity among the timber operations, dairies and creameries, toolmakers, and all the rest. These normal market forces push the MS index immediately back to 1. As Siegfried and his peers go about their business, there is no need to take a particular stand on the “rationality” of investors or the lack thereof; they may suffer from waves of “animal spirits” (à la Keynes) or have “irrational exuberance” (à la Robert Shiller).

- The canonical exposition of Mises’s theory shows clearly how monetary distortions lead to the business cycle that is so evident in Nibelungenland: Credit expansion (i.e., monetary inflation coming from the banks) pushes interest rates down artificially, thereby causing an unsustainable boom period of false prosperity. Because the price-discovery and price-signaling system is distorted, entrepreneurs try to invest more while consumers save less, and, even worse, investments are channeled into the wrong lines. These “real” imbalances eventually result in a general crash, which takes many resources (including labor) out of use temporarily as the economy adjusts to the harsh reality.

- In the Austrian view, the familiar business cycle that periodically plagues modern market economies is the result of government intervention in money and banking; as Mises told us, once a boom sets in, a bust is inevitable—the only question is when. Rather than employ the typical Keynesian solution of goosing spending to get out of a recession, the Austrians would rather avoid the preceding boom altogether. The longer the boom lasts, egged on by accommodative central bank policy—and the more distorted the capital structure becomes—the worse the ensuing crash. By now, it should be clear why the crucial concept used in our parable and completely applicable in the real world is called the MS index, named as it is for Mises who identified the distortive forces at work in the business cycle. Mises’s perspective, and that of the other Austrians, proves to be the superior one. First, we can see why monetary policy can yield a ratio that is persistently higher than 1, even though in the beginning it seems paradoxical and nonsensical. Second, we understand why the types of capital investments spurred by artificially low interest rates are undesirable. Yet with the richer Austrian concept of the roundabout structure of production, we know that the types of investment ultimately matter even more.

- When Ludwig von Mises stood at the front of that lecture hall in 1954 to proclaim “the market is a process,” he labored under no delusion that we lived in a natural system, free of the distortion of intervention. In 1954, the Federal Reserve was in its 41st year, and attempting at the time to “manage” the economy after a mild recession while curbing inflation (a brief, but more severe recession would follow in 1958). Mises, the father of Austrian business cycle theory, knew all too well the disastrous effects of inflation and expansion, which prove far worse than deflation and contraction. As he wrote in Human Action, “Expansion squanders scarce factors of production by malinvestment and overconsumption. If it once comes to an end, a tedious process of recovery is needed in order to wipe out the impoverishment it has left behind. But contraction produces neither malinvestment nor overconsumption.” Although there is a decline in business activities during a contraction, there is also less consumption of both consumer goods and factors of production.

- interior of a house to become as hot as a furnace or as cold as a freezer. When the feedback loop is short-circuited by distortion and manipulation, rather than the system being one that cancels out its errors, it is transformed into one that even magnifies them, such that the errors of inappropriate, unhealthy growth take over the system. When this occurs the system breaks down. There is disconnection in entrepreneurial decisions of whether to invest in more roundabout production based on anticipated demand from consumers (which will probably not materialize), or whether to exploit current higher demand; trees attempt to thrive beyond the capacity of the forest ecosystem to produce and sustain healthy growth. Yet, inevitably, even if the system has been forcibly pushed far out of balance and its governing forces debilitated, homeostasis will eventually reemerge as the communication and governing forces are freed once again. At this point we should pause to clarify one aspect of our discussion that might trouble some readers: How can we speak of a system’s internal “communication,” when there may be no conscious mind at work? And how can we define “thriving” or “failures” within a system, in a nonarbitrary way? In the case of a thermostat, these terms might be innocuous enough—since we can take the goals of the human designers as given—but what about an ecosystem?

To defuse possible misunderstanding, let me be clear that in this discussion I am drawing on the concepts and terminology of the cybernetics literature (which we will explore later in the chapter). The pioneers of cybernetics described self-regulating feedback mechanisms as teleological, a term suggesting that they have a goal or purpose. Now it’s true that later critics suggested an alternate term, teleonomic, (as mentioned with von Baer in Chapter 4) to characterize systems that merely exhibit apparent purpose. (For example, the standard view of modern biologists is that evolution is a teleonomic process, because although life forms demonstrate great internal order and self-regulation, they were presumably not consciously designed.) However, such distinctions are unnecessary for our purposes, because I am focusing on the intentional, teleological behavior of market participants—what Ludwig von Mises called “human action.” When it comes to the interactions of these intentional individuals in the… ([Location 5125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5125))

They cannot see the forest because they are trying to save each individual and immediate tree, and in so doing lose all depth of field and of focus on the generations of trees and the intertemporal search for their mix and magnitude of growth within the forest to come. All too often, particularly today, the focus is only on the shocks and fires with a desire to control and prevent. The desire is to interfere and, perhaps innocently, override the system’s natural governors that maintain balance; in so doing, things are made so much worse. We have thus succumbed to a blind faith in bureaucratic authority over natural processes. And yet, we do well to heed the words of Austrian economist and Mises protégé Friedrich Hayek who observed, “Before we can even ask how things might go wrong, we must first explain how they could ever go right.”1 Homeostasis is the process of how things “go right.” Within the roundabout of capital accumulation in a progressing economy (the figurative directional “going right” that is, indeed, how things “go right” in a healthy manner) homeostasis recalls shi—the propensity of all systems to restore balance through self-righting movements that in a natural world are no more disruptive than ripples on a pond.

- the cybernetic control and communication within the system to return the forest to homeostatic balance. As Murray Rothbard would say, the fire “is the ‘recovery’ process,” and, “far from being an evil scourge, is the necessary and beneficial return” of the forest to “optimum efficiency.”2 Forest fire turns especially deadly, however, when smaller blazes are suppressed, creating the illusion of fire protection. Admittedly, fire is a complex subject in forestry; on one hand, it would seem to make intuitive sense that forest preservation would mean limiting, controlling, or outright prevention of fires that kill trees. At the risk of oversimplification, however, such thinking has proved to be a li strategy focused on the direct means of today’s trees and keeping the forest status quo at all costs. The roundabout shi strategy is the willingness to pursue—or, more specifically in this case, allow—an intermediate objective of naturally occurring fires that do destroy trees (and some healthy specimens right along with the unhealthy ones) now, in order for a succession of forest growth to emerge intertemporally. Between conifers and angiosperms in particular, the ecosystem must always discover the right balance, which changes and adapts to climate and other environmental shifts. Fire is a natural dynamic force of change like any other predator whose presence is crucial to maintaining the health of other species (just as rabbits ([Location 5188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5188))

- would overrun and destroy the meadow and ultimately starve themselves were it not for the foxes that hunt them). When a population within an ecosystem exceeds the amount of resources present (too many rabbits in the meadow) it must be controlled by predator-consumers (the foxes, which do not have to try very hard to capture their next meal). And when the system reaches balance (just the right number of rabbits), the predator-consumers are also managed; they go hungry or move elsewhere. In the case of the overgrown forest, control most often comes from the most ravenous and indiscriminant of all herbivorous predators—fire, thus becoming the consumer that most often accomplishes the control function.3 Smaller, low-intensity fires manage the forest with great expediency, reducing density by clearing underbrush—including the stunted and spindly conifers that cannot compete with larger angiosperms—while leaving the canopy growth untouched. Paradoxical, yes, but forestry practices of old that have regained respect of late underscore the importance of letting small fires burn in order to manage the forest, and to prevent the… ([Location 5201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5201))

- evil more savagely felt than in Yellowstone National Park in 1988, when nearly 800,000 acres—well over one-third of the park—burned and/or suffered fire damage. It was a catastrophe of unprecedented proportion in the history of the National Park Service, and its root cause was fire suppression. The spread of fire-suppression mentality can be linked to the establishment of forest management in the United States, such that by the early 1900s forests became viewed as resources that needed to be protected—in other words, burning was no longer allowed. The danger in this approach became tragically apparent in Yellowstone, which was recognized by the late 1980s as being overdue for fire; yet smaller blazes were not allowed to burn because of what were perceived to be risks that were too high given the dry conditions. And so smaller fires were put out, but in the end could not be controlled and converged into the largest conflagration in the history of Yellowstone. Not only did the fire wipe out more than 30 times the acreage of any previously recorded fire, it also destroyed summer and winter grazing grounds for elk and bison herds, further altering the ecosystem. Because of fire suppression, the trees had no opportunity or reason to ever replace each other, and the forest thus grew feeble and prone to destruction.

The federal government has another “fire suppression policy” that started, coincidentally, just a few years before the Yellowstone blaze, with the 1984 Continental Illinois “too big to fail” bank bailout. This was followed by Alan Greenspan’s pronouncement immediately after the 1987 stock market crash that the Federal Reserve stood by with liquidity to support the economy and the financial system. In its actions in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve telegraphed to the world that it would no longer tolerate fires of any size—which heralded the birth of the “Greenspan put.”5 ([Location 5236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5236))

- Here, we encounter the profound paradox that government interventions systematically achieve the very opposite of their intended goals. So governments, unlike entrepreneurs, try as they might and despite perhaps good intentions (I’ll give the Paul Krugmans of the world the benefit of the doubt), simply cannot achieve their intended outcomes by interfering with the operation of the system. (They cannot act teleologically, as it were.) Governments and central banks undermine the natural homeostatic process by short-circuiting the governors and adaptive teleological processes in the system. Suppression of the market’s natural homeostatic tendencies—such as proclaiming things to be “too big to fail” or by cutting interest rates when the stock market takes a dive—only make things worse by artificially propping up assets that should be allowed to fail, and free up resources for another, perhaps more productive attempt. (A perfect example is the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008, or TARP, a completely unnecessary action by the U.S. government to buy equity stakes in and underwater assets from financial institutions as a response to the crisis that, like a wildfire, was trying to correct the artificial distortions in the system; rather than precluding a catastrophic event, TARP precluded rational market adjustments.)

- financial crisis of 2008—and all the big blazes yet to be—do not need to occur. Without the distortion of intervention, the system can govern itself. In the Austrian view, healthy growth of an economy occurs through heterogeneous capital structures that are allowed to morph and adapt through the intertemporal coordination of production in sync with consumer time preference. Within the process, entrepreneurs rely upon price signals to guide their decision making in order that resources might be deployed in the most appropriate ways.7 Respecting the process allows homeostasis to be pursued through a connection that detects, communicates, and responds to the available resources in the system; to better understand this connection, we explore a branch of the interdisciplinary control systems theory of engineering, known as cybernetics.

- Norbert Wiener (coincidentally, his last name means Viennese, although he was born in Missouri) was a mathematician and originator of the field of cybernetics, who saw homeostasis as a process in which “some sort of feedback is not only exemplified in physiological phenomena but is absolutely essential for the continuation” of that system.8 Feedback is crucial, and must be continuously given by and within the system in order to make the necessary, typically small corrections to keep on course. Sometimes that correction happens quite literally, as in the example given by Wiener of the car being driven on an icy road. The driver makes a series of small movements with the wheel, which are not enough to induce a major skid, but provide feedback “to our kinesthetic sense whether the car is in danger of skidding, and we regulate our method of steering accordingly.”9 The concept of “control by information feedback” makes intuitive sense; in order to operate in an environment, one must have input from it and thus make continuous adjustments to compensate for certain conditions or changes in conditions. Each movement is a return to balance in the moment, never expected to be permanent, but to last until the next shift or ([Location 5297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5297))

- turn of the wheel is required. We might also think of balance sought in the homeostatic process in terms of the “basin of attraction,” a scientific concept best illustrated by the traditional shi image of the boulder that is pushed up the steep grade of a hill, only to fall back down to the bottom of the valley. Similarly, when a system is perturbed, forces push it back to the balance of the basin. This is precisely what happens on an infinitesimal scale as a natural market is perturbed by changing time preferences and innovations. Drawing an example from nature and his own observations of it, Wiener compared the back-and-forth wrestling between counterbalancing forces in a system to a fight between the mongoose and cobra (which calls to mind the battle of the magpie and the serpent that legendarily inspired the creation of taijiquan—though now the tables have tragically turned on the snake). Although there is no evidence that the mongoose is faster or more accurate in its motions, it almost always delivers a lethal bite to the cobra. The mongoose has his teleological, multistage strategy to thank (basically that of the squash or hockey player from Chapter 5). He begins with a feint, provoking the snake to strike, which the animal manages to dodge and then follow up with another feint, a “rhythmical pattern of activity” that develops progressively. The mongoose’s moves come earlier and earlier, until finally coinciding when the snake is extended and the ([Location 5308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5308))

- Within the cybernetic feedback loop, the detection of “entropy” (the amount of disorganization that exists) forces the system to maintain its structure, in order to avoid a breakdown from disorder. Thus, in a natural economy, rising interest rates are a brake on roundaboutness (and, bizarrely, as per the “capital consumption” discussed in Chapter 7, so too are artificially lowered rates); when rates are higher, it becomes more costly to accumulate a deeper and longer capital structure. If interest rates reflect our true time preferences and the resulting activity in the economy, this isn’t a problem. The correct or “natural” market interest rates will, by definition, adjust to allow entrepreneurs to “get through the wait” of longer production only when savers really are extending their durations (as savers will offer their savings at marginally lower rates for longer periods). But when this communication is broken, and rates are pushed down (independently of economic reality) in parallel shifts (and even worse in steepening shifts), one of the consequences of lower rates is to make us exceedingly unsatisfied with waiting right now (as the lower rate is below what we intrinsically require for waiting—particularly in the immediate). Thus we are “trapped” into grabbing the immediate marshmallows, regardless of and ignoring relatively more abundant marshmallows off in the future. Thus the apparent paradox—owing to our myopic time inconsistency from Chapter 6—that even a parallel shift of the entire yield curve downward can give more of an artificial stimulus to existing assets with a quick turnaround (such as a quick momentum trade, or a quick dividend), even though normal accounting would make us think the long-term projects would see the biggest jump in demand. Disorder reigns. ([Location 5333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5333))

- The market movement in tulips, therefore, was not caused by mere waves of emotion that produced a mania—mistaking the cause for the effect; it was rather an increase in the supply of money that prompted a massive (though highly localized) asset inflation, right out of the Land of the Nibelungen. We thus we plant a stake in the ground of understanding of economics and the functioning of markets: that the former view of randomness invokes state inventions, whereas the natural teleological ebb and flow defers to the homeostatic process. To clarify my view, we can contrast it with that of the American economist Hyman Minsky, who tried to lay blame for the boom and bust cycle on leverage. Simply stated, he believed that as the market goes up for an extended period of time without any corrections, the total leverage in the financial sector gradually increases, making the system ever-more tenuous. Although Minsky’s narrative is acceptable as a description of certain features of the business cycle, he doesn’t really give an explanation for the phenomenon. In contrast, the Austrians give a much more satisfactory theory of how artificially low interest rates foster an unsustainable boom (characterized by overleveraged borrowers invested in operating capital that will be unproductive at natural interest rates) and the inevitable bust. This aspect of Minsky’s view—the inherent instability and unpredictability of the crash—is one of its virtues, in the eyes of his Keynesian admirers. Indeed, there are two major trends in Keynesian thought, both descended from different themes in John Maynard Keynes’s 1936 work. On the one hand, there was the straightforward, deterministic system of aggregate demand and involuntary unemployment—the stuff of textbooks. At the same time, Keynes’s prose contained passages describing the utter unpredictability of the market, in particular asset pricing. Here entered the famous “animal spirits,” and Keynes’s likening of the stock market to a casino and a game in which contestants had to vote on “general opinion,” not on what the underlying reality was. In this latter worldview, Minsky’s vague treatment of the boom and bust is proper, since there really aren’t demonstrable “causes” in the way many economists would like to believe (and as I show in Chapter 9).

- Minsky’s belief that the leveraged run-up is the underlying cause of crashes is similar to the notion of self-organized criticality in a dynamical system, the classic metaphor of which is the sand pile effect. Grain by grain the pile gets higher until it is of considerable height, and at some point will reach a critical state where just one more grain will cause a cascading collapse—an avalanche of sorts (the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back). This basic cellular automata model has similarly been applied to forest fire models and to stock market crashes—with exceedingly limited success; indeed, it has become fashionable to look at crashes as critical systemwide landslides. However, these and Minsky’s analyses miss the mark: The homeostatic market process must first be broken by intervention from outside the system in order for it to fail. Specifically, criticality is not an inherent epiphenomenon of the system, growing organically as a delicate cascading network from within. Rather, it grows from unhealthy sprouts doomed at their start from a temporary deception, a miscommunication and failure of control within the cybernetic machine. In the popular financial jargon, a “Minsky moment” now refers to a sudden collapse in asset values, following a leveraged run-up during a period of apparent prosperity. To repeat: This description is consistent with the Austrian theory of the business cycle, but it leaves major questions unanswered: Why should the market’s normal negative feedback mechanism suddenly fail? Sure, individual entrepreneurs can make mistakes, but what explains the systematic mistakes of the boom years—the “cluster of errors” as Rothbard calls them?20 The leading theoretical argument for the supposed efficacy of the various rounds of quantitative easing is the so-called “wealth effect,” meaning that consumers go out and spend more because they feel richer when their assets (stock portfolios, houses, etc.) rise in price relative to consumer prices. It would be difficult to come up with an economic policy more at odds with Austrian capital theory—printing up new money in order to convince people that they can consume more based on their immediate asset appreciation (and never mind what happens once the cost of capital inevitably returns to normal—and the economy and MS index return to stationarity). If the Austrians can dispense with the idea of “animal spirits” and “Minsky moments” as explanatory ([Location 5430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5430))

- devices, they can also jettison another Keynesian nostrum: the so-called “paradox of thrift” in which the individual households do the rational thing by attempting to save more in light of a financial setback, yet when aggregated over the whole economy the motive becomes self-defeating since one household’s spending is another household’s income. According to textbook Keynesian theory, the paradox of thrift shows the role for government deficit spending to escape a slump, when the homeostatic mechanism of the market has failed. Here again, a focus on Austrian capital theory—as opposed to Keynesian income flows—shows the problem. A recession isn’t simply some stroke of dumb luck, in which people have failed to spend enough; it is characterized by physical distortions in the structure of production.

- Now, at this juncture, the philosophical part of our journey comes to an end. Next, we move to the pragmatic application of what we have learned in Austrian Investing I and II, the subject of Chapters 9 and 10. Before we move on, we face our moment of truth, when we must stand up as true believers of this gospel of Austrian theory, which in its attempts to explain the entire boom/bust cycle gives us a coherent story that ties all the pieces together. As we move from theory to practice (the first eight chapters of this book to the last two), we will utilize what I have dubbed the MS index and the Faustmann ratio, as well as Siegfried, the roundabout entrepreneur—the embodiments of all the principles that have come before. When the MS index diverges from 1, unnaturally because returns on capital exceed the cost of capital, ([Location 5524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5524))

More generally, you needn’t chase the immediately seen over what should be foreseen. You can let those who listen to the siren song of li be dashed on the rocks of their own impatience. You can stay true to shi, the roundabout, in its various guises, and wait for the return to homeostasis that will prevail even in the midst of pervasive distortion. Indeed, you can become the hero of your own roundabout investing story, by avoiding the distortion and, thus, having all the more resources later for opportunistic investing. It is your path and your choice. If you choose well, it will become your dao of capital. ([Location 5531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5531))

The thought process here is what matters most; it is the real takeaway, a prescription for all investors, as it culminates the overarching theme of this book: the roundabout of The Dao of Capital as the circuitous means toward the ends of productive capital investment, despite our biology and a system rigged against it.

- The simple insight that the market is a natural homeostatic, self-correcting mechanism and that monetary distortion results only in a temporary disruption of that mechanism portends some results. From this, what do we expect to see—not require, but expect? Let’s take a step back and survey what we really know. Since the Misesian Stationarity index can reach a lofty level (meaning the economy can persistently deviate from stationarity) only because of monetary distortion, we should expect a very high MS index to act as a prelude to a price of title to existing capital (the stock market, the numerator in the MS index) that is unsustainably high; this follows our expectation that the replacement value of that capital (the denominator in the MS index) will be unresponsive, as further new investment is thwarted by the distortion. Savers and investors, dissatisfied with artificially low interest rates that don’t reflect their actual time preferences, placate themselves by eking out yield and otherwise chasing immediate returns (which are themselves given a boost from higher ([Location 5628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5628))

This is a very important realization, something of a death blow to the concept of systemic risk, and which will become the backbone of the Austrian Investing I rationale (and without which we would be left as mere victims of the distorted market and seemingly random shocks). The Austrians were right (before the time of this data): Just as we saw in Nibelungenland in Chapter 7, the undulations of the business cycle (as reflected in the stock market) do indeed simply follow a pattern ([Location 5728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=5728))

I’ll call this our Misesian investment strategy, in honor of the man whose approach was to avoid the systematic collapse of the 1930s. A version of this strategy has of course been identified by others before—and what investment strategy hasn’t? What matters here is the conceptual thinking—the identification of the edge or, in this case, the imbalance—behind the strategy. Here, we are playing the explicit role of our pedagogical conifer, anticipating and exploiting through circumvention the roiling wildfire and resulting nutrient-rich soil.

Just as Klipp’s Paradox of “love to lose money, hate to make money” led to incredible discipline (and some healthy returns) in the trading pit, so, too, does this Misesian approach in anyone’s portfolio. The objective of roundabout Austrian Investing is not to find a way to make money now, but to position ourselves for better investment opportunities later. Or, as we might state it, we’re being patient now so that we can be strategically impatient later. Whatever you decide to do as an investor, keep in mind the overarching aim of this book; it is about a way of thinking, of understanding the roundabout and the considerable strategic advantages to be gained along the patient, circuitous path. If you take away nothing else from this chapter (or even from this book) know that there is usually imminent danger in the direct approach, in ignoring the means for the ends, particularly in the market when distortion is running high. Thanks to the Misesian Stationarity index, there is a way to gauge that danger so that, no matter what your investment decisions are, you are better informed about those dangers.

The first and second century CE Roman poet Juvenal is credited with coining the term black swan in reference to a “decent” wife—“a rare bird, as strange to the earth as a black swan.”3 (Any spousal ire over that comment should be directed at Juvenal, not at this author.) “Black swan” as the code words for an unexpected event (the discovery that not all swans were white as once believed) was promulgated in the early twentieth century by Viennese-born philosopher Karl Popper, who taught at the London School of Economics. (Popper and rival Ludwig Wittgenstein, who famously argued over sundry philosophical problems, were major forces in the intellectual prowess of early twentieth-century Vienna.) When they occur, stock market crashes seem so irrational to most, so haphazard and unforeseeable, so black swan. But are they irrational? Are they even unforeseeable? Or do they simply stem from the distorting effects of credit expansions as the Austrians suggest?

Nonetheless, this part of the discussion is meant to serve as a conservative and honest case study, the purpose of which is (beyond further measuring tails) to demonstrate Austrian tools and the application of the roundabout approach through the conditional historical outperformance generated by adding extremely out-of-the-money puts to the S&P Composite Index.

- Roundabout investing (a very apt synonym for Austrian Investing) is all about the temporal structure of productive capital. As we recall from the slow-growing (at first) conifers and Henry Ford’s capital structure extending from raw materials to automobiles, production by its very nature takes much time. Roundabout production, therefore, cannot focus myopically on the immediate profit; rather, it invests teleologically, building the indirect means—the positional advantage—toward the ends of profits that will not materialize in the near term. In fact, as we will see, it is all the better for us that such evidence is hidden from the rest of the investing public who focus on the seen, and impatiently gobble today’s marshmallows. Their impatience makes them blind to future potential, tomorrow’s profits that are yet unseen but can, if we know where and how to look, be foreseen. Indeed, Austrian Investing II, like Austrian Investing I, is all about the straightforward plan of attack comprised in this book: being patient now in order to be strategically impatient later.

- Therefore, we know that the mark of a true Siegfried is a high return on invested capital (ROIC)—best calculated by dividing a company’s EBIT (operating earnings before interest and tax expenses are deducted) by its invested capital (the operating capital required to generate that EBIT). Wisely, Siegfried continually reinvests his profits into his business—becoming increasingly more roundabout—instead of pocketing the profits by paying out high dividends to himself (or just accumulating cash). He is driven to act by what he sees as false prices on his factors of production—his capital and other costs are just too low relative to the prices at which he can subsequently sell his finished products. (To put it simply, his enterprise can transform dollars spent on inputs into dollars earned from customers at a much higher rate than he could earn by lending the money out.) A true entrepreneur, Siegfried finds those false prices to be, in Mises’s words, “intolerable”; when he sees them, he has to act, which ineluctably makes him become increasingly roundabout (as he is continually building new roundabout capital from square one) and, therefore, even more efficient in the future. While driven by his ends—profitability—he takes aim on his means—the tools of higher order capital goods. ([Location 6104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=6104))

- Most important of all—what truly makes Siegfried a Siegfried—is that he is not all that sensitive to interest rates; his profitability is not terribly contingent upon marginal movements in everyone’s time preferences or the central bank’s imposition of artificial interest rates. Of course, Siegfried is not perfect. When there is a big credit collapse and a liquidation of assets, following a period of monetary distortion, Siegfried will ([Location 6116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=6116))

- see a decline in his ROIC (even he lost a little in 2008). But his capital likely remains profitable and productive, well above his cost of capital, even if the central bank should suddenly and sharply raise interest rates in the thick of a boom. After such a surprise move by the central bank to “take away the punch bowl,” the Günthers of the world will be crushed, as their bloated enterprises were utterly dependent on the artificially cheap credit of the boom. They will be forced to scale back operations, or fold altogether. In contrast, Siegfried will be okay, as his business model remains fundamentally sound. In the mass liquidation of the Günthers, the crashing prices of various business inputs may cause Siegfried to regret some of his purchases made at the height of the boom, but that will be a luxurious position compared to many of his peers. Siegfried is akin to the conifer, as he willingly turns his back on the fray of fast growth (that often exists only because of the artificial fertilizer of distortion), and thus is overlooked by those who have no way to appreciate what he is constructing. (They are mesmerized by the fast, but likely unsustainable, growth of the… ([Location 6119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=6119))

- tools of later efficiencies). Yet to perseverance and tenacity and an intertemporal view come the payoffs, rewarding those who are not obsessed with today and, instead, have a depth of field perspective. Yes, Siegfried will grow more slowly now (so slowly that he may not appear to be growing his profits at all) as he amasses his roundabout capital structure, but when the time is ripe, he will emerge with the greatest advantages (and when the field of competition is cleared by the wildfire that destroys unhealthy, malinvested growth, he is still standing, even ready to advantageously invest more). His slow but deliberate roundabout growth has given him the structure he needs to accelerate later on, to kick into high gear and outperform the rest—the tortoise-that-morphs-into-a-hare and then surpasses the mere hare. To move from our fable to an operational strategy for the real (non-Wagnerian) world, note that Siegfried qualifies as our investment ideal because of the first (of two) criterion: high ROIC, which prompts him to keep reinvesting profits into his capital structure to become even more efficient and eventually grow.

- greater increases in their invested capital compared to non-high ROIC firms. Academic Austrians tend to view above-average returns—what they would call pure profit as opposed to mere interest earnings—as due to superior entrepreneurial vision, while capital roundaboutness is handled in a separate, equilibrium analysis of interest rates. Yet I claim that in the actual market, we should expect these two Austrian concepts to overlap substantially. Consider: The entrepreneur who foresees a profit opportunity in the distant future, and who patiently reinvests earnings into his business year after year in anticipation, has a much greater opportunity for (eventually) posting an enormous ROIC than entrepreneurs who are engaged in short-term projects. (The fewer the rings spanned on Böhm-Bawerk’s Jahresringe, the more commoditized the business.) Thus, while there may be no direct cause-and-effect relationship between capital roundaboutness and above-average returns, once we think through the actual forces governing them, we come to expect an observed, ex post correlation between the two.

- as that other ideal Austrian entrepreneur, Henry Ford, did when he doggedly amassed factors of production to build his own self-contained, ever-deeper, and more productive capital structure. We, too, could mimic Siegfried and bring together our own factors of production in such a way that allows us to be similarly roundabout in our production as we discover and exploit what, to us, are false prices. The high ROIC of our Siegfried means that (relative to his competitors) he is very good at taking investment dollars and transforming them into earnings; the ratio is much better than the going price of capital. This, of course, requires something special, a great insight, and an unwavering belief in what is perhaps merely a promising hunch—the Verstehen of Chapter 7. (One might think of this as the burden of the angel investor.) While important and sometimes even lucrative, this is beyond the scope of this book. Yet as Austrian investors, there is another option open to us: to identify a metaphorical Siegfried and own a piece of him—that is, we can use our funds to buy title to some of his existing operation.

- are just as keen as we are, and that the price of stock in a Siegfried would already reflect the tremendous economic advantage indicated by his high ROIC (which is of course public knowledge). Yet for whatever reasons—and I will give my own thoughts and evidence shortly—this is not always the case. In other words, in the real financial markets we often encounter high ROIC Siegfried firms where these superior efficiencies at turning invested and reinvested capital into future earnings are apparently not priced in. Back in Chapter 5, in our discussion of forestry development I explained a concept that we can now fully deploy: In addition to casting our net for firms with a high ROIC, we are also looking for firms with a low Faustmann ratio, meaning a low market capitalization (of common equity) over net worth (or invested capital plus cash minus debt and preferred equity) ratio. In Chapter 5, I explained that this Faustmann ratio is driven by the degree to which the ROIC exceeds the cost of that capital, so clearly one might expect high Faustmann ratios (where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—or the sum of the factors of production) to accompany high ROICs. (When we make this more realistic and allow for the reinvestment of profits into more land—and thus eventual growth in those profits—this robust relationship remains.) Stating it in Nibelungen terms, we want to acquire ever-more roundabout Siegfrieds ([Location 6163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00D7P2K1W&location=6163))

- while they are priced like breakeven Johanns, or even struggling Günthers. The ultimate end for the Austrian investor is the same as for any other investor: profit. Yet the means are entirely different; here, they are the central focus. The Austrian investor doesn’t lunge in li fashion immediately for the goal; he doesn’t set out directly to find firms with immediately rising profitability, or firms to hold while others also pile in immediately, or firms with immediate dividend yields, or even underpriced firms per se. Rather, his first task is to find highly roundabout, productive firms—ones with high ROIC—that possess the circuitous means of economic profit. Then, to these Siegfrieds he applies a second filter, or screen, and looks for firms with a low Faustmann ratio. This two-pronged approach would strike most investors as quixotic, simplistic, and even contradictory. By this point in the book, though, the reader should understand that such a commonplace attitude is precisely what will deliver remarkable rewards to the roundabout Austrian investor.

- There is much common ground between value investing and its Austrian predecessor. Certainly value investing is as close as we come to it in practice today, having become a popular intuitive approach (though I would argue that a small percentage of the value practitioners truly share the original focus laid out by Graham in his authoritative texts Security Analysis in 1934 and The Intelligent Investor in 1949—the same publication year as Mises’s English-language version of Human Action). One might say that Graham gave the practice of investing a rigor, logic, and entrepreneurial orientation not commonly seen before, and in that he was very Austrian (as Graham famously noted, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike”6).

- Interestingly, the man who is most closely associated with value investing today, Graham’s one-time pupil and perhaps one of the most successful investors in history—Warren Buffett himself—once had a close brush with the Austrian School via his father, Howard Buffett. In a letter from 1962, Howard wrote to Austrian economist Murray Rothbard seeking a copy of his book The Panic of 1819 for his son Warren “who is a particularly avid reader of books about panics and similar phenomenon.”8 It is apparent that, despite the son’s later vocal criticisms of much of what could be considered Austrian orthodoxy, his basic investing actions are more closely aligned with it than he would ever admit. (Most have forgotten how unpopular—and even ridiculed—Warren’s yielding, zouhua, and very Misesian cash position was in the late 1990s.) Over the years, value has sprouted many variations on the Austrian/Grahamian theme. In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French formalized a value factor, which was basically Graham’s P/B measure.9 Another approach, called “The Magic Formula” by Joel Greenblatt, combines our traditional ROIC screen with a simple EBIT relative to enterprise value screen.10 And there is a similar screen known as “Quality,” whereby high gross profits-to-assets (which avoids penalizing high capital investment) and low P/B ratios are selected.11 These cover the variation gamut (though there are certainly countless subvariations on these, including their intersection, such as perhaps the approach of Buffett), and in fact triangulate or cross-verify the Austrian Investing II approach. All introduce noise by assuming additional degrees of freedom: too many to name (in the case of Graham’s intricate screens), heterogeneous capital productivity (in the case of Fama-French’s sole P/B parameter), heterogeneous EBIT growth rates (in the case of Greenblatt’s growth-sensitive P/E parameters), and heterogeneous capital depreciation and thus productivity (in the case of Quality’s depreciation-free gross profit parameter). But as much as they might approximate this approach, they fail to necessarily isolate what matters: roundabout capital and its price. So we should expect these variations to capture some of the Siegfried portfolios, some of their edge, but with some added noise, evident in lower returns resulting from lower information content in the screening methods used, as well as inconsistencies across a range of portfolio construction methods employed.
