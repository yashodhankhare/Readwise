- Business, like life, is all about how you make people feel. It’s that simple, and it’s that hard. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=70))

- I’VE LEARNED MORE OF what I know about life from people than from books, and I’ve learned much of what I know about people from the food they eat. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=76))

- My writing improved because my mother insisted that I keep a diary of our trip. At the time, I hated doing this. But the diary turned out to be one of the greatest gifts she ever gave me. I wasn’t writing about the museums and churches we’d seen. Instead I chose to write about food. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=103))

- Hospitality is the foundation of my business philosophy. Virtually nothing else is as important as how one is made to feel in any business transaction. Hospitality exists when you believe the other ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=169))

- person is on your side. The converse is just as true. Hospitality is present when something happens for you. It is absent when something happens to you. Those two simple prepositions—for and to—express it all. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=171))

- That trip sensitized me to the idea that solo diners could be an important part of our business and should be welcomed accordingly. When I thought about how much time and care I put into choosing where to take myself to dinner, and how often I recommended those places that treated me well (and conversely, how strongly I warned everyone off the inhospitable ones), I knew that treating solo diners as royalty was both the right thing to do and smart business.

- There’s aesthetic value in doing things the right way. But I respond best when the person doing those things realizes that the purpose of all this beauty at the table is to create pleasure for me. To go through the motions in a perfunctory or self-absorbed manner, no matter how expertly rendered, diminishes the beauty. It’s about soul—and service without soul, no matter how elegant, is quickly forgotten by the guest. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1030))

- Understanding the distinction between service and hospitality has been at the foundation of our success. Service is the technical delivery of a product. Hospitality is how the delivery of that product makes its recipient feel. Service is a monologue—we decide how we want to do things and set our own standards for service. Hospitality, on the other hand, is a dialogue. To be on a guest’s side requires listening to that person with every sense, and following up with a thoughtful, gracious, appropriate response. It takes both great service and great hospitality to rise to the top. When you are seated at the precise time of your reservation at the exact table and with the waiter you requested, that is a reflection of good service. When the right food is delivered to the right person at the right table at the right temperature at the right time—that’s service. When you see a member of the waitstaff decanting a bottle of wine with care and grace, that’s service. When your empty plate is cleared from the table in a graceful manner, that too is service. When, in answer to your question, the waiter can explain the nuances of the wines on our list, that’s service. But hospitality, which ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1034))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- most distinguishes our restaurants—and ultimately any business—is the sum of all the thoughtful, caring, gracious things our staff does to make you feel we are on your side when you are dining with us. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1044))

- I had already learned that the trick to delivering superior hospitality was to hire geniune, happy, optimistic people. The Ritz-Carlton hotels are deservedly famous for their focus on service; they don’t call it hospitality. But as a guest there, I have occasionally sensed a rote quality in the process, when every employee responds with exactly the same phrase, “My pleasure,” to anything guests ask or say. Hearing “My pleasure” over and over again can get rather creepy after a while. It’s like hearing a flight attendant chirp “Bye now!” and “Bye-bye!” 200 times as passengers disembark from an airplane. Hospitality cannot flow from a monologue. I instruct my staff members to figure out whatever it takes to make the guests feel and understand that we are in their corner. I don’t tell the staff precisely what to do or say in every scenario, though I do have some pet peeves that I don’t ever want to hear in our dining rooms. I cringe when a waiter asks, “How is everything?” That’s an empty question that will get an empty response. Also, I can’t stand the use of we to mean you, as in, “How are we doing so far?” I abhor the question, “Are you still working on the lamb?” If the guest has been working on the lamb, ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1055))

- it probably wasn’t very tender or very good in the first place. And if a guest says “Thank you” for something, the waiter should not answer, “No problem.” Since when is it necessary to deny that delivering excellent service is a “problem”? A genuine “You’re welcome” is always the appropriate response. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1065))

- I HAVE BEEN FLY-FISHING ONLY once in my life. It was in Woody Creek, Colorado, outside Aspen, and I went with a young guide who had come highly recommended by the original chef at Eleven Madison Park, Kerry Heffernan (no relation to my wife, Audrey), an expert fly-fisherman. My guide, displaying wisdom that belied his age, called me over as he waded into a clear, rushing stream, and picked up a small rock. He turned it over and smiled. From a distance, I noticed nothing unusual on its slick underside. I had no idea what he was looking for, or at. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1220))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- “Here, come look,” he said. He pointed out dozens of tiny aquatic insects hatching on the rock. This told him precisely which fly to tie because, as he explained, the trout would only bite on an artificial fly that resembled what was actually hatching. The guide then put the stone back exactly where he had found it. I was intrigued. There was a world of information under that rock, if only one knew or cared enough to look for it. I took a valuable business lesson back home to New York. There’s always a story behind a story if you look for it; and you can augment your success at “hooking” customers by taking the care, time, and interest to look. On my rounds in our dining rooms, I’m constantly turning over rocks, hunting for those details—a guest’s impatient look or a glance at a watch, an untouched dish, a curious gaze at our artwork. These details could indicate that someone is bored, impatient, in need of affection, puzzled, interested, or just daydreaming. But each gesture is a potential opportunity for me to visit the table and provide some hospitality. It’s human nature for people to take precisely as much interest in you as they believe you’re taking in them. There is no stronger way to build relationships than taking a genuine interest in other human beings and allowing them to share their stories. When we take an ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1225))

- active interest in the guests at our restaurants, we create a sense of community and a feeling of “shared ownership.” Shared ownership develops when guests talk about a restaurant as if it’s theirs. They can’t wait to share it with friends, and what they’re really sharing, beyond the culinary experience, is the experience of feeling important and loved. That sense of affiliation builds trust and a sense of being accepted and appreciated, invariably leading to repeat business, a necessity for any company’s long-term survival. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1235))

- And it all starts by turning over the rocks. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1241))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The information is always there if it matters enough to look for it. Making my rounds in the dining rooms involves, more than anything else, my ability to see, hear, and sense what’s going on so that I can connect intelligently with our staff and guests and make things happen. I don’t have a standard approach for every table, but I often start with a gut sense that a patron is ready for a visit. That’s what springs me into action. I might just walk over to a table and say, “Thanks for being here.” That puts the ball in the other court. The encounter either does or doesn’t advance from there. But once the rock is turned over and a dialogue begins, I start to learn something, and I always act on what I learn. (And sometimes I learn that the person just wants to be left alone to eat dinner.) ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1248))

- The best way to do this is to first gather as much information as I can about our guests. I call this collecting dots. In fact, I urge our managers to ABCD—always be collecting dots. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1276))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Dots are information. The more information you collect, the more frequently you can make meaningful connections that can make other people feel good and give you an edge in business. Using whatever information I’ve collected to gather guests together in a spirit of shared experience is what I call connecting the dots. If I don’t turn over the rocks, I won’t see the dots. If I don’t collect the dots, I can’t connect the dots. If I don’t know that someone works, say, for a magazine whose managing editor I happen to know, I’ve lost a chance to make a meaningful connection that could enhance our relationship with the guest and the guest’s relationship with us. The information is there. You just have to choose to look. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1278))

- IT HAD OCCURRED TO me in Woody Creek that until my fishing guide turned over that rock, I’d have been content to stand at the edge of the running stream enjoying the dreamy valley and mountains. But in business, turning over the rocks and reading the water, as a fly-fisherman might do, gives you crucial information so that you can take an even deeper interest in your customers, and encourages them to do the same with you.

- One of the oldest sayings in business is “The customer is always right.” I think that’s become a bit outdated. I want to go on the offensive to create opportunities for our customers to feel that they are being heard even when they’re not right. To do so, I always actively encourage them—when I’m on my rounds, in our comment cards, and in letters or e-mail to us—to let us know if they feel something’s not right. When they do, I thank them.

- A friend once told me a story about an athletic display by Governor Jeb Bush of Florida. My friend, who is a very successful businessman—and, I should note, a Democrat—opened an office in Florida with about forty employees. On the day the company was incorporated, out of the blue, he received a personal phone call from Governor Bush (whom he had never met) thanking him for doing business in Florida. “Here’s a special number,” the governor said, “that I want you to use if you ever need any roads moved or bridges built for your company.” My friend remains a Democrat, but he left that transaction very impressed with Governor Bush. Whatever your politics, that’s an inspirational business story. It’s the kind of unexpected gesture that sends a clear message to the governor’s constituents: I’m not taking one vote for granted. In my business, which is so dependent on repeat customers, I never take a vote for granted either. I’m campaigning for a core constituency of regulars. I don’t know too many businesses that can survive without one. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1348))

- My goal is to earn regular, repeat patronage from a large number of people—40 percent of our lunch business and 25 percent of our dinner business—who will dine at our restaurants six to twelve times a year. Unlike a Broadway show, which most people will see just once no matter how much they’ve enjoyed it, a solid restaurant experience should make you want to return for more. There are always more dishes to sample, more waiters by whom to be served, and more tables from which to view the ever-changing scene. At its best, a restaurant should not let guests leave without feeling as though they’ve been satisfyingly hugged. If you can do that, regardless of what product you are offering, you’ve built a solid foundation for your business. Those satisfied customers become not just your regulars but also your apostles. They’ll proceed to sell your product for you by telling the world how much they like it. Automobile companies and watchmakers have long understood that people buy their products not just because of how the product itself performs, but to ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1384))

- tell a story about themselves. Almost any watch tells time; every car can get you from point A to point B; and every restaurant can feed you. Just as my choice of a watch to wear and a car to drive (and be seen driving) says something about me, so too does my choice of where I dine frequently. We want as many of our guests as possible to be proud to identify themselves with our restaurants. Our job is to give people a story worth telling.

- I realize that I don’t have to do this kind of thing, but there is simply no point for me—or anyone on my staff—to work hard every day for the purpose of offering guests an average experience. I want to hear: “We love your restaurant, we adore the food, but your people are what we treasure most about being here.” That’s the reaction that makes me most proud and tells me we’re succeeding on all levels. I encourage each manager to take ten minutes a day to make three gestures that exceed expectations and take a special interest in our guests. That translates into 1,000 such gestures every year, multiplied by over 100 outstanding managers throughout our restaurants. For any business owner, that can add up to a lot of repeat business.

- Now, thanks to the vast record-keeping capacity of the computer, I can measure the degree to which guests are regulars. I can know what their favorite table is, or if they have a favorite (or least favorite) server. I can know when a guest’s birthday or anniversary is. I can know if guests are regulars at our other restaurants—in which case I’m even more pleased to see them coming in to try another one of our restaurants for the first time. All this adds up to a gold mine of information, which allows us to connect all sorts of dots. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1455))

- In hospitality, one size fits one! When I spent my summer as a tour guide working for my dad in Italy, I reported to his manager in Rome, Giorgio Smaldone, a proud, chain-smoking native of Salerno who taught me a lot about the essence of hospitality. Giorgio’s favorite expression about how to treat tour group members, delivered in his special form of English, was: “There is to make them feel important. Always start with the one who most need feel important!” Many years ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1469))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- later, a wonderful server who had been at Union Square Cafe for more than a decade told me that when she had previously worked for Mary Kay Cosmetics, Mary Kay would teach the sales people that everyone goes through life with an invisible sign hanging around his or her neck reading, “make me feel important.” Giorgio and Mary Kay had it right. The most successful people in any business that depends on human relationships are the ones who know about that invisible sign and have the vision to see how brightly it is flashing. And the true champions know best how to embrace the human being wearing the sign.   DESPITE HIGH-TECH ENHANCEMENTS, RESTAURANTS will always remain a hands-on, high-touch, people-oriented business. Nothing will ever replace shaking people’s hands, smiling, and looking them in the eye as a genuine means of welcoming them. And that is why hospitality—unlike widgets—is not something you can stamp out on an assembly line. But its powerful impact can be taught, and teaching it with hundreds of colleagues is the best way I’ve found to extend my reach. One reality of our business growth is that I cannot be everywhere at all times. I compensate for the fact that there’s only one of me by studying the maps and responding. I’ll often run into somebody on the street ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1473))

- and be able to say, “I understand you were at Tabla last night. How was your dinner?” People immediately feel good and are surprised that I would know this. But why wouldn’t I? If I want our guests to take an interest in us, I’d better take an equal interest in them. I also use this information to bring together people from similar professions, or to connect people who I know share some common ground—whether it’s from the art world, financial services, politics, the culinary business, book publishing, journalism, advertising, or design. I call this planting like seeds in like gardens in order to extend our community. I’ll purposely make certain that these people are seated near, but not next to, one another. Or I may simply introduce them, hoping that something positive, beyond a good meal, may come out of the “chance encounter.” A publisher who sees another publisher dining at Union Square Cafe will logically assume: “This is where publishers come for lunch.” A food journalist who sees a well-known chef dining two tables away may conclude: “This place must be good if he eats here.” I call this form of dot-connecting “benevolent manipulation.” Everyone wins, including us. Through the years I’ve had plenty of help from our loyal friends in building communities. Roger W. Straus Jr.—the brilliant book publisher and world-class bon vivant who cofounded Farrar, Straus and Giroux and led that company for nearly six decades until his death at age eighty-seven in May 2004—became one of our best and most devoted patrons soon after Union Square Cafe opened. By our estimate, Roger ate some 3,000 lunches there—his favorite dishes were oysters on the half shell, black bean soup, smoked steak sandwich, and vitello tonnato—and almost all of those lunches took place at table 38, where he held court an average of three days a week for nearly two decades. Roger was proud of the people with whom he dined—erudite editors, Nobel Prize winners, best-selling authors—and it was always important to him to introduce them to his other friends. Sometimes we’d be chatting at his table and he’d lean… ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1483))

- Google (or any online search engine, for that matter) is one of the best dot-collecting tools ever invented. I might see a name on the reservation list I think I recognize. I can then check Google to find out who the person is. It’s a remarkable tool for hospitality and for drawing even more detailed maps. Google proved to be amazingly useful during the Republican National Convention of 2004. We served a late-night dinner party at Eleven Madison Park for about a dozen media people who included NBC’s Tom Brokaw, the New York Times’s R.W.

- Purdum’s wife, Dee Dee Myers, Bill Clinton’s former press secretary. Following a marathon evening at the convention, they all finally sat down to a five-course dinner at eleven-forty-five. Before I left at one o’clock in the morning, I said, “If you folks stay long enough, we’ll have to serve you scrambled eggs for dessert.” And Johnny Apple, who’s from Akron, Ohio, said, “I can tell you’re a Midwest boy, probably attended a bunch of coming-out parties.” I smiled. “In fact,” I said, “it was by going to debutante parties as a nineteen-year-old in St. Louis that I first learned about eating scrambled eggs at two in the morning.” “But I bet you’ve never had ‘eggs daffodil,’” he said. “That’s the real thing.” He had me there. As I was leaving for the night, I said to my team, “You guys need to go online and figure out what ‘eggs daffodil’ are, and I want you to make sure to put a bowl of them on the table by two o’clock in the morning.” After all, if you believe that word of mouth makes the world go around, here were eleven people who had fairly big, powerful mouths. Googling “eggs daffodil” revealed just a vague description, but it was enough to inspire Eleven Madison Park’s chef, Kerry Heffernan, who improvised what he imagined eggs daffodil to be, creating an inspired recipe ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1514))

- that included zucchini blossoms and cheese. They were brought out at two o’clock and served in a copper pot to Johnny Apple, right around dessert time, as the journalists were making some toasts. (Brokaw and Apple would soon be retiring and were each covering their last political convention.) The next day Kerry told me the eggs daffodil “blew them away.” Kerry loved the recipe—he had cooked the eggs and cream slowly, put them in a blender with some beurre fondue, and then gently heated them up again, stirring in some zucchini blossoms—and said he had decided to put it on our brunch menu. The ABCD strategy—always be collecting dots—had once again strengthened a sense of community and had challenged our staff to express more caring and creativity than our guests could have expected. It also provided an opportunity to add more value by listening, using our imagination, and executing. We had served a wonderful dinner as it was. But when Johnny Apple made that remark about “eggs daffodil,” it was as if he had presented… ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=1525))

In a meeting of the entire staff of Gramercy Tavern, and with full agreement and support from Tom, I began to outline what I considered nonnegotiable about how we did business. Nothing would ever matter more to me than how we expressed hospitality to one another. (Who ever wrote the rule that the customer is always first?)

A business that understands how powerful it is to create wealth for the community stands a much higher chance of creating wealth for its own investors.

Sometimes—very, very occasionally—I’m presented with an idea or invitation, and I know there’s a 99.9 percent probability I’m not interested in it. Yet my intuition tells me that it’s worth investigating, just to see what’s on the other side. I’ll allow myself to be open to new ideas, particularly when they’re presented by good people I know and trust. And when I hear those ideas from people I know and trust, I pay even stronger attention to my own instinct and intuition.

So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it…and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied…and it is all one.” ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2033))

Theoretically, if the ideal candidate were to score 100 on a suitability test (something we have never administered), his or her potential for technical excellence would count for 49 percent, and innate emotional skills for hospitality would count for 51 percent. I first learned this concept of “51 percent” from the dynamic restaurateur Rich Melman of Chicago, when I visited him in the late 1980s. Rich was an effervescent teacher and a willing mentor, and I was eager and honored to learn from him. The concept made perfect sense to me, and now it is a cornerstone of my business. Our staff performance reviews weigh both technical job performance (49 percent) and emotional job performance (51 percent)—how staff members perform their duties and how they relate to others on a personal level. In some respects this is another intentional business strategy based on instincts I developed while I was growing up. Among my friends were plenty of good athletes and talented students. But far more important to me than a friend’s skills was always his or her goodness as a person. Imagine if every business were a lightbulb and that for each lightbulb the primary goal was to attract the most moths possible.

- learned that 49 percent of the reason moths were attracted to a bulb was for the quality of its light (brightness being the task of the bulb) and that 51 percent of the attraction was to the warmth projected by the bulb (heat being connected with the feeling of the bulb). It’s remarkable to me how many businesses shine brightly when it comes to acing the tasks but emanate all the warmth of a cool fluorescent light. That explains how a flawless four-star restaurant can actually attract far fewer loyal fans than a two-or three-star place with soul. In business, I want to be overcome with moths. Our staff must be like a scintillating string of one-hundred-watt lightbulbs, whose product is the sum of 51 percent feeling and 49 percent task. It is my firm conviction that an executive or business owner should pack a team with 51 percenters, because training them in the technical aspects will then come far… ([Location 2225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2225))

- Over time, we can almost always train for technical prowess. We can teach people how to deliver bread or olives, take orders for drinks or present menus; how to describe specials and make recommendations from the wine list; or how to explain the cheese selection. And it’s straightforward to teach table numbers and seat positions to avoid asking “Who gets the chicken?” (That question sounds amateurish and makes a guest feel as if the waiter didn’t pay attention to him or her in the first place.) A cook needs to know from his chef precisely what the sautéed sea bass is supposed to look like when it’s sautéed properly, how it tastes when it is seasoned perfectly, and what its texture should be when it has been cooked gently and properly. We can and do train for all that. Training for emotional skills is next to impossible. We aim to hire people who possess an emotional skill that chef Michael Romano calls the excellence reflex. People duck as a natural reflex when something is hurled… ([Location 2234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2234))

- caring, and practice. The overarching concern to do the right thing well is something we can’t train for. Either it’s there or it isn’t. So we need to train how to hire for it. We don’t believe in pursuing the so-called 110 percent employee. That’s about as realistic as working to achieve the twenty-six-hour day. We are hoping to develop 100 percent employees whose skills are divided 51-49 between emotional hospitality and technical excellence. As I’ve mentioned above, we refer to these employees as 51 percenters. To me, a 51 percenter has five core emotional skills. I’ve learned that we need to hire employees with these skills if we’re to be champions at the team sport of hospitality.

- A strong work ethic is an indispensable emotional skill for any employee who is going to contribute to the excellence of our business. We want people on our team who are highly motivated, confident, and wired to do the job well. It’s not hard to teach anyone the proper way to set a beautiful table. What is impossible to teach is how to care deeply about setting the table beautifully. When I walk into any one of our restaurants as its dining room is being set up for service, one of the most lovely sights to me is a waiter lifting a wineglass off the table, holding ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2270))

- it up to the light, and checking for smudges. This is not because I’m an unreformed smudge freak, but because someone is showing care for a small detail—smaller even than what the average guest may notice. When an employee does not work out, the problem more often stems from an attitude of “I won’t” rather than “I can’t.” A high degree of empathy is crucial in delivering enlightened hospitality. Empathy is not just an awareness of what others are experiencing; it’s being aware of, being sensitive to, and caring about how one’s own behavior affects others. We want waiters, for example, who can approach a new table of guests and intuitively sense their needs and agenda. Have they come, for example, to celebrate or to conduct business? Are they here to experience the cuisine, or simply to connect with a colleague over a light meal? Do they want extra attention from the restaurant, or would they prefer to be left alone? Guests may think they’re dining out to feel nourished, but I’ve always believed that an even more primary need of diners is to be nurtured. The most direct and effective way to let our guests know that we’re on their side has always been to field a team that exudes an infectious kind of empathy. No business can truly offer hospitality if the preponderance of its team members lack empathy. ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2273))

- But when each member of the team goes to bat for the others, the mutual trust and respect engendered among them creates an infectious environment of caring for our guests. Self-awareness and integrity go hand in hand. It takes integrity to be self-aware and to hold oneself accountable for doing the right thing. I want to work with people who have a handle on what makes themselves tick. Self-awareness is understanding your moods (and how they affect you and others). In a sense, it is a personal weather report. Is the mood dry or humid? Is it raining or stormy? Is it warm and sunny or chilly and cloudy? The staff members’ individual and collective moods influence the customers’ moods; and in the intricate, fast-paced dance between the kitchen, dining room, and guests during a meal—when hundreds of people are served—it’s crucial for my staff members to be aware of and accountable for their own personal “weather reports.” No one can possibly be upbeat and happy all the time.

We call that “skunking.” A skunk may spray a predator when it feels threatened, but everyone else within two miles has to smell the spray, and these others may assume that the skunk actually had it in for them. It’s not productive to work with a skunk, and it’s not enjoyable to be served by one either. In a business that depends on the harmony of an ensemble, a skunk’s scent is toxic. It may seem implicit in the philosophy of enlightened hospitality that the employee is constantly setting aside personal needs and selflessly taking care of others. But the real secret of its success is to hire people to whom caring for others is, in fact, a selfish act. I call these people hospitalitarians.

- The press loves covering restaurants, and with each year its voracious appetite continues to grow, in response, I assume, to the public’s own insatiable interest in consuming and devouring information about dining out. On our best days, the media can be extremely helpful to our business. When we err, or are perceived to have fallen short of someone’s mark, or simply fall out of favor, negative press can set back our business. Imagine that I’m standing on the shores of Manhattan and I am required to cross the Atlantic to France. The catch is that to get there, I have only two options: I can either swim or ride there on the back of a shark. Swimming is obviously out of the question. I’ll tire, freeze, and soon drown. My only choice then, is to hop on the back of the shark and ride with exceptional care and skill, or I’m lunch. The shark, you see, is the press, and it needs to keep swimming or it dies. I can benefit from acting very carefully with that knowledge. If my riding technique is expert, the shark can be my vehicle to deliver me safely to my destination. In my experience of riding sharks, I’ve been tossed off, nipped at, and even bitten—but not, so far, devoured. And I’ve always managed to reach my destination. Sometimes I’ve even enjoyed the ride.

- During one of his uncannily well-timed, impromptu visits to Union Square Cafe when I was still in my twenties, Pat Cetta sat down at a table with me and indulged my need to fret about the travails of managing my staff. I bemoaned the fact that I was failing to get any kind of consistent message across to my staff members regarding standards of excellence. Waiters and managers (at least half of whom were older than I) were continually testing me and pushing the limits, and this was driving me crazy. “If you choose to get upset about this, you are missing the boat, luvah,” Pat said with reassuring calm, in his indelible New York accent. Then he gave me a demonstration that has become integral to the way I view management. Pat Cetta’s simple lesson has helped me navigate through years of challenging moments as I’ve worked to encourage our team to build and sustain standards of excellence, especially while we’re growing. Pat pointed to the set table next to us. “First,” he said, “I want you to take everything off that table except for the saltshaker. Go ahead! Get rid of the plates, the silverware, the napkins, even the pepper mill. I just want you ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2959))

- to leave the saltshaker by itself in the middle.” I did as he said, and he asked, “Where is the saltshaker now?” “Right where you told me, in the center of the table.” “Are you sure that’s where you want it?” I looked closely. The shaker was actually about a quarter of an inch off center. “Go ahead. Put it where you really want it,” he said. I moved it very slightly to what looked to be smack-dab in the center. As soon as I removed my hand, Pat pushed the saltshaker three inches off center. “Now put it back where you want it,” he said. I returned it to dead center. This time he moved the shaker another six inches off center, again asking, “Now where do you want it?” I slid it back. Then he explained his point. “Listen, luvah. Your staff and your guests are always moving your saltshaker off center. That’s their job. It is the job of life. It’s the law of entropy! Until you understand that, you’re going to get pissed off every time someone moves the saltshaker off center. It is not your job to get upset. You just need to understand: that’s what they do. Your job is just to move the shaker back each time and let them know exactly what you stand for. Let them know what excellence looks like to you.

Everyone who works with you will know what matters to you and will respect and appreciate your unwavering values. Your inner beliefs about business will guide you through the tough times. It’s good to be open to fresh approaches to solving problems. But, when you cede your core values to someone else, it’s time to quit. That center point of the table, Pat was saying, represented my core of excellence. Every other point on the table was, to some degree, a measure of mediocrity, or even failure. But his powerful lesson also taught me to preserve my energy and not waste it getting upset about a basic, ongoing fact of life: “Shit happens,… ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=2980))

- Communication is at the root of all business strengths—and weaknesses. When things go wrong and employees become upset, whether at a restaurant, a law firm, a hardware store, a university, or a major corporation, nine times out of ten the justifiable complaint is, “We need to communicate more effectively.” I admit that for many years, I didn’t really know what this meant. I had no problem standing up in front of a group to give a talk. I thought I was a pretty good communicator, but then it dawned on me: communicating has as much to do with context as it does content. That’s called setting the table. Understanding who needs to know what, when people need to know it, and why, and then presenting that information in an entirely comprehensible way is a sine qua non of great leadership. Clear, timely communication is the key to applying constant, gentle pressure. To illustrate the point, I teach our managers about the “lily pad” theory.

- Imagine a pond filled with lily pads and a frog perched serenely atop each one. For the fun of it, a little boy tosses a small pebble into the water, which breaks the surface of the pond but causes just a tiny ripple. The frogs barely notice, and don’t budge. Enjoying himself, the boy next tosses a larger stone into the center of the pond, sending stronger ripples that cause all of the lily pads to rock and tilt. Some frogs jump off their lily pads, while others cling to avoid falling off. But the ripples affect them all. Not content, the boy then hurls a huge rock, which creates a wave that knocks each and every frog into the water. Some frogs are frightened. All are angry ([Location 3047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3047))

- (assuming that frogs get angry). If only the frogs had had some warning about the impending rock toss, each one could have timed its jump so that the wave would have had no serious impact. Grasping the lily pad theory and training yourself and your managers to implement it prevents many, if not all, communication problems. People who aren’t alerted in advance about a decision that will affect them may become angry and hurt. They’re confused, out of the loop; they feel as though they’ve been knocked off their lily pads. When team members complain about poor communication, they’re essentially saying, “You did not give me advance warning or input about that decision you made. By the time I learned about it, the decision had already happened to me, and I was unprepared.” Team members will generally go with the flow and be willing to hop over the ripples, so long as they… ([Location 3052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3052))

- you implement it, gauging whom it will affect, and to what degree. Poor communication is generally not a matter of miscommunication. More often, it involves taking away people’s feeling of control. Change works only when people believe it is happening for them, not to them. And there’s not much in between. Good communication is always a factor of good hospitality. In the fall of 2004 I was invited to appear on the Today Show with Terry Miller, a gourmet sausage specialist from Colorado, to do a segment on pairing hot dogs and wine. This was based on a popular seminar we had conducted together the previous summer at the Food and Wine Classic.

On the segment with Al Roker and Ann Curry, Terry mentioned some of the specialty bratwursts (jalapeño-elk, smoked buffalo,… ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3061))

The seven-minute segment on Today caused the day’s lunch business at Shake Shack to soar, and our staff had no idea what had hit them, what had caused it, or how to prepare for it. Their lily pads were pounded, turning what should have been a public relations triumph into a fiasco. The cooks couldn’t keep up with the unanticipated demand for bratwursts, guests waited far too long for their orders, and we quickly ran out of food.

A balanced combination of uncompromising standards and confidence-building reassurance sends a very clear and consistent message to your team: “I believe in you and I want you to win as much as I want to win.” You cannot have a dynamic organization unless you are constantly encouraging people to improve, and believing that they can do it.

- Feeling seen and acknowledged is a powerful human need. Paul Bolles-Beaven taught me that a traditional greeting among South Africans is umbuntu. It is not traditional there to salute people by saying “Hi,” “How are you?” or “What’s new?” Umbuntu is an expression of humanness, which conveys “I see you.” That simply and effectively addresses the core human need to be seen and to feel seen. It’s hard to imagine that it wouldn’t also apply to an employee, a customer, or a manager of a company. The number one reason guests cite for wanting to return to a restaurant is that when they go there, they feel seen and recognized. Imagine if our hosts consistently conveyed, “I see you!” I’m fairly certain that’s precisely what most people want.

- Stanley’s lesson reminded me of something my grandfather Irving Harris had always told me: “The definition of business is problems.” His philosophy came down to a simple fact of business life: success lies not in the elimination of problems but in the art of creative, profitable problem solving. The best companies are those that distinguish themselves by solving problems most effectively. Indeed, business is problem solving. As human beings, we are all fallible. You’ve got to welcome the inevitability of mistakes if you want to succeed in the restaurant business—or in any business. It’s critical for us to accept and embrace our ongoing mistakes as opportunities to learn, grow, and profit. Baseball’s top hitters can make seven mistakes out of every ten at-bats, and still ride a .300 lifetime batting average into the Hall of Fame. We also need to expect the unexpected.

For us, the secret of the game is anticipating mistakes, harnessing them, and addressing them in constructive ways so that we end up in a better spot than if we had never made them in the first place. I like to think of our staff members not as servers, but as surfers. Surfing is an arduous sport, and no one pursues it involuntarily. No one forces you to become a surfer, but if you choose to do it, there’s no point in wasting energy trying to tame the ocean of its waves. Waves are like mistakes. You can count on the fact that there will always be another wave, so your choice is to get back on the surfboard and anticipate it. The degree to which you ride it with better form than the next guy is how you improve and distinguish yourself. The style with which a company rides the tough waves and addresses mistakes can define its heart, soul, and talent. Otherwise, there is no art to doing business. Our company is populated with surfers—fortunately, since in the restaurant business you can always count on another wave.

- But the worst mistake is not to figure out some way to end up in a better place after having made a mistake. We call that “writing a great last chapter.” Whatever mistake happened, happened. And the person on the receiving end will naturally want to tell anyone who’s interested all about it. That’s to be expected. While we can’t erase what happened, we do have the power to write one last episode so that at least the story ends the way we want. If we write a great one, we will earn a comeback victory ([Location 3515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3515))

To be effective, the last chapter must be written imaginatively, graciously, generously, and sincerely. And sometimes we even write a great last chapter when it was the guest, not us, who made the mistake. If someone spills his or her glass at the bar, we pour another round, period. A child once spilled a glass of Sprite at his table, so we bought all six members of his family a round of what they were drinking. If a guest doesn’t like his or her dish, it is to be removed from the bill. I have found that when you acknowledge a mistake and genuinely express your regret at having made it, guests will almost always give you a chance to earn back their favor.

- THE FIVE A’S FOR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING MISTAKES Awareness—Many mistakes go unaddressed because no one is even aware they have happened. If you’re not aware, you’re nowhere. Acknowledgement—“Our server had an accident, and we are going to prepare a new plate for you as quickly as possible.” Apology—“I am so sorry this happened to you.” Alibis are not one of the Five A’s. It is not appropriate or useful to make excuses (“We’re short-staffed.”) Action—“Please enjoy this for now. We’ll have your fresh order out in just a few minutes.” Say what you are going to do to make amends then follow through. Additional generosity—Unless the mistake had to do with slow timing, I would instruct my staff to send out something additional (a complimentary dessert or ([Location 3530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3530))

Use all your imagination and creativity in thinking about your response. 4. Learn from the mistake. Use every new mistake as a teaching tool with your employees. Unless the mistake involved a lack of integrity, the person who made it has actually helped your team by providing you with new opportunities to improve. 5. Make new mistakes every day. Don’t waste time repeating the old ones. ([Location 3569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3569))

- THERE ARE FIVE PRIMARY stakeholders to whom we express our most caring hospitality, and in whom we take the greatest interest. Prioritizing those people in the following order is the guiding principal for practically every decision we make, and it has made the single greatest contribution to the ongoing success of our company: Our employees Our guests ([Location 3751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3751))

- Considering that most of us spend about one-third of our lives at work, it is the value of the human experience we have with our colleagues—what we learn from one another, how much fun we have working together, and how much mutual respect and trust we share—that has the greatest influence on job satisfaction. When I talk about the staff caring for each other, I stress that it’s incumbent upon all members of our team to be citizens of our company and to come to work looking for opportunities to be on one another’s side.

- The primary reason we have such a loyal and dedicated staff (in a fickle industry notorious for high turnover), is that we understand what people want most from their workplace is to respect and be respected. And it certainly helps to know that their honest day’s work—mistakes and all—is appreciated. We try to find opportunities to express our respect in many ways.

- We strive to treat our guests the way we would want to be treated. The golden rule remains as fresh and meaningful as ever; and beyond how well it serves people in their lives, it may also be the most potent business strategy ever devised. In business, as in life, you get what you give. We try to apply a humanitarian viewpoint to every business challenge, to find creative, gracious solutions and reassure our guests that we are solidly on their side.

- In the course of their calls, our reservationists must continuously listen to themselves and ask: am I being perceived by this caller as an agent or a gatekeeper? An agent makes things happen for others. A gatekeeper sets up barriers to keep people out. We’re looking for agents. In every business, there are employees who are the first point of contact with the customers (attendants at airport gates, receptionists at doctors’ offices, bank tellers, executive assistants). Those people can come across either as agents or as gatekeepers. An agent makes things happen for others. A gatekeeper sets up barriers to keep people out. We’re looking for agents, and our staff members are responsible for monitoring their own performance: In that transaction, did I present myself as an agent or a gatekeeper? In the world of hospitality, there’s rarely anything in between. ([Location 3863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=3863))

- For example, when you see a restaurant with banquettes against a long wall, it’s often a design strategy for fitting more people in as efficiently as possible. And to shoehorn in the maximum number of tables, most restaurants choose the narrowest possible tables to line up along the banquette. But in order for all the food ( plus bread and butter, wine bottle, flowers, and salt and pepper) to fit on these very narrow tables, they are often designed to be both very narrow and very long. That puts a guest twice as far from the face of the person he or she came to dine with and twice as close to the ears of strangers at the tables on either side. It’s almost impossible to be intimate with anyone other than the people on either side of you. That’s inhospitable.

- It’s not natural for a young child to be inclined to share. Until we were taught by parents and teachers about the importance of sharing, none of us wanted to do it. Sharing something important to us with someone else always meant that there would be less of it for us. With patience, maturity, and practice at the art of negotiating and compromise, most of us eventually learned that sharing a toy, a candy bar, or even a friend could actually enrich the experience of life. Less of something for us now could ultimately yield more. That’s the way it is when you choose to take on investors for your business. I suppose if I had all the money in the world, I might choose to own 100 percent of the risk and the financial returns. But I’ve learned over time that while the child in me may want the pie ([Location 4230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=4230))

- all to myself, the wisest thing I can do in my own self-interest is to share pieces of that pie with others. By selling or even giving away some pieces, I’ve never given up having control in preparing the recipe, but I have always ended up with a bigger, better-tasting pie.

- In fact, by avoiding some potential mistakes, I sometimes wonder whether we’ve made much more money by choosing the right things to say no to, than we have made from those things we’ve chosen to say yes to. I often try to measure the money we haven’t lost and all the quality and soul we haven’t squandered. There is much to learn by understanding what goes into a “no” decision, and there’s an art to analyzing the deals you don’t make.

- THE “YES” CRITERIA FOR NEW VENTURES The opportunity fits and enhances our company’s overall strategic goals and objectives. The opportunity represents a chance to create a business venture that is perceived as groundbreaking, trailblazing, and fresh. The timing is right for our company’s capacity to grow with excellence, especially in terms of our having enough key employees who are themselves interested and ready to grow.

- We believe we have the capacity to be category leaders within whatever niche we are pursuing. We believe our existing businesses will benefit and improve by virtue of or notwithstanding our pursuing this new opportunity. We feel excited and passionate about this idea. Pursuing it will be an opportunity to learn, grow, and have fun! We are excited about doing business in this community. The context is the right fit. Our restaurant and our style of doing business will be in harmony with its location. An in-depth pro forma analysis convinces us that it is a wise and safe investment.

- In order to do a gut check on how much I really want to take a space or do a deal, I always ask myself whether I would do this deal if it were given to me for free. That sounds simplistic, I know, but it works. Believe it or not, my answer to this question is most often “no.” ([Location 4434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=4434))

- I don’t take a “rearview mirror” approach to life. Generally, I drive looking straight ahead. But I do try to spend time analyzing the wisdom of choices I’ve made not to go forward with new ventures; and that analysis requires abundant self-awareness and some hindsight. There are a handful of difficult “nos”—projects that I thought would have been the right fit for our company but that presented themselves at the wrong time. Other assessments have led me to conclude it was the right time for a project, but the wrong fit. A yes decision has to meet both of those criteria. My regret isn’t that I came to the wrong conclusion, but that I made a difficult, though correct, decision about what our company needed at a precise moment in time.

- down the road. Especially in cases where timing was the decisive factor in not making a deal, there is value in remaining in close contact with the potential future partner. While it’s true that today’s potential business deal may later evaporate, it also may one day evolve into something bigger, better, and more richly textured. Patience has its rewards.

- With that, Hallie burst into tears. “I never want you to have a restaurant where people are going there for some other reason than to go to your restaurant. People go to your restaurants because they want to be at your restaurant,” she said. That day, I added Hallie to my list of unofficial advisers. I knew she was right. It was her wise way of telling me that the context would not have been right for our company. Context, context, context! For years I had heard the business mantra, “Location, location, location”—an ironclad principle that the key to the success for any retail establishment was picking the right address to set up shop. My own experience indicates that a far more significant contributor to success is context. A powerful example is Tiffany’s famous blue box. The box is the context that provides a strong indication of what you can expect to find inside. Whatever is in that box may not be the exact gift you were anticipating, but it ([Location 4561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000OI0FCQ&location=4561))

- must be entirely consistent with your expectations of something that belongs in a Tiffany box. The box enhances the value of the object inside; and conversely, the object inside supports and further defines the meaning of the blue box. That’s not location. That’s context!

- At about this time, my assistant, Jenny Dirksen (now our director of community investment), shared a priceless expression her grandmother had taught her: One tuchas can’t dance at two weddings. It’s nice to be invited to a lot of parties. But as much as you may want to attend them all, it’s important to acknowledge that you can be in only one place at a time, and do one thing well. My own grandfather used to express similar wisdom: Doing two things like a half-wit never equals doing one thing like a whole wit.

Because with a few exceptions there’s always a higher, steeper mountain to scale, and I’m willing to confront all sorts of treacherous conditions, especially when I’m convinced that they’ll lead to exhilarating views from the top.
