## Highlights
- The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in. It’s the law of leadership: It’s better to be first than it is to be better. It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first. You can demonstrate the law of leadership by asking yourself two questions: ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=87))

- People tend to stick with what they’ve got. If you meet someone a little better than your wife or husband, it’s really not worth making the switch, what with attorneys’ fees and dividing up the house and kids.

- One reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the name often becomes generic. Xerox, the first plain-paper copier, became the name for all plain-paper copiers. People will stand in front of a Ricoh or a Sharp or a Kodak machine and say, “How do I make a Xerox copy?” They will ask for the Kleenex when the box clearly says Scott. They will offer you a Coke when all they have is Pepsi-Cola. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=130))

- Unfortunately, benchmarking doesn’t work. Regardless of reality, people perceive the first product into the mind as superior. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=149))

- Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Who was second? Roger Bannister was the first person to run a four-minute mile. Who was second? George Washington was the first president of the United States. Who was second? Thomas’ was the first brand of English muffin. What was second? Gatorade was the first sports drink. What was second? If you’re second into the prospect’s mind, are you doomed to languish forever with Buzz Aldrin, John Landy, John Adams, some unknown English muffin, and ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=154))

- If you didn’t get into the prospect’s mind first, don’t give up hope. Find a new category you can be first in. It’s not as difficult as you might think. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=176))

- Sometimes you can turn an also-ran into a winner by inventing a new category. Commodore was just another manufacturer of home personal computers that wasn’t going anywhere until it positioned the Amiga as the first multimedia computer. Today the Commodore Amiga is a big success, with more than $500 million worth sold annually. There are many different ways to be first. Dell got into the crowded personal computer field by being the first to sell computers by phone. Today Dell is a $900 million company. When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not “How is this new product better than the competition?” but “First what?” In other words, what category is this new product first in? Charles Schwab didn’t open a better brokerage firm. He opened the first discount broker. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=189))

- This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better. When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence, you have no competition. DEC told its prospects why they ought to buy a minicomputer, not a DEC minicomputer. In the early days, Hertz sold rent-a-car service. Coca-Cola sold refreshment. Marketing programs of both companies were more effective back then. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=197))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Is something wrong with the law of leadership in chapter 1? No, but the law of the mind modifies it. It’s better to be first in the prospect’s mind than first in the marketplace. Which, if anything, understates the importance of being first in the mind. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=212))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=217))

- You want to change something in a computer? Just type over or delete the existing material. You want to change something in a mind? Forget it. Once a mind is made up, it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind. “If you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot worm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable opinion over a period of time. The mind doesn’t work that way. You have to blast your way into the mind. The reason you blast instead of worm is that people don’t like to change their minds. Once they perceive you one way, that’s it. They kind of file you away in their minds as a certain kind of person. You cannot become a different person in their minds. One of the mysteries of marketing is the role of money. One day a few dollars can work a major miracle. The next day millions of dollars can’t save a company from going under. When you have an open mind to work with, even a small amount of money can go a long way. Apple got ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=231))

- Marketing people are preoccupied with doing research and “getting the facts.” They analyze the situation to make sure that truth is on their side. Then they sail confidently into the marketing arena, secure in the knowledge that they have the best product and that ultimately the best product will win. It’s an illusion. There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=249))

- Most marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that you’re fighting a product battle rooted in reality. All the laws in this book are derived from the exact opposite point of view. What some marketing people see as the natural laws of marketing are based on a flawed premise that the product is the hero of the marketing program and that you’ll win or lose based on the merits of the product. Which is why the natural, logical way to market a product is invariably wrong. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=266))

- Only by studying how perceptions are formed in the mind and focusing your marketing programs on those perceptions can you overcome your basically incorrect marketing instincts. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=270))

- So what’s the difference between Honda in Japan and Honda in the United States? The products are the same, but the perceptions in customers’ minds are different. If you told friends in New York you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What kind of car did you get? a Civic? an Accord? a Prelude?” If you told friends in Tokyo you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What kind of motorcycle did you buy?” In Japan, Honda got into customers’ minds as a manufacturer of motorcycles, and apparently most people don’t want to buy a car from a motorcycle company. How about an opposite situation? Would Harley-Davidson be successful if it launched a Harley-Davidson automobile? You might think it would depend on the car. Quality, styling, horsepower, pricing. You might even believe the Harley-Davidson reputation for quality would be a plus. We think not. Its perception as a motorcycle company would undermine a Harley-Davidson car—no matter how good the product (chapter 12: The Law of Line Extension).

- What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows” principle. Everybody knows that the Japanese make higher-quality cars than the Americans do. So people make buying decisions based on the fact that everybody knows the Japanese make higher-quality cars. When you ask shoppers whether they have had any personal experience with a product, most often they say they haven’t. And, more often than not, their own experience is often twisted to conform to their perceptions. If you have had a bad experience with a Japanese car, you’ve just been unlucky, because everybody knows the Japanese make high-quality cars. Conversely, if you have had a good experience with an American car, you’ve just been lucky, because everybody knows that American cars are poorly made. Everybody knows there’s a problem with Audi cars. On November 23, 1986, CBS broadcast a “60 Minutes” segment called “Out of Control.” It called attention to a number of complaints about Audi’s “unintended acceleration.” American sales of Audis fell through the floorboards—from 60,000 in 1986 to 12,000 in 1991. But have you ever personally had any problems with “unintended acceleration” while test-driving an Audi? It is unlikely. Every single automobile expert who has tested the car has failed to duplicate the complaint. Yet the perception lingers on.

- The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=326))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Federal Express was able to put the word overnight into the minds of its prospects because it sacrificed its product line and focused on overnight package delivery only. In a way, the law of leadership—it’s better to be first than to be better—enables the first brand or company to own a word in the mind of the prospect. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it’s invisible. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=331))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association test. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the four most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey’s, and Coke. An astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position. Heinz owns the word ketchup. But Heinz went on to isolate the most important ketchup attribute. “Slowest ketchup in the West” is how the company ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=337))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is preempting the thickness attribute. Owning the word slow helps Heinz maintain a 50 percent market share. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=341))

- For a number of years, Lotus has owned the word spreadsheet. Lotus was synonymous with 1-2-3 and spreadsheet. But the world of spreadsheets is getting competitive, and the potential for growth is limited. Like other companies, Lotus wants to grow. How is the company to get beyond its single-product business?

- What won’t work in marketing is leaving your own word in search of a word owned by others. This was the case with Atari, which owned the words video game. But the business turned out to be faddish, so in 1982 it sailed off in a new direction. It wanted Atari to mean computers. CEO James Morgan laid it all out: “Atari’s strength as a name also tends to be its weakness. It is synonymous with video games. Atari must redefine its image and broaden its business definition to electronic consumer products.” ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=374))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Despite the disaster stories, many companies continue to violate the law of exclusivity. You can’t change people’s minds once they are made up. In fact, what you often do is reinforce your competitor’s position by making its concept more important. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=425))

- Your marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the mind and consequently which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the better, of course. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=461))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which information to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind accepts only new data that is consistent with its product ladder in that category. Everything else is ignored. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=476))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=491))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Marketing people often talk about the “three leading brands” in a category as if it were a battle of equals. It almost never is. The leader inevitably dominates the No. 2 brand and the No. 2 brand inevitably smothers No. 3. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=497))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the seven wonders of the world, seven-card stud, Snow White and the seven dwarfs, the seven danger signals of cancer. Sometimes your own ladder, or category, is too small. It might be better to be a small fish in a big pond than to be a big fish in a small pond. In other words, it’s sometimes better to be No. 3 on a big ladder than No. 1 on a small ladder.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The ladder is a simple, but powerful, analogy that can help you deal with the critical issues in marketing. Before starting any marketing program, ask yourself the following questions: Where are we on the ladder in the prospect’s mind? On the top rung? On the second rung? Or maybe we’re not on the ladder at all. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=513))

- In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=519))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder becomes a two-rung affair. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=521))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In batteries, it’s Eveready and Duracell. In photographic film, it’s Kodak and Fuji. In rent-a-cars, it’s Hertz and Avis. In mouthwash, it’s Listerine and Scope. In hamburgers, it’s McDonald’s and Burger King. In sneakers, it’s Nike and Reebok. In toothpaste, it’s Crest and Colgate. When you take the long view of marketing, you find the battle usually winds up as a titanic struggle between two major players—usually the old reliable brand and the upstart. Back in 1969, there were three major brands of a certain product. The leader had about 60 percent of the market, the No. 2 brand had a 25 percent share, and the No. 3 brand had a 6 percent share. The rest of the market included either private label or minor brands. The law of duality suggests that these market shares are unstable. Furthermore, the law predicts that the leader will lose market share and No. 2 will gain. Twenty-two years later, the leader dropped down to 45 percent of the market. The No. 2 brand has 40 percent, and No. 3 has 3 percent. The products are Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Royal Crown cola, respectively, but the principles apply to brands everywhere. Look at the three long-distance telephone companies. AT&T has 65 percent of the market, MCI has 17 percent, ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=522))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and Sprint has 10 percent. Who will win and who will lose in the telephone wars? While the future is unknowable (chapter 17: The Law of Unpredictability), a betting person would put his or her money on MCI. MCI has won the battle with Sprint for second place, so now MCI ought to become the upstart alternative to old, reliable AT&T. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=532))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The only brand that got killed was Royal Crown. In a maturing industry, third place is a difficult position to be in. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=541))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products. It’s this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: “They must be the best, they’re the leaders.” ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=572))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=577))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In strength there is weakness. Wherever the leader is strong, there is an opportunity for a would-be No. 2 to turn the tables. Much like a wrestler uses his opponent’s strength against him, a company should leverage the leader’s strength into a weakness. If you want to establish a firm foothold on the second rung of the ladder, study the firm above you. Where is it strong? And how do you turn that strength into a weakness? You must discover the essence of the leader and then present the prospect with the opposite. (In other words, don’t try to be better, try to be different.) It’s often the upstart versus old reliable. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=579))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group. In other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink Coke and young people drink Pepsi, there’s nobody left to drink Royal Crown cola. Yet, too many potential No. 2 brands try to emulate the leader. This usually is an error. You must present yourself as the alternative. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=588))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But don’t simply knock the competition. The law of the opposite is a two-edge sword. It requires honing in on a weakness that your prospect will quickly acknowledge. (One whiff of Listerine and you know that your mouth would smell like a hospital.) Then quickly twist the sword. (Scope is the good-tasting mouthwash that kills germs.) ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=596))

- Marketing is often a battle for legitimacy. The first brand that captures the concept is often able to portray its competitors as illegitimate pretenders. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=623))

- Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=639))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Like an amoeba dividing in a petri dish, the marketing arena can be viewed as an ever-expanding sea of categories. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=641))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- A category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over time, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes, minicomputers, workstations, personal computers, laptops, notebooks, pen computers. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=642))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Instead of understanding this concept of division, many corporate leaders hold the naive belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing cousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of America. IBM, according to the New York Times, is poised “to take advantage of the coming convergence of whole industries, including television, music, publishing and computing.” “IBM’s strongest suit,” says the Times, “in the expected convergence of cable and telephone networks with computer and television manufacturers may be technology that it has developed to create extremely high-speed networks.” (See chapter 20: The Law of Hype.) It won’t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=661))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Timing is also important. You can be too early to exploit a new category. Back in the fifties the Nash Rambler was America’s first small car. But American Motors didn’t have either the courage or the money to hang in there long enough for the category to develop. It’s better to be early than late. You can’t get into the prospect’s mind first unless you’re prepared to spend some time waiting for things to develop.

- Is alcohol a stimulant or a depressant? ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=707))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you visit almost any bar and grill on a Friday night after work, you’d swear that alcohol was a stimulant. The noise and laughter are strong evidence of alcohol’s stimulating effects. Yet at 4:00 in the morning, when you see a few happy-hour customers sleeping it off in the streets, you’d swear that alcohol is a depressant. Chemically, alcohol is a strong depressant. But in the short term, by depressing a person’s inhibitions, alcohol acts like a stimulant. Many marketing moves exhibit the same phenomenon. The long-term effects are often the exact opposite of the short-term effects. Does a sale increase a company’s business or decrease it? Obviously, in the short term, a sale increases business. But there’s more and more evidence to show that sales decrease business in the long term by educating customers not to buy at “regular” prices. Aside from the fact that you can buy something for less, what does a sale say to a prospect? It says that your regular prices are too high. After the sale is over, customers tend to avoid a store with a “sale” reputation. To maintain volume, retail outlets find they have to run almost continuous sales. It’s not unusual to walk down a retail block and find a dozen stores in a row with “Sale” signs in their windows.

- In everyday life there are many examples of short-term gains and long-term losses, crime being a typical example. If you rob a bank for $100,000 and wind up spending 10 years in jail, you either made $100,000 for a day’s work or $10,000 a year for 10 years of labor. It depends on your point of view. Inflation can give an economy a short-term jolt, but in the long run, inflation leads to recession. (The nuts in Brazil haven’t figured this out yet.) In the short term, overeating satisfies the psyche, but in the long run it causes obesity and depression. In many other areas of life (spending money, taking drugs, having sex) the long-term effects of your actions are often the opposite’ of the short-term effects. Why then is it so hard to comprehend that marketing effects take place over an extended period of time? Take line extension. In the short term, line extension invariably increases sales. The beer industry clearly illustrates this effect. In the early seventies, Miller High Life was barreling along with sales increases averaging 27 percent a year. Miller’s success was fueled by “Miller Time,” a blue-collar campaign focused on rewarding yourself at the end of the day with a Miller beer. Then ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=730))

- Miller got greedy and in 1974 introduced Miller Lite, a brilliant concept (chapter 2: The Law of the Category) buried under a line extended name. In the short term the two Millers could coexist: the blue-collar beer (High Life) and the yuppie beer (Lite). But in the long term, line extension was bound to undermine one or the other brand. The high-water mark for Miller High Life was 1979, five years after the introduction of Miller Lite. In those five years Miller High Life’s annual sales almost tripled, from 8.6 million to 23.6 million barrels. This was the short-term effect of line extension. The long-term effect was grim. From a high of 23.6 million barrels in 1979, Miller High Life declined 13 years in a row to just 5.8 million barrels in 1991. And the decline is bound to continue. Nor has Miller Lite been immune to the ravages of line extension. In 1986, the brewer introduced Miller Genuine Draft. The brand took because it was the first beer in a new category. Unfortunately, the brand also carried the Miller name. (See the next chapter: The Law of Line Extension.) History repeats itself. Five years later, Miller Lite peaked in sales and then started to decline. Once started, the decline is almost impossible to stop.

- What happened to Coca-Cola clothes also happened to Donald Trump. At first, The Donald was successful. Then he branched out and put his name on anything the banks would lend him money for. What’s a Trump? A hotel, three casinos, two condominiums, one airline, one shopping center. Fortune magazine called Trump “an investor with a keen eye for cash flow and asset values, a smart marketer, a cunning wheeler-dealer.” Time and Newsweek put The Donald on their covers. Today Trump is $1.4 billion in debt. What made him successful in the short term is exactly what caused him to fail in the long term. Line extension. It looks easy, but marketing is not a game for amateurs. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=764))

- By far the most violated law in our book is the law of line extension. What’s even more diabolical is that line extension is a process that takes place continuously, with almost no conscious effort on the part of the corporation. It’s like a closet or a desk drawer that fills up with almost no effort on your part. One day a company is tightly focused on a single product that is highly profitable. The next day the same company is spread thin over many products and is losing money. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=776))

- The world of business is populated by big, highly diversified generalists and small, narrowly focused specialists. If line extension and diversification were effective marketing strategies, you’d expect to see the generalists riding high. But they’re not. Most of them are in trouble. The generalist is weak. Take Kraft, for example. Everybody thinks Kraft is a strong brand name. In jellies and jams, Kraft has 9 percent of the market. But Smucker’s has 35 percent.

- Marketing is a battle of ideas. So if you are to succeed, you must have an idea or attribute of your own to focus your efforts around. Without one, you had better have a low price. A very low price. Some say all attributes are not created equal. Some attributes are more important to customers than others. You must try and own the most important attribute. Cavity prevention is the most important attribute in toothpaste. It’s the one to own. But the law of exclusivity points to the simple truth that once an attribute is successfully taken by your competition, it’s gone. You must move on to a lesser attribute and live with a smaller share of the category. Your job is to seize a different attribute, dramatize the value of your attribute, and thus increase your share.

- been drummed into us. “Think positive” has been the subject of endless books and articles. So it may come as a surprise to you that one of the most effective ways to get into a prospect’s mind is to first admit a negative and then twist it into a positive. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.” “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.” “The 1970 VW will stay ugly longer.” “Joy. The most expensive perfume in the world.” What’s going on here? Why does a dose of honesty work so well in the marketing process? First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an advertisement. You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.… ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=1008))

- “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.” Most companies, especially family companies, would never make fun of their own name. Yet the Smucker family did, which is one reason why Smucker’s is the No.1 brand of jams and jellies. If your name is bad, you have two choices: change the name or make fun of it. The one thing you can’t do is to ignore a bad name. Which is one reason why you won’t find beer brands like Gablinger’s, Grolsch, and Gresedieck in your supermarket today. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.” So why go with them? They must try harder. Everybody knew that Avis was second in rent-a-cars. So why go with the obvious? Marketing is often a search for the obvious. Since you can’t change a mind once it’s made up, your marketing efforts have to be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the brain. You have to use your marketing programs to “rub it in.” No program did this as brilliantly as the Avis No. 2 program.… ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=1020))

- When a company starts a message by admitting a problem, people tend to, almost instinctively, open their minds. Think about the times that someone came to you with a problem and how quickly you got involved and wanted to help. Now think about people starting off a conversation about some wonderful things they are doing. You probably were a lot less interested. Now with that mind open, you’re in a position to drive in the positive, which is your selling idea. Some years ago, Scope entered the mouthwash market with a “good-tasting” mouthwash, thus exploiting Listerine’s truly terrible taste. What should Listerine do? It certainly couldn’t tell people that Listerine’s taste “wasn’t all that bad.” That would raise a red flag that would reinforce a negative perception. Things could get worse. Instead, Listerine brilliantly invoked the law of candor: “The taste you hate twice a day.” Not only did the company admit the product tasted bad, it admitted that people actually… ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC10HA&location=1030))

It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind.

- They think they can pick and choose from a number of different strategies and still be successful as long as they put enough effort into the program. If they work for the leader in the category, they fritter away their resources on a number of different programs. They seem to think that the best way to grow is the puppy approach—get into everything. If they’re not with the leader, they often end up trying to do the same as the leader, but a little better. It’s like Saddam Hussein saying that all we have to do is fight a little harder and everything will work out. Trying harder is not the secret of marketing success. Whether you try hard or try easy, the differences are marginal. Furthermore, the bigger the company, the more the law of averages wipes out any real advantage of a trying-harder approach. History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke. Furthermore, in any given situation there is only one move that will produce substantial results. Successful generals study the battleground and look for that one bold stroke that is least expected by the enemy. Finding one is difficult. Finding more than one is usually impossible.

Equally as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of assuming the future will be a replay of the present.
