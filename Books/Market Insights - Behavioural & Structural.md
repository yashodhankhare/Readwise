## Highlights
- Basis Trade 
  A basis trade is a trading strategy commonly used in financial markets, particularly in futures and fixed-income securities like bonds. It exploits the price difference, or “basis,” between two related instruments—typically a cash (spot) asset and its corresponding futures contract. The goal is to profit from the convergence of these prices as the futures contract approaches its expiration date.
  Here’s how it works in simple terms:
  1 The Basis: The basis is the difference between the spot price of an asset (e.g., a Treasury bond) and the price of a futures contract tied to that asset. For example, if a Treasury bond’s spot price is $100 and its futures contract is priced at $99, the basis is $1.
  2 The Strategy: A trader might buy the cheaper instrument and sell the more expensive one, betting that the price gap (basis) will narrow over time. This is often done with leverage to amplify returns. For instance:
  ◦ Buy the cash bond and sell the futures contract if the basis is positive (cash price > futures price).
  ◦ Sell the cash bond and buy the futures contract if the basis is negative (cash price < futures price).
  3 Convergence: As the futures contract nears expiration, its price should theoretically converge with the spot price of the underlying asset, assuming no major market disruptions. The trader profits from this narrowing gap.
  4 Risks: While basis trades are often considered low-risk arbitrage strategies, they’re not foolproof. Market volatility, liquidity issues, or unexpected events (like sudden interest rate changes) can widen the basis instead of narrowing it, leading to losses—especially if the trade is highly leveraged.
  A classic example is in the U.S. Treasury market, where hedge funds might use basis trades to capitalize on small discrepancies between Treasury bonds and Treasury futures. It’s a popular play among sophisticated investors because it’s seen as a way to generate steady returns with minimal directional risk (i.e., it doesn’t rely on the market going up or down). However, when too many players pile into the same trade, it can amplify systemic risks—like we’ve seen in past market stress events.
  Does that clarify it? Let me know if you want a deeper dive into a specific market or example!
- Serenity Prayer
  God, grant me the serenity
  to accept the things I cannot change,
  the courage to change the things I can,
  and the wisdom to know the difference.
  Living one day at a time,
  enjoying one moment at a time;
  accepting hardship as a pathway to peace;
  taking, as Jesus did,
  this sinful world as it is,
  not as I would have it;
  trusting that You will make all things right
  if I surrender to Your will;
  so that I may be reasonably happy in this life
  and supremely happy with You forever in the next.
  Amen.
- Rubicon Historical Inference
  Difficult mathematical calculations, like other logical reasoning, require willpower as you follow a set of systematic rules to get from one set of information to something new. You often go through steps like these in making a decision, through a process that psychologists call the Rubicon model of action phases, in honor of the river that separated Italy from the Roman province of Gaul. When Caesar reached it, he knew that a general returning to Rome was forbidden to bring his legions across the Rubicon. He realized that crossing it with his army would start a civil war. Waiting on the Gaul side of the river, he was in the “pre-decisional phase” as he contemplated his goals and possibilities along with the potential costs and benefits. Then he stopped calculating and crossed the Rubicon, reaching the “post-decisional phase,” which Caesar defined much more felicitously: “The die is cast.”
- **What does Malcom Goldsmith say in his book ‘what got you here, won’t get you there’ about feed forward?**
  In What Got You Here Won’t Get You There, Marshall Goldsmith (not Malcolm) introduces feedforward as a proactive, future-focused alternative to feedback. Unlike feedback, which often dwells on past mistakes and can feel judgmental, feedforward involves asking others for suggestions on how to improve in the future. Goldsmith emphasizes that it’s about creating a positive, collaborative process to foster growth without rehashing what can’t be changed.
  Here’s what he says about feedforward in essence:
  1 Future-Oriented: Feedforward asks, “How can I do better going forward?” It invites ideas for improvement rather than critiquing past behavior. For example, you might ask a colleague, “What’s one thing I could do to be a better team member?”
  2 Non-Judgmental: It avoids the defensiveness tied to feedback. Since it’s about possibilities, not failures, people are more open to giving and receiving it. Goldsmith notes it’s easier to hear because it doesn’t imply criticism.
  3 Practical Process: He outlines a simple method: pick one behavior to improve, ask for two suggestions on how to do it better, listen without judging, thank the person, and act on the ideas that resonate. No debating or justifying—just listening.
  4 Reciprocity: Goldsmith suggests making it a two-way exchange. When you ask for feedforward, offer to provide it in return, creating mutual growth. This works across hierarchies, from CEOs to team members.
  5 Cultural Impact: He argues feedforward fosters a culture of openness and continuous improvement, especially in leadership, where candid advice is rare. It’s particularly effective because successful people, who might resist criticism, welcome ideas for the future.
  Goldsmith shares examples from his coaching, like executives using feedforward to tweak behaviors (e.g., being more approachable). He stresses it’s not about overhauling your personality but making small, actionable changes. The process is practical, repeatable, and aligns with his broader theme: the habits that got you to your current success might not suffice for the next level, and feedforward helps you adapt.

  **Tie the above up with this statement - While we know that history flows forward, it is difficult to realise that we envision it backward.**
  - Marshall Goldsmith’s concept of feedforward in What Got You Here Won’t Get You There aligns strikingly with the statement, “While we know that history flows forward, it is difficult to realise that we envision it backward.” Feedforward is about looking ahead to shape future behavior, yet our tendency to dwell on the past—envisioning history backward—often traps us in feedback loops that focus on what went wrong. Goldsmith’s approach counters this by urging us to let go of past judgments and instead seek proactive suggestions for improvement, embracing the forward flow of time.
  - The statement highlights how we struggle to escape a backward lens, replaying old mistakes or successes, much like the leaders Goldsmith coaches who cling to habits that no longer serve them. Feedforward breaks this cycle by asking, “What can I do better tomorrow?” rather than “What did I do wrong yesterday?” For instance, when Goldsmith advises asking colleagues for two future-focused ideas—without debating or justifying—it redirects our mental framing from a backward-looking critique to a forward-moving vision, aligning with the reality that history, and our growth, only moves ahead.
  - This connection underscores why feedforward is powerful: it frees us from the backward pull of history’s narrative, fostering a mindset where we can actively shape what’s next, unburdened by what was. If you’d like me to dig deeper into tying specific feedforward practices to this idea, just say so!
- Warren Buffett on Balance Sheets in the 2025 meeting
  It’s one thing we’ve really never talked about here, but I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. Wall Street doesn’t pay much attention to balance sheets, but I like to look at balance sheets over an 8 or 10 year period before I even look at the income account because there are certain things it’s harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet than with the income statement.
  Neither one gives you the total answer on anything, but you should understand what the figures are saying and what they don’t say and what they can’t say and what the management would like them to say that the auditors wouldn’t like them to say. You learn more from balance sheets in my view than most people give them credit for
- “Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market.”​ — Ed Seykota - How does this apply to life as well?
  Ed Seykota’s quote, “Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market,” suggests that outcomes in trading reflect participants’ deeper desires, conscious or not. In markets, people act on their beliefs, risk tolerance, and emotional drives—some chase quick gains, others seek stability, and some invite chaos. The results, whether profits or losses, align with their actions and underlying motivations.
  Applied to life, this idea implies that our choices and outcomes reveal what we truly prioritize, even if it’s not what we claim to want. For example, someone might say they want a fulfilling career but stay in a comfortable, unfulfilling job because they value security over passion. Another might pursue risky ventures, claiming to seek success, but their actions suggest they’re drawn to the thrill of uncertainty. Wins and losses in life—relationships, health, achievements—reflect the trade-offs we’re willing to make and the patterns we repeat.
  The quote invites self-reflection: Are your outcomes aligned with your stated goals, or are they showing you what you’re really chasing? Life, like the market, gives you what you “want” through the choices you make, whether you’re aware of it or not.
