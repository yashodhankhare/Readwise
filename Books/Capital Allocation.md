## Highlights
- “It is dangerous…to apply to the future inductive arguments based on past experience, unless one can distinguish the broad reasons why past experience was what it was.” – John Maynard Keynes 1 ([Location 2185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088PXLQ6X&location=2185))

- Capital Allocation was written for practitioners who wish to analyze more of the finer details of Berkshire as a company. ([Location 2187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088PXLQ6X&location=2187))

- While I researched Berkshire and some of the companies it invested in, investors during this time period also needed to take into account the opportunity cost of missing out on other options. The decisions to not invest in certain companies might have been more important than the investment decisions Berkshire did make. Other than considering interest rates during the time period, fully incorporating opportunity cost into this book was not feasible.

- Each of the former companies had histories dating back to the 1800’s, and both were major textile manufacturers in New England. The business was capital intensive. Inventories made up 41.6% of assets in 1955, while property, plant, and equipment accounted for 30.2% of the company’s assets. Receivables made up another 9.7%2. There was little in terms of liabilities to fund these assets, which meant that a large portion of the company’s equity was made up of tangible assets 3.

- In addition, the company spent $15.1 million on capital expenditures over the period. 10 This money was not spent as an investment to grow the company, but instead was money necessary simply to keep the lights on and remain in business. Sales declined throughout the period as more of shareholders’ capital was invested in the business. Management dipped into their excess cash and sold most of the marketable securities they owned in order to pay for these capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases.

- Management could return capital to shareholders either through dividends or by repurchasing its own stock. Over this time period, Berkshire did both. Dividends face a double taxation, as the business pays taxes on the income it earns annually, while the shareholder also pays taxes on the dividends received. During this time period, dividends were taxed at the individual shareholder’s income tax rate. When the company repurchases its own stock, continuing shareholders avoid the second form of tax. The company still pays a tax on its income, but wouldn’t face any additional taxes when buying back its own stock. Shareholders would just be taxed on capital gains if and when they eventually sold their stock. This means that continuing shareholders could defer taxes through the repurchase option, which is beneficial in many situations. Although book value and net working capital levels decreased over the period, the per share value of these metrics did better due to the reduction in shares outstanding. While the company’s book value decreased by 7.0% from 1959 to 1961, book value per share increased by 12.0%. Net working capital decreased by 23.3%, while net working capital per share only decreased by 7.5%. 19 ([Location 8302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088PXLQ6X&location=8302))

- Buffett could have taken the proceeds and continued to invest in undervalued stocks. Instead, he was about to learn his lesson in acquiring poor businesses that appeared undervalued statistically. By early 1966, BPL owned 552,528 shares or 54.3% of the company. 9 This stake in Berkshire was acquired at an average cost of $14.86 per share, reflecting higher prices paid by BPL in 1965. 10 Buffett was now stuck with this bad business, and would later comment that it was his worst investment decision. “As of January 21, 1966 Buffett Partnership, Ltd., a limited partnership under Nebraska law, owned approximately 54.3% of Registrant’s outstanding shares. Mr. Warren E. Buffett, a director of the Registrant, is the sole general partner of the partnership.” - 1965 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report ([Location 11361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088PXLQ6X&location=11361))

- Most business managers would have taken this capital generated from the textile business and reinvested it right back into their normal operations. Maybe they would pay out a small dividend on the side. This is mostly what Berkshire had done throughout its history. This changed once Buffett gained control of Berkshire. The company became debt free after paying off its $2.5 million debenture in 1965. 11 Also, Berkshire reported $2.9 million of marketable securities on the balance sheet in 1965 after having none the previous year. 12 The company added funds to the marketable securities portfolio in 1966, as Berkshire reported $5.4 million of marketable securities at cost on the balance sheet. 13 Berkshire also repurchased some of its own stock in 1965 14, reducing the shares outstanding from 1,137,778 15 to 1,017,547 16 .

- The annual report in 1966 provides a breakdown of how the marketable securities were invested. Bonds accounted for 88.1% of the portfolio, with the remainder in common stocks. 17 Berkshire acquired its first insurance company, National Indemnity, in 1967. Buffett could have been searching for an acquisition in the few years leading up to purchasing National Indemnity. This could potentially explain the heavy allocation to bonds during this period. The portfolio was entirely made up of common stocks in 1967 after completing the acquisition. 18 ([Location 13983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088PXLQ6X&location=13983))

- Over the next 10 years, National Indemnity prospered. Growth in premiums registered at 21.3% compounded annually, while net income compounded at a rate of 15.7%. The average return on equity was 11.2%. Float grew 21.2% compounded annually to a value of $13.4 million. Most importantly, the float was obtained with disciplined underwriting standards, as it was cost-free in 6 of the 10 years. The combined ratio ranged from a low of 91.2% in 1959 to 102.3% in 1962. A combined ratio of 100% basically means that the firm broke even from underwriting before taking into account any investment income. In 1965, for example, the combined ratio was 99.9%, with 67.4% from losses on policies, and the other 32.5% of expenses coming from overhead. 9 The majority of this overhead came from commissions and brokerage expenses paid in order to acquire business. When someone goes to a bank to borrow money, they have to pay interest on that loan. National Indemnity was able to borrow $13.4 million from policyholders in 1965 and earned a 0.1% fee for borrowing this money. Even when the cost of float reached a high of 102.3% in 1962, this still meant that National Indemnity was only paying 2.3% interest to borrow money from policyholders. With the 10 year treasury bond yielding 3.9% in 1962, this was a low-cost source of funding. 10 Basically, the U.S. Government was borrowing at a rate of almost 4% while National Indemnity was borrowing at 2% or less. The ability of some firms to get paid to borrow money has attracted the attention of many over the years, leading to tough competition in the insurance industry.

- In 1966, National Indemnity earned premiums of $16 million. The total equity under U.S. GAAP accounting was $5.6 million. 14 This means that National Indemnity wrote premiums of almost three times higher than its equity. This is referred to as operating leverage. While leverage magnifies gains in good times, it also magnifies losses. Excluding the effect of investment income, a combined ratio of 117 during a particularly bad year would wipe out over half of the company’s equity when it is leveraged by a factor of three. The company’s consistent underwriting discipline would suggest that a combined ratio of 117 was unlikely, but it still could have been possible someday down the road. While the company had no financial leverage in terms of debt, it was pretty leveraged in terms of its operations. If National Indemnity or the insurance industry experienced tough times, Berkshire could potentially use its additional capital to help the business fund the commitments it made to policyholders.
