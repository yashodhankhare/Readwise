- Man's cares and fatigues of the day become a daily disease, for which quiet sleep is the cure; and the All-wise Creator has so constructed him that his breathing lungs support him through that sleep, like a perfect machine, regulating the digestion of the stomach and the circulation of the blood, and carrying repose and rest to the utmost extremity of every limb; and for the protection and healthy working of this machine through the hours of repose, He has formed him with nostrils intended for measuring and tempering the air that feeds this moving principle and fountain of life; and in proportion as the quieting and restoring influence of the lungs in natural repose, is carried to every limb and every organ, so in unnatural and abused repose, do they send their complaints to the extremities of the system, in various diseases; and… ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=206))

- and sleeping; and the abuse of either is sure to interfere with the other. For the first of these there needs a lifetime of teaching and practice; but for the enjoyment of the latter, man needs no teaching, provided the regulations of the All-wise Maker and Teacher can have their way, and are not contravened by pernicious habits or erroneous teaching. If man's unconscious existence for nearly one-third of the hours of his breathing life depends from one moment to another, upon the air that passes through his nostrils; and his repose during those hours, and his bodily health and enjoyment between them, depend upon the soothed and tempered character of the currents that are passed through his nose to his lungs, how mysteriously intricate in its construction and important in its functions is that feature, and how disastrous may be the omission in education which sanctions a departure from the full and natural use of this wise arrangement % When I have seen a poor Indian woman in the wilderness, lowering her infant from the breast, and pressing its lips together as it falls asleep in its cradle in the open air, and afterwards looked into the Indian multitude for the results of such a practice, I have said to myself, "glorious education! such a Mother deserves to be the nurse of Emperors." And when I have seen the careful, tender mothers in civilized life, covering the faces of their infants sleeping in overheated rooms, with their little mouths open and gasping for breath; and afterwards looked into the multitude, I have been struck with the evident evil and lasting results of this incipient stage of education; and have been more forcibly struck, and shocked, when I have looked into the Bills of Mortality, which I believe to be so frightfully swelled by the results of… ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=215))

- latitudes and different climates; and, in sudden changes of temperature, even in his own house. The physical conformation of man alone affords sufficient proof that this is a habit against instinct, and that he was made, like the other animals, to sleep with his mouth shut—supplying the lungs with vital air through the nostrils, the natural channels; and a strong corroboration of this fact is to be met with amongst the North American Indians, who strictly adhere to Nature's law in this respect, and show the beneficial results in their fine and manly forms, and exemption from mental and physical diseases, as has been stated. The Savage infant, like the offspring of the brute, breathing the natural and wholesome air, generally from instinct, closes its mouth during its sleep; and in all cases of exception the mother rigidly (and cruelly, if necessary) enforces Nature's Law in the manner explained, until the habit is fixed for life, of the importance of which she seems to be perfectly well aware. But when we turn to civilized life, with all its comforts, its luxuries, its science, and its Medical skill, our pity is enlisted for the tender germs of humanity, brought forth and caressed in smothered atmospheres which they can only breathe with their mouths wide open, and nurtured with too much thoughtlessness to prevent their contracting a habit which is to shorten their days with the croup in infancy, or to turn their brains to Idiocy or Lunacy, and their spines to curvatures—or in manhood, their sleep to fatigue and the nightmare, and their lungs and their lives to premature decay.* If the habit of sleeping with the mouth open is so destructive to the human constitution, and is caused by sleeping in confined and overheated air, and this under the imprudent sanction of mothers, they become the primary causes of the misery of their own offspring; and… ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=233))

- When we observe amongst very aged persons that they almost uniformly close the mouth firmly, we are regarding the results of a long practised and healthy habit, and the surviving few who have thereby escaped the fatal consequences of the evil practice I am condemning. Though the majority of civilized people are more or less addicted to the habit I am speaking of, comparatively few will admit that they are subject to it. They go to sleep and awake, with their mouths shut, not knowing that the insidious enemy, like the deadly Vampire that imperceptibly sucks the blood, gently steals upon them in their sleep and does its work of death whilst they are unconscious of the evil.

- Few people can be convinced that they snore in their sleep, for the snoring is stopped when they awake; and so with breathing through the mouth, which is generally the cause of snoring— the moment that consciousness arrives the mouth is closed, and Nature resumes her usual course. In natural and refreshing sleep, man breathes but little air; his pulse is low; and in the moil perfect state of repose he almost.ceases to exist. This is necessary, and most wisely ordered, that his lungs, as well as his limbs, may rest from the labour and excitements of the day. Too much sleep is often said to be destructive to health; but very few persons will sleep too much for their health, provided they sleep in the right way. Unnatural sleep, which is irritating to the lungs and the nervous system, fails to afford that rest which sleep was intended to give, and the longer one lies in it, the less will be the enjoyment and length of his life. Any one waking in the morning at his usual hour of rising, and finding by the dryness of his mouth, that he has been sleeping with the mouth open, feels fatigued, and a wish to go to sleep again; and, convinced ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=265))

- It requires no more than common sense to perceive that Mankind, like all the Brute creations, should close their mouths when they close their eyes in sleep, and breathe through their nostrils, which were evidently made for that purpose, instead of dropping the under jaw and drawing an over draught of cold air directly on the lungs, through the mouth; and that in the middle of the night, when the fires have gone down and the air is at its coldest temperature—the system at rest, and the lungs the least able to withstand the shock.

- I refer to the "Respirators," so extensively in use, and as generally "in fashion," amongst the Fair Sex. For persons very weak in the lungs, and who have contracted the habit so strong and so long that they cannot breathe excepting through the open mouth, this appliance may be beneficial, in the open air; but thousands of others, to be eccentric or fashionable, place it over their mouths when they step into the street; and to make any use of it, must open their mouths and breathe through it, by which indiscretion they are thought- The mouth of man, as well as that of the brutes, was made for the ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=312))

- reception and mastication of food for the stomach, and other purposes; but the nostrils, with their delicate and fibrous linings for purifying and warming the air in its passage, have been mysteriously constructed, and designed to stand guard over the lungs—to measure the air and equalize its draughts, during the hours of repose. The atmosphere is nowhere pure enough for man's breathing until it has passed this mysterious refining process; and therefore the imprudence and danger of admitting it in an unnatural way, in double quantities, upon the lungs, and charged with the surrounding epidemic or contagious infections of the moment. The impurities of the air which are arrested by the intricate organizations and mucus in the nose are thrown out again from its interior barriers by the returning breath; and the tingling excitements of the few which pass them, cause the muscular involution of sneezing, by which they are violently and success fully resisted. The air which enters the lungs is as different from that which enters the nostrils as distilled ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=316))

The arresting and purifying process of the nose, upon the atmosphere with its poisonous ingredients, passing through it, though less perceptible, is not less distinct, nor less important than that of the mouth, lefty contracting the most dangerous habit which they can subject themselves to, and oftentimes catching their death in a few days, or in a few hours; little aware that closed lips are the best protection against cold air, and their nostrils the best and safest of all Respirators. which stops cherry-stones and from entering the stomach. This intricate organization in the structure of man, unaccountable as it is, seems in a measure divested of mystery, when we find the same phenomena (and others perhaps even more surprising) in the physical conformation of the lower order of animals; and we are again more astonished when we see the mysterious sensitiveness of that organ instinctively and instantaneously separating the gases, as well as ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=325))

Infinitesimal insects also, not visible to the naked eye, are inhabiting every drop of water we drink and every breath of air we breathe; and minute particles of vegetable substances, as well as of poisonous minerals, and even glass and which float imperceptibly in the air, are discovered coating the respiratory organs of man; and the class of birds which catch their food in the air with open mouths as they fly, receive these things in quantities, even in the hollow of their bones, where they are carried and lodged by the currents of air, and detected by microscopic investigation. Against the approach of these things to the lungs and to the eye, Nature has prepared the guard by the mucous and organic arrangements, calculated to arrest their progress. Were it not for the liquid in the eye, arresting, neutralizing, and carrying out the particles of dust communicated through the atmosphere, Man would soon become blind; and but for the mucus in his nostrils, absorbing and carrying off the poisonous particles and effluvia for- the protection of the ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=342))

- lungs and the brain, mental derangement, consumption of the lungs, and death would ensue. How easy, and how reasonable, it is to suppose then, that the inhalation of such things to the lungs through the expanded mouth and throat may be a cause of consumption and other fatal diseases attaching to the respiratory organs; and how fair a supposition also, that the deaths from the dreadful Epidemics, such as Cholera, Yellow Fever, and other pestilences, are caused by the inhalation of animalcules in the infected districts; and that the victims to those diseases are those portions of society who inhale the greatest quantities of those poisonous insects to the lungs and to the stomach. In man's waking hours, when his limbs, and muscles, and his mind, are all in action, there may be but little harm in inhaling through the mouth, if he be in a healthy atmosphere; and at moments of violent action and excitement, it may be necessary. But when he lies down at night to rest from the fatigues of the day, and yields his system and all his energies to the repose of sleep ; and his volition and all his powers of resistance are giving way to its quieting influence, if he gradually opens his mouth to its widest strain, he lets the enemy in that chills his lungs—that racks his brain—that paralyses his stomach—that gives him the nightmare—brings him Imps and Fairies that dance before him during the night; and during the following day, headache—toothache—rheumatism—dyspepsia, and the gout. That man knows not the pleasure of sleep; he rises in the morning more fatigued than when he retired to rest—takes pills and remedies through the day, and renews his disease every night. A guilty conscience is even a better guarantee for peaceful rest than such a treatment of the lungs during the hours of sleep. Destructive irritation of the nervous system and inflammation of the lungs, with their consequences, are the immediate results of this unnatural habit; and its continued and more remote effects, consumption of the lungs and death. Besides this frequent and most fatal of all diseases, Bronchitis, Kinsey, Croup, Asthma, and other diseases of the respiratory organs, as well as Dyspepsia, gout of the stomach, Rickets, Diarrhea, diseases of the liver, the heart, the spine, ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=352))

- and the whole of the nervous system, from the brain to the toes, may chiefly be attributed to this deadly and unnatural habit; and any Physician can easily explain the manner in which these various parts of the system are thus affected by the derangement of the natural functions of the machine that gives them life and motion. All persons going to sleep should think, not of their business, not of their riches or poverty, their pains or their pleasures, but, of what are of infinitely greater importance to them, their lungs; their best friends, that have kept them alive through the day, and from whose quiet and peaceful repose they are to look for happiness and strength during the toils of the following day. They should first recollect that their natural food is fresh air; and next, that the channels prepared for the supply of that food are the nostrils, which are supplied with the means of purifying the food for the lungs, as the mouth is constructed to select and masticate the food for the stomach. The lungs should be put to rest as a fond Mother lulls her infant to sleep; they should be supplied with vital air, and protected in the natural use of it; and for such care, each successive day would repay in increased pleasures and enjoyments. The lungs and the stomach are too near neighbours not to be mutually affected by abuses offered to the one or the other; they both have their natural food, and the natural and appropriate means prepared by which it is… ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=370))

Man can exist several days without food, and but about as many minutes, without the action of his lungs.

- Nature produces no diseases, nor deformities; but the offspring of men and women whose systems are impaired by the habits which have been alluded to, are no doubt oftentimes ushered into the world with constitutional weaknesses and predilections for contracting the same habits, with their results; and it is safe to say, that three-fourths of the generating portions of every civilized community existing, are more or less under these disqualifications, which, together with want of proper care of their offspring, in infancy and childhood, I believe to be the cause of four-fifths of the mental and physical deformities, loss of teeth, and premature deaths, between conception and infancy, childhood, manhood, and old age. I have said that no diseases are natural, and deformities, mental and physical, are neither hereditary nor natural, but purely the results of ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=449))

What a sad bill to bring against the glorious advantages of civilized life, its improvements, its comforts and refinements, that in England there are something like 35,000 Idiots and Lunatics— 17,000 Deaf and Dumb, and 15,000 hunch-backs, and about an equal proportion of these mental and physical deformities in the other civilized nations of the Earth! Nature makes nothing without design; and who dares to say that she has designed these lists of pitiable existence amongst the civilized Races of Man, and that the more perfect work of her hand has been bestowed upon the Savage (and even the Brute) creations? And next to Nature, our dear Mothers, under whose kind care and tender handling we have been raised, could subject us to no accident'to turn the brain or crook the spine; but easily and thoughtlessly might, even in their over anxiety for our health, subject us to early treatment, engendering habits which would gradually and imperceptibly produce the ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=455))

The teeth of Man, as with the Brutes, are wisely constructed to answer their intended purposes through the natural term of life, and would so, no doubt, but from abuses, the principal one of which I consider to be the pernicious habit already explained. The saliva exuding from the gums, designed as the Element of the teeth, floods every part of the mouth while it is shut; continually rising, like a pure fountain, from the gums, at the roots of and between the teeth; loosening and carrying off the extraneous matter which would otherwise accumulate, communicating disease to the teeth, and taint to the breath. By nature, the teeth and the eyes are strictly amphibious; both… ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=463))

It is the suppression of saliva, with dryness of the mouth, and an unnatural current of cold air across the teeth and gums during the hours of sleep, that produces malformation of the teeth, toothache, and tic-douloureux, with premature decay, and loss of teeth so lamentably prevalent in the civilized world. Amongst the Brute creations, that never open their mouths except for taking their food and drink, their teeth are protected from the air both day and night, and seldom decay; but with Man, who is a talking and laughing animal, exposing his teeth to the air a great portion of the day, and oftentimes during the whole of the night, the results are widely different—he is oftentimes toothless at middle age, and in seven cases in ten, in his grave before he is fifty.

Amongst the Native Races they seem to have a knowledge of these facts; and the poor Indian woman who watches her infant and presses its lips together as it sleeps in its cradle attracts the ridicule perhaps, or pity, of the passer-by, but secures the habit in her progeny which enables them to command the admiration and envy of the world.

An Indian Warrior sleeps, and hunts, and smiles, with his mouth shut; and with seeming reluctance, opens it even to eat or to speak. An Indian child is not allowed to sleep with its mouth open, from the very first sleep of its existence; the consequence of which is, that while the teeth are forming and making their first appearance, they meet (and constantly feel) each other; and taking their relative, natural positions, form that healthful and pleasing regularity which has secured to the American Indians, as a Race, perhaps the most manly and beautiful mouths in the World.* * When I speak of comparative personal appearance or of the habits of a people, I speak of them collectively, and in the aggregate.

- constituents of manly beauty are much more general amongst the Savage Races; and their Societies, free from the humbled and dependent misery which comparative poverty produces in Civilized Communities, produce none of those striking contrasts which stare us in the face, and excite our disgust and our sympathies, at nearly every step we take. The American Savages are all poor, their highest want is that of food, which is generally within their reach; their faces are therefore not wrinkled and furrowed with the stamp of care and distress, which extreme poverty begets—the repulsive marks which avarice engraves, nor with the loathsome and disgusting expressions which the prodigal dissipations of Wealth often engender in Civilized Societies. Their tastes and their passions are less refined and less ardent, and more seldom exerted, and consequently less abused; they live on the simples of life, and imagine and desire only in proportion; the consequences of which are, that their faces exhibit slighter inroads upon Nature, and consequently a greater average of good looks than an equal community of any civilized people.

(3,660 per annum in England alone, under one year of age, as has been shown.) Amongst the Savage Races, we have seen that death seldom, if ever, ensues from this cause; and how easy it is to perceive that unnatural pains, and even death, may be caused by the habit of infants sleeping with their mouths strained open, and exposed to the cold air, when the germs of the teeth are first making their appearance. The Statistics of England show an annual return of " 25,000 infants, and children under five years of age, that die of convulsions." What causes so probable for those convulsions as teething and the croup; and what more probable cause for the unnatural pains of teething and the croup, than the infernal habit which I am condemning. At this tender age, and under the kind treatment just mentioned, is thoughtlessly laid the foundation for the rich harvests which the Dentists are reaping in most parts of the civilized world.

- All Savage infants amongst the various native Tribes of America, are reared in cribs (or cradles) with the back lashed to a straight board; and by the aid of a circular, concave cushion placed under the head, the head is bowed a little forward when they sleep, which prevents the mouth from falling open; thus establishing the early habit of breathing through the nostrils. The results of this habit are, that Indian adults invariably walk erect and straight, have healthy spines, and sleep upon their backs, with their Robes wrapped around them; with the head supported by some rest, which inclines it a little forward, or upon their faces, with the forehead ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=599))

Lying on the back is thought by many to be an unhealthy practice; and a long habit of sleeping in a different position may even make it so; but the general custom of the Savage races, of sleeping in this position from infancy to old age, affords very conclusive proof, that if commenced in early life, it is the healthiest for a general posture, that can be adopted. It is very evident that the back of the head should never be allowed, in sleep, to fall to a level with the spine; but should be supported by a small pillow, to elevate it a little, without raising ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F2M2LFX&location=603))
