- Buying Treasuries because it was believed we were on the cusp of a major recession and buying gold because runaway inflation was expected in a highly overheated economy were diametrically opposite investor reactions to the same market events. It was like betting heavily on a horse to both win and come in trailing the pack in a major race. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=123))

- One thing, though, is certain: the times are very different today from a little over a decade ago. All the investment standards we were comfortable with for many years appear to have fallen by the wayside. Many of today’s financial teachings are actually toxic to your portfolio. For many generations, investors kept their money in bonds and believed they were investing prudently. Doing so today would bring about disaster. Treasury bills, supposedly the safest investment there is, have cost investors 77 percent of their purchasing power since 1946.

- The error at the heart of EMH, we will see, is that it simply does not recognize that psychology plays a part in your investment decisions. The efficient-market theorists—and most economists—do not believe that psychology, with its “softening” of human rationality, should be allowed a role in investment or economic decision making. Instead, it seems, they have plastered the lipstick of complex mathematics onto an academically abstract piggy to sell a lot of theoretical bacon.

- Appreciating the fundamental flaws in the investment strategies based on EMH will demand that we take a close look at one of the major sources of investment errors—the person you see in the mirror every morning. What psychology has to tell us about our investing behavior as individuals and within groups is, I think you will come to agree, both eye-opening and surprisingly useful in crafting an optimal investing strategy. Introducing a set of powerful psychological insights that help explain why investors so often make incorrect decisions and why the market is subject to so many booms and busts, it will provide ways to help us reject the siren call of many failed methods that are ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=174))

- I believe that it is vital that we never underestimate the role psychology plays in the market. It can be our best friend if we follow the proven contrarian strategies that protect us so well against psychological traps. It can also be our worst enemy if we try to outguess the traps, for example, saying something like, “Okay, this market will blow, but I’ll just stay in a teeny bit longer” or “Heck, I’ve got my ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=263))

- “Why Bother with Bubbles and Panics?” That’s what Fred Hills, an outstanding former editor at Simon & Schuster, asked me in 1997, when I submitted my last manuscript to him. “Even my twelve-year-old daughter knows about bubbles and panics,” he continued. Fred was dead-on. I’m sure that virtually every reader knows about manias and crashes. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=329))

- We all know that it’s very hard to pinpoint exactly when dangerous financial overheating will blow up the financial structure. We realize that stocks can become enormously overvalued, but still, most people don’t fold their cards and walk away with their mounting piles of chips. We just can’t seem to get the timing right. This situation has not been helped by the prevailing wisdom touted by economists. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=351))

- than Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and the “prophet” of prosperity, concurs with this economic thinking: “It was very difficult to definitively identify a bubble until after the fact—that is, when its bursting confirmed its existence.”2 There is widespread agreement by economic scholars with his statement. But even worse, the popular theory states that bubbles are rational. In short, absurd pricing is always justified by the actions of totally rational, nonemotional investors, who keep prices exactly where they should be. As we’ll see, this is an easy out. But it certainly protects the Fed’s and academics’ reputations. To accept it means that we are not capable of ever valuing anything accurately.

- Some Common Characteristics of Manias As we noted earlier, one of the most remarkable characteristics of speculative manias is their similarity from period to period, even if hundreds of years apart.

- In every bubble, the experts have also been caught up in the speculation, not only condoning the rising prices but predicting much higher ones in the future. After all, in each case people thought they had good reason to believe that the opportunity this time was really far better than any other they had ever seen.

- common to all manias is the “Greater Fool Theory.” In each mania some independent and skeptical thinkers were not overwhelmed by the euphoria of the time. They believed prices should never have reached the preposterous levels they had, that the crowd was really mad. But they thought things would get madder still; if prices had gone up tenfold and enthusiasm was soaring, why couldn’t they go up fifteen- or twentyfold? Thus wrote a British member of Parliament in 1720 after being bankrupted by the South Sea Bubble: “I said, indeed, that ruin must soon come upon us, but I own it came two months sooner than I expected.”3 In each mania excessively risky actions were justified as prudent.

A month before they crashed, he said I did not understand the enormous potential of dot-com stocks. Fortunately for me, Jim’s thinking about the bubble, not mine, turned out to be Stone Age that time round. In every bubble, once the crowd begins to realize how wildly overpriced the stocks it rushed into are, there is a scramble to escape. A horrific panic ensues as the image changes from euphoria to doom. Rumors always play a major role, at first of fortunes being made and of good things to come and then later of prophecies of doom.

- Have Bubbles Changed over Time? I’m going to try to make a strong case that they haven’t. If anything, bubbles have become much more frequent since the 1960s, the price swings more violent, and the damage to the financial system and economies, both in the United States and globally, significantly greater.

Technology stocks have had a special allure. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=438))

- Contemporary Crashes More Severe So there are remarkable similarities in market bubbles, but there is also one important difference in the most recent booms and busts. Holland, France, and England were still prosperous after their bubbles imploded. Many speculators lost their homes, their businesses, precious metals, and other valuable assets, but the countries’ economies remained strong and continued to grow stronger as the years passed. The bubbles from the 1960s to the early 1990s, although high for any period, also did little longer-term damage to the economy; the nation continued to prosper and grow. However, the last two bubbles in Table 1-2 are a very different species. Not only have more recent bubbles occurred much more frequently; they have also caused more damage. The dot-com bubble and crash of 1996–2002 is estimated to have cost investors $7 trillion and forced millions of people of ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=451))

The enormous loss of wealth was also due to keeping interest rates far too low for much too long under first Chairman Greenspan and then Ben Bernanke, his successor at the Fed. This disastrous policy was instrumental in setting up the recent financial crisis, which is estimated to have caused losses of $25 trillion to $30 trillion in security values alone. Added to the cost were lost GDP, lost employment, and other major charges that brought the total loss much higher. We can also see that losses in contemporary manias are as high as and sometimes considerably higher than in those in centuries past.

Dozens of other dot-com stocks appreciated several thousand percent. And all of this happened despite the fact that investors were the best educated in history. They commanded powerful state-of-the-art computers and instant communication and had up-to-the-nanosecond data at their fingertips, as well as the finest research money could buy.

- have grown over 170 years. One of the first steps of scientific method is accurate observation. This is as true in psychology as it is in chemistry, medicine, or other scientific fields. As far back as the 1840s, the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay used his astute powers of observation to develop the antecedents of behavioral finance. He wrote a remarkable book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, first published in 1841 and still in print. Mackay examined the three historic bubbles we have discussed—the Dutch Tulip Mania (1630s), the English South Sea Bubble (1720), and the French Mississippi Bubble (1720)—as well as other instances of crowd madness from alchemy to the burning of suspected witches and sorcerers at the stake.

Men, it has been well said, think in herds . . . go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.”4 The characteristic he observed repeatedly was that when the enormous surge of speculative enthusiasm ends and the bubble begins to implode, the crowd… ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=479))

- oblivious to fundamental value, just as they were when no price was too high to pay.5 Mackay captured the flavor of mania and panic as well as any writer to this day. Picking up from Mackay, Gustave Le Bon wrote The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, published in English in 1896. Le Bon was a French social psychologist, sociologist, and amateur physicist. His book brilliantly caught the actions and moods of the crowd that Mackay had described. Le Bon wrote, “The sentiments and ideas of all the persons in the gathering take one and the same direction. . . .

Crowds being only capable of thinking in images are only able to be impressed by images.”7 To a crowd, few images are more seductive than the promise of instant wealth.

- A Glimpse at the New Psychology The psychological studies that explain a good part of these consistent and predictable behavioral errors began in the 1970s. That work eventually earned two of the leaders in the field, Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith, the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. Even more cutting-edge research began coming out after I published Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation in 1998. The new research provides major findings in both cognitive psychology and neuroeconomics that explain why bubbles are so powerful and repeat themselves so frequently, as well as why contrarian strategies have worked so well over time and should continue to outperform other approaches in the years ahead. Just as psychiatrists have learned much about the functioning of the human mind through the study of disturbed patients,… ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=500))

Still, none of the psychological research could answer the question of how price movements can be so extreme or how euphoria can turn to panic in almost the blink of an eye.

- The most important discovery is that of Affect, or the Affect heuristic, as it is sometimes called, which has only recently been recognized as an important component of our judgment and decision making.*3 What the Affect findings have shown is that our strong likes, dislikes, and opinions, experienced as feelings such as happiness, sadness, excitement, and fear, can, either consciously or unconsciously, heavily influence our decision-making ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=535))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Affect can work either on its own or in tandem with our rational decision-making processes within or outside markets. Affect is emotional, not cognitive, so it responds rapidly and automatically. The response, being emotional, need not be rational, and often isn’t. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=539))

- We all know that we often develop very intense likes or dislikes that probably taint our judgment. And I’m sure you’ve found that if someone has a strong political or religious view, it is very hard, if not impossible, to change his or her thinking, no matter how powerful the argument you think you have presented. There is evidence that any such arguments will in fact actually only bolster your interlocutor’s view. He may, for example, categorize your argument as a stereotypical response. Similarly, the more we like an investment choice, the stronger the positive Affect we have for it; and the more we dislike a stock or industry, the more negative the Affect it produces on us. And as in the ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=548))

- Affect can be such a powerful emotional pressure that it can insidiously override our training and experience in the marketplace, and, as we’ll soon see, it goes a long way toward explaining extreme stock mispricing. Images and associations are pulled into the conscious mind from past, current, and hoped-for experiences. And the more intensive our positive or negative feelings are, whether about ideas, groups of people, stocks, industries, or markets, the more intensely Affect influences our decisions on them. Affect may also have an ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=563))

- influence on eyewitnesses to an accident or a crime. They are often poor witnesses, and find it difficult to reconstruct events, as they are focused on one emotional detail or another. The Affect system, anchored in emotions, can at times be far from completely rational. Although analysis is critical to many decision-making circumstances, reliance on Affect and emotions is a quicker, easier, and more efficient way to navigate in a complex, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous world. In periods of great anxiety and uncertainty, it is quite natural for the experiential system, often dominated by Affect, to take over. A key reason is that Affect often has the power to overwhelm our analytical, rational-analytic memory banks, substituting its independent memory bank of related events and their emotional accompaniments. Easy to use, yes, but sometimes extremely dangerous. Every bubble we looked at in the previous chapter, as we shall see, had Affect at its base. You may already have guessed that Affect can also be a powerful subliminal force likely to sway an investor’s judgment when information is sizable but still incomplete or conflicting and yet a decision must be made. In a strong market investors are often mesmerized by the major gains already made and mouthwatering images of even larger gains ahead. The experiential system easily subdues the more cautious images of the rational-analytic system. In the inevitable panic that follows a bubble, the Affect images change dramatically. We no longer think of enormous gains to be made by holding stellar investments. Now we are forcibly introduced to negative Affect. The Affect system flashes out images of crushing losses ahead. The more the stock falls, the more powerful the negative Affect ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=567))

- Affect can cause behavior to move many standard deviations away from the norm. Affect can also act very subtly. For example, you think Merck looks good and pharmaceutical stocks are depressed, but there is more information you want to go through. However, you don’t have the time to get all the data you need because the stock is moving up. You fall back on Affect, often without knowing it, because it’s in sympathy with your gut feeling and reinforces your willingness to make the decision to buy. Reliance on Affect can mislead us, sometimes very badly. If it were always optimal to follow our affective instincts, there would be no need for the rational-analytic system of thinking to have evolved and become so prominent in human affairs.5 It’s time to move on to some of the deadly shortfalls that Affect ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=586))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- bequeaths to markets. The experiential system, provided with psychological rocket fuel from Affect, enhances the powerful images of gains. Affect is potentially more helpful or more dangerous because of its emotional rather than cognitive basis. Next we’ll look at four important forms of Affect, all of which have bloodied investors’ portfolios over time: (1) insensitivity to probability, (2) negatively correlated judgments of risk and benefit, (3) the Durability Bias, and (4) Temporal Construal.

- These findings go to the heart of the overvaluation in a bubble. If we have very strong feelings about the prospects of a stock or another investment, we will sometimes pay 100 times its real value or more.

- EMH argues that the greater the risk taken, the higher the perceived rewards of an investment will be. Affect theory discovered that it doesn’t quite work this way. Professors Baruch Fischhoff, Paul Slovic, Sarah Lichtenstein, Stephen Read, and Barbara Coombs10 found that the judgments of risk and rewards are negatively correlated. That is, the greater the actual risk, the smaller the perceived gain, while the smaller the perceived risk, the greater the perceived gain. In a word, modern risk theory is turned upside down.

- many potentially dangerous or hazardous situations the greater the perceived benefit or reward, the lower the perceived risk. In virtually every case the risk is there but is perceived differently depending on the magnitude of the benefits. Conversely, the lower the perceived reward or benefit, the greater the perceived risk. Researchers, for example, have found that alcoholic beverages and food additives are believed to be low in benefit and high in risk, whereas vaccines, antibiotics, and X-rays tend to be seen as high in benefit and low in risk. In the investment world higher risk is believed to have a close correlation to higher return. This psychological behavior also simply cannot exist according to current investment teachings… ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=687))

- of risk and benefit.*5 12 The behavioral researchers state that a negative correlation between risk and reward occurs even when the nature of gains or benefits is distinct and qualitatively different from the nature of the risks. What is difficult for investors to understand is that psychologically risk and return appear to often be negatively correlated. In markets we believe that rationally they have to be positively correlated. A research paper by Ali Alhakami and Paul Slovic13 indicates that the perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity (e.g., using pesticides) were linked to the positive or negative Affect associated with the activity. The result implies that the more strongly people like an activity, such as the use of an untested treatment for cancer or the… ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=694))

- beverages, or buying stocks with so-so returns, the higher the risk levels they attribute to these. According to Alhakami and Slovic, this result implies that people base their judgments of the risk and benefits of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it. If they have an idea or concept they strongly like, they are moved to judge that the risk is low. The more they dislike an idea or concept, the higher they judge the risk. So Affect again enters into the picture, this time allowing our feelings to tamper with and alter our rational decision making and choices on risk. In the realm of finance, Yoav Ganzach14 found support for concluding that if stocks were perceived as good, they were judged to have higher returns and low risk, whereas if they… ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=702))

- Another way that Affect tends to skew our assessments in the market arises because we tend to overestimate how long a positive or negative event or earnings surprise will have an impact on a stock and industry or the entire market itself. Professors D. T. Gilbert, E. C. Pinel, T. D. Wilson, S. J. Blumberg, and T. P. Wheatley observed a consistent tendency of market participants to overestimate the length of time a positive or negative Affect would last after experiencing a pleasant or unpleasant event.15 This effect is called the “Durability Bias.” The finding is important in gauging the overreaction to either a positive or a negative earnings surprise as well as a host of other market positive or negative events. To take one example, oil exploration and development companies plummeted sharply in the spring of 2010, after the BP rig blew up and a major oil spill ensued in the Gulf of Mexico. The prevailing feeling at the time was that no deep drilling would be allowed again in the gulf or other continental waters around the United States for years. Too, the cleanup costs were at the time thought to be prohibitive for both BP and its partners. Within a year, deepwater drilling was allowed again off U.S. shores, and the costs, though high, were manageable by all the firms involved.

Short-term events will include sales and earnings that are higher or lower than expected, and many other expectations that analysts report.16 Meanwhile, the farther an event occurs in the future, the more probable returns are likely to be represented in terms of a few abstract or general features that contain the perceived essence of the concept of the stock under consideration. This phenomenon is called “Temporal Construal.” This Affect characteristic causes investors to extend their views of the prospects of stocks both in and out of favor far into the future.

In the second case, investors generally extend expectations for concept companies’ positive results as they expand their markets rapidly too far into the future.

- Another interesting instance of Temporal Construal can be observed in studies that asked investors to estimate the future performance of their stock portfolios during the 1996–2000 bubble. In 1998, near the height of the bubble, U.S. investors were extremely optimistic about the future returns of stocks. Late that year Paul Slovic, Stephen Johnson, Donald MacGregor, and I were coauthors of a study to pinpoint the expectations of a large number of mutual fund investors for the next ten years. According to our study,17 when subjects were asked to forecast their average return over the next ten years, investors were highly optimistic, estimating 14 percent annually on average. Stocks have in fact returned about 10 percent over time since the 1920s, so those enthusiastic investors appeared to be anticipating market returns in the decade ahead some 40 percent above those of the past seventy years.

As we just saw, analysts often missed the proper valuations of Internet and high-tech stocks by fifty- to 100-fold as evidenced repeatedly in the dot-com bubble and other tech bubbles since the early 1960s.

Unfortunately, the very people we depend on most to guide us to safety when a market storm appears are the first to be swept away when the terrible weather hits.

They seem to be hardwired into our minds and are thus rather undetectable under ordinary circumstances. Most of us are entirely unaware of them, especially in the heat of action.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, being an “intuitive statistician” has limitations as well as advantages. The simplifying processes that are normally efficient time-savers also lead to systematic mistakes in decision making. Despite what many economists and financial theorists assume, people are not really good intuitive statisticians, and as a result, heuristics are consistently shortchanging investors, even professionals. If I had to pinpoint the one primary error that heuristics cause investors to make, it would be this: they do not calculate odds properly when making investment decisions. The distortions produced by our heuristic calculations are often large and systematic, leading even the savviest investors into blunders of considerable magnitude. In addition, these cognitive biases are locked more firmly into place by group pressures.5 Our own biases are reinforced by the powerful influence of experts and peer groups we respect, and the pressure for us to follow becomes more compelling.

So it will take a good deal of concentration and effort on your part to avoid these pitfalls. Doing so begins with becoming familiar with these heuristics. Once their nature is understood, a set of rules can be developed to help monitor your decisions and provide a shield against serious mishaps—perhaps even profit from them instead. But as you’ll see, it’s much easier said than done, even after people have been made fully aware of them. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=915))

- availability heuristic. According to Tversky and Kahneman, it causes us to “assess the frequency of a class or the probability of an event by the ease with which instances or occurrences can be brought to mind.”6 This is why we think deaths by shark attack are more common than deaths from pieces of airplanes falling on people.

- The shortcut answers we get this way are accurate most of the time because our minds normally recall most readily events that have occurred frequently. But they can sometimes be strikingly off the mark. We think something is more likely because the prospect is more available in our minds when an event had an especially important meaning—in other words, it had a big impact on our thinking—and had occurred recently.7 There are two psychological errors involved here. The first of these errors is referred to in the literature as “saliency” and the second as “recency.” Saliency leads people to recall distinctly “good” events (or “bad” events) disproportionally to ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=923))

Still, over the ten years ending in 2003, despite its hot hand when dot-com stocks were flying, the Janus Fund averaged only an 8.7 percent return, which meant it underperformed the market by 22 percent over the entire time frame, including both the dot-com bubble and the crash afterward. Even this grim statistic doesn’t do justice to the damage wrought by Janus.

Another good example of the major overreaction this heuristic bias causes is the almost blind faith investors place in Federal Reserve or government economic releases on employment, industrial production, the health of the banking system, the consumer price index, inventories, and dozens of similar statistics. These reports frequently trigger major stock and bond market reactions, particularly if the news is bad. For example, if unemployment rises one-tenth of 1 percent in a month when it was expected to be unchanged or if industrial production falls slightly more than the experts expected, stock prices can fall, at times sharply. Should this happen? No. “Flash” statistics, more times than not, are nearly worthless. They are the archetypal case of mistaken decision making due to the law of small numbers.

They had been taught that for a specific situation, the more unreliable the available sketch, the more one should rely on previously established information—that, to use the language of cognitive psychology, the “case rate” (the profile of subject Tom W.) should not have been conflated with the “base rate” (the known percentage of graduate students enrolled in each field).

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The Biases Caused by Information Overload In 1959, the polymath Herbert Simon, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, was one of the first academics to rigorously look at information overload. In the simplest formulation, what Simon established was that not only does more information not necessarily bring about better decisions; it can lead to poorer ones. This is because humans cannot process large amounts of information effectively. In Simon’s words, “Every human organism lives in an environment that generates millions of bits of new information each second, but the bottleneck of the perceptual apparatus certainly does not admit more than 1,000 bits per second, and possibly much less. We react consciously to only a minute portion of the information that is thrown at us.” ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1275))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- And we are biased in the way we do this. Professor Simon notes that this filtering process is not a passive activity “but an active process involving attention to a very small part of the whole and exclusion, from the outset, of almost all that is not within the scope of attention.”36 The key to the bias, he observed, is that when people are bombarded with information they see only the part they are interested in and screen out the rest. More recent research has backed up this finding, including work by Professors Baba Shiv and Alexander Fedorikhin in 1999,37 as well as Professor Nelson Cowan in a research paper in 2000.38 In the context of the stock market (and other trading markets), who suffers most from information overload? It’s hard to give the nod to either the professional or the individual investor. The sheer volume of information is nearly unfathomable.

- outputs should be closely correlated. Companies with strong sales growth (the inputs) should be accompanied by rising earnings and profit margins over time (the outputs). We believe that consistent inputs supply greater predictability than inconsistent ones do. Tests, for example, show that people are far more confident that a student is likely to have a B average in the future if he has two Bs rather than an A and a C, although the belief is not statistically valid.39 To translate this into stock market terms, investors have more confidence in a company that has 10 percent earnings growth that rises consistently year after year than they do in one that has 15 percent growth over the same period but is more volatile, i.e., 18 percent in year 1, 3 percent in year 2, 15 percent in year 3, and so on.

Contrarian stocks have outperformed the market for many decades, but that doesn’t mean they can’t underperform for one year or even a few years—remember the lessons we learned about regression to the mean a couple of sections back. Yet investors too often demand immediate, though incorrect, feedback and can make serious mistakes as a consequence.

- Bachelier’s work lay dormant for decades until it was rediscovered in 1960. During the 1960s, other researchers started to study stock price movements. One early study showed that randomly chosen series of numbers, when plotted closely together, looked like charts of stock price fluctuations over time.4 Another study found that stock price movements were remarkably similar to the random movements of minute solid particles, termed “Brownian motion” in physics, after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who first observed the phenomenon in 1827.5 In the first half of the 1960s, evidence of the random fluctuations of stock prices mounted. Virtually all of the statistical evidence, which was now considerable, buttressed the hypothesis that successive price movements were independent of past price movements.*14 Essentially, the random walk hypothesis of stock price behavior states that the history of stock price fluctuations and trading volume does not contain any information that will allow the investor to do any better than a buy-and-hold strategy.6 In short, the odds are strong that you won’t beat the averages. The market has “no memory.” As with a friend well into his cups whom you are walking to your car, any of his steps will give you no clue of which way he’ll lurch next. Not surprisingly, the theory was not accepted by cheering crowds of those practicing technical analysis, one of the two methods commonly used to determine stock and market values. They make their living, after all, by forecasting stock price movements. Technical analysis defines a fairly wide range of techniques, but these are all based on the premise that past information on prices and trading volume gives the sophisticated “expert” a clear ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1446))

Unlike fundamental analysis, which will be tossed into the arena next, technical analysis attempts to forecast changes in stock prices solely by studying market data, rather than by looking at a company’s earnings, finances, and prospects. (The latter is what a fundamental analyst does.) The last thing these grizzled veterans needed to hear from a passel of young, clean-shaven, academic computer geeks was that their methods didn’t work. If the academics were correct, it meant that technical analysis ought to be abandoned. Obviously, a major war of ideas was about to break out. The technicians threw in their most sophisticated techniques, ranging from advanced charting formations to support and resistance levels. Most technicians work from dozens of separate patterns of prices and methods, relying on their judgment to use the proper combination for each case.

If stock prices are random, no matter what price and volume information you have or how strong a chart may look, the chart is meaningless as a predictive instrument, because the next price move is entirely independent of the preceding one. If a stock has moved up seven days in a row, that has no influence on what it will do on the eighth day. It can trade up or down or be unchanged, just as a coin coming up heads many times in a row has a fifty-fifty chance of coming up heads again on the next toss. In extensive testing employing rigorous statistical procedures, only relatively minor departures from randomness in price movements were found from day to day, week to week, and month to month.10 The central thesis of the technician that markets and stocks display major identifiable trends that may be used to predict future movement stands refuted.

The tests have measured only total price data and indicated randomness. Could there not be useful direction in price changes within the time periods studied, such as hour to hour, that the daily or weekly studies did not pick up? Or trends that could be seen only by using selective data such as price-volume statistics together with Kondratieff waves?”*16 In effect, the technicians were inviting the academic researchers to test the systems used in technical analysis rather than price movements as a whole, which they proceeded to do—with devastating results.

Relative-strength methods, which buy stocks that are performing better for a time, were also tested and provided no better results.12 The popular Dow Theory in its turn was subjected to scientific scrutiny. Peaks, valleys, support, and resistance levels, although important to technicians, were all shown to have no predictive value. Price action was random after both “sell” and “buy” signals were given. The computer proved fickle. Though helping the chartist when in his hands, it was also turned against him.

The computer measured its results, based on these signals, against the performance of the general market. No correlation was found between the buy and sell signals and subsequent price movements.

The problem is that the numerous transactions involved in such systems generate substantial commissions, which absorb the expected profit.15 In numerous tests, then, no evidence to date has been able to refute the random walk hypothesis.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As we’ve seen, the academic investigators proposed a revolutionary new hypothesis that we briefly examined earlier, the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), which holds that competition between sophisticated, knowledgeable investors keeps stock prices where they should be. This happens because all facts that determine stock prices are analyzed by large numbers of intelligent and rational investors. New information, such as a change in a company’s earnings outlook or a dividend cut, is quickly digested and immediately reflected in the stock price. Like it or not, competition by so many market participants, all seeking hidden values, makes stock prices reflect the best estimates of their real worth. Prices may not always be right, but they are unbiased, so if they are wrong, they are just as likely to be too high as too low. Since meaningful information enters the marketplace unpredictably, prices react in a random manner. This is the real reason that charting and technical analysis do not work. Nobody knows what new data will enter the market, whether they will be positive or negative, or whether they will affect the market as a whole or only a single company. A key premise of the efficient-market hypothesis is that the market reacts almost instantaneously (and correctly) to new information, so investors cannot benefit. To prove this contention, researchers conducted a number of studies that they claimed validated the thesis. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1574))

To calculate it, a mutual fund, a portfolio, or a stock must be measured against a benchmark, normally a stock index. Stock portfolios of larger-capitalization mutual funds or other similar portfolios are often measured against the S&P 500, which is assigned a beta of 1. If the mutual fund has a higher beta, the academics say, it is more risky than the index. Conversely, a lower beta is considered less risky.

The development of the CAPM resulted in academics’ and consultants’ putting risk measurements into the formula to determine how well a portfolio performed.

A flawed investment theory is not market-neutral; it can be destructive to the capital of average and sophisticated investors alike.

- Because academic findings clearly showed that money managers could not outperform the market, a trillion dollars flowed into funds based on various indexes, from the S&P 500 to the Russell 2000.*24 Owing to the scope of their victory, some academics even expressed concerns that the markets might not continue to be as efficient as the realization spread that money managers and analysts could not beat the market and as a result would probably be laid off. Since these managers and analysts were essential, according to EMH, to keeping markets efficient, too many such layoffs would make them less so.

- Why? Because the S&P futures had infinite liquidity. This is a central belief of efficient marketers and the core concept of portfolio insurance. If markets went down, swarms of sophisticated buyers would come out of the woodwork and immediately buy the futures at lower prices. If the market went still lower, even larger hordes of buyers would be there to scoop up the depressed values. After all, a cardinal EMH belief was that since markets were entirely rational, increasing numbers of buyers would appear as prices declined. End of discussion.

- what the enemy would do, the major brokerage houses and S&P futures traders also knew almost precisely how much the portfolio insurance managers still were behind in their futures selling. It wasn’t nearly as complex as Enigma to decode. Remember, if the market dropped 3 percent, the insurers were supposed to sell 10 percent of the futures to reduce the equity exposure to the predetermined lower level in order to remain delta neutral (the level of stocks and bonds the formula called for).

- The S&P 500 was down 20.5 percent at the close on October 19, and the S&P 500 futures dropped 28.6 percent; this left them at a 23.3-point discount (10.4 percent) to the S&P 500. According to EMH theory, futures cannot ever fall below the cash price for the same expiration date (in this case the end of December 1987). The reason is simple: when an investor buys a stock or the S&P 500 on margin, he or she has to pay the broker an interest charge to carry it. The interest (about 5 percent at the time) is priced into the S&P 500 futures contract, so it must always be at a premium to the cash price of the S&P itself. This should apply even in a panic if people are rational. If the S&P 500 futures contract goes to a discount, the trader makes an automatic profit by selling the S&P 500 stocks and immediately buying the discounted futures.

This gave knowledgeable investors such as index funds and other investment firms with cash an incredible return. They simply had to buy the future and sell or short sell the S&P 500 stocks instantaneously. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1905))

- As I see it, many of the major pillars supporting the efficient-market hypothesis were destroyed in the 1987 crash. Five should be noted. 1. Liquidity dried up. A crucial assumption of EMH, that there is always sufficient liquidity in markets, was disproved, as the above events indicate. The lack of understanding by the academics and the portfolio insurance managers of liquidity was a primary cause of the 1987 crash. 2. The argument that rational investors keep stock prices in line with their value, another core assumption of EMH, was seriously challenged. When was the market efficient? When professional and other sophisticated investors took the S&P 500 down from 315 to 216 (31 percent) in five trading days or when it recovered all of its losses nineteen months later, with only minor changes in the underlying fundamentals? 3. Another example of glaring market inefficiency was the 28.6 percent drop in prices of S&P 500 futures to the actual 20.5 percent drop in the price of the S&P itself on October 19, allowing savvy investors to make gigantic profits on their ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1920))

- capital in two months. The cornerstone of EMH theory states that such actions by rational investors are impossible because of their automaton-like rationality. 4. The EMH offspring, CAPM, states that risk is defined solely as volatility. The only way to lower risk is to lower volatility. But the risk that caused the 1987 crash was not volatility. The panic was caused by a serious lack of liquidity as the futures market dried up, as well as enormous excess margin. Both are measures of risk that are not part of EMH risk theory and therefore are excluded from it. This prodigious flaw in risk measurement is vitally important to your investment decisions. (Solutions will be discussed in chapter 14.) 5. EMH theorists thought that increased leverage would facilitate more efficient markets by strongly encouraging futures trading on stocks at low margins. These academics played an important role by having their recommendation to drastically lower stock future margins about 90 percent below stock margins accepted by the regulators, the SEC, and CFTC. They apparently did not consider ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1928))

What lessons did EMH theorists, as well as true believers, including then Fed Chairman Greenspan, learn from this crash? As noted, none. The theorists tried to explain away all the causes, although their explanations ranged from skimpy to downright foolish. As a result, the mistakes were repeated and contributed to two more market collapses, as we will see next. ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1936))

- LTCM concentrated on “relative value” trades in both domestic and global bond markets. If two high-quality bonds, for example, had almost the same maturity but one yielded 25 basis points (one-quarter of 1 percent) more than the other, LTCM would buy the higher-yielding bond and short the lower-yielding one. Or if a highly rated bond in Spain provided a higher yield than one in the United Kingdom, again with nearly the same maturities, the fund would buy the Spanish bond and short the U.K. issue. These were called “paired ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1954))

- trades.” The fund was also highly diversified, owning and shorting thousands of issues. Another feature of LTCM’s strategy was to buy somewhat riskier and more illiquid bonds in its trades than the ones it shorted to increase the spread. This increased the return on each paired transaction, as less liquid and slightly riskier bonds commanded a somewhat higher yield than bonds with the same risk and liquidity. LTCM believed that this was a low-risk strategy because interest rates tend to rise or fall in sync, so spreads move only a fraction as much as the value of the bonds themselves; LTCM should fare well no matter whether bonds rose or fell or even if the market crashed. One of the academics calculated the risk in a spread transaction at only about 4 percent of owning a bond outright. The paired-trade strategy that was a good part of LTCM’s portfolio was in essence a nickel-and-dime business. Myron Scholes, aside from being an outstanding academician, ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1957))

As he explained it, “the fund would be earning a tiny amount on thousands of trades as if it were vacuuming up nickels that nobody else could see.”7 In essence it would be like a giant penny arcade making big money on the volume of nickels and quarters thrown into the wide variety of game machines on the premises. The confidence so many felt in the strategy was premised on work by Robert Merton, who was considered one of the outstanding experts on risk. He had made major breakthroughs in EMH theory in risk, which eventually earned him the Nobel Prize. Merton was convinced, as were almost all EMH believers, that volatility was the sole measure of risk; this was the bedrock of LTCM’s approach. He was equally sure that volatility remained stable over time. If a stock or bond had a… ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1964))

- than it should be for the bond bought in a pair trade and lower than normal for the one sold short, it would return in each case to its normal level. The higher the volatility on the bond purchased and the lower the volatility on the bond sold, the greater the added return to the trade when the risk swung back to its normal level. That this assumption was never proved was of no consequence. The strategy was also premised on the belief that volatility was mathematically predictable. A large amount of testing was done on volatility, as well as the chance that something could go wrong. Using the cardinal Merton principle that volatility did not change, LTCM was convinced that it could calculate precisely the odds of what the best, average, and worst days would return, as well as the odds that the portfolio could take serious or mortal losses. Even worst-case calculations showed that the firm could sail through the most punishing financial hurricanes. The belief that volatility was mathematically predictable was not held only at LTCM; it was a core belief throughout the Street. The Black-Scholes pricing model was anchored on the predictability of volatility, and trading rooms on Wall Street and in every major financial center globally monitored volatility as if it were the Holy Grail. Every major trading floor was staffed by bright young Ph.D.s who had studied under Fama, Merton, Scholes, or other strong EMH believers, and they didn’t question the unproved premise that yesterday’s prices were reliable and predictable indicators that would determine today’s value.

- What the professors and traders didn’t focus on was leverage or liquidity. Since they had volatility completely under control and that was the only source of risk, liquidity and leverage did not matter a hoot. So focused were they on volatility, and so strong was their belief that volatility was risk, that leverage and liquidity as independent risk elements were considered inconsequential. They were not even a punctuation mark in the EMH-inspired formulas LTCM used. The question most often asked by LTCM academics and portfolio managers was how much volatility (“Vol”) it took to optimize returns. The answer that almost consistently came back was that the Vol could be raised, with little addition to risk. The leverage went from 20 to 1 to… ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=1988))

- By the spring of 1996, it had $140 billion in assets under management, and its capital had tripled to $3.6 billion. After only two years of operations, its assets were larger than those of Lehman Brothers or Morgan Stanley and were approaching those of the giant Salomon Brothers. In 1996, it earned 41 percent net of fees or $2.1 billion, more than giant blue-chip growth companies such as Walt Disney, McDonald’s, and American Express. But there were other somewhat less appetizing aspects to this sizzling growth. By early 1996, the firm’s leverage had, as noted, climbed to 30 to 1. Leverage works well, as we saw, when markets are going up, as they were before the 1929 and 1987 crashes, but when markets go down, it’s death. At 30-to-1 leverage LTCM had to lose only 3.3 percent of its market value to have its capital wiped out entirely. Meanwhile, its return on total assets was less than 2.5 percent, before counting its large derivative positions in the many hundreds of billions of dollars. Including those, it was probably less than 1 percent.10 A ninety-day Treasury bill at that time yielded 4.5 percent, which was approximately 4.5 times LTCM’s return on total assets. Almost all of LTCM’s return came from levels of leverage that defied gravity. Then, in mid-1997, the Asian economies began to melt, first Cambodia, then the Philippines, then Malaysia, then South Korea, followed by Singapore and Indonesia.

They do not say in what time period volatility securities or derivatives will revert to the mean. It’s like crossing a river that’s four feet deep on average, carrying a fifty-pound backpack: it might be three feet deep in some places and fifteen feet deep in others. Not good survival odds, but precisely the odds Merton the supermathematician had chosen.

Merton and Scholes were making the same kinds of bets that any desperate amateur deeply out of pocket might make: LTCM could fail on the toss of a coin. Maybe the gods were not major EMH adherents after all. LTCM’s spreads on its paired trades did not narrow; they widened. Through 1998, a flight to safety occurred in almost every sector it was invested in. Remember, the firm was always invested in the riskier, not safer, bonds and was short of the safest bonds. To add to its problem, the volatility indices it short sold skyrocketed as volatility increased. In May, problems with the Asian Tigers flared up again.

Then, in August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and market fear heightened across the board.

They began shorting LTCM’s positions, well aware that in a forced liquidation, when it was compelled to sell, prices would drop drastically and the bankers could cover their shorts at bargain prices. The parallels between the portfolio insurers in 1987 and LTCM are remarkable. Both were undone by a massive lack of liquidity when it was most needed, in a bear market.

- These words have become popular. I don’t think they have any meaning.”13 That’s Professor Fama, trying to defend the central core of the efficient-market hypothesis, that prices are always where they should be. He denies the existence of manias and crashes. Still, bubbles and IPOs present a particularly vexing point to EMH because they seem to defy consistently rational behavior. Fama and other EMH adherents are backed into a corner. EMH has to deny the existence of manias and panics, or it will be pierced by a fatal arrow—not a particularly pleasant way for a popular hypothesis to die. There was only one escape, and Professor Fama, never accused of not being highly intelligent, found it. He states emphatically that bubbles don’t exist. Why? Because rational investors always keep prices where they should be. In the New Yorker article, Fama dodges, ducks, or sidesteps the volley of arrows the well-versed financial reporter John Cassidy fires at him. But in doing so he steps into a position even more challenging that to my knowledge has never been examined. Continuing with EMH logic, if, as Fama says, there are no bubbles or panics, we have to look more closely at the rational investors who perform this extraordinary feat. We already examined this question in some detail in chapter 2*36 and again briefly in this chapter and found there are no widely followed fundamental analytical methods used by security analysts, money managers, and other rational investors that condone buying stocks at prices anywhere from 10 to 100 times or more normal valuation levels in a… ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2128))

- MY EXPERIENCE AS a Forbes columnist for more than thirty years—writing columns that EMH partisans did not take kindly to—gives me the tiniest inkling of what Galileo went through with his scientific work in the early seventeenth century. The great Italian scientist supported the new heliocentric idea of the solar system when a huge majority of philosophers and astronomers still subscribed to the geocentric view, namely, that the earth is the center of the universe. Galileo was forced to recant his views. When he published again, in 1632, he was arrested by the Inquisition, was found “vehemently suspect of heresy,”1 was forced to recant yet again, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. The geocentric view, by the way, had an impeccable pedigree going all the way back to the work of Ptolemy, a revered scholar who lived in the second century A.D. in Alexandria, the University of Chicago of its day. He was part of a cosmopolitan elite who had made the Egyptian city a jewel of scholarly activity, and his own outstanding contribution was the Ptolemaic system. His treatise, using hundreds of years of celestial observations, explained the motion of the sun and planets and provided convenient tables allowing the computation of future or past positions of the planets. The basic premise was that the earth was the center of the universe and the planets, the sun, and the stars orbited around it. The Ptolemaic system was universally accepted by the civilized world for almost 1,600 years, filling a major role in land and sea navigation.

- None other than Galileo introduced the telescope to astronomy in 1609. He became the first man to observe the craters of the moon, sunspots, the four large moons of Jupiter, and the rings of Saturn. Far from abandoning the Ptolemaic system, the model became increasingly complex in order to incorporate the new observations. Now the planets and stars moved around one another and around the earth in a combination of circles, epicycles, and eccentrics (large deferent circles—don’t ask—around whose centers the epicycles revolved). The result of this hodgepodge was a mind-boggling whirl. Nonetheless, the Ptolemaic system met two major criteria of a useful scientific hypothesis: it was “predictive” in correctly forecasting where various celestial bodies would be at future points in time, and it was “explanatory” because it codified a system of planetary motion. It was also entirely wrong. ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2173))

- Two questions we should now ask: 1. Why was there an almost obsessive focus on volatility as the sole measure of risk by the academics? 2. Was this focus justified? Let’s look at these questions next. Much of the previous chapter swirled around volatility. Does greater volatility reward investors with higher returns, and lower volatility with lower returns? From what we’ve seen in that chapter, the answer is a definite no. In reality, academic research found answers to this question more than three decades ago. Let’s look at these answers now. How did leading EMH academics know that investors measured risk strictly by the volatility of the stock? They ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2195))

- didn’t, nor did they do any research to find out, other than the original studies of the correlation between volatility and return, whose results were mixed at best. The academics simply declared it as fact. Importantly, this definition of risk was easy to use to build complex computer finance models, and that’s what the professors wanted to do. They could then build a simple but elegant theory. Economists find this view of risk compelling, if not almost obsessional, because it is the way rational man should behave according to economic theory. If investors are risk-averse and economists can show this to be so, they have proof of a central concept of economic theory: that man is a rational decision maker. If investors will take greater risks only if they receive higher returns—eureka!—an eight-lane highway opens between investment markets and microeconomic theory.

I might return 15 percent a year and my competitor 30 percent, but if her portfolio was much more volatile than mine, I would have the better risk-adjusted returns.

- Fama and French found that stocks with low betas performed roughly as well as stocks with high betas. Fama stated, “Beta as the sole variable in explaining returns on stocks is dead.”12 Write this on the tombstone: “What we are saying is that over the last 50 years, knowing the volatility of an equity doesn’t tell you much about the stock’s return.”13 Yes, make it a large stone, maybe even a mausoleum. An article in Fortune on June 1, 1992, concluded, “Beta, say the boys from Chicago, is bogus.”14 The Chicago Tribune summed it up well: “Some of its best-known adherents have now become detractors.”15 If not beta, then what?

- risk cannot be measured by volatility, how can it be determined? According to Professor French, “What investors really get paid for is holding dogs.”16 Their study, as we will see, indicated that stocks with the lowest price-to-book-value ratios and lowest P/Es provide the highest returns over time, as do smaller-capitalization companies. Stock returns are more positively related to these measurements than to beta or other similar risk criteria.17 Fama added, “One risk factor isn’t going to do it.” Investors must look beyond beta to a multifactor calculation of risk, which includes some value measurements and other criteria.18 ([Location 2274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2274))

- These models are built to replace CAPM; but they are built in an identical fashion, that is, they all attempt to show that higher volatility provides higher return and that lower volatility provides lower return. If CAPM could not do this, why should any new model built in an identical manner do so? CAPM was dumped because it didn’t work, but its central tenet, that there is a direct correlation between risk and return, is being kept as the core of EMH risk analysis.

- So researchers must search for new sets of risk and return variables that will give them the correlation between higher risk and higher return. In effect, they must create a new CAPM (naturally with a new name) that behaves almost exactly as the old one was supposed to behave but didn’t. In short, it appears they are attempting to create something along the lines of a financial Stepford wife. But this leads them deeper into the theoretical jungle.

- The first problem is that they have presented a grab bag of simple correlations that attempt to show a link between risk and return. This is very dangerous scientific ground. As Milton Friedman warned, “If there is one . . . [correlation] . . . consistent with the available evidence there are always an infinite number that are.”25 Even if the academics found a correlation between volatility and return, which is doubtful from what we have seen, there could be ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2330))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- hundreds of others that explain risk and return better. The first problem researchers have is that they cannot prove that the three-factor, the four-factor, or any other models they put forth actually work rather than simply being chance correlations. As Friedman also noted, one of the basic rules of scientific method is that correlation is far removed from causation. There can be innumerable chance correlations for any effect, but without reasonable evidence that one or another is true, they are pure coincidence and likely to go away with time. A humorous example of chance correlation was the Hemline Indicator, which was shown in a well-known Wall Street chart for decades. When fashion dictated that hemlines should be high, in periods such as the 1920s, the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, markets roared ahead. When hemlines dropped in the 1930s, in the 1940s, and again in the 1970s, markets went lower. According to this tongue-in-cheek hypothesis, the height of hemlines dictated where markets would go. Obviously, few took it seriously. However, many EMH researchers seem to accept chance correlations as proof, although there is no evidence that a myriad of other variables might also correlate as well as or better than the ones they’ve selected. No new theory of volatility and return has been discovered that shows a consistent correlation between the two. Still, the EMH researchers continue to struggle to find one. They have scanned thousands of possible financial variables in an attempt to do this, but none has worked consistently.

Burton Malkiel, the author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, now in its tenth edition, wrote in an article reviewing the evidence on efficient markets in 2005, “In my view, equity prices adjust to new information without delay, and, as a result, no arbitrage opportunities exist that would achieve above average returns, without accepting above average risk.”36 But do equity prices really adjust to ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2432))

A number of these studies also make it clear that the initial market reactions are wrong. You will also see this predictable reaction to earnings surprise over thirty-eight years in chapter 9, where the first reaction repeatedly is not the correct one. It is also demonstrated in papers by Ray Ball and Philip Brown (1968)37 and Victor Bernard and Jacob Thomas (1990)38 and noted by Eugene Fama in his 1998 survey of EMH literature.39 ([Location 2439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2439))

Sadly, this information was unavailable, so the researchers measured from the month in which the stock split was actually distributed, a period when the information had been out for two to four months, and reported that no extra return was made from that point onward. Naturally, their measurements of stock movement at that point were meaningless, as the market had already digested the news from two to four months before and the informational content was already fully reflected in the stock prices.

What the chart appears to show, assuming that the majority of split announcements occurred two to four months prior to the stock distribution, is that the stocks may indeed have provided above-average returns after the announcement date. The positive adjustment to the splits, then, appears not to have been immediate but to have taken place for some months after the split’s announcement. If this is the case, the researchers’ argument is invalid. The most logical conclusion is that the stocks continued to rise as a group for an extended period after the split announcement, which… ([Location 2476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2476))

If it were possible to place the split at the correct point, as the above analysis indicates, the conclusion would have been very different, the evidence helping to prove the tenet that markets react to new information in an inefficient, not an efficient, manner, which would certainly help to question the overall efficiency of markets. Three decades later, in 1996, the research was replicated by David Ikenberry, Graeme Rankine, and Earl Stice,42 who examined 1,275 two-for-one stock splits from 1975 to 1990 on the New York Stock Exchange and the AMEX.

On the contrary, they should search for black swans, because finding even one would destroy the theory.55 EMH researchers have not followed Popper’s teachings. The black swans of EMH are the ever-increasing number of major anomalies outside the theory’s explanatory range.

These findings, which one could call “slivers of efficiency,” led the researchers by quantum leaps to much broader conclusions.

The findings of economic theory would be as precise as measuring the exact expansion of steel on a bridge of a given length as the temperature rose. The only solid platform upon which the higher math could be built was the bedrock of rationality. Integrating sociological or psychological theories could result in a number of possible starting points, with new ones added over time, and it would be impossible to anchor complex mathematical formulas on a changing behavioral platform. No, the most practical solution, to most economists, was to use the assumption of consistent rationality, even if it was often incorrect. As a result, the great majority of economic research gravitated in that direction, despite the warnings of some of the important economic thinkers of the past.

Perhaps even worse, the academic journals are, in effect, in the pockets of the major EMH researchers. To publish in the major journals, you must be a true believer or at least a reasonable compromiser. The journals, of course, can make or break the careers of most academics.

- Curious as to what he would find in the stock market, Paul Slovic tested the importance of configural (or interactive) reasoning in the decisions of market professionals. In one study he provided thirteen stockbrokers and five graduate students in finance with eight important financial inputs—the trend of earnings per share, profit margins, outlook for near-term profits, and so on—that they considered significant in analyzing companies. They had to think configurally to find the optimum solution. As it turned out, however, configural reasoning, on average, accounted for only 4 percent of the decisions made—results roughly equivalent to those of the radiologists and psychologists. Moreover, what the brokers said about how they analyzed the various inputs differed significantly from what they ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2833))

- did.6 For example, a broker who said that the most important trend was earnings per share might actually have placed greater emphasis on near-term prospects. Finally, the more experienced the brokers, the less accurate their assessment of their own scales of weighting appeared to be. All in all, the evidence indicates that most people are weak configural processors, in or out of the marketplace. So it turns out that human minds—as I’m sure you’ve suspected—are not hardwired anything like the way computers are.

- As we saw in our first look at information processing in chapter 3, Herbert Simon more than fifty years ago wrote extensively on information overload. Under certain conditions, experts err predictably and often; in fields as far apart as psychology, engineering, publishing, and even soil sampling, all of them make the same kinds of mistakes. The conditions for such errors are as fertile in the stock market as anywhere. I briefly mentioned that the vast storehouse of data about companies, industries, and the economy mandated by current investment methods may not give the professional investor an extra “edge.” When information-processing requirements are large and complex analysis is necessary to integrate it, the rational system, which is deliberative and analytical, is often subtly overridden without the professional’s knowledge by the experiential system. Inferential processing delicately bypasses our rational data banks. As we’ve seen, ingesting large amounts of investment information can lead to worse rather than better decisions because the Affect working with other cognitive heuristics, such as representativeness and availability, takes over. In the next chapter, you’ll see that forecasting, the heart of security analysis, which selects stocks precisely by the methods we are questioning, misses the mark time and again. We’ll also see that the favorite stocks and industries of large groups of professional investors have fared worse than the averages for many decades.

Expert bridge players, for example, proved much more capable of assessing the odds of winning a particular hand than average players.17 When predictability is very low, however, experts are more prone to overconfidence than novices. When experts predict highly complex situations—for example, the future of troubled European Union countries such as Portugal and Greece, the impact of religious fundamentalists on foreign policy in the Middle East, or the movement of the stock market—they usually demonstrate overconfidence. Because of the richness of information available to them, they believe they have the advantage in their area of expertise.

They set up Washington and international listening posts to catch the slightest whiff of change in government policies or economic conditions abroad. The latest turn here, now being investigated by the SEC, is to hire former corporate executives from major companies they follow to give them “the real scoop” on “what’s going on” inside.

- I hope it is becoming apparent that configural relationships are extremely complex. Stock market investors are dealing not with twenty-four or forty-eight relevant interactions but with an astronomical number. As we have already seen, far fewer inputs can overtax the configural or interactive judgment of experts. Because most Wall Street experts, like those elsewhere, are unaware of these psychological findings, they remain convinced that their problems can be handled if only those few extra facts are available. They overload with information, which doesn’t help their thinking but makes them more confident and therefore more vulnerable to making serious errors.

- Evaluating stocks is no different. Under conditions of anxiety and uncertainty, with a vast interacting web of partial information, it becomes a giant Rorschach test. The investor sees any pattern he or she wishes. In fact, according to recent research in configural processing, investors can find patterns that aren’t there—a phenomenon called illusory correlation. Trained psychologists, for example, were given background information on psychotics and were also given drawings allegedly made by them but actually prepared by the researchers. With remarkable consistency, the psychologists saw in the drawings the cues that they expected to see: muscular figures drawn by men worried about their masculinity or big eyes by suspicious people.

- Tversky went on to note that “rather than operating on rational expectations”—with total logic, unaffected by behavior, as efficient-market theory assumes investors do—“people are commonly biased in several directions: they are optimistic; they overestimate the chances that they will succeed, and they overestimate their degree of knowledge, in the sense that their confidence far exceeds their ‘hit rate.’”24 Tversky was queried about overconfidence at an investment behavioral conference in 1995 that I attended and also spoke at. The questioner asked what he thought of the fact that analysts were not very good at forecasting future earnings. He responded, in part, “From the standpoint of the behavioral phenomena . . . analysts should be more skeptical of their ability to predict [earnings] than they usually ([Location 2960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=2960))

He replied that “unfortunately cognitive illusions are not easily unlearned. . . . The fact that in the real world people have not learned to eliminate . . . overconfidence speaks for itself.”26 I’m afraid we’re overconfident that we can overcome our tendency to be overconfident by simply recognizing that we tend to be overconfident.

- The results are startling: analysts’ estimates were sharply and consistently off the mark, even though they were made less than three months before the end of the quarter for which actual earnings were reported. The average error for the sample was a whopping 40 percent annually. Again, this was no small sample; it included more than 800,000 individual analysts’ estimates. Interestingly, these large errors are occurring in the midst of the information revolution. Yet in spite of this fact, estimated errors remain enormously high—much too high to be of any use in determining the real value of most stocks. Yes, the margin of error simply swamps any chance of accurately determining earnings!

- past thirty-eight years do? When we look at sharp price drops on sizzling stocks after analysts’ misses of only a few percent, it becomes apparent that even small estimate errors can be dangerous to your investment health. Yet that is precisely how the game is played on the Street by analysts, large mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors, and swallowed by average investors. You might wonder whether the results are skewed by a few large errors. To check for that kind of skew, we measured earnings surprises four different ways.11 In all cases, errors were high. What about surprises from companies that report small or nominal earnings? A miss of the same amount would obviously result in a higher percentage error for companies reporting very small earnings per share compared to those reporting much higher earnings per share. If, for example, the estimate was $1.00 and the company actually reported 93 cents, the miss would be 7.5 percent. But if the estimate was 10 cents and the company reported only 3 cents, the miss would be 233 percent.*46 No matter how we analyzed it, the slightest error in the earnings forecast had a disproportionate effect on the fortunes of a company’s stock, irrespective of other measures of the company’s soundness or management performance.

After the horror stories precipitated when forecasts were off even minutely, the answer seems to be—not much. We have seen that estimates carefully prepared only three months in advance, by well-paid and diligent analysts, are notoriously inaccurate. To complicate matters, many stocks sell not on today’s earnings but on expected earnings years into the future. The analysts’ chances of being on the money with their forecasts are not much higher than the chance of winning a major trifecta. Current investment practices seem to demand a precision that is impossible to deliver.

This result is so consistent that we should call it a Psychological Guideline.   PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDELINE 12: There are no highly predictable industries in which you can count on analysts’ forecasts.

What did come out clearly is that analysts are always optimistic; their forecasts are too optimistic in periods of recession, and this optimism doesn’t decrease in periods of economic recovery or in more normal times. This last finding is not new. A number of research papers have been devoted to the subject of analyst optimism, as chapter 7 showed, and, with the exception of one that used far too short a period of time, all have come up with the same conclusion.13 This is an important finding for the investor: if analysts are generally optimistic, there will be a large number of disappointments created not by events but by initially seeing the company or industry through rose-colored glasses, as we saw in chapter 7.

- Finally, we have seen two additional problems with analysts’ forecasts. First, the error rates are not due to the business cycle. Analysts’ forecast errors are high in all stages of the cycle. Second, and more important, analysts have a strong optimistic bias in their forecasts. Not only are their errors high, but there is a consistent tendency to overestimate earnings. This is deadly when you pay a premium price for a stock. The towering forecast errors combined with analysts’ optimism result in a high probability of disaster. As we saw, even a slight “miss” for stocks with supposedly excellent visibility has unleashed waves of selling, taking the prices down five or even ten times the percentage miss of the forecasting error itself.

Yet accurate earnings estimates are essential to most of the stock valuation methods we looked at in chapter 2.

The growth and momentum schools of investing also require finely calibrated, precise estimates many years into the future to justify the prices they pay for stocks. The higher the multiple, the greater the visibility of earnings demanded. ([Location 3287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3287))

- Yet another important research finding indicates the fallibility of relying on earnings forecasts. Oxford Professor Ian Little, in a 1962 paper appropriately titled “Higgledy Piggledy Growth,” revealed that the future of a large number of British companies could not be predicted from recent earnings trends.16 Little’s work proved uncomfortable to both EMH theoreticians and EMH practitioners, who promptly criticized its methodology. Little good-naturedly accepted the criticism and carefully redid the work, but the outcome was the same: earnings appeared to follow a random walk of their own, with past and future rates showing virtually no correlation, and recent trends (so important to security analysis in projecting earnings) provided no indication of the future course.17 A number of studies reach the same conclusion:18 changes in the earnings of U.S. companies fluctuate randomly over time.

- Richard Brealey, for example, examined the percentage changes of earnings of 711 U.S. industrial companies between 1945 and 1964. He, too, found that trends were not sustained but actually demonstrated a slight tendency toward reversal. The only exception was companies with the steadiest rates of earnings growth, and even their correlations were only mildly positive.19 Juxtaposing the second set of studies with the first provides part of the explanation of why analysts’ forecasting errors are so high. If analysts extrapolate past earnings trends into the future, as Cragg and Malkiel have shown, and earnings do follow a random walk, as Little and Brealey demonstrated, one would expect sizable errors. And large forecast errors are what we have found consistently. Thus, once again and from quite another tack, we see the precariousness of attempting to place major emphasis on earnings forecasts.

- Forecasters are “excessively prone” to treating each problem as unique, paying no attention to history. Cognitive psychologists note that there are two distinct methods of forecasting. The first is called the “inside view.” This method is the one overwhelmingly used to forecast earnings estimates and stock prices. The analyst or stock forecaster focuses entirely on the stock and related aspects such as growth rates, market share, product development, the general market, the economic outlook, and a host of other variables. The “outside view,” on the other hand, ignores the multitude of factors that go into making the individual ([Location 3443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3443))

- forecast and focuses instead on the group of cases believed to be most similar. In the case of earnings estimates, for example, it would zero in on how accurate earnings forecasts have been overall or how accurate they have been for a specific industry or for the company itself in deciding how precisely the analyst can estimate and the reliance that can be placed on the forecast. If stock market forecasters are to succeed using the inside view, they must capture the critical elements of the future. The outside view, in contrast, is essentially statistical and comparative and does not attempt to read the future in any detail.

- As is now apparent, the inside and outside views draw on dramatically different sources of information, and the processes are poles apart. The outside view ignores the innumerable details of the project on hand (the cornerstone of analysis using the inside view) and makes no attempt to forecast the outcome of the project into the future. Instead, it focuses on the statistics of projects similar to the one being undertaken to determine the odds of success or failure. The basic difference is that with the outside view, the problem is treated not as unique but as an instance of a number of similar problems. The outside view could be applied to a large number of the problems we’ve seen, including curriculum building, medical and psychiatric or legal diagnosis, and forecasting earnings or future stock prices.

- According to Kahneman, “It should be obvious that when both methods are applied with intelligence and skill the outside view is much more likely to yield a realistic estimate. In general, the future of long and complex undertakings is simply not foreseeable in detail.” The number of possible outcomes when dozens or hundreds of factors interact in the marketplace is, for all practical purposes, infinite. Even if one could foresee each of the possibilities, the probability of any particular scenario is negligible. Yet this is precisely what analysts are trying to accomplish with a single, precise prediction. ([Location 3468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3468))

As we saw earlier, the Street demands forecasts normally within a range of plus or minus 3 percent. Table 8-3, taken from our previous analysts’ forecasting study, shows how slim the probability of getting estimates within even the wider 5 percent range actually is. Remember, only 30 percent of forecasts made this target in any one quarter. The table shows the chance of an analyst’s hitting the target for one quarter, four quarters, ten quarters, and twenty quarters; for all earnings surprises in column 1, negative surprises in column 2, and positive surprises in column… ([Location 3475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3475))

For any ten consecutive quarters, the odds of fine-tuning the estimates for a company within this range fall to 1 in 199,000, and for twenty consecutive quarters, they fall to 1 in 40 billion. We stopped our calculation of estimates there, as the odds would have been likely to go up to the trillions twenty years out.

If the odds are staggeringly high against being precise for five years, what are they for ten or fifteen? Many extremely pricey growth stocks must make their forecasts for ten- or fifteen-year periods in order to justify their current prices.

Within the stock market they do the same for companies’ earnings outlooks—and thus inevitably their stock prices. The market is always adjusting to surprises or anticipating them or discounting them: the standard fare of investment news you hear or read every day. The key players, of course, in initiating a market surprise are the analysts we met in the previous chapter, the men and women who predict what will happen barring any surprise. Ironically, here we have a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s their pinpoint forecasts, which are rarely met, that create the majority of earnings surprises on stocks.

- earnings surprises cause two distinct categories of price reactions in both “best” and “worst” stocks. I’ll call the first an “event trigger” and the second, which will be discussed shortly, a “reinforcing event.” I define an event trigger as unexpected negative news about a stock believed to have excellent prospects, or unexpectedly positive news about a stock believed to have a mediocre outlook. As a result of the event trigger, people look at the two categories of stocks very differently. They take off their dark or rose-colored glasses. They now evaluate the companies more realistically, and the reappraisal results in a major price change to correct the market’s previous overreaction.

As has been shown, the process goes on beyond the quarter in which the surprise is reported and through the year following the surprise. In the next section, we’ll see that it actually continues for much longer periods. Event triggers can result from surprises other than earnings. A non-earnings surprise might be the FDA’s approval of an important new drug or its denial of further testing. Winning or losing a landmark tobacco case would be another. New technology that suddenly makes a semiconductor obsolete would be a third. There could be hundreds of such surprises, any one of which could have a sharp and lasting impact on a stock’s price.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The event trigger resulted in a major reassessment of the company by investors. As we saw, investors systematically overrate the future of favored companies. When a negative earnings surprise occurs to a favored stock, accompanied by serious downbeat news, people are shaken by the realization that this could happen to a “best” stock. Their reaction is to sell—fast—sending the prices down, often dramatically. Even when the bad news proved to be not nearly as severe as originally anticipated and the company, in fact, came near to meeting its original earnings targets, the memory of the unpleasant experience lingered. Though many “best” companies bounce back, their stock underperformance continues for some time. THE SECOND EVENT TRIGGER Investors do not expect positive surprises from companies they consider to have poor outlooks. When such surprises happen, people begin a process of perceptual change. The stocks are reevaluated more positively, and they outperform the market significantly, largely because of the original undervaluations. The second type of event trigger is a positive surprise—or a series of positive surprises—for an out-of-favor stock.

- earnings surprises. Whether the estimate was too high or too low, analysts do not revise it accurately immediately but take as long as three quarters after the surprise to do so.8 When a forecast is too high, it continues to be high for the next nine months, and when it is too low, it continues to be low for the next three quarters. As Abarbanell and Bernard put it, analysts “underreact to recent earnings reports.” This underreaction generates new surprises, which reinforce investors’ changing opinion of a company. If, for example, investors are taken aback by a negative earnings surprise on a favorite stock and more negative surprises occur in the following quarters (as a result of analysts’ not revising their earnings estimates down enough), people’s increasingly poor reappraisal of the company pushes the stock even lower. The event trigger continues over a number of quarters, as we have seen in the various annual quarterly ([Location 3824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3824))

- The Effects of Reinforcing Events The second category of earnings surprises is what I call a “reinforcing event.” Rather than changing investors’ perceptions about a stock, these surprises reinforce the current beliefs about the company. Since they do, they should have much less impact on stock prices. Reinforcing events are defined as positive surprises on favored stocks or negative surprises on out-of-favor stocks. A positive surprise on a favored stock reinforces the previous perception that this is an excellent company. Good companies should do well; if they have positive surprises, it is only to be expected.

- Let’s briefly look at neuroeconomics research that appears to explain the four categories of classes of earnings surprises, which, as we know, divide into two distinct categories, event triggers and reinforcing events. The researchers Wolfram Schultz of the University of Cambridge (Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience), Read Montague at Baylor College of Medicine, and Peter Dayan at University College London have made a number of important research findings about dopamine and reward. They discovered that getting what you anticipated produces no dopamine rush, sending out electromechanical pulses at their resting rate of about three bursts per second. Even though a reward is expected to make investors enthusiastic, it does not. This is almost precisely what we see with the high-P/E phenomenon with positive surprises and negative surprises on out-of-favor stocks with reinforcing events. The reward—in this case a positive surprise on a favored stock—is actually more than investors expected, but the reaction is almost nebulous and sometimes negative. This may also explain why drug addicts require larger hits to get the same high and why investors require larger earnings hits on “best stocks to see their prices move higher.” To neuroeconomists, the two event triggers would be the real surprises. They are major unexpected events. According to a research study by Pammi Chandrasekhar, C. Monica Capra, Sara Moore, Charles Noussair, and Gregory Berns,13 higher-than-expected rewards are unanticipated and as a result release dopamine. Looking at event triggers shows that a positive earnings surprise for an unfavored stock is also unanticipated by investors holding or interested in the stock. They are likely to experience “rejoice” or elation when their stock shows a positive earnings ([Location 3892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3892))

- Schultz, Montague, and Dayan also found that if rewards we expect don’t pan out, dopamine dries up.19 Dopamine neurons activate when people spot a signal that the reward is coming, but if it doesn’t come, they will instantly stop firing. The brain is thus deprived of its expected shot of dopamine, and disappointment sets in. This is similar to the reaction we see in the earnings surprise on a favored stock that has a negative surprise (an event trigger). Schultz and Dickinson also observed that omitted rewards induce opposite changes in dopamine neurons compared with unpredicted rewards. If a predicted reward fails to occur, dopamine ([Location 3922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3922))

- neurons are depressed at the time the reward would have occurred. This suggests a form of error coding that is compatible with the idea that the error directly controls learning about the prediction.20 The fact that there is no positive reward, but a negative consequence, for each security in the best-stock negative-surprise portfolio quite possibly is responsible for the significant, immediate, and then continuing drop in price. As we have seen, both the positive and the negative effects last for at least four quarters. Reinforcing events, the two other classes of earnings surprises we noted—a positive surprise on a favored company and a negative surprise on an out-of-favor stock—do not seem to have much impact on our neuroprocessing or, for that matter, in the marketplace, from what the neuropsychologists report in related studies. For example, winning a bet when it is highly probable evokes less rejoicing than winning a bet when the ([Location 3927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3927))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- outlook was unlikely. Similarly, losing a bet when the outcome is probable evokes less regret than losing a bet when the outlook is improbable. Chandrasekhar and colleagues indicate that the degree of regret or rejoicing correlates with the perceived probabilities of winning or losing. The higher the expectation of winning, the lower the amount of rejoicing; and the lower the expectation of winning, the higher the amount of rejoicing. Also noted was that different brain regions exhibited activation that increased with the levels both of regret and rejoicing. The authors conclude, “Our results suggest that distinct but overlapping networks are involved in the experiences of regret and joy.”21 What seems apparent from this analysis is that expected… ([Location 3934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3934))

- that this is exactly what happens with the stocks we have labeled as reinforcing events.*54 Also of interest is the difference in the size of event triggers and reinforcing events, as the neuroeconomists’ work would suggest. The event trigger’s impact on stock prices is about four times as much as that of reinforcing events in the quarter of the surprise, and almost twenty-four times as much after one year (removing signs on both). The chart is statistically significant at the 0.1 percent level; this means that there is only a 1-in-1,000 possibility that it could be sheer… ([Location 3941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3941))

Conversely, the highest-P/E group receiving negative surprises (high-P/E negative) underperformed in every quarter for the following five years, lagging behind the market by 30.4 percent for the full period.

- differential between the two groups continued to increase significantly through the five years measured. Is the entire difference in performance between the two types of event triggers caused by earnings surprises? Did the original surprises change investors’ perceptions permanently? These questions are impossible to answer statistically at this time. We do know that investors were far too confident of their prognostications for both “best” and “worst” stocks; consequently, “best” stocks were significantly overvalued and “worst” stocks were undervalued. When the dark or rose-colored glasses were removed, perhaps they were swapped for each other. As was also noted earlier, not one but a series of surprises ([Location 3956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=3956))

- may occur, some in later quarters, including surprises other than analysts’ forecast errors, that continue to reinforce the price reevaluations. What we can say, however, is that the enormous market outperformance by the low-P/E and other low-value groups*56 and the underperformance by the highest quintile in each value group indicate that there certainly had to be an event or a series of events that changed investors’ perceptions of what were “best” and “worst” stocks.

- We also see the effects of reinforcing events. “Worst” stocks with negative surprises (low-P/E negative) consistently outperformed after the surprise quarter and for the next nineteen quarters, while “best” stocks with positive surprises (high-P/E positive) just as consistently underperformed. Although the differences are not as large as for “best” and “worst” stocks that experienced an event trigger in the surprise quarter, they are still major. “Best” stocks underperformed the market by 21.3 percent in the full five-year periods, while “worst” stocks outperformed by 20.4 percent. (The results for the two other value measures, price to cash flow and price to book value, are again similar.) The middle group is not shown. However, the long-term findings differ little from those at the end of the first year. Surprise has a major effect only in the quarter in which the news is announced. After that the stocks perform in line with the market. Overall, positive and negative surprises almost cancel each other out, and this is pretty much what we should expect, since being in the middle group shows that the stocks are not overvalued or undervalued by much.

Therefore, let’s ask another question: should you avoid the stocks the experts and the crowd are pursuing and pursue the ones they are avoiding? The answer, as we shall see, is an unqualified yes. And we can document the consistent success of this investment strategy going back almost eighty years, a strategy that dramatically opposes conventional wisdom—a prime reason it works. For the findings show that companies the market expects the best future for, as measured by the price-to-earnings, price-to-cash-flow, price-to-book-value, high-yield, and low-price-to-industry strategies, have consistently done the worst, while the stocks believed to have the most dismal future have always done the best.

- Unhappily for believers in growth, the long-term drubbing does not stop here. Although there is constant debate in the financial press and the investment media, as well as in Morningstar and other advisory services, about whether value or growth performs better over time, the results of this study are clear-cut. First, contrarian strategies outperform growth strategies regardless of the metric chosen. Next, the margin of outperformance over time is enormous. Low-P/E stocks outperform their high-P/E brethren by close to thirteenfold. Ten thousand dollars initially invested in these stocks in 1970 became $3,274,000, versus the $259,000 invested in high-P/E stocks at the same time. Similarly, $10,000 invested in low-price-to-book-value stocks would have grown to $2,425,000 against the $242,000 that the initial $10,000 would have increased to in high-price-to-book-value stocks. The comparisons of price to cash flow are similar. It’s clear that contrarian strategies outperform favored stocks by a country mile. What is also demonstrated is that contrarian strategies have performed very well, increasing initial capital by up to 327 times, from 1970 through 2010, and this after the worst market downturn since the Great Depression. But the story is still not over. Most investors want more than just to increase their nest egg in a rising market.

- intact when the bear growls. We’ve seen the intensity of this goal after the 2007–2008 bear market. Morningstar, Lipper, and the Forbes Annual Mutual Funds Survey, among others, rank mutual funds on how they have performed through several bear markets. To find out how our contrarian strategies worked in down markets, we took the returns of the value stocks in each of the four categories for all fifty-two down quarters in the study and averaged them. As Figure 10-5a shows, the value strategies all did better than the market average in the down markets through the same period (1970–2010). While the market dropped 7.6 percent in the average down quarter, low-P/E, low-price-to-cash-flow, and low-price-to-book-value stocks all fell less, as the figure shows. The best performers, as you might expect, were the high-yield stocks, declining only 3.8 percent, or half as much as the market.

Sanjoy Basu,2 in 1977, and behavioral finance pioneers Werner De Bondt and Richard Thaler refer to investor overreaction in their 1985 paper,3 but limit it primarily to the performance of “best” and “worst” stocks.

Absolute contrarian strategies provide superior returns over time. 1b. Out-of-favor stocks, as valued by at least three different major fundamental measurements—low price-to-earnings, low price-to-cash-flow, and low price-to-book-value ratios—will outperform the market as a group over longer periods of time, normally five to ten years or more. 1c. Favored stocks, as measured by high price-to-earnings, high price-to-cash-flow, and high price-to-book-value ratios, will underperform the market over the same time periods. 1d. Out-of-favor stocks should significantly outperform favorites over the same time periods. 2a. Relative contrarian strategies provide superior returns over time.

The role of Affect applies on an industry-relative basis for most and least favored stocks, as it does to stocks on an absolute basis. 5. There are two distinct categories of earnings surprises: a. Event triggers—significant positive surprises on the lowest-valued group of stocks and major negative surprises on the highest-valued group. Both result in a consequential impact on the categories’ price movement. b. Reinforcing events—negative surprises in the lowest-valued group and positive surprises in the highest-valued group. Both have small relative impacts on stock movements. 6a. Surprise will… ([Location 4390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4390))

Even without the occurrence of an event trigger, the “best” and “worst” investments regress toward the market average over time, with the “best” stocks underperforming the “worst” ones, whether high price-to-book-value, high price-to-earnings, or high price-to-cash-flow ratio is considered, as chapter 9 demonstrated. 7. A significant part of current investment theory is dependent on accurate forecasting. The IOH predicts that: a. Analysts’ and economists’ consensus forecasts are overoptimistic over time. b. Analysts’ consensus forecasts on individual stocks will show substantial errors over time, resulting in significant mispricing of stocks on an almost continual basis. c. Analysts’ consensus forecasts on industries will also show substantial errors over time, resulting in significant mispricing of stocks on an almost continual basis. 8. Investor overoptimism occurs regularly in a number of important market activities, including: a. IPOs. b. Analysts’ and economists’ overoptimistic earnings estimates. 9. The overreaction occurs prior to the event trigger or other factors that lead to a reevaluation of the “best” and “worst” stocks. After the event trigger other reevaluation forces occur that continue the reversion to the mean. “Worst” stocks continue their rise in price and “best” stocks their fall for a period of years. 10.

- The fact that “best” and “worst” stocks continue to exist in all markets indicates that constant rational pricing, though a cherished EMH concept, has never existed. The investor overreaction hypothesis rejects EMH teaching and conclusions as they are currently presented almost en masse. 2. In many instances IOH is diametrically opposite in its assumptions and conclusions to EMH, and IOH reaches very different conclusions from EMH given the same facts. As we’ll soon see, a very different and hopefully improved method for measuring risk will be put forth. In the 1987 crash, for example, the investor overreaction hypothesis would have cautioned against the interaction of index arbitrage and portfolio insurance that led to a lethal market overreaction and the devastating panic that followed. One of IOH’s goals is to decrease the causes of major market overreactions and their sometimes devastating consequences. High levels of ([Location 4428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4428))

- leverage and liquidity have a long-standing record of creating serious downturns, often accompanied by panic. IOH would thus caution against high leverage and massive illiquidity, because of the dangers of a major overreaction. EMH risk theory ignores them entirely, because, under its assumptions, the only risk is volatility, although, as we saw in chapter 5, this situation resulted in three major panics and crashes. 3. Unlike EMH and general economic theory, the IOH does not accept the belief that equilibrium in markets has ever existed or will exist. In a dynamic, continually changing global economy, thousands of new political, economic, investment, and company-related inputs come up almost instantaneously and are immediately integrated into the marketplace. Decision making, as a result, is always changing, and this makes equilibrium as elusive as finding the Fountain of Youth. 4.

- manner that all too many economists have adopted using the rationality assumption. By comparison, the IOH has built its assumptions on recent well-proved findings of human behavior, and its conclusions are supported by strong statistical findings that investors do behave in the manner that the IOH predicts. It may fall short of a ten commandments for contrarians, but remember, all twelve predictions of the IOH have been confirmed to a high level of statistical probability in the studies reviewed in chapters 9 and 10.

- CONSTRUCTING YOUR PORTFOLIO How, then, can you build a portfolio that should outdistance the market while providing better protection when the bear growls? And, since a good sell discipline is one of the hardest things to develop, what guidelines should you use? The guidelines I’ll add in this chapter and the next, including several new ones based on the 2007–2008 market collapse, though certainly not guaranteed to get you out at the top (if you know of any that are, please write), have a high probability of success. But before figuring out when to sell to protect your profits, let’s figure out what to buy. Fortunately, there are four proven ways to do this.

- It’s surprising that the returns stayed as high as they did for so long. This indicates that the undervaluation of low-P/E stocks is very marked. Holding the lowest 20 percent of stocks for nine years (not shown) still provides above-market returns for the low-P/E group, with virtually no deterioration of performance from year 1. For high-P/E stocks, the overvaluation is just as significant (not shown). Even after five years, they continue to display much lower returns than the market. Another advantage of low-P/E and other contrarian strategies is that they don’t require a lot of work to be effective. As we just saw, rebalancing low-P/E portfolios annually with large-sized companies results in far-above-market returns. However, you could rebalance far less frequently. This is a low-intensity strategy with high-intensity results. You don’t have to spend much time agonizing over the stocks ([Location 4497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4497))

Just select your portfolio (we’ll look at how to do this shortly) and put it on automatic pilot. You’ll save annoyance, not to mention taxes, commissions, and transaction costs, this way. At the same time, you’ll outdistance the market by a comfortable margin, and as you know, few money managers can do that. The point of the chart is not to get you to hold a portfolio intact into eternity but to show that our normal work ethic of constantly being busy to be successful is not useful but often counterproductive in investing. Though I wouldn’t buy a portfolio and hold it without looking at it for eight years, Table 11-1 (a large sample of stocks over the last forty-one years) demonstrates that you can make big bucks in the market by positioning yourself carefully at the beginning and fine-tuning moderately thereafter.

- The strategy of buying the lowest 20 percent of stocks by either price to book value or price to cash flow, as we have seen, holds up through both bull and bear markets. Buying and holding portfolios of the lowest-price-to-cash flow and lowest-price-to-book-value stocks without any change in their composition for periods of two, three, five, and eight years (not shown) provide returns very similar to those of buying and holding the lowest-P/E portfolio (Table ([Location 4545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4545))

Investing in these two groups results in returns well above the market’s and sharply higher than the favored stocks in each group for every period up to eight years.10 The “best” stocks continue to underperform for these extended periods. Again we see that you don’t have to watch the market like a gunslinger, ready to slap leather at any new piece of information. Relax; you’ll probably make far more by taking your time. And there is the collateral reward of not shooting yourself in the foot by moving quickly and incorrectly, as is often the case with the pros. The final reward, and one of the most important, of the buy-and-hold approach, as indicated with low-P/E or the other low-price-to-value strategies, is that lower transaction costs and taxes can result in a substantial increase in your capital over time. Transaction costs are often not recognized by investors but can add up, particularly on less liquid stocks.

With the wide fluctuations of interest rates in recent decades, the bond market has actually been almost as volatile as the stock market.

Invest equally in thirty to forty stocks, diversified among fifteen or more industries (if your assets are of sufficient size). Diversification is essential.

- As we have seen, selecting stocks by their contrarian characteristics and placing no reliance on security analysis has given better-than-average returns over long periods of time. Should we, then, consider abandoning security analysis entirely? The evidence we’ve seen certainly shows that it doesn’t help much. However, I would not go quite this far (and not just because I’ve been thoroughly steeped in the doctrines of the Old Church). I believe parts of it can be valuable within a contrarian framework. Contrarian methods eliminate or downgrade those aspects of traditional analysis, such as forecasting, that have been shown to ([Location 4606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4606))

- be consistently error-prone. By recognizing the limitations of security analysis, you can, I believe, apply it to achieve even better results within the contrarian approach. However, for a lot of you, a well-diversified contrarian index fund built on the principles in this book would be a solid way to invest. Unfortunately, there are very few out there to choose from. Our firm manages a series of contrarian index funds from large cap to midcap to small cap.*64 Why there are so few baffles me. Over thirty years, contrarian performance has sharply outperformed the market and the various index funds out there, from small to mid to large. It’s an idea whose time has come, but it does require a pretty careful reading of the funds’ prospectuses as well as a thorough watch over their portfolios to make sure the fellers are actually managing the money the way they say they are.

- In my own application of the low-P/E approach, I select from the bottom 20 percent of stocks according to P/E. The lowest quintiles provide plenty of scope for applying the ancillary indicators that follow. If, after what you’ve seen, you are brave enough to dabble in security analysis, here are the indicators I consider most helpful: Indicator 1. A strong financial position. This card is essential in today’s market, where liquidity is hard to find. This is easily determinable for a company from information contained within its financial statements. (The definitions of the appropriate ratios—current assets versus current liabilities, debt as a percentage of capital structure, interest coverage, and so on—can all be found in any textbook on finance, as well as in material provided free of charge by some of the major brokerage houses.)*65 A strong financial position will enable a company to sail unimpaired through periods of operating difficulties, which contrarian companies sometimes experience. Financial strength is also important in deciding whether a company’s dividends can be maintained or increased. And of course in a liquidity crisis, such as the one that we have just gone through and that… ([Location 4621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4621))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Indicator 2. As many favorable operating and financial ratios as possible. This helps ensure that there are no structural flaws in the company. Again, the definitions of such ratios can be found in standard financial textbooks. Indicator 3. A higher rate of earnings growth than the S&P 500 in the immediate past and the likelihood that it will not plummet in the near future. Such estimates are an attempt not to pinpoint earnings but only to indicate their general direction. Remember that we are dealing with stocks in the bottom quintile, for which only the worst is expected. Unlike those who use conventional forecasting methods, we do not require precise earnings estimates; we need merely note their direction and only for short periods, usually about a year or so. In my initial contrarian work, I was more of a purist on this subject. I thought: since contrarian strategies worked at least in part because of analysts’ errors, why bother with forecasting at all? Some rather harsh experiences have caused me to modify this position. If, for example, the Street estimates that a company’s earnings are likely to be down for some time, I would not rush in to buy, no matter how positive my indicators appear to be. Often, as we’ve seen, analysts are overoptimistic. All too frequently, an estimated moderate decline in earnings turns into a drop off a cliff. This was the case with many of the financial stocks, from Citigroup to Wachovia to AIG, in 2007–2008, when the analysts were making estimates of relatively small declines in earnings, but those companies’ income had actually fallen off the cliff. The important distinction between forecasting the general direction of earnings and trying to derive precise earnings estimates is that the former method is far simpler and the probability that it will succeed much higher. Indicator 4. Earnings estimates should always lean to the conservative side. This ties in with Graham and Dodd’s margin of safety principle, even more so after our frightening trip through the lands of overoptimistic analysts. Sometimes you don’t need a pencil to recalibrate estimates to lower, more realistic levels; you need a large excavator to drop them down into their proper subterranean place. Remember, too, that by relying on general directional forecasts and keeping them ultraconservative, you are reducing the chance of error even… ([Location 4633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4633))

- Now that we have looked at five indicators that should prove helpful regardless of the contrarian strategy we use, I’ll turn briefly to another matter. A question I’m frequently asked is “What is the best approach to contrarian investing? Is it better to select one method, such as price to earnings or price to book value, and focus solely on it?” For me, the answer is no. Though you can certainly select one strategy and run with it successfully, once again I favor a more eclectic approach. Our money management firm uses the low-P/E method as its core strategy but also utilizes the other three contrarian strategies extensively. Investment opportunities vary, and often you can find exceptional value with one method that does not show up as clearly with another. Low P/E is probably the most accessible of the four contrarian strategies, because the information on P/E ratios is available daily in the financial section of any large newspaper, next to a stock’s price. The information is also updated quarterly, as are… ([Location 4654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4654))

An examination of their default ratios confirmed that over time their credit standards had been much higher for buyers to qualify for mortgages, and their default ratios had been much lower.

Most good companies do turn around, but when they don’t you get stung.

The card is then put back into the 164-quarter deck. We then randomly select another card in the same manner, calculate the return, and again put it back into the deck. This allows any quarter to be drawn more than once and other quarters to be missed entirely.

- If trends and fashions exist in the marketplace as a whole, it is reasonable from a psychological perspective to expect that they exist within specific industries.1 Analysts’ research, expert opinion, current prospects, and a host of other variables should work on investors’ expectations almost the same within industries as in the overall market. The result again should be expectations set too high for favored stocks within an industry and too low for out-of-favor stocks.

- Thus, Apple might be a favorite in the computer and peripheral industry, while Dell might be thought of as a laggard. Similarly, Chubb might be a favorite in the insurance industry, while Hartford is unloved and unwanted. Overpricing and underpricing of favored and unfavored stocks within value and growth industries would thus appear to be a natural extension of contrarian strategies. Sounds great in theory, but, unlike our academic friends, we’re going to ask a rude question: does it work? First we should ask how well the contrarian industry strategy does in the difficult environment we have recently experienced. The harsher the environment, the more accurate your judgment must be. Contrarian industry or relative strategies, like the absolute contrarian strategies we looked at in the preceding chapter, should also reduce the number of judgment errors significantly by not allowing us to overpay for stocks and not ([Location 4930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=4930))

Again, the results of investing in the most out-of-favor stocks within industries are similar to those of buying the most unpopular stocks overall; however, the industry returns are somewhat lower. As Table 12-1 indicates, the returns of the laggards continue to outperform the market but fall off more rapidly against it over longer periods of time than do absolute contrarian strategies. It is best to rebalance portfolios annually when this strategy is used. The returns of price to cash flow and price to book value (not shown) are also similar.

- Are these returns simply due to the superior performance of industries loaded with unloved stocks? No. The most out-of-favor stocks in an industry, regardless of whether they were dirt cheap or highly priced, outperformed the most popular stocks in each group and the market average. Low P/E beats high P/E, for example, by almost 50 percent. The evidence suggests that the relative value has a potent effect in all industries.4 So a new strategy is born. Let’s make that a Psychological Guideline to summarize the concept:   PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDELINE 26: Buy the least expensive stocks within an industry, as determined by the four contrarian strategies, regardless of how high or low the general price of the industry group is. This strategy will beat the market handily most of the time. The psychological reasons are identical to those behind the contrarian strategies we looked at previously. It appears that the driving force behind these surprising results is Affect, as it is with absolute contrarian strategies. Regardless of how high or low the stock is valued absolutely, it has a nearly identical influence on investors in choosing the most popular and least popular stocks in an industry, as it does on the most popular and least popular stocks in the market itself. The industry-relative price-to-value strategies appear to rely more on Affect than on fundamentals in the two periods ranging over the thirty-seven years the studies covered.

- investors, tired of being battered by bad advice, have moved into index funds, as have large numbers of their institutional counterparts. Index funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), now account for over $1 trillion of investment. The new research about buying the cheapest stocks in a group of major industries leads to excellent long-term returns, while allowing you the chance to participate in stocks across the board—any investor can use this formula. Our study indicates that the returns are well ahead of those of an index fund. Though it’s not a strategy for everybody, it will work for investors who can afford to own a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks: two in each industry across sixty-eight industries. This is not an index fund as such, because it does not own hundreds of stocks, but it does own the most unfavored stocks in each of the sixty-eight major industries.

- The advantage of the contrarian industry strategy is that you have far more diversification by industry than you do in the original contrarian strategies. This diversification should protect you from the underperformance that occurs when the most out-of-favor stocks and industries in the market are taboo. Thus, if industries such as communications equipment or biotechnology are headed for the stars, you will not feel left out. You will also not be positioned only in the most disliked groups, which may underperform for months or sometimes years.

With the inane focus on quarterly performance by too many consultants and clients continuing to increase, a manager who lags behind for too long can easily get the ax. True, he or she may prove right, but all too frequently it is “dead right.” For individuals, the psychological pressure to run for the hills is difficult or impossible to resist.

- To select contrarian stocks on your own, some simple rules should suffice. First, take a broad market index, like the S&P 500, for which the current P/E, price-to-cash-flow, and price-to-book-value ratios and dividend yield can easily be found in a variety of sources. The current P/E ratio of the S&P 500, in September 2011, was about 12х, its price-to-cash-flow ratio 7х, its price-to-book-value ratio 1.9х, and its yield 2.3 percent. Pick well-established companies. A rule of thumb might be to use a 20 percent discount or more from the S&P 500 for any of the first three measures and a yield of at least 1 percent above the market for the fourth. The deeper the discount from the S&P 500, the further into contrarian land you go. There is nothing magical about picking the bottom 20 percent by any of the first three measures. It’s simply a good cutoff point for a computer. As we found in virtually all of the contrarian studies, this group consistently outperformed the market.

- What contrarian strategies should do is give you the best relative opportunities for your capital, particularly in the present difficult environment. This means that in a falling market, your stocks ought to decline less than the averages, and in a rising market, they should perform somewhat better. But remember that averages are deceptive. Even if contrarian stocks provide better returns in most bear markets, they don’t do so for all bear markets. Similarly, though contrarian strategies provide far-above-average returns over time, they don’t do so every time. Think of yourself as the owner of a casino. The odds in your favor are extremely high, but in this financial casino, unlike a regular casino, you will have a few years of poor results, as was the case from 1997 to 2000 or 2007 to 2008, eventually followed by some years of staggering returns.

- But in my opinion from what we’ve seen, in these two recent periods of market crisis, one strategy stands out. The HFT traders use their enormous speed, measured in thousands of a second, to accentuate market moves up or down. If markets are down a few hundred points, as in the ([Location 5249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5249))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- flash crash, and selling begins to pick up, HFT firms short S&P futures or other stock vehicles heavily. All of this is computer driven because of the enormous speed required. HFT firms can also be very active on openings and closings, when the market is down or up fairly sharply, accentuating the moves in either direction significantly. It would seem the algorithms of most HFT firms are programmed similarly for this type of scenario, so if one flash trader begins to short the computerized algorithms of many others, HFT firms fire off short sell orders almost instantaneously. We have already seen how this tactic worked in the flash crash to drop the Dow 600 points in eight to ten minutes and can lead to widespread contagion in the marketplace. The panic moves through the S&P stock futures pits into the stock market itself and results in the selling of individual stocks. As we saw in the flash crash, the carnage was very heavy, with many stocks dropping as much as 40 to 60 percent.

- We also know that the HFT firms fire off enormous numbers of bids or offers for futures and stocks in milliseconds and cancel them a few milliseconds later. Some of the reasons given seem valid, such as trying to uncover a buyer’s position. But this is very different from placing enormous orders that they don’t intend to follow through on. The latter practice in a sharply falling market is dubious at best. One reason in a panicky market might be to drive prices even lower. If a flotilla of HFT firms are attempting to drive prices down and a large tidal wave of flash sell orders show up on the screen, canceled in milliseconds, other investors can easily be fooled into thinking that heavy potential waves of selling will hit the floor in seconds, resulting in investors and traders selling immediately to escape the deluge. The same strategy may apply in a market which is rising substantially, only in this case the tactics would be used to keep the market rising, and if possible on an accelerated basis.

- How can we stop this major threat to markets? It won’t be easy. As we saw, we faced a similar situation during the 1987 crash because of the interaction of index arbitrage and portfolio insurance. However, in 1987, the explosion was accidental, while here it seems to be intentional. HFT seems to be a far more effective weapon to keep volatility high over prolonged periods of time, if not dealt with quickly. One solution might be to raise the margin requirements up to 25 or even 50 percent for these firms on the stock futures they trade. Another would be to place limits on the size of positions they can buy or sell very quickly in S&P 500 and other futures, which do disrupt markets. A third is the SEC’s proposal in late September to set tighter limits on circuit breakers, reducing them down to 7 percent from 10 percent, and using the much broader S&P 500 instead of the Dow Jones Industrial ([Location 5280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5280))

- Average.16 A fourth is to increase the transaction costs per share slightly on trades.

- However, there is something you can do to avoid being bloodied in the interim. High-frequency traders can profit big-time from a panicky market that they’ve created, though most traders would swear on their mothers’ lives that it isn’t true. To avoid this, do not put in stop-loss or sell-at-the-market orders. Instead, always put in limit orders, which limit the price at which a broker can sell. If you do this, your stock, derivative, or futures contracts cannot be sold off many points down in a crash. Don’t use stop-loss orders until the problem is cleared up, or you could lose big. Stop-loss orders worked in the past, but, given HFT, they could be as bad in these times as Russian roulette.

- Buy-and-Weed Strategies We’ve looked at the success of buy-and-hold strategies. A twist to this approach is to buy a portfolio of contrarian stocks and weed it periodically of stocks if they move up to or above the market ratios or if they fail to perform as well as the market after a certain time, at the same time replacing the stocks sold with new contrarian stocks. If, for example, you owned a low-P/E portfolio of forty stocks with roughly 21/2 percent in each holding and sold 10 percent of it, you would replace the 10 percent with four low-P/E stocks each with about a 21/2 percent portfolio weighting. An overview of the studies indicates that returns normally diminish with long holding periods (five to six years or more). Some methods, such as this, should raise overall return above that of the simple buy-and-hold strategy. The pruning process should also allow you to maintain a portfolio of contrarian stocks with above-average yields. In any case, whichever strategy you choose, you should have a good chance of outdoing the market while taking below-average risk and spending minimal time making selections.

- Another important consideration is that when you buy foreign companies, you are taking an exchange-rate risk that can greatly add to or detract from your total return. In the years that foreign markets outpaced those in the United States, the gains were often more a consequence of a weak dollar than of strong markets overseas. Thus, when the dollar dropped in recent years, a good part of the fabulous returns on foreign portfolios—trumpeted in many funds’ advertising—was not from the markets themselves but from the fact that stocks were simply worth more because of the cheaper U.S. dollar, as may be the case again ([Location 5434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5434))

If the stock was originally purchased at $20 with the sell target at $40, and it shot through $40, a manager would often bump the sell price higher. Forty would become $50; $50 would be stretched to $60. This frequently resulted in the manager’s taking the “round trip”: riding a stock all the way up, only to ride it all the way down again.

- For example, assume we are using the low-P/E strategy and the market P/E is 16х. If one of our stocks (say, Chevron), bought at a P/E of 10х, went up to 16х, we would sell it and replace it with another low-P/E stock.*79 The first guideline, then, is simple: pick a sell point when you buy a stock. If it reaches that point, grit your teeth, brace yourself, and get rid of it. You will probably be unhappy because the issue will often go higher. But why be greedy? You’ve made a good gain, and that’s what the game is all about. (The only exception is when you have an almost sure takeover situation.) Picking a sell point, however, doesn’t necessarily mean selling a stock just because it has gone up. If you are a low-price-to-book-value (P/BV) player, you may find that even after a stock has risen sharply it still sells at a below-market P/BV because its book value has continued to go up. Often, stocks remain at low P/BVs for years, despite doubling or even tripling in price, because their book value has also doubled or tripled, keeping the P/BV ratio low. The same is true for low-price-to-earnings and low-price-to-cash-flow ratios, and high dividend yields. Another question is how long you should hold a stock that has not worked out. Investors all too often fall in love with their holdings. I have seen portfolios loaded with dozens of companies that look good on paper but have long been dogs in the market, resulting in poor returns. Again, there are many partial answers to this problem, but I think two and a half to three years… ([Location 5489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5489))

I’m talking not about a poor quarter or a temporary surprise that a stock will snap back from but about major changes that weaken a company’s prospects, as the financial crisis did with scores of financial stocks. Under these conditions, I have found that taking your lumps immediately and moving on usually results in the smallest loss. To summarize: don’t be stubborn, don’t be greedy, and don’t be afraid to take small losses. Above all, when you buy a stock, make a mental decision as to the level at which you will sell it—and stick to that decision.

A switch might then be made, but keep in mind the principle of a fixed number of stocks in the portfolio: each time one is purchased, another should be sold. Because you are bringing in more judgment in switching, and therefore more opportunity for error, changes of this sort should be relatively rare in order to avoid the dangers of overtrading. Or, as horse players like to say, “Stay away from the switches.” A supplementary rule, which I followed for years, was not to sell a stock that attained a high P/E multiple solely because of a decline in earnings, either through a large onetime charge or because of temporary business conditions.

- It all seemed so simple under efficient markets. Mr. Risk, aka Mr. Volatility, was a real mensch. He told you exactly who he was and what he did, and for decades we loved him for telling us expressly how much risk we could take to fine-tune our portfolios as precisely as a violin virtuoso tunes his strings. We thought we had finally caged the risk devil that had run amok since the beginning of history. But then things began to change. We are increasingly finding out in this new, more difficult investment world that Mr. Volatility is not the mensch he claimed to be. In fact, he began to seem more like a heavy, a wise guy who ordered investors around, threatening them when they asked why their returns weren’t what was promised if they followed his recommendations. Let’s translate that into slightly more technical terms. As we’ve discussed, beta and other ([Location 5537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5537))

- volatility measures were introduced as objective gauges of risk, promising no more messy, inaccurate human guesses, and beta in particular became the touchstone calculation of risk in efficient-market theory. That was all to the good, except for one small problem that became apparent from the long-term performance data of the stock market: greater (or lesser) volatility did not correlate with the actual returns. Mr. Volatility’s numbers just didn’t work. Oh, he was more than articulate, and he proposed an elegant theory that was so easy to understand that most investors happily anchored their portfolio strategies on it. But he encountered the same argument made by Thomas Huxley, who defended Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution against avid creationists more than 150 years ago. Huxley said back then of creationist thinking, “The great tragedy of Science [is]—the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.” As if the data were not enough, we saw in chapter 2 that the untested economic theory of ([Location 5543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5543))

- risk collides head-on with Affect research findings about risk behavior. Over a number of experiments, Affect research has found that risk and benefits are negatively correlated. Taking on higher risk results in lower, not higher, perceived benefits, and conversely, taking on less risk results in higher perceived rewards. These findings are the direct opposite of core EMH risk beliefs. Finally, the headlong charge into aggressive stocks in mania after mania, stocks that were characterized as low risk but were actually highly volatile, certainly at least partially documents the validity of the recent findings in Affect research. From the beginning, then, this hypothesis of risk seemed unrealistic. And with time its problems only became larger. Once again, and from a surprising source, modern risk theory is being questioned. Nonetheless, as we discussed, when the assertion that volatility is the best measure of risk couldn’t be proved, rather than giving up on the concept, its advocates started altering their calculations of volatility in the hope of finding a new correlation between the two. They continued to put… ([Location 5551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5551))

- As we’ve discussed, liquidity played the crowning role in the 1987 crash. A serious but little realized problem is that liquidity can vary sharply with changing market conditions. The efficient-market hypothesis assumes that “liquidity begets liquidity,” meaning that as prices fall, swarms of buyers will appear. However, there is no proof that this has ever been accurate, but a good deal of evidence that in periods of severe strain, liquidity dries up, in the face of sharp drops in price. Recall that this occurred with S&P 500 futures markets during the 1987 crash. ([Location 5601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5601))

Both using too much leverage and having too little liquidity seem to be by-products of strong positive Affect.

- Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit (1921),1 stated that there is a major difference between risk and uncertainty. Risk, according to him, was “a quantity susceptible of measurement,” while uncertainty is not capable of being measured. By his definition risk applies to many types of gambling games, horse racing, betting on baseball and football, and many other activities—anything where the risks can be calculated. Uncertainty applies to situations where the gains or losses are indeterminate either on the upside or on the downside, such as the value of stocks in a revolutionary period, shorting futures or derivatives positions and leverage on real estate, or scores of similar situations. By far the most dangerous new risk over the past sixty years has been inflation, which can attack our savings in… ([Location 5674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5674))

- in this country and similar periods abroad. Inflation was a minuscule one-tenth of 1 percent from 1802 to 1870 and six-tenths of 1 percent from 1871 to 1925.2 When all major nations were on the gold standard, most government and many corporate bonds could be redeemed in either the national currency or gold at maturity at the holder’s option. Given that inflation was almost nil, the “prudent-man” rule was introduced by Justice Samuel Putnam of the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1830 and has served as an important guideline for money management for 150 years. A prudent man did not speculate, according to Putnam, who directed trustees “to observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their own affairs” and act accordingly. So it made the best sense to stay in bonds with a number of preferred shares and a sprinkling of blue-chip stocks.3 But risk is a cunning beast, and inflation is a major weapon it unleashes against our capital, stealthily sneaking through our defenses time and again. Inflation caught investors following Justice Putnam’s prudent-man edict flatfooted after World War II. Anyone who had put $100,000 into bonds at the end of that war would have $280,000 in 1946 purchasing power left today.4 However, that’s before income taxes, which averaged 60 percent between 1946 and 2010.

The investor then merrily selects a portfolio made up of risk-free and riskier assets, measured by their volatility, to get the optimum mix. The trouble is that the “risk-free asset” of the academic theory, the T-bill, is one of the riskiest assets over time.

- The major risk is not the short-term stock-price volatility measurements, which have been shown to be specious. Rather, it is the possibility of not reaching your long-term investment goal through the growth of your funds in real terms. It is counterproductive for investors with investing time horizons of thirty, twenty, ten, or even five years to focus on short-term fluctuations. Shorter-term volatility measurements provide an illusion of safety while derailing the higher returns that are provided by holding equity or equity-equivalent products (real estate, housing, better-grade private-equity investments, and so on) over time.

A realistic definition of risk recognizes the potential loss of capital through inflation and taxes and includes at least the following two ([Location 5806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5806))

- A further Psychological Guideline is in order here.   PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDELINE 33(a): Try to ignore near-term market fluctuations; if you intend to be invested for a five-year or longer period, the true risk is in not owning stocks or similar investments that appreciate faster than the rate of inflation over time. PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDELINE 33(b): Unless yields are very high, don’t consider bonds, savings accounts, or other low-interest fixed-income securities as longer-term investments. They are high-risk vehicles with the odds heavily against them; the longer they’re held, the greater the risk. Consider them only as a repository of cash for short- to intermediate-term needs.

- Professor Knight’s distinction between risk and uncertainty holds a very important lesson for us here. The performance of the stock and bond markets is uncertain for any short period of time. But over time the uncertainty turns into risk. Risk is our friend if the odds are heavily in our favor, as they are with stocks. What we must remember is that for stocks and similar investments, risk turns into an increasingly high probability of winning over time.*85 ([Location 5897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004T4KRDS&location=5897))
