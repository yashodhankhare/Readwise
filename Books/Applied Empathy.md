## Highlights
- Empathy is a squishy word. Sometimes it’s confused with sympathy or misinterpreted as “being nice.” That isn’t empathy. Empathy is about understanding. Empathy lets us see the world from other points of view and helps us form insights that can lead us to new and better ways of thinking, being, and doing. The words business and empathy are rarely used together—in fact, for some of us they might even sound oxymoronic, but there are incredible benefits to taking on others’ perspectives in the context of our professional lives. That’s what Applied Empathy is about. Empathy is not some out-of-reach mystical power. Instead it is a skill that each of us can make a part of our daily practice and ultimately bring into the organizations we serve. This book presents a set of tools and ideas for applying empathy to: ([Location 21](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=21))

- • Understanding your customers’ needs and improving your products and services by infusing them with rich, meaningful insights gleaned from a newfound perspective. • Connecting and collaborating with your teams more effectively—understanding the skills and styles of each person and how to get the most out of your interactions. • Leading with a new awareness that will undoubtedly aid you in not only understanding others better but, perhaps more important, understanding the truest aspects of your own self.

- Another more recent example of a lack of empathic leadership can be seen in the music industry’s inglorious failure to participate in the digital music revolution. While executives stretched their travel and expense accounts to the max and obsessed over CD distribution deals with brick-and-mortar retailers, Napster and LimeWire were hard at work building a completely new, and more empathic, distribution ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=44))

Missing that opportunity crushed the major music labels’ business and gave rise to powerhouses such as Apple Music and Spotify.

- My own company, Sub Rosa, is a strategy and design studio that works with large, often complex corporations as well as progressive thinkers in government, entertainment, and the start-up world to help them evolve their businesses with empathy. We have worked with some of the world’s most recognizable companies and leaders, and I’m proud that those clients have sought us out because we offer fresh solutions that support their need to explore, learn, and grow.

- Empathy lets us better understand the people we are trying to serve and gives us perspective and insight that can drive greater, more effective actions. The seemingly magical quality of empathy is the connection it helps us form with other people. Some of us are born with an overwhelming degree of empathy, while others are callous or even blind to the perspectives of others. The rest of us fall somewhere in between. But empathy is more than just a natural talent; it can also be a process, a learned skill, developed and applied when and where needed.

- Honing your ability to view a situation from a perspective other than your own is one of the first things you must do to gain a stronger sense of empathy. The challenge comes in dropping your biases and points of view, which will free you to truly “see” from someone else’s vantage. To begin, take a moment to identify an issue you are trying to solve. It can be a personal or a professional challenge. Some workplace examples might include: • How can I build a better product for our customers? • What is the smartest way to grow my organization? • Who are the people I need on my team in order to be successful? ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=344))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Or personal questions such as: • Why do I have a hard time communicating my emotions to my partner? • How can my family connect to each other on a deeper level? • What do my friends rely on me for the most? Once you’ve identified the right question, you’ll want to establish three (or more) different perspectives you can use to evaluate it from new angles. For example, if I were to take “How can I build a better product for our customers?” I might consider: • My own perspective • My customers’ perspective • My competitors’ perspective You will discover distinct insights as you consider the question from different perspectives. Let’s say I’m a smartphone manufacturer and I want to improve my product. I might think I should increase its functionality, but it turns out that my customers care more about paying a lower price than having more features. Or perhaps I think the phone would be improved by faster speed, but then I discover that my competitors’ ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=351))

- greatest concern is that we have a more powerful design capability. If I were to pursue this from only my perspective, I would focus on increasing the smartphone’s functionality and speed. But taking into account the perspectives of my customers and my competitors, I realize that I need to deliver a more affordable product that continues to push the limits of good design while also fulfilling the function that I believe is right for the product. Considering a question from multiple perspectives will help you make more well-rounded and better decisions. Play around with the idea of perspectives. The “personal/customer/competitor” configuration is just one of many you can devise. You might find that some problems benefit from being viewed through another set of points of view, such as “colleague/elder/child.” You may find you need to do some research to understand the different perspectives. Talk to your customers or your competitors. Read articles or watch content that you think different audiences might consume. Play the part. Embody their point of view. Think of it as part ethnography and part method acting. There’s no wrong way to do this. Experiment with a variety of perspectives; just be sure they are varied ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=360))

- I recognize that empathy sounds great, and of course everyone wants to be perceived as an empathic person. However, what we’ve discovered is that using empathy in your work often makes it harder, not easier. You have to listen, and you might not like what you hear. Real empathy, deep understanding and connection, is tough to create and even tougher to maintain day after day.

- About a year later, the other leaders in the company and I realized we needed to have a better understanding of our underlying philosophy—essentially, how we do what we do. Having worked with so many clients going through their own growth spurts, we knew how valuable it would be to take the time to do a proper assessment of our company, its culture, and its processes in order to establish a clear point of view. After all, we were the company our clients had partnered with to do that kind of work. We decided to make ourselves our own best client. We pulled together a team of some of our best and brightest people. We drew up a scope, one that was similar to the type of assignment we used with our own clients, and we got to work. Our first step was to examine our best client case studies and ask what we’d done well and why it was so effective. The GE mammography assignment was one my colleagues and I dug into intensely. We knew it shone a light on our ability to delve deeply into a situation, to understand it from all sides, and to use that insight—that empathic understanding—as a way of pushing through a problem and into a solution. We believed that if we studied that case and others like it, we would unearth something powerful—our own empathy origin story.

- I found myself scribbling notes whenever I observed different ways that others on our team and I were being empathic. Some people couldn’t resist asking “Why?” until they got to the heart of a problem. That approach, popularized by Sakichi Toyoda of the Toyota Motor Company, has become known as the “5 Whys.” It is based on the belief that after asking “Why?” five times, you can get to the root of what’s happening. That was Toyoda’s way of being empathic, of seeking to understand a person or problem in its most essential state.

- We designed the seven Empathic Archetypes as personas that an individual can slip into and use as a way of getting out of his or her own head, role, or organizational hierarchy. Even during the process of creating the archetypes, they began to lead us toward new perspectives and greater understanding. Before we dive into what the archetypes are, it bears mentioning that I’ve always been drawn to the mystical. The iconography, language, and symbols of ancient texts have been a fascination of mine for as long as I can remember. These elements even influenced the creation of the Sub Rosa brand.

- subtly forms a triangle—a key symbol of sacred geometry evoking stability. Even the phrase sub rosa is a Latin term used to denote confidentiality. To speak “sub rosa” means you are speaking to someone you can entrust with your secrets. That captured the spirit of what we wanted in our client relationships. We wanted people to know they could come to us with their concerns and challenges. Those were the kinds of topics we wanted to tackle. I wanted clients to know it was safe to share their most important issues with us—things they needed a trusted partner to understand and keep in strict confidence.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- We narrowed our empathic archetypes to seven, and each one was crafted to elevate and celebrate ancestral and sacred practices for understanding the psyche, creating deeper connections, and practicing self-discovery. These archetypes are not gimmicks; their iconography is as old as time. They come to life through their behaviors. An archetype and its behavior represent a way of being that can be applied to almost any task. We now use the seven empathic archetypes to govern the way we work and collaborate.

- SEVEN EMPATHIC PERSONAS, SEVEN ARCHETYPES 1. The Sage Be present: Inhabit the here and now. We discovered the Sage during our work with GE when we realized that deep insight can emerge when we are fully present in a space together. During this project, we had a few ground rules that helped us to remain fully present in our SoHo space: no phones, no computers, no cross talk. Those simple behaviors led our team members to be respectful, contemplative, and fully in the moment with one another. We saw how those simple behavioral adjustments created an environment in which deeper understanding could be attained. The Sage represents wisdom and the ability to be fully in the moment, sensing truths about the mind, body, and surrounding space, examining what is brought into the moment and what is meant to be taken away. Look to the Sage when a situation becomes untethered from the present and disconnected from reality. Relying on this archetype will help you bring people and their ideas back to the here and now. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=527))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- 2. The Inquirer Question: Interrogate assumed truths. The Inquirers on our team have strengths that harken back to the lessons of the “5 Whys.” They are deeply curious question askers who don’t stop at the first response but probe deeper, looking for more complete understanding. We saw this emerge in the mammography assignment when we began asking why the examination rooms were so cold. By asking this over and over, going deeper down the rabbit hole, we eventually reached an opportunity for improvement that was a key to our success. The Inquirer is one part reporter, another part therapist. This archetype challenges preconceived notions and pushes for deeper, more authentic truths. Inquirers neglect small talk in favor of “big” talk: deep questions that demand contemplative responses. Always intrigued by the “why” behind each answer, Inquirers dig and dig until they reach the root. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=536))

- 3. The Convener Host: Anticipate the needs of others. So much of the overall experience we created in SoHo was a result of this archetype. The Conveners on our team knew that establishing a sense of community would bring out the truth from everyone with whom we interacted. Everything from the furnishings to the food and drink was selected to inspire a sense of safety, security, and comfort. That provided all of our participants the comfort they needed so they could drop into deep conversation quickly. From that we got loads of information—both verbally and nonverbally—that helped us design a better overall patient experience. The consummate host, the Convener understands the importance of space and space holding. Recognizing that every detail is critical, the Convener creates a… ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=544))

- 4. The Alchemist Experiment: Test and learn at all costs. The Alchemist emerged when we built waiting rooms and prototype exam rooms. They were spaces where we were able to experiment and test different ways in which women experience a mammogram. Such behavior is prevalent in many of the projects we analyzed in developing the archetypes and is a powerful tool often used in many innovation and design firms. The willingness to test and learn is an empathic behavior that delivers powerful understanding and impactful solutions. Never afraid to fail in the pursuit of knowledge, the Alchemist tests everything, confident that the best work comes only from countless hours of experimentation. The Alchemist is curious,… ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=552))

- 5. The Confidant Listen: Develop the ability to observe and absorb. Creating a sense of confidence is paramount to the work we do. For GE, we knew that once we created a private, safe environment, the participants would become more open about describing the fears and anxieties involved in the mammography experience. We had the space covered by the Convener, but we needed to show up in the space and listen. Our team brought a sense of patience and a willingness to open up to each participant. We listened fully and absorbed every ounce of information the women shared with us. In many ways, this is a strategist’s first and primary skill: to shut off the inner dialogue and purely listen. Over time, I began to see how the Confidant was showing up not only on this project but on many others as well. Your trusted ally, the Confidant hears to listen—instead of simultaneously planning what to say next. The Confidant embodies stillness; listens, observes, and absorbs. Keeping… ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=560))

- 6. The Seeker Dare: Be confident and fearless. Seekers are daring. They are confident and fearless. Frankly, if we hadn’t had a bit of the Seeker running within us, we probably couldn’t have undertaken the mammography project at all. The Seeker gave us the assuredness we needed to take on such a daunting challenge and be unafraid to do things differently. I have discovered in my own self-work that I often operate from this archetype. Entrepreneurs are inherent risk-takers, and they must dare in order to be successful. A boundless explorer, the Seeker bravely sets out on new adventures. The Seeker lives outside his or her comfort zone, acts with confidence and… ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=570))

- 7. The Cultivator Commit: Nurture with purpose and intentionally grow. Cultivators have powerful vision. They understand that we commit to things today as a way of getting what we want in the future. Most people get so caught up in the day-to-day that they lose sight of the long game. The Cultivator remembers to maintain a state of empathy for the point he or she is working toward, even if it’s far out on the horizon. In our work with GE, we constantly reminded our team that the work we were doing was bigger than selling more machinery. It was about improving the overall patient experience and potentially having an impact on the lives of those involved. The Cultivator is committed to developing ideas and is intentional about every action. Through the Cultivator, you can connect everything you do to the development and maintenance of your thoughts and work. When… ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=578))

- We can now begin to build a deeper familiarity with the seven Empathic Archetypes. A method we’ve found helpful is to think about someone in your life or the world who personifies each archetype the most. Think of this exercise as discovering your archetype exemplars. To some, the Convener, whose behavior is to host, immediately brings to mind Martha Stewart or other well-known lifestyle gurus. Others might imagine a maître d’ at their favorite restaurant or their yoga instructor. Each of these perfectly embodies the spirit of the Convener. Assign to each archetype a real-life person who embodies its behavior. Doing so will… ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=588))

- Self-Assessment and Application Once you have a better understanding of the archetypes, it’s time to connect with your personal strengths and weaknesses. You must be honest with yourself about this work. No one is evenly distributed across all seven archetypes; a good way to determine where you index on each of them is to personalize them. Personalizing the Archetypes Reread each of the archetypes, keeping in mind the real-life exemplars you have assigned to each one. Now, for each archetype, look back on your own life and identify a moment in your past where you clearly embodied the archetype fully. Remember how it felt when you were in that moment. Were you happy? Anxious? At ease? As you do this exercise, journal your memories of these experiences. Consider how easy or hard it was for you to… ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=594))

- you to understand your strengths and weaknesses across all seven archetypes. Use the spider graph on the next page, or one you sketch yourself, to plot where you felt most to least comfortable with each archetype, and a clear picture will start to emerge. With this assessment of where you stand with the strengths and weaknesses of each archetype, you can begin “trying on” each one. One of the ways I try to improve my ability to shift among archetypes with greater ease is by pushing myself to work through the ones that make me the most uncomfortable. You can also identify specific ways you can “show up” in the perspective of a particular archetype and make them part of your daily practice. For example, let’s look at the Alchemist, whose behavior is testing and learning, experimentation at all costs. Ask yourself each day how you can challenge yourself to experiment. It doesn’t have to be huge. You don’t need to dive into particle physics. Perhaps you have always been intimidated by cooking. Now is your chance to pick up some groceries and make something for yourself. You will probably not… ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=602))

- But too often the solutions the consultants produce are disconnected from the implementation. They haven’t been crafted by implementers, and as a result, they sometimes miss the key elements needed to bring the strategy or solution to life. In a word, the consultants lack empathy. Though I didn’t know it back in my college days, the connection between thinking and doing, between recommending and acting—that is what real empathic problem-solving requires.

- After my first session with Gil, I spent the next week opening countless doors, only to realize on the other side that my right hand was recoiling from the handle and returning to my side. “I did it again,” I’d tell myself. It was beyond frustrating. I couldn’t believe that something as simple as opening a door with my nondominant hand could be so difficult. But I wasn’t in the moment. I was unconsciously moving through life while my mind continued to race through an inner monologue at a million miles an hour. Of Gil’s many gifts, his ability to help others see this about themselves was one of his best. He knew how to assign a simple action, something that would require presence and discipline and that, if adhered to over time, would lead to a heightened sense of self-awareness. That’s what the doorknob assignment did. It made me realize that I was rarely, if ever, actually ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=673))

- present. To put it another way, I had no empathy for myself. I was completely detached and had no real understanding of who I was or where I was. I was always thinking about something else. Where I was going. The meeting I had just left. What I wanted for dinner. Anything other than the present moment—or even the door in front of me and the conscious act of opening it with my left hand. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=679))

- I kept trying to master the door-opening exercise and would return to Gil time after time, lamenting that I wasn’t getting it. Eventually, after about four months of work, I was able to proclaim my success. “I’m doing it, Gil!” He smiled a half-grin and said, “Good. Now switch back.” It took me a few more months of the exercise before I began to figure out what it was really about. I had begun to breathe more slowly. I was in my body. I was becoming more present. I was learning how to quiet the inner dialogue that had me running around like a madman. I was beginning to understand my inner self. That was what Gil had been striving for all along. He was dismantling some of my bad internal habits. He was helping me to see the different “I’s” that were driving my actions. Some days it was a manic “I” who couldn’t stop thinking about work and clients and managing the growing complexity of the company. Other “I’s” were self-destructive, self-indulgent, or simply lazy. I got to know all of them and was able to see that each of them was a lesser version of the man ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=691))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I wanted to become. The nearly constant state of self-observation Gil had put me into had helped me notice when the wrong “I” was showing up and trying to run the show. So in a way, Gil saved my life. He didn’t pull me from a burning building or take a bullet for me, but he might as well have. He stepped in front of a false version of myself that was at the wheel of my mind and body. He spotted in me a more essential, more capable “I” and over time, with additional training and dialogue, he helped me regain control of a self that was careening toward disaster. Sometimes a session with Gil seemed like talk therapy. I’d go on and on about what was happening in my daily life, and he would let me talk as his silent gaze looked into something deeper. After I had rambled on for probably thirty minutes, he’d usually ask a sharp and powerful question such as “Why do you think I should care about any of this?” or “Who’s talking right now?” Those questions would knock me back and make me rethink everything I’d just said.

- Philosophers and psychologists have suggested for years that each of us is made up of many “selves.” Carl Jung referred to them as opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. William James is quoted as saying, “Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him.” ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=715))

- which I was becoming more aware of myself through action and movement. He was pushing me to get into touch with my physical presence, to inhabit the here and now, and to be in command of my own body. Without this sort of presence, any other more cerebral pursuits are futile. Next is our Emotional Self, which connects us to our personal needs and our inner voice, giving us a means to achieve greater understanding and self-knowledge. This self helps us understand our biases, our fears, and our self-imposed limitations and constrictions. Talk therapy is a great way to explore this realm of the self. This therapy is often diagnostic, and ideally, when effective, it can lead to actionable behavioral changes that help us come into our true “self.” The Inspired Self is the spark that ignites the inherent desire to make, to do, and to solve. We engage with this self when we establish goals or intentions we want to pursue and then take the steps to act upon them. Think about the times you’ve set a goal for yourself, then acted upon it and accomplished it.

- ourselves back from a deeper, more whole sense of understanding and personal growth. Having grasped our physical, emotional, and inspired states of being, we can begin to look at how we fit within the context of the world around us. What role do we play among our family, friends, and colleagues? This is the Community Self, and it helps us understand how our individual self interacts with the world around us. What type of person are we at work? At home? Do people rely on us the same way? Do we provide different things to different people, or are our core aspects of ourselves relied upon in a similar way irrespective of the people around us? The Community Self helps us know what others most often rely upon us to do and helps us contextualize the “fit” of our relationships. If people ask us to behave in a manner consistent with our own views and the intent of our Whole Self, we can work with others effectively. But when we are urged to deviate from our authentic self, to act in ways that pull us from our core beliefs, it is often an indicator that we need to do some personal work to… ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=735))

- perspective and communicate it effectively. At times our emotions are complex and hard to manage. How many times have you acted out of anger and said something you shouldn’t have? Or been so overjoyed that you saw a situation through rose-colored glasses, obscuring the reality? The Intellectual Self helps put our emotions and senses into concepts and words that help us understand what’s going on inside us and relate more effectively to those around us. Mindfulness is an ancient topic that has become increasingly popular again. The growing interest in meditation, from tried-and-true forms such as Vedic and Zen meditation to more contemporary modalities such as Transcendental Meditation (TM) and facilitation tools such as the popular app Headspace, have helped people the world over to become more conscious and aware. It’s no coincidence that in these trying times, we are seeing more people, of all demographics and psychographics, begin to explore a more mindful state of being. This is the nature of the Mindful Self. This self’s primary function is to raise our consciousness for the present moment, our relationship with the world around us in this moment, and our place in it. Once we had outlined these six selves—the Physical, Emotional, Inspired, Community, Intellectual, and Mindful—I thought about what these different facets of our inner workings add up to. What kind of clarity do they create? For me, they come together in an awareness of our Aspirational Self. Some might call this our purpose. This is what we strive for and constantly pursue. It clarifies the vision we have of our growth and what we see as the necessary steps to getting us there. It is in our nature to grow, to learn lessons, and to evolve. Many great spiritual teachers, spanning all religions and sects, have shared this lesson with us for millennia. The pursuit and acceptance of the Aspirational Self allows our lives to gain meaning. Having a sense of our greater purpose is like the magnetism that keeps a compass needle pointing toward the north. With clarity of purpose, we can make choices and take actions clear-mindedly.

- We looked at the seven aspects of the Whole Self and applied each one to the feet and the experience of running; and then we considered how we could integrate those insights with the whole body and mind. Soon an outline for our strategy began to form. • The Physical Self: We would use the feet as part of the overall product launch. • The Emotional Self: We would find a way to heighten the emotional response to the activity of placing the feet on the ground (or floor). • The Inspired Self: We would create an experience that would prompt participants to want to learn more about the barefoot running trend. • The Community Self: We would design the experience in a way that would compel the participants to connect with one another about what had happened to them. • The Intellectual Self: We would provoke a sense of curiosity in the participants by communicating ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=787))

We focused attention and awareness at the physical body level. • The Emotional Self: By using different textures on the floor, as well as the light and sound triggers, we created external stimuli that gave the participants something that engaged their emotions. They were sometimes confused, sometimes peaceful, and sometimes excited, but all of them said they had run through a range of emotions as they walked through the space. • The Inspired Self: Each participant came away more fully aware of his or her states of awareness and relaxation. Many of them said they were inspired to think about their bodies differently and to consider how small changes in their routines could have an impact on their overall well-being. Many went away with new goals or ambitions for their personal training routines. • The Community Self: Though this was an individual experience, many of the participants ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=854))

They understood Nike’s philosophy and technology better, and they could see how the technology could help them understand their own selves better. • The Mindful Self: We engaged with people at a mindful level, and they engaged with themselves. They knew their connection to the space around them more intimately. Their senses were heightened, and their ability to feel the world around them was ultimately enhanced. • The Aspirational Self: In the end, many participants walked away having moved their understanding of themselves a little further down the field. They had learned something meaningful about themselves and were more committed to changing or pushing themselves in a new or different way to more fully experience their mind-body connection.

They spill from our lips regularly when we talk about businesses and their products. But we’re missing something—or overlooking it—when we talk in this way. Whether consciously or subconsciously, we are forgetting that a “company” isn’t doing any of those things—it’s the people inside the company who make everything happen. We know that companies are made up of people, which might seem like an overly simplistic observation.

- the business world often leaves out the people at the heart of companies. The more empathic versions are these: “I’ve loved every product its designers create.” “That team is far and away the best in the industry.” “The leaders of that company are praised for how they treat their employees.” Notice a difference? When we speak about the people within the business, not just the business itself, we add a layer of recognition and understanding of exactly whom or what we are talking about. And that’s a critical element to bear in mind as we start to think about building more effective, more empathic companies. It starts with the people inside. When we recognize that people are at the core of every business, it becomes necessary that we show up in a different way. If we simply “phone it in,” our behavior has an impact on the company. But when we bring our best selves to the companies we serve, we can often create some pretty spectacular results. This isn’t just something that comes from the top down. Yes, a CEO certainly has a major role to play in establishing an organization’s culture and environment, but he or she is not the only one responsible. Working with companies as small as ours and others with nearly a million employees worldwide, I’ve noted one important element that always plays a role in building a strong internal culture: alignment.

Your ability to perform better and more comfortably, to have empathy for your inner athlete no matter your skill level, is meaningful.

- Unlike the more common dialectic approach, in which two people debate a point from opposing positions (e.g., the prosecutor and defense attorney in a courtroom), in parallel thinking participants inhabit assigned roles and they analyze the topic from various sides. De Bono’s “Six Thinking Hats” method uses six colored “hats” we can wear when we need to think about problems. The blue hat, for example, focuses on managerial questions, such as “What is the goal of this?” The black hat is more focused on logic, using caution and realism to determine flaws and evaluate ideas. Each “hat” presents us with a way of looking at a particular situation in isolation from our own perspective. The challenge in this work comes in playing a role that may be contrary to your own instincts, but it can be essential to making sure you’re not just “getting high on your own supply” and falling in love with ideas based on your cognitive biases.

- Objective decision-making is relatively simple to get a handle on. When a problem is approached objectively, facts are considered without feelings or bias to confuse them. Either things happen, or they don’t. A light switch works, or it doesn’t. A train is on schedule, or it isn’t. If the solution is clear and factual, objectivity is easy to come by. The problem is that today’s businesses, and our roles within them, need to operate more and more on subjectivity. And subjective decision-making takes some getting used to. When things are subjective, there can be multiple right answers, which can be influenced by a person’s feelings and biases, which can lead to confusion and indecision. Perspective, personal taste, intuition, and a host of other individualized attributes play a role in making subjective decisions. Take, for example, the hiring of a new team member. You’ve objectively narrowed the candidates through your requirements for a university degree, industry experience, and specific hard skills. Two finalists come in for interviews, and now everything will depend on subjective decision-making. This is likely something you already do instinctively: you evaluate prospective employees’ cultural fit and presentation style, even how they make you feel when you talk with them (whether you consciously recognize that or not). Even knowing what you want to see in the candidates, it can still be hard to make a subjective decision. For example, let’s say the first of the two candidates walks in with confidence, looks you straight in the eyes, and answers questions directly but doesn’t offer anything exactly memorable, while the second candidate is a little meek, fumbles… ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=1233))

- relative to the organization. It’s a subjective call to make but one that will have real consequences. One way to approach subjective decision-making is to consider what factors are important to the decision and put them into a hierarchy. Taking the example above, we might say that cultural fit within the company is highly important, along with other considerations such as writing style, creativity, and demeanor. The interviewer will evaluate each of those factors through his or her own perspective. Perhaps they shouldn’t all be weighted equally. For example, it is best to know from the outset if the interviewer’s opinion of the candidate’s creativity is more important than that of his or her ability to fit into the company culture. The same could be said when evaluating ideas presented by your team for a new marketing campaign. What’s most important to you? How an ad looks? How it reads? What you think your consumers will think of it? What your boss will think of it?

- Through a mix of readings, case-based learning, and participatory labs, our budding young empaths would work through a series of challenges, not unlike the exercises in this book, that taught them how to apply empathy in order to become more and more comfortable with subjective work—which for many of them was foreign territory. Mechanical engineering, for instance, though at times dependent on subjective choices, is most often evaluated objectively. Either a machine works, or it doesn’t. Either it performs its desired task, or it fails. The way it performs its task could be described in subjective terms, but most of our students majoring in mechanical engineering were comfortable with mechanically engineered solutions that could be judged objectively by the results they achieved. Straightforward computational and analysis-based code, from our computer science majors, is also evaluated objectively by whether or not the task was performed, but app development, on which so many of today’s computer science students are focused, depends on a programmer’s ability to make a variety of both objective and subjective choices.

But as a company grows, it is often impossible for one person to remain the sun. It is frequently too much responsibility. And that was happening for us. Jeff recognized how disappointing it was to lose those team members, but he insisted that it was an inevitable part of growth and that, in the end, more and more leaders would emerge and contribute to playing the role of the “sun” in our solar system. In truth, that was already happening. Jeff was one of them, along with our CFO, Julie Puccio, who had earned my trust years earlier and had moved up the ranks from a midlevel position to one of my most trusted thought partners. As we talked more about that analogy, it became our shared goal for the business. It seemed like the right thing to do, and it gave me permission to delegate some responsibility and let me focus on growing the business instead of running the company’s day-to-day operations. But in time it would also be unhealthy for our management team to be alone at the center. We wanted all the leaders in the company to feel that they had influence and to know that collectively, each of us had a meaningful place in the “solar system.” Jeff was right.

By being aware of it and embracing it with openness and empathy, we can calibrate our strategy quickly and effectively in order to meet the needs of the business. Empathic companies train dexterity into the fabric of their culture. They have a true understanding of the dynamics at play on a variety of levels within the organization, and they know that great cultures are built by constantly calibrating the top-down aspects of their operations with the bottom-up feedback from the organization as a whole. Applying empathy to an organization or team is a constantly evolving process, but with careful attention, it can inspire and empower leaders to steward the company through change time and again.

- I kept up my visits to Dr. Chan, and after a few months of acupuncture, plus a specific concoction of Chinese herbs that would rebalance my imbalanced internal system, I was really starting to feel different. The next step to healing was working on how to better manage the stress I was continuing to endure as a young entrepreneur. I had tried meditation a few times but had found it uncomfortable to sit still because my mind and body were so restless. Dr. Chan suggested that I try tai chi, a Chinese form of moving meditation. I asked him, “You mean I don’t have to sit to meditate?” He smiled and told me no. The next day I was talking to a friend, and without his knowing about my conversation with Dr. Chan, he told me he had been thinking about learning tai chi. I was blown away by the coincidence. It was a sign! I set out to find a tai chi teacher (and learned that they are called masters). Later that week I was headed to a friend’s holiday party being held in the basement of an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. I walked down the narrow steps into a sea of people who were standing around drinking wine and eating appetizers. Through the crowd, a small, bald head was weaving its way toward me.

- MASTER RU’S INELEGANT HORSE Master Ru’s approach was to teach by doing. He moved, and I mimicked his movements (or at least tried the best I could). He described my early attempts to learn his powerful tradition as the fumblings of an inelegant horse. And as we were training, I kept asking questions, such as “What does this pose do?” and “Why are we moving in this direction?” I love the cerebral aspects of learning, and I wanted to understand everything. But Master Ru didn’t want to cloud my mind with language and theory. He would just smile and say, “We talk later, just breathe.” He is a great master, and he could tell I was trying too hard to think about what we were doing. He knew how to stop me from distracting myself with too many thoughts. The other thing that made learning from Master Ru so engaging was that we practiced our tai chi outside, no matter what kind of weather we faced. In New York, we get about ten weeks of great weather a year. The rest is either freezing cold or swelteringly hot. But that didn’t matter because we did tai chi in snow up to our knees and we did it in 100 percent humidity. That was part of the meditation Master Ru taught. Over time, I stopped noticing the temperature. We’d be standing in the snow, and I’d be sweating from the amount of qi (pronounced “chee”) I was cultivating. Qi is our life force—the energy that powers us. It was truly awesome to see how much more control I had over my mind and body when I was in that meditative state. After tai chi, Master Ru took me back to his house, where he performed bodywork on me in a tradition called qigong Gong essentially means “working.” So qigong translates to “working with life force.” It’s a powerful form of energetic medicine that has helped to heal me and many others. Qigong is practiced in different ways. In Master Ru’s apartment he manipulated my energy through touch as well as working around my energetic body. Qigong also has poses (like yoga) and meditative practices, and over time Master… ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=1588))

With my newfound momentum and sense of groundedness, I dove headfirst into my exploration of every form of Eastern and new age healing modalities I could find. In addition to my regular acupuncture sessions with Dr. Chan and my training with Master Ru, I tried shamanic healing, sound healing, aromatherapy, yoga, massage, applied kinesiology, hypnosis, craniosacral therapy, and more. I walked the spiritual buffet line for quite some time, sampling various practices and seeing what worked for me. A lesson I learned at a certain point along the path was that I needed to commit and go deep with one or a few practices. An understanding of the world’s spiritual practices is helpful, but the real results, the powerful stuff I was seeking, would come only when I committed myself to a specific practice and went deep with it.

- The first step any company should take before externally acting on an Empathic Opportunity is to decide clearly and articulately what it wants to communicate. This may seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how often marketers and creative types dive straight into a campaign for a product or service before the company has figured out exactly what it wants to say. The only way to do that empathically is to engage in internal conversations. This goes to the core of the work we do. Building a campaign with empathy begins with asking ourselves: • What conversation(s) are we trying to have? • With whom? • In what channels? • And most important: Why are we having this conversation? Asking these questions helps establish the baseline for the company’s marketing and communications. We want to understand who we’re talking to, how they consume content (e.g., via social media, through advertising), and what we want to say to them once we have their attention. We worked with a fashion brand that couldn’t figure out why its social media following had plateaued.

We looked for other topics for which the brand shared a passion with its consumers, and we landed on music, design, and food.

We helped them think empathically about the consumers they wanted to attract and provide content they knew would interest those consumers.

- other, the greater the likelihood is that everyone will get what they are looking for. Behaviors Once your company knows the message it wants to communicate, it is time to determine what behaviors you want to bring about. Sometimes, as with the fashion brand, it will simply be encouraging followership or building a loyal customer base, but it can be a wide range of things, such as: • Taking a test drive • Coming to your store and shopping • Following you on Instagram • Buying our product The role empathy plays here is in recognizing that your consumers are savvy, and they know when companies are marketing to them. So it’s important that you be clear about your intention, whatever it is. You’re not going to pull one over on them. With a clear conversation in hand, you can construct a path toward the desired behavior(s). Relationships When your conversations with consumers start eliciting the behaviors you desire, that is the start of a relationship. But, like any relationship, it must be maintained so it continues to grow. How you do that is by applying empathy and anticipating what your consumers want from the relationship. How often do they want to hear from you? Should your communication be personalized at this stage of the relationship? What channels do they want you to use? Will those be uniform, or will they be different depending on customers and their preferences? Successful brands know how important it is to use empathy when considering these questions while creating external campaigns. They know that consumers have only so much time for any one company and realize that they will be drawn to the ones that take their time, interests, and relationships into consideration.

Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, is someone who is (rightly) praised for his ability to lead this way. He’s brought empathy into the center of Microsoft’s organization, using it as a tool to reorient the business and listen to feedback from within the company as well as the world around it. As a result, the company’s internal culture, as well as its growth, is on the rise. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2305))

- Look around your organization, and ask what skills are lacking. We do this often, and a part of Sub Rosa Day focuses on training those deficiencies into strengths. Sometimes it’s as straight- forward as honing our presentation skills or improving a department’s deftness with a particular software. But other times it has taken a more idiosyncratic and “ownable” incarnation. We utilize a basic five-step process for providing feedback. We refer to it by the acronym CLEAR: C: Check in L: Lead with data E: Emotion A: Agreement R: Resolution Any feedback session among team members should follow this format as a way of making sure that information and personal sentiments are shared in a manner that benefits both parties. When we “Check in,” we make sure it’s the right time for feedback and all parties involved are in the right headspace to have this sort of conversation. “Lead with data” reminds everyone to start the conversation with facts, not subjectively with feelings or opinion. With the first two in place, it’s time for “Emotion” to be revealed, with each person saying how he or she feels about a given issue or topic.

- “Agreement” is a step designed to bring about common ground. You could think of this as the “empathy” step, where we look at the situation from the other person’s perspective and look for the place where our views align. We end with “Resolution,” the moment when we discover how we can move forward together. This may not be a surprising approach to conflict resolution, but interestingly, we have found it helpful to consider when there’s positive feedback to deliver. Over time, CLEAR conversations have become second nature to us, and we don’t always have to go through the five steps overtly because each element is integrated into our behavior. Consider your own team, culture, or company, and think about what aspects might be improved by incorporating new rituals such as these or others you might create for yourself. Rituals such as Sub Rosa Day and CLEAR have delivered meaningful results to both our company and our culture. They foster a sense of empathy in our interpersonal relationships because they show that we are ([Location 2344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2344))

- Empathic leadership comes with some nonnegotiables. One of them is the acceptance of, and participation in, mentoring. I’m sure that many of you have endured the rote experience of a mandated mentorship session or peer review meeting. That’s not what I’m talking about here. I’m not saying that those formats can’t be empathic—in fact, they should be; what I’m talking… ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2356))

- or who need you and with whom you can work reciprocally to give and receive feedback. A lot of people who seek me out about their personal development do so because they think I’ve got it all figured out. I have learned that one of the best ways to have these conversations is to be open and honest about myself. Obviously, those people are in for a surprise when they discover how much I’m still committed to working through my own challenges. Being a leader often requires one to behave like a duck on a pond—calm and cool on the surface but kicking like hell below to keep moving forward. That’s what my self-work has felt like all along, and it often still feels that way. I’m the first to admit that I don’t have everything figured out, but I do know one thing about myself that has often helped guide others on their own path: empathy for myself, an ability to view my own progress as… ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2359))

- going through. When people are mentoring, they tend to look reflexively at their own experiences and offer counsel that starts with phrases such as “When I was your age” or “Here’s how I would do it.” Resist that inclination when working with those around you. Though sharing a bit about your own experiences can certainly help others create new behaviors, the real gift an empathic leader can impart to someone else is a perspective on his or her own challenges so that the person being mentored can learn to see things in fresh ways. If you consider what I do professionally, it looks kind of insane to some people. I run a fifty-person strategy and design studio; I have a thriving alternative medicine practice called Corvus Medicine; I lecture and run workshops on empathy; I teach; and my wife and I co-operate Calliope, a design-focused retail shop. To many people, that seems completely crazy, particularly because it appears to lack any real focus. But that’s not how I see it. There was a time when I felt as though I were drowning in all of those seemingly disconnected endeavors. But when a mentor of mine brought a sense of empathy and objectivity into my life, I began to see that what I do at Sub Rosa, Corvus, Calliope, and anyplace else is just the same job taking different forms. What I’m really good at is helping people identify obstacles that stand in the way of their progress and then finding solutions that remove those obstacles.… ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2367))

- Our close look at the Color of the Year revealed Pantone’s savant gift. It was hiding right there in plain sight. The world saw it, but the company had become so locked into the day-to-day of its business that it hadn’t been able to see it. That was our way in. We realized that the Color of the Year had more power than just being a great PR moment.

- Applying empathy, we put ourselves into the perspective of the entire design community (designers, decorators, architects, and so on)—not such a stretch for a shop like ours but an important step to ensure that we were seeing the matter from all angles. We challenged ourselves to consider surprising ways Pantone could show up in the world while still being true to its brand. At the same time, we noted how often the world of design changes seasonally. Then the kernel of an idea began to emerge. We were homing in on a calendar.

- Built into Sub Rosa is the belief that if we are doing our job well and applying empathy to solve complex problems for our partners, we should at some point create our own obsolescence. When we fix a problem, we should also deliver to the client enough tools, lessons, and empowerment that they can begin to own their own future. This sort of thinking isn’t consistent with many of the agencies in the industry, which pursue annual retainer after annual retainer, seeking the oh-so-comforting normalized cash flow we agency owners ask for in our prayers before bed. I’ve always seen this differently. There are plenty of big, ambitious businesses out there with problems that need solving, so I know there’s plenty more work to be had. And with a long-term retainer, at a certain point both sides start spending a lot of time managing the retainer—the agency people analyzing whether hours are burning high, pushing the agency team to the brink, or burning low and the client wondering if it is getting its money’s worth. It’s a constant calibration contest and a highly unempathic way of managing a partnership. Pantone knew our philosophy on this and wanted to internalize some of the capabilities and services we were providing. We agreed wholeheartedly and locked arms with the team to help them do just that. We worked collaboratively to identify the company’s existing skills gaps and realized that it needed some new talent. But that talent would replace work we at Sub Rosa were doing. So after we helped Pantone recruit the right people, the new hires first worked for Sub Rosa for a short time in our studio, where they learned the job. After a few months, they moved full-time to the Pantone offices. In addition, we gave a series of training sessions for existing Pantone employees to help them increase their capabilities and familiarity with the sort of work we were doing. Within about eighteen months, the Pantone team was completely empowered to do this work themselves. It was a beautiful thing to see unfold. The story gets a little sappy at this point, but it’s the truth. One day we received the nicest letter we’ve ever gotten from a client, six beautiful pages from one of our key contacts at Pantone. She wrote that we had helped reinvigorate the company and ultimately ushered forth a bright new chapter for the business. She said the work we had done had singlehandedly helped retain some of the top talent within the company who had been looking toward the door. That letter hung on our studio wall for a long time. Not only was it a nice thing to read, but, more important, it reminded us why we do what we do. When we help a company awaken and embrace its most innate ([Location 2553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078MC84D9&location=2553))

- THE GREATER GOOD Empathic leadership isn’t always easy. Sometimes it is thankless and often grueling, but I know that everyone on my team has the same spirit of inspiration and hope that I do. We believe in the power of empathy as a tool to help leaders take a different view of themselves and the companies where they work. If we can do that, if we can help ignite more passion and understanding in the leaders of companies that have the largest impact on the world, we might just help create the empathic shift we all want to see in the world around us. Every company has something special and powerful that makes it tick.

- Empathy can and should be an essential part of your daily life, both in the workplace and in all of your relationships; but as we have seen, developing and applying empathy takes time and dedication. In my own journey to apply empathy, I’ve discovered certain mind-sets that can help hone that ability within all of us. I look at these as “encouragements”—things we can do to inspire ourselves and the teams around us. Each one is important on its own, but collectively, they create an empathic spirit that can help you explore, learn, and grow with empathy at the center.
