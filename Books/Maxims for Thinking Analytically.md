## Highlights
- The book is based on “Analytic Frameworks for Policy,” a course Richard has taught at the Harvard Kennedy School for more than four decades. Students learn analytic methods from various fields (economics, decision analysis, behavioral decision, game theory, operations research, etc.), and many describe it as life-changing.

- The book extracts some key ideas of the course, which Richard crystalizes in the form of maxims, one-sentence nuggets of wisdom meant to immortalize an important idea. Richard has been sharing these maxims for many years with his students, colleagues and coauthors, so much so that they remember these maxims long after first hearing them. The maxims covered here represent only a partial list. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=185))

- Maxims are useful for two reasons. First, they make us think about things that might not be intuitive at first. For example, most of us intuitively associate a good outcome (like “I am happy in my current job”) with a good decision (“I accepted to work for employer X two years ago”), and the maxim “Good decisions sometimes have poor outcomes” can remind us to counter that intuitive notion. Second, they can help us correct behavior when we intuitively know what the right behavior is but yet somehow don’t engage in it. For example, we intuitively know that envy is not good for us but we sometimes fall victim of it, just as tennis players naturally follow the opponent and not the ball. In tennis, the maxim “keep your eye on the ball” helps us overcome our natural tendency. Similarly, the maxim "Strive hard to avoid envy – see your friend’s success as your gain" is meant to remind us of what we know is good for us.

- Simplify your situation sufficiently to enable clear thinking and to give you some traction. Then turn back to your actual, more challenging situation, using the insights you gained. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=257))

- Maxim 1 When you are having trouble getting your thinking straight, go to an extreme case ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=263))

- Mary and Jim want to paint a room together. If Mary painted alone it would take her 2 hours, and if Jim painted alone it would take him 3 hours. How long would it take to paint the room if they paint together? Many high school students (and adults) quickly answer 2.5 hours when they encounter this kind of problem for the first time. Take a minute to think how you would explain to a high school student why this is not the correct answer. One effective way to see why 2.5 hours is not the right answer is to imagine that Mary alone paints and Jim just watches. How long will it take? Two hours. So if Jim helps Mary paint, it has to take them less than two hours. This is an example of going to an extreme to get your thinking straight. In this case, the extreme we used is that Mary paints and Jim does nothing.[1] Of all the maxims in this book, this is the most popular among Richard’s coauthors and former students. Broadly speaking, this maxim can be especially helpful for two kinds of situations: To understand a concept, problem, or idea better; or To assess the best-case or worst-case consequences of a decision you are struggling to make.

- Understanding a concept sometimes involves addressing and correcting a misconception. Barry Nalebuff, one of Richard’s coauthors and a professor at Yale School of Management, does this when teaching negotiation. He noticed people often default to proportional division as a fair solution in a negotiation. For example, imagine Division A of a company is spending ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=292))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- $20,000 on a software package and Division B is spending $10,000, but they can buy a joint license for $24,000. How should they split the cost? Most people venture that A should pay double what B pays, so $16,000 and $8,000. But what cooperation is really doing is saving $6,000 and both divisions are needed equally for those savings. They should split those savings equally: Division A pays $17,000 and B pays $7,000. To help students not yet convinced that proportional division is unfair, he gives an extreme example in a not-so-hypothetical negotiation between a small organic iced-tea startup whom we’ll call David and a large beverage company whom we’ll call Goliath.[3] ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=294))

- Going to an extreme case can sometimes help you discover the key insight of a problem or situation you are trying to understand. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=323))

- Maxim 4 When trying to understand a complex real-world situation, think of an everyday analogue ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=566))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The analogues we choose might be everyday situations, or ones that are memorable for other reasons. For example, imagine you are contemplating transporting 100 identical items, one by one, over the Niagara Falls using buckets. There are two types of buckets. The first type has been used 100 times and succeeded in 70 of them. The second type has been used 2 times and succeeded only once. What would you do? This is the kind of classic puzzle that Richard gives to his students and colleagues. Pause for a minute to think about it before you read the answer in the next paragraph. In the absence of any other information or constraints, you should use the second bucket for a few times until you have a better sense of its overall success rate. With the first one, you are reasonably sure that its success rate is close to 70 percent, whereas with the second one you are highly uncertain because it has only been used twice. So you should use the second bucket a number of additional times until you accumulate more evidence and either conclude that the success rate is below 70 percent (in which case you switch to the first bucket), or conclude that the success rate is above 70 percent (in which case you should continue using it).

- Maryaline Catillon was on the receiving end of this puzzle. “This image of transporting buckets across the Niagara Falls always comes to mind when I am thinking about choosing between something I am used to (be it a project, idea, product, organization, restaurant, etc.) and an alternative that I have less experience with. The larger the uncertainty, with the same expected probability of success, the more I should try the new bucket. And the optimal length of experimentation depends on whether the old product ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=584))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- or the new product does better. I should experiment longer even if the new product looks inferior, because I can always switch back to the old product. However, if I mistakenly conclude that the old product is superior, and discard the new product for good, I will never learn more about the new product. There is no switching back.” Maryaline’s professional work with drug trials for pharmaceuticals no doubt inspired this formulation. Maryaline goes on, “The Niagara Falls analogy also has very important implications from the perspective of a project manager, a researcher, or anybody managing any sort of portfolio. When making decisions, such as whether to invest time and effort in a project, think of its option value. Projects with more uncertain outcomes are likely to be more interesting, and potentially high impact. Being the first person to explore an area (be it a research topic or a business idea), is potentially much more interesting, but also easier than entering widely explored areas. Higher-uncertainty projects can bring much higher gains.”[16] ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=587))
