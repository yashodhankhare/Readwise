## Highlights
- Forgetting pain is a survival instinct, but unfortunately, that means we also forget the ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=167))
- lessons. Then, too, though people individually forget, markets don’t. History does not, in fact, repeat—not exactly. Every bear market has a distinct set of drivers, as does every bull market. But human behavior doesn’t change—not enough and ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=168))
- not very fast to matter. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=170))
- Learning from history is scant in our world. First, history is usually boring to most. And second, most folks can’t quite believe in their myopic minds that ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=202))
- what happened a few too many decades ago has any bearing on today. In reality, markets don’t change much in the basics of how they function because the people whose interactions make them work don’t change much over time. One of the most ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=203))
- basic lessons of behavioral psychology is that humans are slow to change and learn. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=205))
- This is, in essence, what most of my books, Forbes columns and other writings are about and have always been about—looking at the world and trying to see it differently but more correctly (in my view) and then determining how to act or not act ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=218))
- all largely centered on error-rate reduction. And you’ll still make lots of errors, but that’s ok. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=220))
- Yet every time I talk about history’s role as a powerful tool in capital markets forecasting, inevitably some say, “Past performance is no indication of the future!” Well, that’s not why you should look at history. Use history as a laboratory—to understand the range of reasonable expectations. For example, when event X happens, the outcomes are usually B, C or D, but can be anywhere from A to F. So I know that anything could happen, but odds are greater something like A through F happens, with ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=228))
- odds still higher on B, C and D. And the odds of something outside that range happening is very, very low, so it would take exceptional extra knowledge to bet on something like that happening. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=232))
- Then, too, you should consider other factors ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=234))
- that might affect the outcome—the world of economic, political and sentiment drivers. Maybe Event Y is happening simultaneously, which likely reduces the odds of D happening and increases B. Heck, maybe Event Z is likely to happen soon, which usually ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=234))
- near-guarantees a Q, so even though it’s an outlier, I know to throw that into my bucket of probabilities. That’s how I would have you think—in terms of the probabilities. At its basics, investing is a probabilities game; it’s not a certainties game. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=236))
- And if a lot of people say Event X must cause Outcome Y, there’s no harm in checking to see if that’s what happened historically most of the time. Because if it hasn’t happened before, it’s unlikely to happen now ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=244))
- whether most folks think it will or not. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=245))
- Typically, people tend to seek things reconfirming what they already believe and ignore or ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=279))
- discount things not supporting their worldview. This is a known cognitive error people who study all forms of behavioralism (including behavioral finance) call confirmation bias. We find evidence to confirm our biases and make ourselves blind to ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=280))
- evidence contradicting them. Behavioralists have documented why this is basic to the human condition of successful evolution. It makes us more confident and willing to try harder repeatedly in the face of the brutishly difficult conditions ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=282))
- we’ve faced in normal human evolution. But it hurts in markets. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=283))
- Further, more investors are prone to be naturally skeptical—bearish—than are prone to be naturally optimistic. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=285))
- Instead, I advocate not blindly following the herd. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=293))
- “The four most expensive words in the English language are, ‘This time it’s different.’” So saith Sir John Templeton ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=383))
- To say Sir John is legendary is an injustice to the word legendary. He was a mutual fund pioneer—founded and ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=386))
- built one of the first big firms. He was a global investing pioneer, too—doing global for clients before anyone did. Sir John had ice water in his veins and really lived the idea: Don’t follow the herd. He knew to be greedy when others were fearful and vice ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=387))
- versa before Buffett made that his. He never believed in chart voodoo, no matter how trendy it was. He was firmly grounded in fundamentals. He believed in what he called bargains. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=388))
- And that’s why Sir John’s admonition that it’s never different this time is so eternally useful. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=423))
- Side note: One reason ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=439))
- folks fall prey to the notion of long-term stagnancy now, I believe, is the death of journalism. Once upon a time, journalism was a serious pursuit.

- Bull markets aren’t average. (Nor are bear markets.) Average returns are, in actuality, very, very unusual. You’d think that would be easy to remember—but this is something ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1164))
- investors routinely forget fast. Stock market returns are widely varied, and returns close to the average occur in a small percentage of years. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1165))
- If you’re a long-term investor with growth goals (i.e., most reading this book), you should utterly ignore arbitrary benchmarks like ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1356))
- breakeven, high water, round-number index levels, etc. Focus instead on whether your strategy makes sense for your long-term growth goals without thinking about what stocks did last week, last month or last year. ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1357))
- That stock prices have gone up a lot doesn’t mean they always must fall. In fact, more often than not, they just keep rising in irregular fashion, but people forget—always. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1382))
- There’s no such thing as “too far, too fast.” There’s no set amount bull markets are allowed to rise before they must fall again. Nor is there a ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1429))
- capped amount they are permitted to appreciate in a given week, month or year. Fact is, in any given year, the bulk of the returns can be the result of just a few weeks—maybe days! You just don’t know when those days will be. And when they happen, ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1430))
- they will be huge and likely feel like too much, too fast. Markets are wildly unpredictable in the very near term. That’s normal. (And by the way, this is all the same in reverse for bear markets.) ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1432))
- And I have never, ever seen the market behave normally. ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1467))
- Actually, that’s not true. The market behaves normally all the time—and by that, I mean it’s wildly variable, and that’s normal. But this isn’t what people mean when they say they want the market to behave “normally.” They mean they want some sort of ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1468))
- signal: “All clear! Everybody in!” Or, “Danger here! Time to exit!” And smooth from there. They want returns to be less variable, more reliable. If you’re waiting for that, you will wait a very long time. Because while the market does wildly unpredictable things ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1470))

- What exactly volatility is. (People don’t always know!) Volatility is itself ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1728))
- pretty darn volatile. No matter how you slice it, stocks aren’t getting more volatile. Given some time, stocks can be less volatile than bonds. And finally, if you want long-term growth, volatility is good, not bad. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1729))
- In general, people think of downside volatility as bad and upside volatility as not volatility at all! It’s just “good.” But volatility isn’t “bad” or “good.” It just is. ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=1748))
- Investing isn’t a certainties game or a possibilities game; it’s a probabilities game. ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2060))
- The good news is, though markets are volatile, history shows they are also resilient. ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2083))
- Markets know (though people forget) as terrible ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2084))
- as these events are, we always rise above. We dig out and rebuild and go on. Through it all, the profit motive is strong, and human ingenuity never dies. So no matter how trying a setback overall, humanity carries on—and so do our economies and capital ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2084))
- markets. ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2086))
- It’s human nature to misremember history and say, “I wasn’t so scared then. That wasn’t nearly so painful.” Our brains evolved this way ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2273))
- to help us survive our hunter-gatherer days. It’s the same with volatility. History shows us “now” isn’t an inherently more volatile time—just that volatility ebbs and flows. So we forget long-past volatility. Even if you’ve lived through massive volatility a ([Location 2274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2274))
- number of times, it’s so easy to forget within just 5 or 10 years. But you forget at your peril. You might end up knee-jerking at what’s otherwise some normal volatility in an overall fine year and robbing yourself of who-knows-how-much future return. Or, ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2276))
- worst case, you could find yourself wiring your life savings to a con artist. Neither outcome is great. ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2278))
- Never forget: Volatility is normal—and volatile. History teaches us. Memory fails us. ([Location 2281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2281))
- bear markets last, on average, 21 months. ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2366))
- On average, bear markets typically don’t last two years. Bull markets last much longer—averaging 57 months. See it another way: The average bull market is nearly as long as the longest-ever bear market ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2369))
- from the Great Depression! ([Location 2371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2371))
- Research shows the human brain is hard-wired from many thousands of years to focus more on danger than the absence of danger (from Daniel Kahneman’s Noble Prize–winning prospect theory). This is why folks tend to fear ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2382))
- airline travel much more than car travel—though vastly more people die in cars than in airplanes each year in every country. ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2383))
- And it’s the same in investing. Though secular bear markets are hard to find, secular bears, as individual ([Location 2385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2385))
- people, aren’t—you can find them easily on TV and in print. This is the opposite of how it works for people biased to bullishness. Secular bears are wrong much more than they are right—except during bear markets, which occupy much less time ([Location 2386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2386))
- historically than bull markets. Then, they are vindicated—but for some reason, folks quickly forget that more than two-thirds of the time, they were bearish and wrong. My guess is long-term perma-bear types get a lot of media play ([Location 2388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2388))
- because human nature tends to bestow automatic credibility on the skeptic. The pessimist. They don’t call the movie critics critics for nothing. They sure don’t call them movie analysts. It’s critics. Criticism is seen by most as sophisticated and smart. Scientific ([Location 2390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2390))
- even! On the flip side, humans tend to see optimists as dupes—Pollyannas seemingly unaware of all the trouble all around us, whistling their way through rose-colored lives. (Almost all of Sir John’s life, he was seen as a Pollyanna.) ([Location 2392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2392))
- Mind you, in capital markets, history is solidly on the side of the more-optimistic-than-not set. (Not the perma-bullish—but the bullish-much-more-than-bearish.) ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2395))
- And for ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2399))
- some reason, people are more forgiving if you’re wrong and miss upside than if you’re wrong and expose them to the downside—though history shows over time, being bearish and wrong can be much more damaging to long-term results than being ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2399))
- bullish and wrong. I think it’s because of what behavioralists have proven—that people hate losses fully twice as much as they enjoy gains emotionally. ([Location 2401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2401))
- You may think 30 years is a long time. But in my view, many people think about investing time horizons wrong. They may think, “I’m 60. I plan to retire at 65. I’ve got only five years to invest, so my time horizon is five years. At that ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2678))

Or, with only five years, I should start moving heavily away from stocks now!” In my view, this cookie-cutter approach in which age is the only or primary input for an ([Location 2679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2679))
- investment strategy is all wrong. It utterly ignores critical personal factors, like what your ultimate goal for the money is, what your income needs are, what your return expectations are, what your tolerance for risk is, on and on and on. ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2681))
- Your time horizon shouldn’t be how long it is until you retire. In my view, a more appropriate way to think about time ([Location 2684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2684))
- horizon is how long you need your assets to last—which, for most, is their entire life and that of their spouse. (For gents reading this, remember, odds are your wife lives longer. Plan for that, too, and you’ll increase the odds she remembers you ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2685))

- In myriad ways, it’s easier—emotionally—to be bearish always than bullish most of the time. If you’re bearish and wrong, you can say “Oh well, at least I didn’t lose money.” Which is true, sort of—as we saw earlier in this chapter. If you have a short time ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2696))

- no stocks and not experiencing equity-like upside for very long periods can be quite damaging to long-term results. History teaches us stocks are positive much more than negative. It’s just our faulty memories that regularly forget this. ([Location 2699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=2699))

- If you want an excellent history on bubbles, and why we will always be prone to them periodically, read Charles MacKay’s excellent book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. My guess is speculative ([Location 3425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005SHTZJW&location=3425))
