## Highlights
- “Small things with great love. . . . It is not how much we do, but how much love we put into the doing. And it is not how much we give, but how much love we put into the giving. To God there is nothing small.” —Mother Teresa ([Location 20](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=20))

- in this powerful statement from the Tao Te Ching: “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Though it is rooted in ancient philosophy, it is just as practical and effective when applied to our hectic modern lives. Kaizen has two definitions: using very small steps to improve a habit, a process, or product using very small moments to inspire new products and inventions ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=36))

- I would like to cover one more topic: spirituality. By this I do not mean necessarily a faith in God, but a sense of purpose and a feeling of fulfillment. Kaizen is as much a philosophy or belief system as it is a strategy for success in changing or enhancing some behavior. There are two elements of the spirit, or purpose, in which kaizen plays an essential role: service and gratitude. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, expressed it, “You can’t live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you.” Other luminaries have spoken of the essential element of service: ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=91))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Service is even an essential aspect of the business applications of kaizen. Each employee in a kaizen culture is asked to look each day for ways to improve the process or product: lowering cost, increasing quality, and always—I repeat, always—in the service of the customer. Very often, successful corporations such as Amazon, Starbucks, and Southwest Airlines define themselves as primarily devoted to service. As Colleen Barrett, a former Southwest CEO, says, “We’re ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=100))

- in the customer-service business; we happen to offer air transportation. We consider our employees to be our number one customer, our passengers our second, and our shareholders our third.” Kaizen demands that every small change be to the benefit of the customer.

- To overcome these tight time and personnel constraints, the U.S. government created management courses called Training Within Industries (TWI) and offered them to corporations throughout America. One of these courses held the seeds of what would, in another time and ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=200))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- place, become known as kaizen. Instead of encouraging radical, more innovative change to produce the demanded results, the TWI course exhorted managers toward what it called “continuous improvement.” The course manual urged supervisors to “look for hundreds of small things you can improve. Don’t try to plan a whole new department layout—or go after a big installation of new equipment. There isn’t time for these major items. Look for improvements on existing jobs with your present equipment.” One of the most vocal advocates of continuous improvement at this time was Dr. W. Edwards Deming, a statistician who worked on a quality control team that aided American manufacturers as they tried to find their wartime footing. Dr. Deming instructed managers to involve every single employee in the improvement process. The intense time pressure had transformed elitism and snobbery into unaffordable luxuries. Everyone, from those on the lowest rungs to the men in the catbird seats, was encouraged to find little ways to increase the quality of their product and the efficiency of creating it. Suggestion boxes were positioned on factory floors so that line workers could suggest ways to improve productivity, and executives were obliged to treat each of these comments with great respect.

- “When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens—and when it happens, it lasts.” ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=213))

- California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, I’ve had plenty of opportunity to witness people who need to change their lives—to kick a bad habit, ease their loneliness, or break out of an unsatisfying career. When I assist corporations, helping business executives grapple with tough situations is practically my job description. Over and over, I’ve seen people bravely attempt to implement revolutionary schemes for improvement. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=240))

- Kaizen Versus Innovation Kaizen and innovation are the two major strategies people use to create change. Where innovation demands shocking and radical reform, all kaizen asks is that you take small, comfortable steps toward improvement.

- Small Steps, Giant Leaps Julie struck me as the perfect candidate for change in its smallest, least threatening form. I looked on as Julie ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=249))

- waited to hear what the resident had to say. As I predicted, the resident talked to Julie about the importance of taking time for herself and of getting some exercise. Just as she was about to tell Julie to spend at least thirty minutes of most days on aerobically challenging exercise—a recommendation that would have likely been met with disbelief and anger—I found myself jumping in. “How about if you just march in place in front of the television, each day, for one minute?” The resident shot me an incredulous look. But Julie brightened a little. She said, “I could give that a try.” When Julie returned for a follow-up visit, she reported that she’d indeed marched in front of the TV set for one minute each night. Granted, she ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=250))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- wasn’t going to get much healthier with just sixty seconds of low-intensity exercise. But during this second visit, I noticed that Julie’s attitude had changed. Instead of coming back discouraged, as so many failed exercisers do, Julie was more animated, with less resistance in her speech and demeanor. “What else can I do in one minute a day?” she wanted to know. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=256))

- Often, people find that their minds develop a desire for this new behavior, whether it is regular exercise (as in Julie’s case), a diet, cleaning off their desks, or spending time with a loving, supportive companion instead of a destructive one. Eventually, my clients are startled to discover that they have reached their goals with no additional conscious effort on their part. How does this happen? I believe that the kaizen approach is a highly effective method of building new neural connections in the brain, an idea I’ll address in more detail in the coming chapter. As one client often said to me, “The steps were so small I couldn’t fail!” Because the vast majority of people want to improve their health, relationships, or careers, this book devotes much of its space to these topics. But the principles I outline here can apply to any project for change, whether the goal is ending a nail-biting habit or learning to say no to the empty demands that suck up all your time.

- plans for change, I hope you’ll want to keep in mind the original intent of the small-steps philosophy. Kaizen is an effective, enjoyable way to achieve a specific goal, but it also extends a more profound challenge: to meet life’s constant demands for change by seeking out continual—but always small—improvement. Through decades of working with people of all stripes, with unique strengths and needs, I’ve developed a theory about why kaizen works when all else fails. I outline this theory in the first chapter. The succeeding chapters are devoted to the personal application of kaizen and encompass six different strategies. These strategies include: asking small questions to dispel fear and inspire creativity ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=279))

- All changes, even positive ones, are scary. Attempts to reach goals through radical or revolutionary means often fail because they heighten fear. But the small steps of kaizen disarm the brain’s fear response, stimulating rational thought and creative play.

- Some lucky people are able to get around this problem by turning their fear into another emotion: excitement. The bigger the challenge, the more excited and productive and thrilled they become.

- big goals trigger big fear. Just as it happened with our ancestors on the savanna, the brain restricts the cortex in order to get us moving away from the lion—but now the lion is a piece of paper called a test or a goal of losing weight, finding a mate, or creating a sales result. Creativity and purposeful action are suppressed exactly when we need them the most! ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=345))

- How Small Steps Become Giant Leaps Your brain is programmed to resist change. But, by taking small steps, you effectively rewire your nervous system so that it does the following: “unsticks” you from a creative block bypasses the fight-or-flight response creates new connections between neurons so that the brain enthusiastically takes over the process of change and you progress rapidly toward your goal ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=360))

- Adults, I believe, assume that if they are living correctly, they can control the events around them. When fear does appear, it seems all wrong—so adults prefer to call it by the names for psychiatric disease. Fear becomes a disorder, something to put in a box with a tidy label of “stress” or “anxiety.” ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=380))

- Shhh . . . Don’t Wake the Amygdala! Make your questions small, and you reduce the chances of waking the amygdala and arousing debilitating fear.

- Kaizen Tip You want to do something creative: write a story or a song, paint a picture, dream up your perfect career, or come up with a zinger of a solution to an office problem. But you have no idea where to start. Your mind keeps coming up empty. During times like these, kaizen can help you summon your powers of inspiration. Although you can’t force your brain to cough up creative ideas on demand, you can program it to launch the imaginative process simply by asking yourself a small question. Here are some of the most popular small questions my clients use for creativity. Feel free to come up with your own. Whatever question you use, your challenge is to ask it with a gentle and patient spirit. When you use a harsh or urgent tone with yourself, fear will clog the creative process. What’s one thing I wish to contribute to the world with my book, poem, song, or painting? Whom could I ask for help or inspiration? What is special about my creative process/talents/business team? What type of work would excite and fulfill me? ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=520))

- Remember: If you repeat the question over the course of several days or weeks—or for however long it takes—the hippocampus (the part of the brain that stores information) will have no choice but to address it. And in its own way, on its own timetable, the brain will begin giving you answers. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=528))

- Some of my clients, including Grace, thrive when they are “assigned” to leave answers to their small questions in my voice mail. But not everyone has a therapist (and not every therapist likes an overflowing voice mailbox). These people might try calling a friend or relative. If that’s too scary, another possibility is writing their answers down in a journal or leaving messages on their own answering machines.

- I hope you’ll build the kaizen habit of asking yourself small (and positive!) questions. As you begin, remember that you are programming your brain for creativity, so choose a question and ask it repeatedly, over the course of several days or weeks. Instead of freezing up your brain with tall orders and angry demands, you’ll experience the productive output of a brain that is pleasantly challenged. If your goal is to come up with a creative breakthrough or a single idea for improvement, you may be done when you receive your answer. But if you are trying to achieve a difficult or frightening goal, a small question may be just one step toward change. The rest of this book will suggest many more strategies—safe and nonthreatening—for realizing your dreams. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=635))

- It may come as a relief to know that there’s a nearly painless way to train yourself to perform difficult tasks, even those you think are unsuited to your nature and talents. This method, called mind sculpture, can help you run a tough race, go out on blind dates, or talk to employees more effectively. Mind sculpture takes advantage of cutting-edge neuroscience, which suggests that the brain learns best not in large dramatic doses—Just do it!—but in very small increments, smaller than ever believed possible.

- This small kaizen strategy is actually perfect for anyone who’s struggled and struggled to achieve a goal that remains out of reach. That’s because it’s such a safe, comfortable step to take that it allows you to walk right past any mental obstacles that have held you back. Mind sculpture is so effective in neutralizing fear that it’s even worked for earthquake or accident victims who suffer from flashbacks. They imagine themselves inside the flashback—but they envision a positive resolution. The same goes for people with recurring nightmares: I ask them to relive the dream, but with a happy ending. Dozens of my clients have used this technique, and for each one the nightmare or flashback has vanished within a matter of days.

- For the first month, Michael was to spend thirty seconds each day performing mind sculpture. I asked him to imagine giving a person from his department a specific, detailed compliment in an enthusiastic tone of voice, as if there were no problems at all with this person’s work. He was to imagine how he would stand in front of the person, how it would feel to approach the person with a relaxed, open posture, how his voice would sound, and what any ambient sounds or smells might be.

- I asked Michael if he’d mind extending this exercise to his family. I suspected that his silence extended to his home life and that his loved ones would appreciate a little kaizen sent their way. I asked him to spend some of his thirty-second periods imagining giving specific compliments to his wife or one of his three children. The next month I asked Michael if he could continue to imagine one compliment but to add one critical comment as well. He was to imagine himself with a specific employee, feeling his own facial muscles moving and his body posture remaining open as he delivered these messages in a kind, matter-of-fact tone of voice. I also asked him to actually give one compliment out loud to someone at home every day. Two weeks into the second month, my phone rang. “My wife and kids are asking what’s wrong with me!” Michael said, clearly pleased with himself. His family had returned his compliments with such love and warmth that mind sculpture and kaizen now had real credibility with him. “Now,” I suggested, “how about calling me once a day and leaving your one compliment and one criticism for an employee on my voice mail?” He could practice his tone of voice that way, and I’d return the call with feedback about the specificity of the comments and whether his tone had reached the level of neutrality he sought. Mind sculpture—plus the small, active steps that mental rehearsal enabled him to take—taught Michael a new set of skills. It also gave him a taste for the ease and the rewards of applying them. At the end of our three months together, he conducted the belated reviews without any prompting and he found himself stopping in the hallways ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=749))

- Kaizen Technique A Mind Sculpture How-To Whatever your goal, mind sculpture is a terrific way to ease into your kaizen program for change. In true kaizen fashion, I’ll break mind sculpture down into several small steps: Isolate a task either that you are afraid to do or that makes you uncomfortable. Try to give yourself at least a month before you actually have to perform this activity. Decide how many seconds you’re willing to devote to mind sculpture for this task each day. Make sure you allot seconds, not minutes or hours; the time commitment should be so low that you can easily fulfill its requirements every single day. Repetition is essential: Whatever you do repeatedly, even if for only a few seconds at a time, the brain decides must be important and so begins committing cells to the new behavior. When you are ready to practice mind sculpture, sit or lie down in a quiet, comfortable spot and close your eyes. Imagine that you are in the difficult or uncomfortable situation and looking around you through your own eyes. What do you… ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=764))

- Without moving an actual muscle, imagine that you are performing the task. What are the words you use? What does your voice sound like and how does it resonate through your body? What are your physical gestures? Imagine a positive response to your activity. If you are mind sculpting for public speaking, for example, see the audience leaning forward in their seats, looking responsive and interested. Hear the scratch of pencil on paper as some particularly enthusiastic people take notes. When your allotted time for mind sculpture has become habitual and even fun, you may find that you are automatically performing the formerly difficult activity with enthusiasm. But if you’re not ready for the real thing, that’s perfectly okay. Never force the process of kaizen; it works only if you let change happen in a comfortable and easy manner. You may instead choose to increase the time you spend on mind sculpture—but once again, you should increase slowly, perhaps by just thirty seconds. You should increase the length and pace only when the previous stage of mind sculpture has become effortless. If you start making excuses for not practicing mind sculpture, or if you find yourself forgetting to do it, then you need to cut back on the amount of time. Once you feel comfortable using mind sculpture for this task (and it may take days or weeks or even longer), imagine a worst-case scenario and how you would respond effectively to it. A public speaker might feel nervous sweat run down his face as he sees the… ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=774))

- Small actions are at the heart of kaizen. By taking steps so tiny that they seem trivial or even laughable, you’ll sail calmly past obstacles that have defeated you before.

What patients really hated was that feeling of surrender when they walked in the door, that not only their bodies but their time was in someone else’s hands. It was a perfect moment for a kaizen question: How can you improve the patient’s experience of delays in a way that won’t cost anything or demand more than a few seconds of your time?

Although pain cannot always be managed with medications and other medical inventions, mental techniques like meditation can significantly reduce the suffering of those who hurt. This pain expert encouraged each of his listeners to go home and meditate for one minute a day. Quite surprised, I went up to him after the talk and asked him why he thought one minute of meditation would possibly do anyone any good. In a patient tone of voice, he asked me how long meditation techniques had been around. “Two or three thousand years,” I said. “That’s right,” he told me. “So there’s a very good chance that the people in this audience have heard of it before now. Those who like the idea have already found a teacher or a book and are doing it. For the rest of the people in this audience, meditation is the worst idea they ever heard of. I’d rather they go home and meditate for one minute than not meditate for thirty minutes. They might like it. They may forget to stop.” ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=912))

- And I believe he was right. The study of persuasive techniques consistently demonstrates kaizen’s power to melt even the toughest resistance. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=920))

- Kaizen Tip For glowing health, it might be best to set your goals lower. Just a few positive changes can have a surprising impact on your well-being. Recent research has strongly suggested that losing 10 percent of one’s body weight (assuming a person is overweight to begin with) leads to radical improvements in diabetes risk, hypertension, and sleep apnea. A study at Adelphi University shows that people who used the treadmill just four minutes a day for four days a week (making sure to reach 70 percent of their maximum heart rate), experienced a 10 percent increase in their aerobic capacity—the same percentage as those who exercised twenty minutes a day!

- I knew there was no point in prescribing the latest smoking-cessation technology for Rachel. She clearly possessed the self-discipline to make that first leap onto the wagon. But one of the most solid predictors of success in life is whether a person turns to another human for support in times of trouble or fear. If Rachel really was to succeed, she’d have to learn to trust, to find a human companion and confidante who could replace cigarettes. And we both knew that her health was on the line; in all likelihood, she didn’t have a couple of years to spend in therapy thoroughly discussing her childhood before trying to give up cigarettes again. Nor did she have the patience; I suspected such intense therapy was too big and scary a step for her. The first small step Rachel took was to call my voice mail once a day. All she had to say was, “Hi, it’s Rachel.” She was taken aback when she realized this teeny step made her nervous. She then understood its value: If you’ve spent a lifetime avoiding dependence, the simple act of calling into voice mail violates your promise never to need another person. As this step became less frightening, we added another call just before she smoked a cigarette. This was not an attempt to shame Rachel into quitting. We agreed that she could still smoke as many cigarettes as she wanted to—she was just supposed to say hello before smoking. “Hi, it’s Rachel!” she’d say. “I’m having a cigarette now!” Because Rachel had learned not to crave human companionship, I was trying to develop Rachel’s appetite for it in a way that wouldn’t scare her. I was also putting one step between Rachel and her “best friend.” We did this for one month. Then I asked Rachel to write down her feelings in a journal. Research demonstrates that people who use a journal to chart their emotions receive many of the same physical and psychological benefits as those who talk to a doctor or minister or friend. I believe that the reason writing in a journal is so effective is that, for many people, it’s a pretty big deal to decide that your emotional life is valuable enough to commit to a book that no one else will ever see. Psychology research suggests that clients are supposed to write in their journals for at least fifteen to twenty minutes a day to receive its benefits, but there was no way Rachel would devote that much time to her inner life. So we began by having her write for just two minutes every day. We did this, along with the phone calls, for two ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1037))

- more months. Rachel’s brain began to think about her journal and me whenever she was upset. At the end of this period, Rachel was surprised to discover her cigarette intake was cut back by 30 percent, without any effort on her part. Then I asked her to incorporate another kaizen step—small questions—into her routine. She was to imagine that she had a best friend (a human one!) who was by her side all day long, and to ask herself what she’d like the friend to do at any given moment—perhaps listen to her brag about one of her accomplishments or chat with her as she decided what to have for lunch. These questions began to take hold. (For more information about the power of small kaizen questions, see the chapter “Ask Small Questions.”) Soon Rachel started to call real people, those friends who seemed worthy of the risk, and she began to have positive experiences as she reached out to them in small ways. Around this time, Rachel went back to the smoking-cessation technique she’d used before. Within a month, she’d stopped smoking. And this time, she didn’t stop for just a little while. Rachel has not smoked a cigarette in two years. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1054))

- We are so accustomed to living with minor annoyances that it’s not always easy to identify them, let alone make corrections. But these annoyances have a way of acquiring mass and eventually blocking your path to change. By training yourself to spot and solve small problems, you can avoid undergoing much more painful remedies later.

- Kaizen Technique Learning to Spot Small Problems Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20, and it’s always easier to spot a crack in the ceiling after rain has soaked the plaster. But it’s possible to train yourself to see small warning signs more clearly. Try these exercises to sharpen your small-problem vision: Recall a major mistake you’ve made at some point in your life. Now, take some time to consider whether there were small signs along the way indicating that things were not going according to your plans or wishes. What measures did you have to take to correct the problem? Did you halt your “assembly line” and start all over? Did you ignore the problem in the hopes you’d achieve your result on time anyway? Identify one small mistake you have made today, without becoming angry with yourself for making this mistake. This single act, especially if you perform it daily, will raise your awareness of small mistakes. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1135))

- Now ask yourself whether the small mistake you identified in exercise 2 reflects a larger problem, or if it has the potential to gather velocity. (If you misplaced your car keys, for example, ask yourself if you are trying to juggle too many things at once, or are so distracted that you might eventually make a more serious mistake.) By paying attention to this mistake, you will reduce its frequency. If you feel this mistake indicates a more significant problem in your life, ask yourself: What kaizen step can I take to correct this situation? Ask yourself whether there are ways in which you irritate your family, friends, co-workers, or customers. Your new awareness alone reduces the probability that you will make this mistake again, but you should also ask yourself whether this mistake is part of a bigger problem. If you can peg the error to a larger issue, you’ll give yourself further incentive to work on it! ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1142))

- A happier example can be found in New York City’s approach to crime. In the 1980s, there was a yearly average of two thousand murders and six hundred thousand felonies. In the subway system alone, riders and workers fell victim to fifteen thousand felonies per year. Frustrated politicians and police officials tried again and again to reduce major crime with bold steps, raising the number of cops on the beat, increasing budgets, and so on. They assumed that since crime had attained such outsized dimensions, only the splashiest, most costly techniques could deflate the statistics. But, despite great expense and effort, crime continued to rise. Enter William Bratton, who was hired in 1990 to reduce New York’s subway crime. Bratton’s philosophy was influenced by a lecture he’d attended on the “broken windows” theory, first postulated in 1982 by two criminologists, James Q. Wilson ([Location 1261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1261))

- and George L. Kelling. The broken windows theory held that if a city—or a neighborhood or a street—tolerated minor infractions of the law, it was practically inviting more serious offenses. Wilson and Kelling observed that when kids threw rocks at a vacant building and broke one windowpane, and that windowpane was not fixed, the remaining windows were soon broken as well. But if the initial broken window was repaired quickly, vandals stayed away and the rest of the windows remained intact. This scenario was emblematic, Wilson and Kelling believed, of a larger truth about crimes: People are more willing to break the law in neighborhoods where small crimes go unnoticed or unpunished. If no one in the neighborhood is able to handle a drunk who is loud and disorderly, will any of the citizens even attempt to interfere with a mugging or call the police during a robbery? When Bratton arrived in New York in 1990, he brought this kaizenlike philosophy with him. Resisting what must have been extraordinary pressure to apply radical, showy solutions to the problem of subway crime—a problem that plagued millions of responsible citizens as they rode to and from work each day—Bratton isolated small problems instead. He decided to focus on the petty crimes that eroded the quality of life for transit passengers but did not put them in physical danger. These crimes included urinating in public, vagrancy, and turnstile jumping. Imagine Bratton’s bravery in telling cynical and angry New Yorkers that he was going to focus on turnstile jumping instead of homicides. But he held to his plan.

Not only are they inexpensive and convenient, but they also stimulate the internal motivation required for lasting change.

- Kaizen Technique The Perfect Reward Think hard before deciding on a small reward. You want the reward to have these three qualities: The reward should be appropriate to the goal. For Karen Pryor, chocolate was a perfect encouragement to get to class—a small, harmless indulgence. But for the man told by his doctor to cut back on unhealthful foods, chocolate would be counterproductive. The reward should be appropriate to the person. If you’re trying to encourage another person to achieve a goal, remember that one person’s reward is another person’s annoyance. For some people, it’s a great boost to receive a compliment every time they take a positive step toward their goal. Others think that frequent compliments are condescending. For certain clients, especially those who are hesitant to contact me outside of our scheduled visits, I use phone calls as a reward: Every time they achieve a small success, they call me so that I can congratulate them. Needless to say, this reward would be meaningless for those clients who feel entitled to call their therapists any time of the day or night!

- When you’re implementing a plan for change but find yourself bored, restless, and stuck, look around for hidden moments of delight. People who are most successful at improving their health habits are those who can transform exercise or eating well into a source of excitement and pride. My clients have taught me that this holds true for other goals as well. So don’t assume that happiness will arrive with your size 6 jeans (or your newly robust marriage, or your organized closet). Instead, focus on the moments of change that bring you pleasure. I know it sounds tough, but most people are able to come up with at least one moment they’ve enjoyed. “Well, on my walk today I remembered just how pretty my neighborhood is,” people will say. Or “I was eating an apple today and remembered working in the orchard for my uncle. I had so much fun that summer!” ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B5L788P5&location=1482))

- Kaizen Technique Cultivating Awareness of Small Moments It takes curiosity and an open mind to see the promise of small moments. By cultivating these qualities, you’ll improve your chances of recognizing creative potential—whenever it happens to spring up in your path. Here’s a series of steps to help your mind stay open, playful, and alert to small moments, even in emotionally charged situations. Look for a person who has the opposite opinion from you on hot-button social policy issues, such as abortion, gun control, or school vouchers. It is helpful if this person is a stranger—say, someone sitting next to you on an airplane—rather than a close friend or family member. Engage this person in a conversation in which all you do is ask questions with only one agenda: to discover and understand the reasons for his or her point of view. Try not to argue, persuade, or sound judgmental. You will know you are succeeding when you feel the person becoming more and more relaxed and chatty as he or she perceives your interest and respect.
