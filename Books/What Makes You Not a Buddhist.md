## Highlights
- Many people mistakenly think that Buddha is the “God” of Buddhism; even some people in commonly recognized Buddhist countries such as Korea, Japan, and Bhutan have this theistic approach to the Buddha and Buddhism. This is why throughout this book we use the name Siddhartha and Buddha interchangeably, to remind people that Buddha was just a man and that this man became Buddha.

- One is a Buddhist if he or she accepts the following four truths: All compounded things are impermanent. All emotions are pain. All things have no inherent existence. Nirvana is beyond concepts. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=93))

- So, what makes you a Buddhist? You may not have been born in a Buddhist country or to a Buddhist family, you may not wear robes or shave your head, you may eat meat and idolize Eminem and Paris Hilton. That doesn’t mean you cannot be a Buddhist. In order to be a Buddhist, you must accept that all compounded phenomena are impermanent, all emotions are pain, all things have no inherent existence, and enlightenment is beyond concepts.

- lives we have this impulse to shield ourselves and others from the truth. We’ve become impervious to obvious signs of decay. We encourage ourselves by “not dwelling on it” and by employing positive affirmations. We celebrate our birthdays by blowing out candles, ignoring the fact that the extinguished candles could equally be seen as a reminder that we are a year closer to death. We celebrate the New Year with firecrackers and champagne, distracting ourselves from the fact that the old year will never come back and the new year is filled with uncertainty—anything can happen.

He no longer sees the point of working fourteen-hour days, sucking up to his boss, greedily swallowing up competitors, destroying the environment, contributing to child labor, and living in constant tension only to have a few weeks of vacation every year. He tells you that he wants to cash in his stocks, donate everything to an orphanage, and become a vagabond. What would you do? Give him your blessing and boast to your friends about how your son has come to his senses at last? Or would you tell him that he is being utterly irresponsible and send him to a psychiatrist?

- Without a single scientific tool, Prince Siddhartha sat on a patch of kusha grass beneath a ficus religiosa tree investigating human nature. After a long time of contemplation, he came to the realization that all form, including our flesh and bones, and all our emotions and all our perceptions, are assembled—they are the product of two or more things coming together. When any two components or more come together, a new phenomenon emerges—nails and wood become a table; water and leaves become tea; fear, devotion, and a savior become God. This end product doesn’t have an ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=252))

- existence independent of its parts. Believing it truly exists independently is the greatest deception. Meanwhile the parts have undergone a change. Just by meeting, their character has changed and, together, they have become something else—they are “compounded.” He realized that this applies not only to the human experience but to all matter, the entire world, the universe—because everything is interdependent, everything is subject to change. Not one component in all creation exists in an autonomous, permanent, pure state. Not the book you are holding, not atoms, not even the gods. So as long as something exists within reach of our mind, even in our imagination, such as a man with four arms, then it depends on the existence of something else. Thus Siddhartha discovered that impermanence does not mean death, as we usually think, it means change. Anything that changes in relation to another thing: even the slightest shift, is subject to the laws of impermanence. Through these realizations, Siddhartha found a way around the suffering of mortality after all. He accepted that change is inevitable and that death is just a part of this cycle. Furthermore, he realized that there was no almighty power who could reverse the path to death; therefore there was also no hope to trap him. If there is no blind hope, there is also no disappointment. If one knows that everything is impermanent, one does not grasp, and if one does not ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=256))

- Yet even after a devastating reminder like the tsunami, the death and devastation will soon be camouflaged and forgotten. Luxurious resorts will be erected on the very spot where families came to identify the corpses of their loved ones. The people of the world will continue to be caught up in compounding and fabricating reality with hopes of achieving long-lasting happiness. Wishing for “happily ever after” is nothing more than a desire for permanence in disguise. Fabricating concepts such as “eternal love,” “everlasting happiness,” and “salvation” generates more evidence of impermanence. Our intention and the result are at odds. We intend to establish ourselves and our world, but we forget that the corrosion begins as soon as creation begins. What we aim for is not decay, but what we do leads directly to decay. At the very least, Buddha advised, we must try to keep the concept of impermanence in mind and not knowingly conceal it. By maintaining our awareness of assembled phenomena, we become aware of interdependence. Recognizing interdependence, we recognize impermanence. And when we remember that things are impermanent, we are less likely to be enslaved by assumptions, rigid beliefs (both religious and secular), value systems, or blind faith. Such ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=317))

- awareness prevents us from getting caught up in all kinds of personal, political, and relationship dramas. We begin to know that things are not entirely under our control and never will be, so there is no expectation for things to go according to our hopes and fears. There is no one to blame when things go wrong because there are countless causes and conditions to blame. We can direct this awareness from the farthest regions of our imaginations to subatomic levels. Even atoms cannot be trusted.

- The rules keep changing. One day we invite a friend to dinner, and since he is a fanatical vegetarian, we have to tailor the menu to him. But then the next time he comes over, he asks where’s the meat because now he is a fanatical protein-diet practitioner. Or someone who advocates abstinence before marriage can suddenly become very promiscuous once he or she tries it once.

- Whether you pride yourself on your religion or on not belonging to any religion, faith plays an important role in your existence. Even “not believing” requires faith—total, blind faith in your own logic or reason based on your ever-changing ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=395))

- changing feelings. So it is no surprise when what used to seem so convincing no longer persuades us. The illogical nature of faith is not subtle at all; in fact it is among the most assembled and interdependent of phenomena. Faith can be triggered by the right look at the right time in the right place. Your faith may depend on superficial compatibility. Let’s say that you are a misogynist and you meet a person who is preaching hatred against women. You will find that person powerful, you will agree with him, and you will have some faith in him. Something as inconsequential as a shared love of anchovies might add to your devotion. Or perhaps a person or institution has the ability to lessen your fear of the unknown. Other factors such as the family, country, or society you are born into are all part of the assembly of elements that come together as what we call faith.

- Fear and anxiety are the dominant psychological states of the human mind. Behind the fear lies a constant longing to be certain. We are afraid of the unknown. The mind’s craving for confirmation is rooted in our fear of impermanence. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=414))

- Fearlessness is generated when you can appreciate uncertainty, when you have faith in the impossibility of these interconnected components remaining static and permanent. You will find yourself, in a very true sense, preparing for the worst while allowing for the best. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=416))

- But we forget that our days are always numbered. Even if we understand intellectually that everything born must die and that everything assembled will eventually disintegrate, in our emotional state we constantly slip back into operating out of a belief in permanence, entirely forgetting interdependence. This habit can foster all kinds of negative states: paranoia, loneliness, guilt. We may feel put upon, threatened, mistreated, neglected—as if this world were unjust to us alone.

- Buddha was not a pessimist or a doomsayer; he was a realist, while we tend to be escapists. When he stated that all assembled things are impermanent, he did not intend for that to be bad news; it is a simple, scientific fact. Depending on your perspective and on your understanding of this fact, it can become a gateway to inspiration and hope, glory and success. For example, to the extent that global warming and poverty are products of insatiable capitalistic conditions, these misfortunes can be reversed. This is thanks to the impermanent nature of assembled phenomena. Instead of depending on supernatural powers, such as God’s will, to reverse such negative trends, a simple understanding of the nature of assembled phenomena is all that is needed. When you understand phenomena, you can manipulate them, and thus affect causes and conditions. You might be surprised how much a small step like just saying no to plastic bags would postpone global warming.

- You can transform not only your physical world but your emotional world, for example, turning agitation into peace of mind by letting go of ambition or turning low self-respect into confidence by acting out of kindness and philanthropy. If we all condition ourselves to put our feet in other people’s shoes, we will cultivate peace in our homes, with our neighbors, and with other countries.

- The concept of impermanence does not foretell Armageddon or the Apocalypse, nor is it a punishment for our sins. It is not inherently negative or positive, it is simply part of the process of the compounding of things. We usually appreciate only half of the cycle of impermanence. We can accept birth but not death, accept gain but not loss, or the end of exams but not the beginning. True liberation comes from appreciating the whole cycle and not grasping onto those things that we find agreeable. By remembering the changeability and impermanence of causes and conditions, both ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=481))

- positive and negative, we can use them to our advantage. Wealth, health, peace, and fame are just as temporary as their opposites. And of course Siddhartha wasn’t favoring heaven and heavenly experiences. They are equally impermanent. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=485))

- We might wonder why Siddhartha said that “all assembled things” are impermanent. Why not just say that “all things” are impermanent? It would be correct to say that all things are impermanent without the qualifying word assembled. However, we must take every opportunity to remind ourselves of the first part, the assembly, in order to maintain the logic behind the statement. “Assembly” is a very simple concept, yet it has so many layers that to understand it deeply, we need this constant reminder. Nothing that exists or functions in the world, no constructs of the imagination or of the physical plane, nothing that passes through your mind, not even your mind itself, will stay as it is forever. Things might last for the duration of your experience of this existence, or even into the next generation; but then again, they may dissolve sooner than you expect. Either way, eventual change is inevitable. There is no degree of probability or chance involved. If you feel hopeless, remember this and you will no longer have a reason to be hopeless, because whatever is causing you to despair will also change. Everything must change.

- A more appropriate question to ask a Buddhist is simply, “What is life?” From our understanding of impermanence, the answer should be obvious: “Life is a big array of assembled phenomena, and thus life is impermanent.” ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=525))

- Of course, the definitions of “suffering” and “happiness” differ a great deal among these life-forms, even within the relatively small human realm. The definition of “suffering” for some is the definition of “happiness” for others and vice versa. For some humans, being happy means just managing to survive; for others it means owning seven hundred pairs of shoes. There are those who find happiness in having a likeness of David Beckham tattooed on their biceps. Sometimes the price is the life of another being, as when one’s happiness depends on getting hold of a shark’s fin, a chicken’s thigh, or a tiger’s penis. Some consider the gentle tickle of a feather erotic, while others prefer cheese graters, whips, and chains. King Edward VIII preferred to marry an American divorcée instead of wearing the crown of the mighty British Empire.

- Some of these cultural definitions of “happiness” do work to an extent. In a general sense, having a bit of money in the bank, comfortable shelter, enough food to eat, decent shoes, and other basic comforts does make us happy. But then again, the sadhus of India and wandering hermits of Tibet feel happy because they have no need for a key ring—they have no fear that their possessions will be stolen because they have nothing to be locked up.

- He explored suffering with an open mind, and through his tireless contemplation Siddhartha discovered that at the root, it is our emotions that lead to suffering. In fact they are suffering. One way or another, directly or indirectly, all emotions are born from selfishness in the sense that they involve clinging to the self. Moreover, he discovered that, as real as they may seem, emotions are not an inherent part of one’s being. They are not inborn, nor are they some ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=600))

- sort of curse or implant that someone or some god has thrust upon us. Emotions arise when particular causes and conditions come together, such as when you rush to think that someone is criticizing you, ignoring you, or depriving you of some gain. Then the corresponding emotions arise. The moment we accept those emotions, the moment we buy into them, we have lost awareness and sanity. We are “worked up.” Thus Siddhartha found his solution—awareness. If you seriously wish to eliminate suffering, you must generate awareness, tend to your emotions, and learn how to avoid getting worked up. If you examine emotions as Siddhartha did, if you try to identify their origin, you will find that they are rooted in misunderstanding and thus fundamentally flawed. All emotions are basically a form of prejudice; within each emotion there is always an element of judgment. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=603))

- Seeing beyond the superficiality of palace life, Siddhartha could now see his own physical body as essenceless. To him the fire ring and the body have the same nature. As long as one believes that such things truly exist—either momentarily or “for all eternity”—one’s belief is rooted in misunderstanding. This misunderstanding is none other than a lack of awareness. And when awareness is lost, that is what Buddhists call ignorance. It is from this ignorance that our emotions emerge. This process, from the loss of awareness to the emergence of emotions, can be fully explained using the four truths, as we will see.

- An unfathomable variety of emotions exists in this worldly realm. Every moment, countless emotions are produced based on our misjudgments, prejudices, and ignorance. We are familiar with love and hate, guilt and innocence, devotion, pessimism, jealousy and pride, fear, shame, sadness, and joy, but there are so many more. Some cultures have words for emotions that in other cultures are undefined and therefore do not exist. In some parts of Asia, there is no word for romantic love, whereas the Spaniards have numerous words for different kinds of love. According to Buddhists there are innumerable emotions that are yet to be named in any language, and even more that fall outside of our logical world’s ability to ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=636))

- define. Some emotions are seemingly rational, but most are irrational. Some seemingly peaceful emotions are rooted in aggression. Some are almost imperceptible. We might think that someone is completely impassive or detached, but that is itself an emotion. Emotions can be childish. For example, you might get angry because another person is not angry and you think they should be. Or you might be upset one day because your partner is too possessive and the next day because she is not possessive enough. Some emotions are amusing to the casual observer, as when Prince Charles, in a clandestine moment of flirtation, remarked to his then mistress Camilla Parker Bowles that he wouldn’t mind being reincarnated as her tampon. Some emotions manifest as arrogance, such as the White House–dwellers imposing their idea of liberty on the world. Forcing our personal views on others through strength, blackmail, trickery, or subtle manipulation is also a part of our emotional activity.

- self-righteous emotion when President Bush, from the bridge of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, declared victory over Iraq, even though in fact the war had barely begun. Desperation for respect is an emotion: consider Malaysia, Taiwan, and China competing to see who can build the tallest building in the world, as if it were proof of their virility. Emotions can be sick and twisted, leading to pedophilia and bestiality. One man even advertised on the Internet for young men who wanted to be killed and eaten. He received numerous responses, and did indeed kill and devour one of the respondents. GETTING TO THE ROOT: THE (NONEXISTENT) SELF All of these various emotions and their consequences come from misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding comes from one source, which is the root of all ignorance—clinging to the self. We assume that each of us is a self, that there is an entity called “me.” The self is just another misunderstanding, however. We generally manufacture a notion of self, which feels… ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=650))

- We do the same with feelings, perceptions, and actions. I have feelings, I am my perceptions . . . But Siddhartha realized that there is no independent entity that qualifies as the self to be found anywhere, either inside or outside the body. Like the optical illusion of a fire ring, the self is illusory. It is a fallacy, fundamentally flawed and ultimately nonexistent. But just as we can get carried away by the fire ring, we all get carried away by thinking that we are the self. When we look at our own bodies, feelings, perceptions, actions, and consciousness, we see that these are different elements of what we think of as “me,” but if we were to examine them, we would find that “me” doesn’t dwell in any of them. Clinging to the fallacy of the self is a ridiculous act of ignorance; it perpetuates ignorance; and it leads to all kinds of pain and disappointment. Everything we do in our lives depends on how we perceive our “selves,” so if this perception is based on misunderstandings, which it inevitably is, then this misunderstanding permeates everything we do, see, and experience. It is not a simple matter of a child misinterpreting light and movement; our whole existence is based on very flimsy premises. At the moment that Siddhartha found no self, he also found no inherently existing evil—only ignorance. Specifically, he contemplated the ignorance of creating a label of “self,” pasting it on a totally baseless assembled phenomenon, imputing its importance, and agonizing to protect it. This ignorance, he found, leads directly to suffering and pain. Ignorance is simply not knowing the facts, having the facts wrong, or having incomplete knowledge. All of these forms of ignorance lead to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, overestimation and underestimation. Suppose that you are searching for your friend and you see him in a distant field. When you approach, you discover that you have mistaken a scarecrow for your friend. You are bound to be disappointed. It is not as if either the mischievous scarecrow or your friend tried sneakily to mislead you, it is your own ignorance that betrayed you. Anything we do that emerges from this ignorance is speculative. When… ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=660))

- favor, and an underestimation of the obstacles. Of course, causes and conditions do come together and things do happen as we anticipated, but we take this kind of success for granted. We use it as proof that it should not be otherwise, that our assumptions are well-founded. But such assumptions are just food for misunderstanding. Every time we make an assumption—for example, that we understand our spouse—we are exposing ourselves like an open wound. Assumptions and expectations that rely on someone or something else leave us vulnerable. At any moment, one of the uncountable possible contradictions can pop up and sprinkle salt on our assumptions, causing us to flinch and howl. HABIT: THE SELF’S ALLY Probably the biggest discovery in human history was Siddhartha’s realization that the self does not exist independently, that it is a mere label, and therefore that clinging to it is ignorance. However, as unsound as the label self may be, destroying it is no small task. This label called “self” is the most stubborn of all… ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=680))

- Mara is depicted as a handsome and powerful warrior who has never been defeated. Like Mara, the self is powerful and insatiable, egocentric and deceptive, greedy for attention, clever, and vain. It’s hard to remember that, like the illusion of the fire ring, the self is assembled, doesn’t exist independently, and is susceptible to change. Habit makes us weak against the self. Even simple habits die hard. You may be aware of how bad smoking is for your health, but that doesn’t necessarily convince you to stop smoking, especially when you enjoy the ritual, the slender shape of the cigarette, the way the tobacco smolders, the fragrant smoke curling around your fingers. But the habit of self is not just a simple addiction like smoking cigarettes. From time immemorial we have been addicted to the self. It is how we identify ourselves. It is what we love most dearly. It is also what we hate most fiercely at times. Its existence is also the thing that we work hardest to try to validate. Almost everything that we do or think or have, including our spiritual path, is a means to confirm its existence. It is the self… ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=689))

- live as a capitalist. When the self feels lonely, it desires friendship. Its possessiveness of those it loves manifests in passion that can lead to aggression. Its supposed enemies—such as spiritual paths designed to conquer the ego—are often corrupted and recruited as the self’s ally. Its skill in playing the game of deception is nearly perfect. It weaves a cocoon around itself like a silkworm; but unlike a silkworm, it doesn’t know how to find the way out. WARRING WITH THE SELF During the battle at Bodh Gaya, Mara deployed a variety of weapons against Siddhartha. In particular, he had a collection of special arrows. Each arrow possessed ruinous powers: the arrow that causes desire, the arrow that causes mental dullness, the arrow that causes pride, the arrow that causes conflict, the arrow that causes arrogance, the arrow that causes blind obsession, and the arrow that causes no awareness, to name a few. In the Buddhist sutras we read that Mara remains undefeated in each of us—he directs his poison arrows at us all the time. When we… ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=699))

- When struck by the desire arrow, all of our common sense, sobriety, and sanity go out the window while false dignity, decadence, and immorality trickle in. Poisoned, we stop at nothing to get what we want. Someone struck with passion might even find a streetwalking hippopotamus sexy, even as a beautiful girl loyally waits for him at home. Like moths to the flame and fish to baited hooks, many on this earth have been ensnared by their desire for food, fame, praise, money, beauty, and respect. Passion can also manifest as lust for power. Seized with such a passion, leaders are completely indifferent to how their lust for power is destroying the planet. If it were not for certain people’s greed for wealth, the highways would be filled with cars powered by the sun, and no one would be starving. Such advances are technologically and physically possible, but apparently not emotionally possible. And meanwhile we grumble about injustice and we blame people like George W. Bush.

- march in “No Blood for Oil” protests rely on oil to import the kiwifruit for their smoothies. Mara’s arrows create endless conflict. Throughout history, religious figures, those who are supposedly above desire, our models of integrity and propriety, have proved to be equally power hungry. They manipulate their followers with threats of hell and promises of heaven. Today we see politicians manipulating elections and campaigns to the extent that they have no qualms bombarding an innocent country with Tomahawk missiles if it will sway public opinion in their favor. Who cares if you win the war so long as you win the election? Other politicians sanctimoniously flaunt religion, have themselves shot, manufacture heroes, and stage catastrophes, all to satisfy their desire for power. When the self is full of pride, it manifests in countless ways—narrow-mindedness, racism, fragility, fear of rejection, fear of getting hurt, insensitivity, to name a few. Out of masculine pride, men have stifled the energy and contributions of over half the human race—women. During courtship, each side lets pride get in the way, constantly evaluating whether the other person is good enough for them or whether they are good enough for the other person. Proud families spend fortunes on a one-day wedding ceremony for a marriage that may or may not last, while on the ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=718))

A tourist makes a show of giving a ten-dollar tip to the doorman for pushing a revolving door, and the next minute he’s bargaining for a five-dollar T-shirt from a vendor who is trying to support her baby and family. Pride and pity are closely related. Believing that your life is harder and sadder than everyone else’s is simply a manifestation of clinging to self. When the self develops self-pity, it eliminates any space that others have to feel compassionate. In this imperfect world so many people have suffered and are still suffering. But some people’s suffering has been categorized as a more “special” suffering. Although actual statistics are not available, it seems safe to say that the number of Native Americans slaughtered as Europeans colonized North America is at least equal to that of other recognized genocides. And yet there is no widely used term—such as anti-Semitism or the Holocaust—for this inconceivable slaughter. The mass murders led by Stalin and Mao Tse-tung also don’t have recognizable labels, let alone sleek museums, lawsuits for retribution, and endless documentaries and feature films. Muslims cry that they are persecuted, forgetting the destruction wreaked by their Moghul forefathers, who conquered large parts of Asia as missionaries.

Christians, Jews, and Muslims all believe in the same God, and in a sense they are brothers. Yet because of the pride of each of these religions and their thinking that they are “right,” religion has caused more death than the two world wars put together. Racism drips from the poisoned arrow of pride. Many Asians and Africans accuse white Westerners of being racist, but racism is also an institution in Asia. At least in the West there are laws against racism, and it is publicly condemned. A Singaporean girl cannot bring her Belgian husband home to meet the family. Ethnic Chinese and Indians in Malaysia cannot have the status of Bhumiputra, even after many generations. Many second-generation Koreans in Japan are still not naturalized.

Envy is another of Mara’s arrows. It is one of the great loser emotions. It manifests irrationally and generates fantastic stories to distract you. It can strike suddenly at the most unexpected times, perhaps even while you are enjoying yourself at the symphony. Even though you have no intention of becoming a cellist, you have never even touched a cello, you may become jealous of an innocent cello player whom you have never even met. Just the fact that she is talented is enough to poison your mind. Much of the world is jealous of the United States. Many of the religious and political fanatics who ridicule and criticize the U.S., calling Americans “Satanists” and “imperialists,” would fall head over heels for a green card, if they don’t already have one.

- Out of Mara’s selfish desire for more disciples, he cleverly preaches freedom, but if someone really exercises freedom, Mara won’t necessarily like it. Fundamentally we like to have freedom only for ourselves but not for others. It is no wonder that if we or anyone else really do exercise all our freedoms, we will not be invited to all the parties. This so-called freedom and democracy is just another tool of control by Mara. WHAT ABOUT LOVE? One might think that not all emotions are suffering—what about love, joy, creative inspiration, devotion, ecstasy, peace, union, fulfillment, relief? We believe that emotion is necessary for poetry, songs, and art. Our definition of “suffering” isn’t fixed, and it is limited. Siddhartha’s definition of “suffering” is much more vast and yet much more specific and clear. Some kinds of suffering, such as aggression, jealousy, and headaches, have an obvious negative quality, while others are more subtly painful. For Siddhartha, anything that has a quality of uncertainty and unpredictability is… ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=757))

- a leash. And the additional hidden conditions are uncountable. For this reason it is also futile to blame our parents for our unhappy childhood or to blame ourselves for our parents’ disharmony, because we are not aware of the many hidden dependent conditions involved in these situations. Tibetans use the words rangwang and shenwang to represent “happiness” and “unhappiness.” They are difficult to translate precisely; rang means “self” and wang means “power,” “rights,” or “entitlement,” while shen means “other.” Broadly speaking, as long as one is in control, one is happy, and as long as someone else holds the leash, one is unhappy. Therefore the definition of “happiness” is when one has full control, freedom, rights, leisure, no obstacles, no leash. That means the freedom to choose and the freedom not to choose, the freedom to be active or to be leisurely. There are certain things we can do to bend conditions to our advantage, such as taking vitamins to become strong or drinking a cup of coffee to wake up.

- nice living with someone who sulks all the time. But we can’t keep another person’s emotions upbeat at all times. We can try, and maybe we’ll even succeed sometimes, but such manipulation requires a great amount of maintenance. It’s not enough to say “I love you” just once in the beginning of a relationship. You have to do the right thing—send flowers, pay attention—until the end. If you fail even once, everything you have built can fall apart. And sometimes, even if you give undivided attention, the object of your attention may misinterpret, not know how to accept, or not be receptive at all. A young man anticipates a candlelight dinner with the girl of his dreams, imagining how the night will unfold, how he will woo and charm her. But that’s just his imagination, a guess. Whether it is an educated or an uneducated guess, it’s still just a guess. Basically we can’t be 100 percent prepared all the time. Therefore our obstacles and opponents need to be successful only 1 percent of the time to do all their damage: a slip of the tongue, accidental expulsion of gas, one casual glance away from the X-ray… ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=778))

- going as well as can be expected, I am not suffering. But what do they mean? Do they mean this 100 percent? Have they stopped preparing for things to get better? Have they dropped all their insecurities? If such an attitude comes from genuine contentment and appreciation for what they already have, this kind of appreciation is what Siddhartha recommended. But rarely do we ever witness such content; there is always this constant nagging feeling that there is more to life, and this discontent leads to suffering. Siddhartha’s solution was to develop awareness of the emotions. If you can be aware of emotions as they arise, even a little bit, you restrict their activity; they become like teenagers with a chaperone. Someone is watching, and the power of Mara is weakened. Siddhartha was not injured by the poison arrows because of his awareness that they were merely illusions. In the same way, our own powerful emotions can become as harmless as flower petals. And when the apsaras approached Siddhartha, he could see clearly that they were just assembled phenomena, like a fire ring, and therefore they lost their allure. They couldn’t get a rise out of him. Similarly, we break the spell of temptation by seeing that the objects of our desire are actually just assembled phenomena. When you begin to notice the damage that emotions can do, awareness develops. When you have awareness—for example, if you know that you are on the edge of a cliff—you understand the dangers before you.

It is much more functional to work with the linear concept of “yesterday, today, and tomorrow” than to say “time is relative.” We are not programmed to think, I can fit into that yak horn without changing my size or shape. We cannot break our concepts of “small” and “big.” Instead we continuously confine ourselves with our safe and narrow perspectives that have been handed down for generations. When these perspectives are examined, however, they don’t hold up. For example, the concept of linear time upon which this world relies so heavily does not account for the fact that time has no real beginning and no end.

If we isolate one aspect or characteristic, this sameness falls apart. The water is different, the Earth is in a different place in its rotation through the galaxy, the leaves have fallen and been replaced—all that remains is an appearance of a river similar to the one that we saw last time. “Appearance” is quite an unstable basis for “truth.” Through simple analysis, the underpinnings of our conventional reality are revealed to be vague generalizations and assumptions.

But suppose that you are asleep and dreaming that you are flying through the sky. If someone in the dream says, “Human beings can’t fly,” you will say, “Yes, I can—see?” And you will fly away. Siddhartha would agree on both counts—you can’t fly when you are awake, and you can fly when you are asleep. The reasons are the causes and conditions that have or have not come together; a condition necessary to be able to fly is to be dreaming. When it is not there, you can’t fly, when it is you can.

The king ordered huge amounts of uncontaminated water to be stored so that he wouldn’t have to drink the cursed rain. But his subjects didn’t have the resources to store their water. When the rain came, they drank the water and became crazy. The king alone was “sane,” but he could not rule his crazy subjects, so as a last resort he, too, drank the water. In order to rule them, he needed to share in their delusions. As in the Miss Universe contest, everything that we do or think in this world is based on a very limited system of shared logic. We put so much emphasis on consensus. If the majority agrees that something is true, then it usually becomes valid. When we look at a small pond, we humans just see a pond; but to the fish in the pond this is their universe. If we take a democratic stance, then the aquatic dwellers should win because there are many more of them than there are of us pond gazers. Majority rule doesn’t always work. Terrible blockbuster films can gross huge profits, while a fascinating independent film is seen by only a handful of people.

- The classic Buddhist example used to illustrate emptiness is the snake and the rope. Let’s say there is a cowardly man named Jack who has a phobia about snakes. Jack walks into a dimly lit room, sees a snake coiled up in the corner, and panics. In fact he is looking at a striped Giorgio Armani tie, but in his terror he has misinterpreted what he sees to the point that he could even die of fright—death caused by a snake that does not truly exist. While he is under the impression that it is a snake, the pain and anxiety that he experiences is what Buddhists call “samsara,” which is a kind of mental trap. Fortunately for Jack, his friend Jill walks into the room. Jill is calm and sane and knows that Jack thinks he sees a snake. She can switch on the light and explain that there is no snake, that it is actually a tie. When Jack is convinced that he is safe, this relief is none other than what Buddhists call “nirvana”—liberation and freedom. But Jack’s relief is based on a fallacy of harm being averted, even though there was no snake and there was nothing to cause his suffering in the first place. It’s important to understand that by switching on the light and demonstrating that there is no snake, Jill is also saying that there is no absence of the snake. In other words, she cannot say, “The snake is gone now,” because the snake was never there. She didn’t make the snake disappear, just as Siddhartha didn’t make emptiness. This is why Siddhartha insisted that he could not sweep away the suffering of others by waving his hand. Nor could his own liberation be granted or shared piecemeal, like some sort of award. All he could do was explain from his experience that there was no suffering in the first place, which is like switching on the light for us. When Jill finds Jack frozen in terror, she has some choices about what to do. She can directly point out that there is no snake, or she can use a skillful method such as escorting the “snake” from the room. But if Jack is so terrified that he is unable to differentiate the snake from the tie, even with the light on, and if Jill is not skillful, then she could actually make things worse. If she dangles the necktie in Jack’s face, he could die of a heart attack. But if Jill is skillful and sees that Jack is delusional, she can say, “Yes, I see the snake,” and carefully take the tie out of the room ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1048))

- so that Jack feels safe for the time being. Maybe then, when he is relaxed, he can be gently guided to the point of seeing that there was never a snake in the first place. If Jack had never even gone into the room, if there was no misapprehension, then the whole scenario of seeing a snake or not seeing a snake is nullified. But because he saw a snake and is caught in the scenario, and because he is paralyzed with fear, he wants a means of escape. Siddhartha’s teachings are a method for such liberation. The dharma is sometimes referred to as a “holy” path, although strictly speaking there is no divinity in Buddhism. A path is a method or a tool that leads us from one place to another; in this case, the path leads us out of ignorance to the absence of ignorance. We use the word holy or venerable because the wisdom of dharma can release us from fear and suffering, which is generally the role of the divine. Our everyday experience of life is full of uncertainties, occasional joys, anxieties, and emotions that coil around us like a snake. Our hopes, fears, ambitions, and general hysteria create the darkness and shadows that allow the illusion of the snake to become even more vivid. Like the cowardly Jack, we hunt for solutions in all corners of the darkened room. The sole purpose of Siddhartha’s teaching is to help cowards like us understand that our suffering and paranoia are all based on illusions.

- The word karma is practically synonymous with Buddhism. It is usually understood as a sort of moralistic system of retribution—“bad” karma and “good” karma. But karma is simply a law of cause and effect, not to be confused with morality or ethics. No one, including Buddha, set the fundamental bar for what is negative and what is positive. Any motivation and action that steer us away from such truths as “all compounded things are impermanent” can result in negative consequences, or bad karma. And any action that brings us closer to understanding such truths as “all emotions are pain” can result in positive consequences, or good karma. At the end of the day, it was not for Buddha to judge; only you can truly know the motivation behind your actions.

Thus nirvana is neither happiness nor unhappiness—it goes beyond all such dualistic concepts. Nirvana is peace. Siddhartha’s aim in teaching the dharma is to completely free people like Jack, who suffers from fear of snakes. This means that Jack must go beyond the relief of realizing that he is in no danger from a snake. He must realize that there was never a snake to begin with, only a Giorgio Armani tie. In other words, Siddhartha’s aim is to relieve Jack’s suffering and then to help him realize that there was no inherently existing cause of suffering in the first place.

- A sculptor may create a beautiful woman out of marble, but he should know better than to have passion toward his creation. Like Pygmalion with his statue of Galatea, we create our friends and our enemies as well, but we forget that it is so. Because of our lack of mindfulness, our creations are transformed into something solid and real, and we become ever more entangled. When you fully realize, not just intellectually, that everything is just your creation, you will be free. Even though happiness is considered a mere concept, Buddhist texts still use terms like great bliss to describe enlightenment. Nirvana can indeed be understood as a joyful state, because having no confusion and no ignorance, no happiness and no unhappiness, is bliss. Seeing the source of confusion and ignorance, the snake for example, as never having existed, is even better. You feel great relief when you awaken from a nightmare, but bliss would be to never have dreamed in the first place. In this sense, bliss is not the same as happiness. Siddhartha emphasized to his followers the futility of seeking peace and happiness, in this world or in the afterlife, if they were serious about freeing themselves from samsara.

- In his first sermon, at Varanasi, Siddhartha taught the following four steps, known popularly as the four noble truths: know the suffering; abandon the causes of suffering; apply the path to the cessation of suffering; know that suffering can end. Some might wonder why Siddhartha needed to point out, “Know the suffering.” Aren’t we intelligent enough to know when we are in pain? Unfortunately only when pain is in its most fully blossomed state do we recognize it as pain and suffering. It is difficult to convince someone who is blissfully licking an ice cream cone that he is suffering. But then he remembers his doctor’s warning to lower his cholesterol and lose weight. And if you explore this seeming pleasure closely from the time he started craving ice cream all the way to his worry ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1369))

- His greatest achievement was understanding the truth, because it is the understanding of the truth that frees us from suffering once and for all. That is the true miracle. Buddha saw the same old age and sickness and death that we see, but he was driven to find the root causes; and that, too, is a miracle. His realization that all compounded things are impermanent was his ultimate triumph. Instead of flaunting victory over some externally existing enemy, he found that the real enemy is our clinging to the self; and defeating that self-clinging is a miracle far greater than all supernatural miracles, real or imagined.

- Many of us are so engrossed with our own concepts of beauty that we don’t perceive that our version of what is attractive may actually repel others. We fall victim to our own concepts and to our vanity. This vanity feeds the cosmetic industry, which is one of the causes and conditions that literally destroys the environment. When we receive a good amount of praise peppered with a little criticism, all of our attention goes to the criticism. Compliments are taken for granted because of our insatiable appetite for praise.

- We truly can’t judge our next-door neighbors solely by the way they look. So obviously we can’t judge something as personal as religion by superficial appearance. We can’t even judge religions by the actions, ethics, morality, or codes of conduct they promote. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1523))

- All methods of Buddhism can be explained with the four seals—all compounded phenomena are impermanent, all emotions are pain, all things have no inherent existence, and enlightenment is beyond concepts. Every act and deed encouraged by Buddhist scriptures is based on these four truths, or seals. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1555))

- As an example of the first seal—impermanence—consider generosity. When we begin to realize the first truth, we see everything as transitory and without value, as if it belonged in a Salvation Army donation bag. We don’t necessarily have to give it all away, but we have no clinging to it. When we see that our possessions are all impermanent compounded phenomena, that we cannot cling to them forever, generosity is already practically accomplished. Understanding the second seal, that all emotions are pain, we see that the miser, the self, is the main culprit, providing nothing but a feeling of poverty. Therefore, by not clinging to the self, we find no reason to cling to our possessions, and there is no more pain of miserliness. Generosity becomes an act of joy. Realizing the third seal, that all things have no inherent existence, we see the futility of clinging because whatever we are clinging to has no truly existing nature. It’s like dreaming that you are distributing a billion dollars to strangers on the street. You can give generously because it’s dream money, and yet you are able to reap all the fun of the experience. Generosity based on these three views inevitably makes us realize that there is no goal. It is not a sacrifice endured in order to get recognition or to ensure a better rebirth. ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1571))

- Generosity without a price tag, expectations, or strings provides a glimpse into the fourth view, the truth that liberation, enlightenment, is beyond conception. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1581))

- The concept of karma, the undeniable trademark of Buddhism, also falls within these four truths. When causes and conditions come together and there are no obstacles, consequences arise. Consequence is karma. This karma is gathered by consciousness—the mind, or the self. If this self acts out of greed or aggression, ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1588))

- negative karma is generated. If a thought or action is motivated by love, tolerance, and a wish for others to be happy, positive karma is generated. Yet motivation, action, and the resulting karma are inherently like a dream, an illusion. Transcending karma, both good and bad, is nirvana. Any so-called good action that is not based on these four views is merely righteousness; it is not ultimately Siddhartha’s path. Even if you were to feed all the hungry beings in the world, if you acted in complete absence of these four views, then it would be merely a good deed, not the path to enlightenment. In fact it might be a righteous act designed to feed and support the ego. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CS5KMG2&location=1590))

- If it is not accompanied by the four views, morality can be similarly distorted. Morality feeds the ego, leading us to become puritanical and to judge others whose morality is different from ours. Fixated on our version of morality, we look down on other people and try to impose our ethics on them, even if it means taking away their freedom.
