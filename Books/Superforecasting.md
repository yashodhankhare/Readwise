## Highlights
- WE ARE ALL forecasters. When we think about changing jobs, getting married, buying a home, making an investment, launching a product, or retiring, we decide based on how we expect the future will unfold. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=41))

- These expectations are forecasts. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=43))

- Because Bill Flack is a remarkable forecaster. We know that because each one of Bill’s predictions has been dated, recorded, and assessed for accuracy by independent scientific observers. His track record is excellent. Bill is not alone. There are thousands of others answering the same questions. All are volunteers. Most aren’t as good ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=69))

- as Bill, but about 2% are. They include engineers and lawyers, artists and scientists, Wall Streeters and Main Streeters, professors and students. We will meet many of them, including a mathematician, a filmmaker, and some retirees eager to share their underused talents. I call them superforecasters because that is what they are. Reliable evidence proves it. Explaining why they’re so good, and how others can learn to do what they do, is my goal in this book.

- Every day, the news media deliver forecasts without reporting, or even asking, how good the forecasters who made the forecasts really are. Every day, corporations and governments pay for forecasts that may be prescient or worthless or something in between. And every day, all of us—leaders of nations, corporate executives, investors, and voters—make critical decisions on the basis of forecasts whose quality is unknown.

- I want to spoil the joke, so I’ll give away the punch line: the average expert was roughly as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee. You’ve probably heard that one before. It’s famous—in some circles, infamous. It has popped up in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the Economist, and other outlets around the world. It goes like this: A researcher gathered a big group ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=89))

Time passed, and when the researcher checked the accuracy of the predictions, he found that the average expert did about as well as random guessing. Except that’s not the punch… ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=93))

- More often forecasts are made and then … nothing. Accuracy is seldom determined after the fact and is almost never done with sufficient regularity and rigor that conclusions can be drawn.
