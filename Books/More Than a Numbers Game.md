## Highlights
- Second, the growth of services aggregating analyst earnings estimates led to a game where analysts and investors evaluated the quality of a firm’s reported results by determining whether the company met or missed consensus earnings figures. Some management teams bowed to increasing pressure and reported a few additional pennies per share each accounting period to demonstrate mastery of business operations. Jimmying the books created bigger problems. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=189))

- In a double-entry world, assets must equal the sum of liabilities and shareholders’ equity. What we have equals what we owe plus what we own. Equity represents owners’ interests in assets after satisfaction of all outside claims. In liquidation, a firm would sell assets, pay liabilities, and distribute any remainder to owners. Figure 1.1 illustrates this accounting identity. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=206))

- Accounting principles turn on three concepts: recognition, valuation, and classification. Recognition determines when a tool or claim should be recorded on the books. Valuation ascribes a dollar measurement to that tool or claim. Classification places the item somewhere in the geography of the balance sheet.

- Since 1894 the U.S. convention has been to classify assets in descending order of liquidity in order to make balance sheets more useful to creditors.5 Assets that could not be easily converted into cash appeared further down the balance sheet’s left-hand side. Suppliers, banks, and bondholders looked for liquid assets as potential collateral to secure loans to corporations.

- Accountants value long-term financial obligations with predictable disbursements, such as bonds and lease contracts, as the sum of discounted future payments. As with assets, accountants classify liabilities in decreasing order of liquidity: Payables due within 30 days appear near the top while long-term bonds appear near the bottom.

- Debt and shareholders’ equity, collectively known as capital, make up a firm’s long-term financing. Bondholders and stock investors trade divisible pieces of these balances in capital markets. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=233))

- Perhaps the most important accounting decision a bookkeeper can make is determining whether resources consumed today will generate revenue in future accounting periods. If the answer is yes, then the charge should be capitalized and classified on the balance sheet as an asset. If not, then the balance should be expensed, flow through the income statement, and accumulate as a reduction in retained earnings. This issue will reappear in subsequent chapters.

- With increasing stock ownership in the 1920s, the income statement displaced the balance sheet as the primary financial statement. Lenders want to know if they will get their money back. Balance sheets show potential collateral and existence of other claims. Shareholders care about a corporation’s ability to pay future dividends through growth and improved margins. Whereas balance sheets supported creditor evaluation of management stewardship, income statements published by corporations in the early twentieth century allowed equity investors to value company shares.

- power and dividend capacity. Balance sheets came to be viewed as holding tanks of unallocated debits and credits yet to flow through future income statements. By the mid-twentieth century, U.S. corporate accounting’s primary purpose was computation of earnings to facilitate stock valuation. Many investors multiplied current earnings by some valuation factor to arrive at an indicated share price. The relationship between accounting earnings and stock prices became the single most important association in U.S. security analysis.

- Absentee ownership became synonymous with corporate America. Perhaps the first modern American corporation was the Boston Manufacturing Company, a textile firm organized in 1813. By 1830 ownership had spread from 11 to 76 shareholders. No shareholder controlled more than 8.5 percent of the company, and directors collectively held just 22 percent ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=286))

- of the voting stock. No single owner could dictate company strategy. By 1930 the largest shareholder of AT&T, United States Steel, and the Pennsylvania Railroad each owned less than 1 percent of these firms’ outstanding stock.7 Dispersed ownership means no individual shareholder can influence management actions, especially when management controls the proxy process for soliciting shareholder votes. Management abuses can easily arise from institutional separation of management from ownership: A notable example was RJR Nabisco’s extravagant 1980s spending on a corporate aircraft fleet. Investors and creditors fashioned contracts from financial accounting balances in attempts to align employee interests. Compensation schemes based on accounting results and bond covenants tied to earnings or debt levels were common examples. Regulators sometimes threatened intervention when reported capital levels dropped below agreed-upon solvency trigger points. Labor unions used reported earnings as a basis for contract negotiations. By the end of the twentieth century, reported earnings and debt levels became very significant issues to preparers of financial statements.

- By 1850 a few railroad securities traded on the NYSE; by 1869, the number had grown to 38.4 Railroads asked investment bankers to market bonds, preferred stock, and common stock to willing investors. Securities partition claims on corporate cash flows into divisible units that can be traded in secondary markets. Corporate capital structure, the combination of securities used to finance a business, establishes conditions and sequences for outsiders to receive cash distributions. Bondholder claims precede those of preferred stockholders, and both precede those of common stockholders. Holders of common equity receive residual claims on corporate profits in exchange for voting rights to elect directors and approve changes to corporate charters. Corporate governance covers details of apportioning cash flows and voting rights among these claimants. Nineteenth-century American industrial firms disclosed little to outsiders. Owner-managers saw little upside to sharing financial information, and they worried that disclosure could help competitors. In 1866 the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Rail Road Company treasurer replied to an NYSE information request by stating his managers make “no reports and publish no statements and have done nothing of the sort for the last five years.” The New York Central ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=328))

- and Hudson River Railroad did not issue an annual report to shareholders during the 1870s and 1880s.5 Railroads initially raised money without financial disclosure. Investors bought securities based on confidence in the investment banker. Bankers were supposed to undertake their own investigations before offering securities to the public. A prospectus describing the security could be as short as two pages.6 An early specialty of JP Morgan bankers was marketing American railroad bonds to European investors.7 Distant investors sought additional information to assess railroad performance. In the absence of accounting information, some investors looked at dividend payment rates. Cash can be a simple, visible, and credible indicator of operating health. However, dividends represent an imperfect signal because firms could dip into contributed capital when current earnings were insufficient to cover distributions. Management duplicity could cause investors to confuse return of capital for return on capital. Concealment of losses represents the essence of accounting scandal. These actions caused investors to pay high stock prices for ventures that could not continue large dividend payments.8 Early corporation laws developed to forbid dividend payments from contributed capital, requiring distributions to come from retained earnings.

- Depreciation, the consumption of long-term assets used in production, represents a financial reporting problem because it is never clear when the wear and tear takes place. Journalist Roger Lowenstein uses a newspaper delivery route example to illustrate this concept. To figure weekly earnings, the car’s gasoline expenses should probably be deducted, but transmission repair costs should be spread over a longer horizon.14 How should management match revenues with expenses when a major resource consumed was ephemeral wear and tear on equipment? The railroad accounting convention had been to write off the original cost of an asset when it was removed from service instead of reporting gradual depreciation.

- illustrates a critical lesson. Net income over a sufficiently long time period equals cash inflows minus cash outflows, other than transactions with owners.15 Regardless of depreciation assumptions made, the locomotive generates $35,000 of income over its five-year life. With one notable exception discussed in the next chapter, accounting principles do not affect a corporation’s cash flows. Depreciation merely reflects the arbitrary cost allocations into accounting periods. Depreciation assumptions, and most other accounting disputes, matter little in the long-term course of business.

- The 1862 Union government established the Bureau of Internal Revenue to assess personal and corporate income taxes to help finance the Civil War. The federal government allowed the measure to expire in 1872. By the mid-1890s, corporations had replaced partnerships as the country’s primary form of business association. Railroads’ success created some extremely rich shareholders. An 1890 survey showed three of the four wealthiest families in the United States—the Vanderbilts, Goulds, and Stanfords—had roots in the railroad business.1 ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=442))

- The Revenue Act of 1894 provided for a flat 2 percent tax on corporate profits, defined as revenues (receipts, gains, and income) less operating expenses. Three tenets of U.S. tax policy have been ability to pay, equality of sacrifice, and imposition of burdens commensurate with government benefits received.2 Corporations had cash, had not paid taxes, and enjoyed protections offered by the federal government. If one considered a corporation a taxable entity, then the government could justifiably raise revenue through income taxation. Chief Justice John Marshall, writing in the Dartmouth case, defined a corporation ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=452))

- The return allowed a deduction for interest expense from debt financing but made no such provision for dividend payments to equity investors. This precedent would have profound implications for corporate financial management in the next century. Also of note is Line 14, which provided for a dividend deduction from intercorporate equity investments. The deduction was an early attempt to prevent taxing the same income more than once: the investee corporation presumably had already paid taxes on the income that gave rise to the dividend payment.

- Financial accounting is about matching efforts and results. U.S. tax accounting turns on the realization principle: income should not be taxed until cash is available to pay liabilities. Tax authorities permit deferral of unrealized gains until cash is received to prevent involuntary asset liquidations or borrowings to pay taxes.7 While there are some permanent differences between tax and GAAP income (e.g., municipal bonds’ interest income and the dividends-received deduction mentioned earlier), the two accounting methods report comparable results over sufficiently long time periods. In the interim, varied definitions of income gave rise to timing differences between GAAP and tax statements as of balance sheet dates. Financial accountants developed the concept of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reconcile four broad categories of timing differences. Table 3.1 shows how tax revenues can be recorded before or after GAAP recognizes revenue and how tax deductions can be taken before or after GAAP recognizes expenses.

- recognize GAAP revenue. However, cash receipt triggers the obligation to pay income taxes immediately. By the end of the subscription year, income under tax and GAAP accounting evens out. Transactions involving cash receipt before GAAP revenue recognition or expenses recognized before cash disbursement create deferred tax assets. These balances appear on the left-hand side of a balance sheet and can be considered nascent receivables from the U.S. government. Transactions involving revenue recognized before cash receipt or cash payment before use of goods and services give rise to deferred tax liabilities, a sum appearing on the balance sheet’s right-hand side that can be considered a precursor for future tax payments to the IRS.

- This sequence of events shows how a layperson could become frustrated with the financial accounting standards-setting process. Authorities issued four standards using the same title. In the case of recognizing a tax loss carryforward, Bulletin 24 instructed statement preparers to recognize a deferred tax asset if they wished, Opinion 11 said to do it if realization was certain beyond a reasonable doubt, Statement 96 said never to do it, and Statement 109 said always to do it. Vacillation signaled lack of conviction of what financial accounting standards setters were trying to accomplish, an illustration of the point in Chapter 1 that there has been little consequence of reporting the same transaction in varied ways.

- There are many ways to match cost of inventory sold with sales revenue. A noteworthy comparison involves first-in, first-out (FIFO) and last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumptions. The FIFO method means that the oldest units placed in inventory are the first to be selected for sales or further processing. The LIFO method means the most recently added stocks are the first to be removed from inventory. An old accounting joke characterizes LIFO inventory as first in, still here. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=562))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In periods of rising prices, LIFO statements release more inventory dollars from the balance sheet to the income statement. Assuming inventory levels stay the same or grow, LIFO results in lower reported earnings, later tax payments, and closer matching of revenues with inventory replacement costs. Unfortunately, LIFO use over prolonged periods of inflation causes less realistic valuation of inventory remaining on the balance sheet. Early LIFO adopters still have inventory valued at costs prevailing during World War II. Depletion of inventory at old costs, known as a LIFO layer liquidation, can cause spikes of artificially high earnings. If management’s goal is to report increasing earnings during periods of rising prices, then it should use FIFO. If management seeks to defer taxes and conserve cash, then it should use LIFO. Ideally, management would prepare external financial reports under FIFO and tax returns under LIFO. The firm would show increasing earnings yet minimize taxes through matching of revenue with the most expensive inventory acquired. The real world is not so simple.

- should be included in inventory. Blough reappears in subsequent chapters. Blough opposed LIFO because the cost flow assumption did not reflect actual inventory movement. Kracke favored acceptance and countered that since LIFO generally reduced reported profits, companies would be reluctant to adopt it for financial reporting purposes. Blough compromised and recommended that companies should be allowed to use LIFO if they used it for both tax and financial reporting.9 In the subsequent year Congress made LIFO available to all taxpayers and passed an act to consolidate and codify internal revenue laws. The Internal Revenue Code of 1939 summarized federal tax law in a (comparatively) orderly fashion. Subsequent regulations issued by the executive branch’s Treasury Department and case law recorded by the judicial branch served to interpret Code provisions. Congress rewrote the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, introducing accelerated depreciation and creating sizable differences between GAAP and tax income, and again in 1986, when the Congress killed the investment tax credit. Section 22(d) (2) of the 1939 Code captured Blough’s compromise and allowed taxpayers to calculate taxable income ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=612))

- using LIFO if the taxpayer has not used any other inventory valuation procedure “for credit purposes or for the purpose of reports to shareholders.” In IRS vernacular, credit purposes meant financial reporting to bondholders and reports to shareholders meant financial reporting to equity investors.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, LIFO had a prominent critic. University of Michigan’s William Paton charged in 1938 that LIFO represents a “device for equalizing earnings, to avoid showing in the periodic reports the severe fluctuations which are inherent in certain business fields.... Certainly, it is not good accounting to issue reports for a copper company, for example, that make it appear that the concern has the comparative stability of earning power of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.”11 Earnings volatility would become the signature issue for the accounting scandals of 2002. With a clear tax law and improved accounting techniques, profitable U.S. corporations facing price inflation could defer income tax payments if they were willing to report comparatively lower accounting earnings. What happened? Adoption of LIFO came slowly. Consistent with a fashion model’s mantra that it’s better to look good than feel good, corporations seemed reticent to sacrifice GAAP earnings numbers in order to save tax dollars.

- Observers wondered whether stock investors saw through the accounting and understood that LIFO adopters are generally better off despite reporting lower earnings. The first Arab oil embargo together with relaxation of 1971 wage and price controls sparked a dramatic acceleration in inflation in 1974. The economics favoring LIFO adoption became overwhelming, and a host of firms embraced the switch. Sun Oil and Texaco adopted LIFO, Kodak and DuPont expanded LIFO use, and General Electric chairman Reg Jones explained its significance in an address to New York security analysts. In 1975 Shyam Sunder, a Carnegie-Mellon PhD who had joined the University of Chicago, published a study of stock price changes associated with firms that adopted LIFO during the period 1946 to 1966.12 Using sophisticated statistical techniques, he found evidence of abnormal stock price increases during the 12-month period preceding LIFO adoption. An interpretation of these data is that investors rewarded firms expecting to pay lower taxes from anticipated conversion to LIFO. Statistics show correlation but cannot prove causal relationships. Sunder’s study was consistent with the argument that investors see through accounting convention when assessing a firm’s cash-generating ability. The study suggested sensible managers concerned about their employer’s stock price should forsake accounting earnings to boost cash flow through deferral of income tax payments. Subsequent studies provided supporting and confounding evidence of Sunder’s conclusions: divining meaning from security price movements is a tricky business.

- The metal, petroleum, and motor vehicle industries accounted for the highest use of LIFO inventory valuation.

- By the 1980s LIFO accounting lost significance as price inflation decelerated. Subsidiaries of Insilco (formerly the International Silver Company) used LIFO to prepare tax returns while the parent issued consolidated financial statements using FIFO flow assumptions. The IRS challenged Insilco and argued breach of the conformity rule. Both a 1979 tax court and a 1981 federal court held for Insilco’s position.

- Inventory valuation highlights another GAAP-tax accounting difference. After historical cost, financial accounting’s most important precept for asset valuation is conservatism. In the presence of uncertainty, it is better to err on the side of reporting low asset values and income numbers. All accounting estimates are wrong. Overstatement of profits and asset values can give rise to actions resulting in bankruptcy. Understatement represents the lesser evil because subsequent adjustments merely provide a fortuitous valuation gain.15 In the context of inventory, conservatism emerged as the lower of cost or market rule. If management has evidence that inventory has sustained damage, obsolescence, or other impairment, then the inventory value under GAAP should be written down with the corresponding loss charged to the income statement. In 1964, Thor Power Tool Company wrote down excess inventory to estimated net realizable value and continued to hold ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=676))

- the goods available for sale. In conformance with GAAP, Thor charged the impairment against earnings. Thor then tried to carry the resulting tax loss back to offset 1963’s taxable income.

- Cost accounting is the one dialect where practitioners listened to outside experts such as economists and engineers. The field’s early intellectual home was the University of Chicago. John Maurice Clark taught an economics course on the nature of overhead costs and published course materials in a 1923 book.13 The son of John Bates Clark, after whom the most prestigious American economics award is named, attained notoriety for development of the multiplier concept taught in introductory macroeconomics courses. Clark studied the behavior of costs that could not be traced directly to products. In particular, railroads’ so-called fixed costs and ability to add freight inexpensively piqued his interest. His economics training led him to attack cost accounting problems with marginal analysis, the differential cost incurred if a course of action is taken or rejected. Clark reached three important conclusions. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=800))

- First, cost accounting differs from financial accounting. While the disciplines share some primary records, they serve distinct purposes. Financial accounting concerns itself with revenue and expense to calculate an absolute level of income available to pay dividends after an accounting period. Double-entry bookkeeping further serves as a modest control to protect assets. Cost accounting, Clark argued, furnishes management with information needed to establish efficiency standards and pricing policies. Second, he emphasized that cost numbers are not absolute. For some decisions they matter a great deal, while in other situations the same costs may be irrelevant. Cost behavior also depends on time frame. Daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual horizons lead to different conclusions about resource consumption. Clark spent considerable effort reviewing railroad cost behavior. Using data filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, he decomposed costs into fixed and variable components. He found that over sufficiently long horizons infrastructure investment represents a variable cost that grows just as fast as revenue. Finally, Clark emphasized that managers need to think critically about capacity costs. Few services are used evenly over the course of a day, week, month, or year. It does not make sense to charge consumers the ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=808))

- same price for electricity used during peak business as at night or for phone service during weekdays and weekends. He asked who should pay for capacity costs when equipment stands ready to serve yet actual output may be next to nothing.

- Also during this time economists R. S. Edwards and Ronald Coase at the London School of Economics developed the concept of opportunity cost in business analysis.15 Opportunity costs represent benefits forgone from failing to dedicate a scarce resource to its best use. If a firm uses a valuable plot of owned land as a parking lot, the income statement would not show any rental cost. However, a good cost accountant ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=836))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- would note that employee parking was not free. Allocating the land to parking could cause the company to forgo sale to a developer willing to pay top dollar. The difference between what the company earned letting employees park cars and what the company would have earned selling the parcel represents the land’s opportunity cost. Forward-looking analysis requires opportunity costs to be estimated and considered even though they fail to meet financial accounting’s recognition criteria. A common use of opportunity cost is including a firm’s cost of equity capital when evaluating investment decisions. Equity does not generate an accounting charge under GAAP, but this valuable resource has other possible uses. Past, specialized investments that cannot be used for alternate purposes are considered sunk costs, where the opportunity cost is zero. Rent payments, depreciation, and other accounting charges associated with these specific assets should be included in financial statements. However, cost accountants properly exclude sunk costs from forward-looking analyses because no management action affects their value. The same resource can represent either an opportunity cost or a sunk cost, depending on circumstances. An oft-cited example is determining the cost of meat in Wendy’s chili. The fast-food chain grills patties in anticipation of hamburger orders. If orders do not materialize, the meat becomes too dry to serve in sandwiches. With no alternate use, the beef can be crumbled and used to make chili. Overly cooked hamburger represents a sunk cost and adds little to the cost of preparing chili. However, if hamburger sales exceed expectations, then use of grilled beef in chili has an opportunity cost because the meat could have been ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=840))

In 1950, University of Chicago accounting professor William Vatter produced Managerial Accounting, another collection of lecture notes using the same title as had McKinsey.16 Vatter focused on internal control, budgeting, product costing, and cost interpretation. The Inuit language apparently provides Eskimos with dozens of words for snow. Vatter showed how cost accountants use many descriptors for resource consumption. Costs can be fixed, variable, normalized, actual, imputed, sunk, direct, indirect, controllable, uncontrollable, and so on. Granularity brings precision.

- Experts’ next intellectual contribution to cost accounting was use of present value analysis. Investments involve time delays between outlays and returns. Actuarial literature had discussed the time value of money since the early 1800s, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that engineering consultants applied this tool to compare certain cash disbursements with risky future receipts. The petroleum industry, with enormous exploration and production investments, was an early adopter of this tool.

- Among CPAs, Arthur Andersen & Co.’s Leonard Spacek emerged as CAP’s most vocal critic. Andersen had earned fame as the auditor brought in to disentangle intercompany transactions of Samuel Insull’s Chicago utility holding company empire. Andersen developed a substantial regulated utility practice and favored uniform accounting principles to facilitate comparisons for rate making. Managing partner Spacek had gained notoriety as the only Andersen employee willing to stand up to founder Arthur E. Andersen. When challenged, Spacek showed his lack of fear by telling his boss he was from Iowa and could always return home to plow corn.8 This moxie allowed Spacek to emerge as Mr. Andersen’s successor and serve as the firm’s leader from 1947 to 1970. The scrappy Midwesterner served as a foil to the genteel George May. Spacek’s experience with regulated utility accounting gave him strong conviction that fairness in financial accounting practices meant uniformity across firms. Using journalism as a metaphor, he commented that if someone read an article in one newspaper, the reader ought to be able to get somewhere near the same story from another newspaper.9 For the name Arthur Andersen & Co. to mean something, Spacek believed the firm must follow the same accounting principles in all client engagements. Accounting treatment should not depend on beliefs of the individual partner signing an opinion.10 All auditors should reach the same conclusion given the same set of facts.11 ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1242))

- Evidence that Spacek meant what he said was Andersen & Co.’s handling of the recently obtained DuPont audit. DuPont owned 23 percent of General Motors’ stock and recognized income from GM’s operations instead of waiting until GM declared dividends. While Spacek agreed with this treatment (eventually sanctioned by APB Opinion 18 in 1971 and later described as look-through earnings by Warren Buffett), the equity method was not part of GAAP at this time. At Spacek’s urging, Arthur E. Andersen qualified the firm’s opinion and promptly lost his prestigious audit client.12 Comparable stubbornness caused the firm to lose railroad and savings and loan clients.13 Spacek had no love for New York colleagues running larger public accounting firms. He felt snubbed that his competitors considered Arthur Andersen & Co. a regional firm specializing in utility accounts. He also had little respect for the flexibility shown by the CAP. He once labeled CAP pronouncements as “generally accepted and antiquated accounting principles.”14 In the 1950s, Spacek gave a series of… ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1256))

- Most significantly, the APB ran into a buzz saw with issuance of its first significant Opinion. During the Kennedy administration, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1962. A provision introduced the investment tax credit (ITC) to spur capital expenditures and economic growth. Firms buying qualifying property, plant, and equipment would receive an immediate tax credit based on the property’s purchase price in the year of investment. Tax credits, dollar-for-dollar ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1286))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- reductions in tax liabilities, represent more powerful incentives than simple deductions reducing taxable income. The innovative ITC represented uncharted waters. Two rival accounting policies emerged, the deferral and flow-through methods. The deferral method viewed the ITC as a reduction in the cost of the asset and amortized the credit over the asset’s useful life. The flow-through method considered the ITC a reduction in income tax expense in the year the investment was made and recognized the entire benefit in the year of property acquisition. Selection of accounting method does not affect cash flow. Profitable firms using the flow-through method simply report higher income in the year of purchase. Table 6.1 serves as an illustration, where a firm buys $50,000 of qualifying equipment with a five-year useful life to earn a 7 percent credit. Notice how choice of accounting method has no effect on cumulative net income, tax payments, or cash flows. Use of the flow-through method simply boosts reported net income in the year the firm acquired the qualifying property. APB Opinion 2, issued in December 1962, required use of the deferral method and prohibited flow-through accounting. The APB reasoned that earnings ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1289))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- arise from use of acquired assets instead of mere acquisition. Subsequent sale of qualifying assets would give rise to tax recapture, and realization depended on the business keeping assets in service. Therefore the deferral method better matched revenues and expenses. Observers criticized the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for acting slowly and not pressing hard enough for uniform accounting principles. The APB passed these tests with flying colors. In terms of politics, the APB was tone-deaf. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1301))

- In 1960, 26-year-old UCLA economics PhD candidate William Sharpe needed a dissertation topic. While also working at the nearby RAND Corporation, Sharpe met economist Harry Markowitz.1 Markowitz’s famous 1952 paper “Portfolio Selection” studied risk and return for collections of financial assets. He showed that diversification reduces risk. However, Markowitz struggled to pinpoint how correlation among returns of individual holdings influences aggregate portfolio risk. Discussions between the two suggested a dissertation topic on security prices and required returns of financial assets held in a portfolio. Required return, also known as cost of equity, represents expected earnings needed to attract equity capital for a particular investment.2 This forward-looking measure depends on investor sentiment and cannot be observed directly. Sharpe attacked the problem and presented findings at the University of Chicago in 1962. Reactions were so favorable he received a job offer, which he declined. Sharpe then submitted a summary paper to the prestigious Journal of Finance. The editor rejected the article. Sharpe asked a referee to reevaluate the submission, and the journal subsequently published “Capital Asset ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1836))

Sharpe argued that investment risk of a given stock is not about raw volatility. Investors face risks that can and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Buyers of financial instruments demand to be compensated for systematic risk resulting from swings in economic activity. They are less concerned with idiosyncratic risks specific to individual companies. Holding securities in a diversified portfolio mitigates the second exposure.

- Financial accounting’s purpose is to help outsiders project the amount, timing, and certainty of a firm’s future cash flows. Problems with reporting volatility have caused tension between standard setters and statement preparers since the 1930s. Managers believe investors consider bumpy earnings a blemish when evaluating a firm’s earning power: reporting smooth, predictable earnings will boost a company’s stock price. By contrast, standard setters want companies to tell it like it is, alerting outsiders to the presence of warts on a corporate earnings trajectory. Three case studies illustrate this tension. The first concerns foreign currency translation. Countries designate currencies as the local medium of exchange. The U.S. dollar’s market price relative to another currency depends on supply and demand factors arising from political and economic events.

- Combined translation differences from use of varied rates required an unfavorable $17,700 adjustment to keep statements balanced. The adjustment had no effect on cash flows.

- In October 1975 the FASB pressed further and issued Statement 8, requiring the translation adjustment to be classified as an exchange gain or loss and included in income statements. Financial statement preparers revolted. Malcolm Forbes wrote an editorial decrying the standard.4 Currency market machinations could determine a company’s income for the year and impair management’s goal of reporting a smooth earnings trajectory. In our example, the Statement 8 translation adjustment would erase 40 percent of the subsidiary’s translated pretax earnings even though cash flows remained unaffected. Academics found that the only meaningful consequence of Statement 8 was that multinational firms embraced currency contracts designed to minimize fluctuation in noncash accounting adjustments. To avoid earnings volatility, corporations risked cash resources in forward exchange contracts to hedge noncash exposures5 and smooth earnings trends. In May 1978 the FASB requested constituent comments concerning its first 12 Statements. Eighty-five percent of comments received requested reconsideration of Statement 8.6 ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1918))

- In December 1981 the FASB issued Statement 52, requiring self-contained subsidiaries to translate balance sheet figures at current rates (reducing the magnitude of balance-sheet-related currency adjustments) and to record the translation adjustment as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. The FASB here showed early focus on the balance sheet and classifying open transactions as comprehensive income. With issuance of Statement 52, reported earnings no longer bore consequences of volatile currency markets. Mollified management teams preparing statements were less concerned with fluctuations in shareholders’ equity balances. Statement 52 moved currency translation off everyone’s radar screen.

- A second case study on earnings volatility comes from the influence of interest rates and stock returns on annual pension obligations. Defined benefit pensions sprouted after World War II to guarantee payments to retired workers based on annual wages and years of service at the company. Determining the annual cost of this promise requires rate projections for employee tenure, wages, life expectancy, and investment returns. Defined benefit pension accounting makes depreciation look like child’s play. What makes the liability so difficult to value is its long time horizon and resulting sensitivity to modest adjustments in discount rates and projected investment returns. Innocent changes in economic projections could erase or double a firm’s annual pension expense. At a high level, pension expense flowing through an income statement has three components: Pension expense = Service cost + Interest cost - Portfolio returns ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1936))

Some commentators feel Opinion 8 represented a successful standard because the APB used a formal research study in the deliberation process and reduced diversity of accounting practice.7 Opinion 8 marked a turning point in standard setting. Since 1939 U.S. standard setters had offered broad guidance. Now the APB offered a detailed prescription for calculating pension expense. Consider paragraph 17b discussing the maximum permissible expense figure: The annual provision for pension cost should not be greater than the total of (1) normal cost, (2) 10 per cent of the past service cost (until fully amortized), (3) 10 per cent of the amounts of any increases or decreases in prior service cost arising on amendments of the plan (until fully amortized) and (4) interest equivalents under paragraph 42 or 43 on the difference between provisions and amounts funded. The passage reads more like tax return instructions than guidance for keeping a set of books. Price Waterhouse’s Carl Tietjen described Opinion 8 as the beginning of financial accounting’s cookbook era.8 ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1961))

- Two constituents benefited from the replacement of a principle with a rule: the SEC received protection from charges of political favoritism, and auditors could reduce malpractice litigation by demonstrating company compliance with quantitative standards.9 The loser was the role of judgment in the financial accounting profession. The FASB tried to further narrow diversity of practice with a 1982 proposal that would have forced pension sponsors to recognize more debt on balance sheets. Economic studies had shown that investors already viewed unfunded obligations as liabilities, which raised borrowing costs and lowered issuer bond ratings. Forcing companies to recognize a greater pension liability, perhaps amounting to 9 percent of assets on the balance sheet, may not have provided additional, relevant information but would have caused borrowers to violate debt covenants.10 ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=1973))

- Observable market prices seem to satisfy standard setters’ tests of relevance and reliability. New York University’s George Sorter quipped that if accounting statements can influence security prices, then why can’t security prices affect accounting balances? Use of historical cost invites trouble. Firms often hold securities purchased over time at wide-ranging costs. An opportunistic manager could sell appreciated securities in periods when the firm wanted to report more income. Such cherry-picking gives the appearance of steady earnings growth and saddles the firm with the remaining poorly performing securities. Suppose a firm invested $1,000 in a liquid common stock and the position appreciated to $1,400 by the balance sheet date. How should the firm account for the investment when closing the books? Table 9.2 suggests three possibilities. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=2000))

- Method 1 presents the simplest solution: ignore changes in market values until the security is sold. After completing a sales transaction, the company records a gain or loss on the income statement for the difference between the market price and the carrying cost. In this example, no sale has taken place and no revaluation is recognized in the financial statements. Method 2 adjusts the investment to the $1,400 market value, even though the security remains unsold. The mark-to-market adjustment creates an unrealized holding gain, raising pretax income by $400. The tax payment on the gain will not be due until the firm sells the security and collects cash, the realization principle discussed in Chapter 3. Consequently, the firm posts the future obligation as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. Method 3 also marks the security to market, but the gain bypasses the income statement and is posted net of the deferred tax liability to accumulated other comprehensive income, the same holding tank used to record a running total of open-ended foreign currency translation and pension accounting adjustments. Balance sheet totals are identical under Methods 2 and 3. Both methods mark the security to market, increase shareholders’ equity by $260, and create a $140 deferred tax liability ($400 gain × 35 percent tax rate). Method 2 shows higher net income and retained earnings, while Method 3 quarantines the unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income until management sells the security. Eventually, all three methods show the same cumulative results. The first accounting standard to address so-called fair value accounting was Bulletin 30, issued by CAP in August 1947.

- Statement 115 required use of three classifications of marketable securities. For debt securities that the company has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity, the company should carry them at amortized cost (Method 1). Absent default, holding gains and losses reverse by the time bonds mature. Debt and equity securities bought and held for the purpose of selling them in the near future should be marked to market with the unrealized gains or losses posted to the income statement (Method 2). Debt and equity securities not classified as either trading or held to maturity should be classified as available for sale. Under this approach, securities are also marked to market with the offsetting unrealized gains and losses posted to accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheet’s shareholders’ equity section (Method 3). Companies have little latitude to change classification for designated securities. As a colleague noted, the FASB directed management to pick a lane and stay in it. Under Statement 115, held to maturity is a restrictive standard and leaves management little opportunity to sell a bond. Further, no company wants to subject reported income to the volatility of security ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=2054))

On the other side, nonprime borrowers could bypass banks and insurance companies and sell debt directly to bondholders at lower cost.

Milken’s career soared. Milken showed an uncanny ability to design capital structures to support diverse businesses with heavy debt loads. Securities partition cash distributions and voting rights among capital providers. Capital structure establishes the sequence and conditions required for each set of investors and creditors to receive such rights. Using building blocks of debt, equity, and options, Milken crafted sophisticated hybrid securities that satisfied needs of varied stakeholders. He also received warrants from many debt issuers; these long-term options allowed Milken to capture some of the upside potential as heavy borrowers paid off massive debt loads. He also benefited from circumstance. The 1981 tax law allowed companies to depreciate fixed assets even faster than permitted by the 1954 tax code revision.

- steady or drops, then the option remains unexercised. If the price rises, the owner may choose to exercise the option and realize a profit. Option holders have the right to buy or sell something in the future at a fixed price. If market value exceeds the contract’s strike price, then a call option holder can realize a profit by either exercising the option or selling the unused contract to someone else. If the contract price exceeds the market price at the end of the contract term, nothing happens and the option expires worthless. Companies sometimes use options as risk management tools. A growing firm unsure of future space needs could buy a call option for an attractive parcel of land. In exchange for a modest option premium, the firm ensures that the landowner will not sell the parcel to anyone else for a specified period of time. If growth materializes and the company needs more land, the firm exercises the option and buys the land at the previously agreed-upon strike price. If growth decelerates and there is no need for more space, the company lets the option expire. Corporate boards often grant options to executives in an effort to align management interests with those of owners. A rising stock price increases stock option values and rewards both managers and owners. In the 1980s boards used debt as a stick to align management interests with those of owners. In the 1990s, when debt fell into disfavor, directors used options as a carrot to motivate desired behavior. Going back to the gold mine example, suppose the company’s stock trades at $20 per share and an option holder can buy a share of stock for $20 up to one year from the date of the option grant. Figure 12.1 summarizes these facts. When the market price equals the strike price, exercising the option yields a payoff of zero to the option holder. However, the holder could probably sell the contract for about $4. The difference between the exercise… ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=2493))

- Finally, in October 1995, after roundtable discussions and further meetings, the FASB issued Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Paragraph 60 acknowledged that the debate on stock option accounting “became so divisive that it threatened the Board’s future working relationship with some of its constituents.” The Statement offered a compromise. Statement 123 stated unequivocally that options have value that can be estimated by formal option pricing models. However, the Statement allowed companies a choice of between (1) expensing estimated option values over employee service periods and (2) accounting for options in the manner offered by Opinion 25 with disclosure of pro forma earnings had the options been valued and expensed under the preferred fair value method. The FASB allowed the disclosure alternative to bring closure to the debate, not because it believed that solution was the best way to improve financial reporting. Arthur Levitt later admitted that urging the FASB to back off from its proposal to expense options was “the biggest mistake I made” as SEC chairman.12 As of 2001, 99 percent of the Fortune 500 used employee stock options.13 Only Boeing and grocer Winn-Dixie expensed stock option compensation on the income statement.

Since options represent leveraged investments, small changes in stock prices can cause disproportionate changes in option values. Managers with sizable option grants could become extremely sensitive to stock price changes. Two researchers found that managers paid comparatively high levels of stock compensation were more likely to report earnings that met or just beat analysts’ forecasts compared to managers paid with low equity incentives.16 Academics found overwhelming evidence that companies manage earnings to avoid decreases or losses. Firms reporting a pattern of consistently higher earnings enjoyed higher stock market valuations. Further, the premium grew as the series continued for longer periods of time.17 Firms that habitually met or beat earnings estimates enjoyed higher stock market returns than firms that failed to meet expectations. This valuation premium carried over to firms that openly engaged in earnings and expectations management.18 ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=2813))

- A parallel story to this EPS drama was rise of pro forma earnings. “For the sake of form” in Latin, this term applies to disclosures designed to present data for hypothetical situations such as proposed mergers or implications of alternate accounting treatment. Technology firms in the 1990s issued press releases featuring pro forma earnings figures in addition to earnings prepared under GAAP. The most common adjustments excluded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, and costs associated with acquisitions. Pro forma earnings during this period were invariably higher than those reported under GAAP.24 Telecom companies’ enormous infrastructure investments saddled earnings with large depreciation charges. One way to burnish reported performance was to focus investor attention on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Warren Buffett poked fun at this practice by asking if the tooth fairy bore responsibility for making capital expenditures. Advocates argued that pro forma figures presented more meaningful accounting information; critics charged that this tool obscured economic performance. Earnings press releases, with pro forma figures, issued before formal SEC filings did not fall under GAAP’s jurisdiction.

Qwest issued its earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2000 on January 24, 2001, the date Arthur Andersen gave a clean audit opinion. The body of the release did not cite a GAAP net income figure. Instead, the release provided figures on “a pro forma normalized basis and excluding non-recurring items.” Full-year 2000 pro forma EPS of $0.59 grew 51 percent from the $0.39 reported for 1999. One could infer Qwest had had a great year. Then, on March 16, 2001, Qwest filed its annual Form 10-K with the SEC. The GAAP income statement showed diluted earnings per share dropped from $1.52 in 1999 to -$0.06 in 2000. Qwest’s GAAP earnings didn’t grow by half; they evaporated. Outrage over such practices prompted the SEC to issue Regulation G in March 2003 to require registrants to reconcile pro forma earnings figures to balances calculated under GAAP. However, it’s not clear that use of EBITDA and pro forma figures hurt the investing public. Two researchers compared stock prices and earnings data for companies that did and did not report pro forma numbers. They found little difference in stock price behavior. In other words, investors did not appear to price shares of firms issuing pro forma earnings ([Location 2878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NC2UB4&location=2878))
