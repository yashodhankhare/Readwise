## Highlights
- As I had learned over my years as a business person, strategy is an unusual beast. Most of my time and that of everyone else at Netflix must be spent achieving superb execution. Fail at this, and you will surely stumble. Sadly, though, such execution alone will not ensure success. If you don’t get your strategy right, you are at risk. I have been around long enough that I remember the lesson of the IBM PC. Here was a breakthrough product—the customer take-up was amazing: 40,000 upon announcement of the product and more than 100,000 in its first year. No one had ever seen anything like it. IBM’s execution was flawless. Their superb management never missed a beat. It would be hard to imagine another company at that time scaling physical production as rapidly as they did without tripping up. Even their marketing was inspired. Remember Charlie Chaplin as the friendly face of their campaign, welcoming all of us to the new world of computing? But they got the strategy wrong. By outsourcing the OS and permitting Microsoft to sell it to others, IBM squandered their opportunity for the kind of network economy home run that had powered their mainframe ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=83))

- juggernaut, System 360. Then their decision to outsource the microprocessor to Intel, while still promoting applications hard-wired to it, likewise ceded yet another important front. As a consequence, they sealed the fate of the PC, rendering it an unattractive box-assembly business. Try as they might, they could never right this ship. The inevitable denouement came with their 2005 fire sale of the business to Lenovo. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=91))

- Wisdom, root causes, thinking strategically, smart prioritization—it made sense to me that all of this mapped to strategy. But to remain true to our culture, senior management could not simply impose its own view of strategy. Instead we had to develop in our people an understanding of the levers of strategy so that, on their own, they could flexibly apply this to their work.

- This perspective, however, created a dilemma for me. Strategy is a complex subject—how could this “context” be learned by our people expeditiously? Having held a lifelong interest in education, I have always been much taken with an anecdote concerning the Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as recounted by James Gleick in his book Genius. Professor Feynman, one of the truly great science teachers of his time, was asked to do a lecture on a difficult area of Quantum Mechanics. Feynman agreed but then several days later recanted, saying “You… ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=105))

- “really understand it” enough to teach it? Fortunately, I recalled the succinctness with which Hamilton summarized strategy in his 2004 presentation. I initiated a dialog with Hamilton and grew more and more convinced of his unique qualifications. In the end, Hamilton developed a program which conveyed to a large number of Netflix’s key people a fundamental understanding of strategy. This effort was a huge success. Still today, many Netflixers look back on it as one of the best educational experiences of their professional lives. Hamilton is so much more than an able synthesizer and communicator, as 7 Powers demonstrates. Any strategy framework, to be broadly useful to a business person, must address all the key strategy issues facing an organization. Hamilton has long been aware of the deficiencies in existing frameworks. His solution? To forge ahead with entirely novel conceptual advances, and then to bind these together into a unified whole. Let me give you two examples of such advances from 7 Powers… ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=110))

- superficial thinker might pin this on lack of vision and leadership. Not Hamilton. By inventing the concept of Counter-Positioning, he was able to peel back the layers to peer into the deeper reality of these situations. Rather than lacking vision, Hamilton established, these incumbents are in fact acting in an entirely predictable and economically rational way. Our earlier battle with Blockbuster bore out this notion. Power Progression. At Netflix, we aggressively prioritize our attention in order to focus on what is essential to accomplish now. This applies to strategy as well: what are the near-in strategic imperatives? Unfortunately, existing strategy frameworks offered little guidance. There was recognition that this was an important issue, but none of those other frameworks could address it in a systematic, reliable, sufficiently transparent way. How did Hamilton respond to this void? Over… ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=120))

Now it’s you who’s in for a treat. 7 Powers tightly integrates the numerous insights he has developed in his several decades of consulting, active equity investing and teaching. It is a uniquely clear and comprehensive distillation of strategy. It will change how you think about business and pull into focus your critical strategy challenges, not to mention their solutions.

- the intellectual discipline of Strategy make a difference in such adaptation?” After decades as a business advisor, active equity investor and teacher, my conclusion is, “Yes it can.” But with this hard-won conclusion comes a caveat informed by Pasteur’s well-known dictum: “Chance only favors the prepared mind.” Strategy serves best not as an analytical redoubt, but rather in developing the “prepared mind” of those on the ground.

- The 7 Powers, a Strategy framework borne of hundreds of consulting engagements and decades of active equity investing, clears this hurdle. Because it covers all attractive strategic positions, it is not simplistic, while its unitary focus on Power makes it sufficiently simple to be learned, retained and used by any business person. It can be, and indeed has been, successfully employed inside businesses as a shared, actionable understanding of the primary levers of Strategy. If your business does not have at least one of these seven Power types, then you lack a viable strategy, and you are vulnerable.

- Two additional clarifications are needed to narrow our discussion of “Strategy” and “strategy.” First, though Game Theory has important intersections with Strategy—the whole notion of arbitrage, for example, can be likened to the process of players playing their best games over time—Game Theory’s definition of strategy simply refers to the set of actions available to a player and thus proves far more inclusive than my definition. Even an optimal strategy in Game Theory, such as a Nash Equilibrium, implies no assurance of value creation. Intel’s retreat and exit from memories would have appeared optimal through a Game Theory lens—but no route to Power resulted. If we hold the ultimate normative benchmark in business to be value creation, then Game Theory alone is not sufficiently constrained to provide a normative framework for Strategy.4 Second, my definitions are distanced from the school of thought which centers on cleverness in choices—the idea that if you read Sun Tzu or hire a prestigious consulting firm, you can somehow make lemonade out of lemons. I have ignored this mindset on purpose. Businesspeople are usually smart, motivated, well-informed; with established businesses, this sort of cleverness typically figures into the perpetual to and fro of arbitrage—it’s necessary for value creation, sure, but relatively common and hardly sufficient.

- This is potential value and operational excellence is required to achieve that potential. Examining Intel through this lens, we can identify a large-scale market (M0g) for both memories and microprocessors. So what accounted for the utterly different value outcome? Under Andy Grove, operational excellence was the ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=270))

- Why do Scale Economies result in Power? Let’s recall the conditions for Power laid out in the Introduction. Power is a configuration that creates the potential for persistent significant differential returns, even in the face of fully committed and ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=394))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- competent competition. To fulfill this, two components must be simultaneously present: A Benefit: some condition which yields material improvement in the cash flow of the Power wielder via reduced cost, enhanced pricing and/or decreased investment requirements. A Barrier: some obstacle which engenders in competitors an inability and/or unwillingness to engage in behaviors that might, over time, arbitrage out this benefit. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=396))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This unattractive cost/benefit is itself the Barrier for Scale Economies. Of course, it goes without saying: the Barrier must be thoughtfully maintained by the incumbent leader, but to bet on anything else would be foolish. So we see that Scale Economies satisfy the sufficient and necessary conditions for Power.        Scale Economies: Benefit: Reduced Cost Barrier: Prohibitive Costs of Share Gains ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=412))

- This situation creates a very difficult position for Netflix’s smaller-scale streaming competitors. If they offer the same deliverable as Netflix, similar amounts of content for the same price, their P&L will suffer. If they try to remediate this by offering less content or raising prices, customers will abandon their service and they will lose market share. Such a competitive cul-de-sac is the hallmark of Power.

- In the Netflix example we see a feature of Scale Economies that recurs in many technology firms: a single fixed cost which declines per unit as it is prorated over higher and higher volumes. Beyond fixed costs, Scale Economies emerge from other sources as well. To name a few: Volume/area relationships. These occur when production costs are closely tied to area, while their utility is tied to volume, resulting in lower per-volume costs with increasing scale. Bulk milk tanks and warehouses would serve as examples. Distribution network density.

- Value and Power The sole objective of a strategy is to increase the potential value of the business. The chart below shows how Netflix fared after creating Power in their streaming business. Netflix’s share price trajectory is instructive. First, the payoff for their successful strategy was enormous. Over the above six years, Netflix’s stock price increased six-fold compared to a doubling of the market. Second, we can observe that this outperformance was not monotonic—2010 to 2013 was a roller coaster, and later years were no walk in the park. Regarding this volatility: In situations of high flux, it often takes time for cash flow to reliably reflect Power, so investor expectations may move up and down. In our discussion of Power, I have been careful to characterize it as creating a potential for value, but this potential can only be realized when coupled with… ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=443))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As I noted earlier, the Barrier in Scale Economies comes from a follower’s rational economic calculation (often learned) that, despite the attractive returns being earned by the leader, attack carries an unattractive payoff. A productive way to more formally calibrate the intensity of the scale leader’s Power is to assess the economic leeway they have in balancing attractive returns with appropriate retaliatory behavior to maintain share. The greater this leeway, the more attractive the longer-term equilibrium is likely to be for the leader. To do this, let me introduce the notion of Surplus Leader Margin (SLM). This is the profit margin the business with Power can expect to achieve if pricing is such that its competitor’s profits are zero. We derive the SLM for Netflix-like fixed cost Scale Economies in the appendix to this chapter. If the fixed cost = C, then: Surplus Leader Margin = [C/(Leader Sales)] * [(Leader Sales)/(Follower Sales) – 1] The first term of this equation20 indicates the relative significance of fixed cost in the company’s overall financials, while the second term shows the degree of scale advantage. Put another way: Surplus Leader Margin = [Scale Economy Intensity] * [Scale Advantage] Namely, the first term is tied to the economic structure of that industry (the intensity of the scale economy), a condition faced by all firms. The second term reflects the position of the leader relative to the follower. For Power to exist, both of these terms must be significantly positive. For example, even if there exists strong potential scale economies (C is large, relative to sales), the leader margin will still be ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=459))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- zero (no Power) without any scale differential, because that second term was still zero, too. This parsing of Power intensity into the separate strata of industry economics and competitive position is critical for a practitioner as it applies to most types of Power. In any assessment of Power, both need to be understood independently, and both are fair game for strategy initiatives.21 Here, with their streaming business, Netflix launched a two-pronged assault. Their thrust into exclusives and originals changed the economic structure of the industry, while their early-in and thoughtful rollout gave them a scale advantage. If Netflix had accepted the existing industry economic structure as an unalterable given, then no route to Power would have been available in streaming, and their value prospects would have remained quite dim, dependent on a declining DVD rental business. So as we discuss each type of Power in the coming chapters, in addition to the 7 Powers Chart, I will roll up another table summarizing the nature of these two dimensions, which together govern the intensity ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=473))

- The success of all three parties on this dance card, BranchOut, Facebook and LinkedIn, was predicated on users’ value of the service depending on the presence of others, the central feature of Network Economies. Their founders were fully aware of this business characteristic and aggressively and competently pushed tactics fully consistent with this understanding. Facebook and LinkedIn could co-exist because their respective networks were walled off from one another: users wanted to keep their personal lives (Facebook) separate from their work lives (LinkedIn). BranchOut hoped to build a bridge between the two, but it just didn’t fly. Users wanted this wall maintained, a lesson Facebook themselves learned in their failed rollout of Facebook at Work. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=538))
    - Tags: [[7 powers]] 
- Network Economies occur when the value of a product to a customer is increased by the use of the product by others. Returning to our Benefit/Barrier characterization of Power: Benefit. A company in a leadership position with Network Economies can charge higher prices than its competitors, because of the higher value as a result of more users. For example, the value of LinkedIn’s HR Solutions Suite comes from the numbers of LinkedIn users, so LinkedIn can charge more than a competiting product with fewer participants. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=546))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Barrier. The barrier for Network Economies is the unattractive cost/benefit of gaining share, and this can be extremely high. In particular the value deficit of a follower can be so large that the price discount needed to offset this is unthinkable. For example, “What would BranchOut have had to offer users for them to use BranchOut rather than LinkedIn?” I think most observers would agree that every user would have required a non-trivial payment, so the total spend for BranchOut would have ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=550))

- Winner take all. Businesses with strong Network Economies are frequently characterized by a tipping point: once a single firm achieves a certain degree of leadership, then the other firms just throw in the towel. Game over—the P&L of a challenge would just be too ugly. For example, even a company as competent and with as deep pockets as Google could not unseat Facebook with Google+. Boundedness. As powerful as this Barrier is, it is bounded by the character of the network, something well-demonstrated by the continued success of both Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook has powerful Network Economies itself but these have to do with personal not ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=554))

Due to tipping point dynamics, early relative scaling is critical in developing Power. Who scales the fastest is often determined by who gets the product most right early on.

- This means a leader can price at very attractive margins while still pricing well below the breakeven point for the follower. The result is that a follower would have to price at a significant loss to offer equivalent value. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=592))

- This chapter introduces Counter-Positioning, the next Power type. I developed this concept to depict a not well-understood competitive dynamic I often have observed both as a strategy advisor and an equity investor. I must confess it is my favorite form of Power, both because of my authorship and because it is so contrarian. As we will see, it is an avenue for defeating an incumbent who appears unassailable by conventional wisdom metrics of competitive strength.

- model. Think of the diverse circumstances attending Vanguard’s rise: huge and successful incumbent active mutual funds, a committed entrepreneur, an advancing intellectual frontier, fast-improving computer technology, entrenched channel disincentives, consumer misinformation, and so on. In situations like this, it falls to the strategist to carefully peel back the layers of complexity and eventually seize upon some irreduceable kernel of insight amidst the competitive reality. To understand the ascendancy of Vanguard, I must first note these characteristics: An upstart who developed a superior, heterodox business model. That business model’s ability to successfully challenge well-entrenched and formidable incumbents. The steady accumulation of customers, all while the incumbent remains seemingly paralyzed and unable to respond. These elements were not unique ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=677))

Think of Dell vs. Compaq, Nokia vs. Apple, Amazon vs. Borders, In-N-Out vs. McDonalds, Charles Schwab vs. Merrill Lynch, Netflix vs. Blockbuster, etc. But nearly always, these featured the same outcome: the incumbent responds either not at all or too late. These victories aren’t born of happenstance, of course; they are strategic, and the upstarts usually succeed in creating a lot of value for themselves, while severely diminishing that of the incumbents. Returning to our Benefit/Barrier characterization of Power: Benefit. The new business model is superior to the incumbent’s model due to lower costs and/or the ability to charge higher prices. In Vanguard’s case, their business model resulted in substantially lower… ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=685))

Due to their business structure of returning profits to their fund-holders, they realized value from market share gains (s in the fundamental equation of strategy), rather than ramping up differential profit margins (m). Barrier. The barrier for Counter-Positioning seems a bit mysterious: how could a powerhouse (such as Fidelity Investments in this case) allow itself to be persistently humbled by an upstart over such an extended period? Couldn’t they foresee the potential success of Vanguard’s model? Freqently in such situations, naïve onlookers castigate the incumbent for lack of vision, or even just poor management.

They observe the upstart’s new model, and ask, “Am I better off staying the course, or adopting the new model?” Counter-Positioning applies to the subset of cases in which the expected damage to the existing business elicits a “no” answer from the incumbent. The Barrier, simply put, is collateral damage.

- A new superior approach is developed (lower costs and/or improved features). The products from the new approach exhibit a high degree of substitutability for the products from the old approach. In this case, as semiconductor topologies shrunk, digital imaging came to completely supplant chemical imaging. The incumbent has little prospect for Power in this new business: either the industry economics support no Power (a commodity), or the incumbent’s competitive position is such that attainment of Power is unlikely. Kodak’s formidable strengths had little relevance to semiconductor memory, and those new products were on an inevitable path to commodization.

- This was the situation faced by Ned Johnson, the CEO of Fidelity, when passive mutual funds started to appear.

However, the impact of entry into passive funds on ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=747))

- their remaining base business of active funds would have been subtractive. Active funds carry radically higher expense charges and many even had upfront sales commissions (loads). For the assets they would have cannibalized, the revenue decline would have been dramatic. Further, many at Fidelity felt they were facing an existential threat, and the introduction of passive funds would have taken them off-message in the rear-guard advocacy of active funds. They assumed, reasonably, that any conceivable gains made with these new funds would have been more than offset by losses in their base business of active funds. In similar hypotheticals, then, a rational incumbent CEO would decide to eschew the new approach. This type of “don’t invest” determination represents one type of Counter-Positioning (CP). The term I use is “Milk” because the CEO is essentially choosing to milk a declining original business even though the new… ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=750))

- Costs are somewhat murkier but no less persuasive. They stem from the loss of familiarity with the product or from the the risk and uncertainty associated with the adoption of a new product. When employees have invested time and effort to learn the particulars of how to use a certain product, there can be a significant cost to retraining them in a different system. In the case of SAP, applications exist for a wide array of enterprise functions. This means that there are employees in human resources, sales and marketing, procurement, accounting, not to mention managers across these many divisions, who have all learned how to create reports based on the SAP system and its complementary software. Such a system-switch breeds organizational discontent by forcing many within the ranks of the organization to change their daily routines. Furthermore, procedural changes open the door for errors.

Relational Switching Costs are those tolls which would result from the breaking of emotional bonds built up through use of the product and through interactions with other users and service providers. Often a customer establishes close, beneficial relationships with the provider’s sales and service teams. Such familiarity, ease of communication and mutual positive feelings can create resistance to the prospect of severing those ties and switching to another vendor. Additionally, if the customer has developed affection for the product and their identity as a user, or if they enjoy the camaraderie which exists amongst a community of like users, they may shrink from the prospect of switching identities and abandoning that community.

- offering, distinct from the objective value of the good. For example, Safeway’s cola may be indistinguishable from Coke’s in a blind taste test, but even after revealing the result, the taste tester remains willing to pay more for Coke. Uncertainty reduction. A customer attains “peace of mind” knowing that the branded product will be as just as expected. Consider another example: Bayer aspirin. Search for aspirin on Amazon.com and you will see a 200 count of Bayer 325 mg. aspirin for $9.47 side-by-side with a 500 count of Kirkland 325 mg. aspirin for $10.93. So Bayer has a price per tablet premium of 117%. Some customers still would prefer the Bayer because of diminished uncertainty: Bayer’s long history of consistency makes customers more confident that they are getting exactly what they want. Note that the Benefit from Branding does not depend on prior ownership, as with Switching Costs. Barrier. A strong brand can only be created over a lengthy period of reinforcing actions (hysteresis), which itself serves as the key Barrier. Again, Tiffany has cultivated its brand name for more than a century. What’s more, copycats face daunting uncertainty in initiating Branding: a long investment runway with no assurance of an eventual path to significant affective valence. Efforts to mimic another brand run the risk of trademark infringement actions as well with their attendant costs and unclear outcomes.

- Brand Dilution. Firms require focus and diligence to guide Branding over time and ensure that the reputation created remains consistent in the valences it generates. Hence, the biggest pitfall lies in diminishing the brand by releasing products which deviate from, or damage, the brand image. Seeking higher “down market” volumes can reduce affective valence by damaging the aura of exclusivity, weakening positive associations with the product. For example, Halston rose to fame in the 1970s as a high-end design standard for women’s clothing. However, when Halston accepted $1 billion from lower-end retailer J.C. Penney to expand into affordable fashion lines for the mass consumer, Bergdorf Goodman dropped the label in order to protect their brand. The J.C. Penney line was a failure, and the Halston name never recaptured its previously enviable Branding. I stated earlier that Branding’s Barrier is hysteresis and uncertainty. Dilution threatens Branding Power because it can “reset the hysteresis clock,” forcing a company to restart the slow and uncertain process of building affective valence. The Halston experience serves as a persuasive case in point. Counterfeiting. Since it is the label, not the product, that bestows Branding Power, counterfeiters may try to free-ride by falsely associating a powerful brand with their product. Because Branding relies upon repeated positive interactions with consumers, counterfeiters who flood the market with inconsistent offerings can gradually undermine it. For instance, in 2013 Tiffany sued Costco for intimating to shoppers that they sold Tiffany jewelery; the company had previously sued eBay for facilitating the sale of counterfeits. A press release to investors after the filing of the 2013 suit explicitly noted that, “Tiffany has never sold nor would it ever sell its fine jewelry through an off-price warehouse retailer like Costco.”53 Changing consumer preferences. Over time, customer preferences may vary in a way that undermines the value of Branding. Nintendo developed a brand for family-friendly video games. However, as the gaming demographic evolved from predominantly children to adults, there was a shift in demand for more mature games. Nintendo’s Branding did not extend to this segment with the attendant negative impact.

Note that Branding is a non-exclusive type of Power. Indeed, a direct competitor might have an equally impactful brand that targets the same customers (e.g., Prada and Luis Vuitton and Hermès). All competitors with brand Power, however, still will earn returns superior to those of the competitor with no Branding. Type of Good.

Hundreds of thousands of executives from thousands of businesses have toured Toyota’s plants in Japan and the United States.”66 This failure to transfer the NUMMI practices perpetuated the trend noted before: GM’s inexorable decline continued for decades, despite the success of NUMMI.

Observing all this, GM workers naturally assumed you could clone TPS by copying these procedures. It turns out, though, that these production techniques merely manifest some deeper, more complex system, as illustrated by the frustration of Ernie Shaefer, the manager of the GM plant in Van Nuys, California: “…what’s different when you walk into the NUMMI plant?

So you are probably asking yourself two questions: “What must I do to establish Power?” and “When can I establish it?” Part II of this book reveals the answers to these questions. The question of “What?” serves as the subject of this chapter, and “When?” the subject of the next. ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1582))

- Netflix realized that content lay at the heart of the problem. After all, great content ultimately represents any streamer’s core value proposition, and for Netflix, it accounted for the bulk of their cost structure. Unfortunately, content holders could “variable cost price” the programming they licensed, charging Netflix according to usage. This put other licensors on an even footing with Netflix, regardless of ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1634))

- scale, thus eliminating any chance of Power. Ted Sarandos, the strategically acute Netflix content head, took the first step in addressing this challenge by pursuing exclusives. At first blush, exclusives seemed a poor choice for Netflix: their higher price meant less content for subscribers. Nevertheless, on August 10, 2010, Netflix and Epix agreed to an exclusive agreement: “Adding EPIX to our growing library of streaming content, as the exclusive Internet-only distributor of this great content, marks the continued emergence of Netflix as a leader in entertainment delivered over the Web,” said Ted Sarandos.81 This changed the game. The price of an exclusive was fixed, which meant some content no longer carried a variable cost. All of a sudden Netflix’s substantial scale advantage over other streamers made a difference. But the owners of potential exclusive properties could take note of Netflix’s success. Eventually they ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1637))

- would resort to bargaining hard for an outsized share of those returns, even using other streaming competitors as stalking horses. In fact, Epix did exactly this, ending its deal with Netflix and signing up instead with Amazon on Sept 4, 2012. So again, with Sarandos’ approbation, Netflix took the next logical step—originals. Here they took a page out of HBO’s playbook—that network’s transition to originals had secured their position as a premium cable juggernaut years before. First for Netflix was the modest Lilyhammer, but on March 16, 2011, Netflix dropped a bomb. Deadline Hollywood splashed: Netflix To Enter Original Programming With Mega Deal For David Fincher-Kevin Spacey Series ‘House Of Cards’82 Netflix plunked down $100 million, beating out HBO, CBS and Showtime to lock up twenty-six episodes, two full seasons of the political thriller. It was a big bet, and despite modest assurance from their user stats, a large risk. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1645))

- Here’s the first important takeaway from our consideration of Dynamics: “getting there” (Dynamics) is completely different from “being there” (Statics). This is a distinction not only for academics but for practitioners as well. For example, in the early days of strategy consulting, the two were frequently conflated: a close study of Statics indicated that high relative market share led to attractive returns; this fed the instinct to gain market share (Dynamics), usually via aggressive pricing. Such policies usually did not create value, as competitors would ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1672))

- This snaps into focus the crux moves that established the foundations of Power: Competitive Position: an attractive new service. Netflix’s pioneering rollout excited customers, and their influx propelled Netflix to an early relative scale advantage that the company has never relinquished. Industry Economics: originals and exclusives. This converted some content, the largest element of their cost structure, from variable cost to fixed cost, cementing Power by creating Scale Economies for the first time.88 ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1685))

With this first Power type, you must simultaneously pursue a business model that promises Scale Economies (industry economics), while at the same ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1697))

Had Netflix invented the streaming product without introducing originals, they would have been left with an easily imitated commodity business. There would have been no Power and little value in the business. This is where the 7 Powers figures in. In the midst of invention, you need to be ever watchful for Power openings. The 7 Powers framework focuses your attention on the critical issues and increases the odds of a favorable outcome. This is the most Strategy can accomplish.

So in this formative period, as your invention takes shape, you must attune yourself to the exigencies of Power and stay constantly vigilant. This is why I developed the 7 Powers—to give you a ready guide for this. Steve Jobs famously proselytized for “insanely great products.” This was not whimsical, but deeply strategic. Invention not only opens the door to Power, it also fuels market size, the other half of the Fundamental Equation of Strategy. So let’s turn to the complementary question.

Over and over, I have witnessed Buffett’s axiom play out in the press, with business leaders castigated for poor management ability in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances. Yahoo, Twitter and Zynga come to mind here. That said, when it comes to establishing Power in the first place, make no mistake: leadership is fundamental. Operation Crush would never have happened were it not for Andy Grove’s implacable, aggressive leadership. Going back further, the company would not have even pursued microprocessors were it not for the leadership of Bob Noyce.
