## Highlights
- Since that original memo, I’ve made a few adjustments in the things I consider “the most important,” but the fundamental notion is unchanged: they’re all important. Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, all at the same time. Omit any one and the result is likely to be less than satisfactory. That is why I have built this book around the idea of the most important things—each is a brick in what I hope will be a solid wall, and none is dispensable.

- In particular, you’ll find I spend more time discussing risk and how to limit it than how to achieve investment returns. To me, risk is the most interesting, challenging and essential aspect of investing. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=125))

- SETH KLARMAN: This fact may be one of the most shocking statements in this book. During this period, investors were lulled to sleep, anticipating double-digit annual returns while completely losing sight of the risks. Seventeen years ought to qualify as long term—it is roughly half of a career—yet a career built only during this period would hardly have withstood the test of time.

- SETH KLARMAN: Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.

- Remember, your goal in investing isn’t to earn average returns; you want to do better than average. Thus, your thinking has to be better than that of others—both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, you must find an edge they don’t have. You must think of something they haven’t thought of, see things they miss or bring insight they don’t possess. You have to react differently and behave differently. In short, being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won’t be sufficient. You must be more right than others … which by definition means your thinking has to be different. PAUL JOHNSON: Marks’s comments in this paragraph are excellent. He successfully articulates the critical importance of second-level thinking to investment success. The short discussion that follows offers three excellent examples of the difference between first- and second-level thinking. What is second-level thinking?   •   First-level thinking says, “It’s a good company; let’s buy the stock.” Second-level thinking says, “It’s a good company, but everyone thinks it’s a great company, and it’s not. So the stock’s overrated and overpriced; let’s sell.” ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=245))

- it (a bad sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority). All the first-level thinker needs is an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning the stock will go up.” Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted. The second-level thinker takes a great many things into account:   •   What is the range of likely future outcomes? •   Which outcome do I think will occur? •   What’s the probability I’m right? •   What does the consensus think? •   How does my expectation differ from the consensus? •   How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine? •   Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=267))

- You can’t do the same things others do and expect to outperform. … Unconventionality shouldn’t be a goal in itself, but rather a way of thinking. In order to distinguish yourself from others, it helps to have ideas that are different and to process those ideas differently.

- There are many participants in the markets, and they share roughly equal access to all relevant information. They are intelligent, objective, highly motivated and hardworking. Their analytical models are widely known and employed. •   Because of the collective efforts of these participants, information is reflected fully and immediately in the market price of each asset. And because market participants will move instantly to buy any asset that’s too cheap or sell one that’s too dear, assets are priced fairly in the absolute and relative to each other. •   Thus, market prices represent accurate estimates of assets’ intrinsic value, and no participant ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=344))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- can consistently identify and profit from instances when they are wrong. •   Assets therefore sell at prices from which they can be expected to deliver risk-adjusted returns that are “fair” relative to other assets. Riskier assets must offer higher returns in order to attract buyers. The market will set prices so that appears to be the case, but it won’t provide a “free lunch.” That is, there will be no incremental return that is not related to (and compensatory for) incremental risk.

- I agree that because investors work hard to evaluate every new piece of information, asset prices immediately reflect the consensus view of the information’s significance. I do not, however, believe the consensus view is necessarily correct. In January 2000, Yahoo sold at $237. In April 2001 it was at $11. Anyone who argues that the market was right both times has his or her head in the clouds; it has to have been wrong on at least one of those occasions. But that doesn’t mean many investors were able to detect and act on the market’s error. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=360))

- The most important upshot from the efficient market hypothesis is its conclusion that “you can’t beat the market.” Not only was this conclusion founded logically on the Chicago view of the market, but it was buttressed by studies of the performance of mutual funds.

- I don’t believe the notion of market efficiency deserves to be dismissed out of hand. In principle, it’s fair to conclude that if thousands of rational and numerate people gather information about an asset and evaluate it diligently and objectively, the asset’s price shouldn’t stray far from its intrinsic value.

- regularly extant, meaning it should be hard to beat the market. In fact, some asset classes are quite efficient. In most of these:   •   the asset class is widely known and has a broad following; •   the class is socially acceptable, not controversial or taboo; •   the merits of the class are clear and comprehensible, at least on the surface; and •   information about the class and its components is distributed widely and evenly.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and how regularly can any one person detect those mispricings? Answer: Not often, and not dependably. But that is the essence of second-level thinking. Second-level thinkers know that, to achieve superior results, they have to have an edge in either information or analysis, or both. They are on the alert for instances of misperception. My son Andrew is a budding investor, and he comes up with lots of appealing investment ideas based on today’s facts and the outlook for tomorrow. But he’s been well trained. His first test is always the same: “And who doesn’t know that?” ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=444))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- term inefficiency came into widespread use over the last forty years as the counterpoint to the belief that investors can’t beat the market. To me, describing a market as inefficient is a high-flown way of saying the market is prone to mistakes that can be taken advantage of. Where might errors come from? Let’s consider the assumptions that underlie the theory of efficient markets:   •   There are many investors hard at work. •   They are intelligent, diligent, objective, motivated and well equipped. •   They all have access to the available information, and their access is roughly equal. •   They’re all open to buying, selling or shorting (i.e., betting against) every asset.   For those reasons, theory says that all ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=450))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the available information will be smoothly and efficiently synthesized into prices and acted on whenever price/value discrepancies arise, so as to drive out those discrepancies. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=459))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But it’s impossible to argue that market prices are always right. In fact, if you look at the four assumptions just listed, one stands out as particularly tenuous: objectivity. Human beings are not clinical computing machines. Rather, most people are driven by greed, fear, envy and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes. Likewise, what about the fourth assumption? Whereas investors are supposed to be open to any asset—and to both owning it and being short—the truth is very different. Most professionals are assigned to particular market niches, as in “I work in the equity department” or “I’m a ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=461))

- bond manager.” ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=466))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- To me, an inefficient market is one that is marked by at least one (and probably, as a result, by all) of the following characteristics: •   Market prices are often wrong. Because access to information and the analysis thereof are highly imperfect, market prices are often far above or far below intrinsic values. •   The risk-adjusted return on one asset class can be far out of line with those of other asset classes. Because assets are often valued at other-than-fair ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=475))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- prices, an asset class can deliver a risk-adjusted return that is significantly too high (a free lunch) or too low relative to other asset classes. •   Some investors can consistently outperform others. Because of the existence of (a) significant misvaluations and (b) differences among participants in terms of skill, insight and information access, it is possible for misvaluations to be identified and profited from with regularity. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=479))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This last point is very important in terms of what it does and does not mean. Inefficient markets do not necessarily give their participants generous returns. Rather, it’s my view that they provide the raw material—mispricings—that can ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=484))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- allow some people to win and others to lose on the basis of differential skill. If prices can be very wrong, that means it’s possible to find bargains or overpay. For every person who gets a good buy in an inefficient market, someone else sells too cheap. One of the great sayings about poker is that “in every game there’s a fish. If you’ve played for 45 minutes and haven’t figured out who the fish is, then it’s you.” The same is certainly true of inefficient market investing. “WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT, ALPHA?” JULY 11, 2001 ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=485))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- market is completely one or the other. It’s just a matter of degree. I wholeheartedly appreciate the opportunities that inefficiency can provide, but I also respect the concept of market efficiency, and I believe strongly that mainstream securities markets can be so efficient that it’s largely a waste of time to work at finding winners there.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- In the end, I’ve come to an interesting resolution: Efficiency is not so universal that we should give up on superior performance. At the same time, efficiency is what lawyers call a “rebuttable presumption”—something that should be presumed to be true until someone proves otherwise. Therefore, we should assume that efficiency will impede our achievement unless we have good reason to believe it won’t in the present case.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- exist, and why? Think of it this way:   •   Why should a bargain exist despite the presence of thousands of investors who stand ready and willing to bid up the price of anything that’s too cheap? •   If the return appears so generous in proportion to the risk, might you be overlooking some hidden risk? •   Why would the seller of the asset be willing to part with it at a price from which it will give you an excessive return? •   Do you really know more about the asset than the seller does? •   If it’s such a great proposition, why hasn’t someone else snapped it up?

- Bottom line: Inefficiency is a necessary condition for superior investing. Attempting to outperform in a perfectly efficient market is like flipping a fair coin: the best you can hope for is fifty-fifty. For investors to get an edge, there have to be inefficiencies in the underlying process—imperfections, mispricings—to take advantage of. But let’s say there are. That alone is not a sufficient condition for outperformance. All that means is that prices aren’t always fair and mistakes are occurring: some assets are priced too low and some too high. You still have to be more insightful than others in order to regularly buy more of the former than the latter. Many of the best bargains at any point in time are found among the things other investors can’t or won’t do. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=515))

- we are left with two approaches, both driven by fundamentals: value investing and growth investing. In a nutshell, value investors aim to come up with a security’s current intrinsic value and buy when the price is lower, and growth investors try to find securities whose value will increase rapidly in the future.

- The quest in value investing is for cheapness. Value investors typically look at financial metrics such as earnings, cash flow, dividends, hard assets and enterprise value and emphasize buying cheap on these bases. The primary goal of value investors, then, is to quantify the company’s current value and buy its securities when they can do so cheaply. Growth investing lies somewhere between the dull plodding of value investing and the adrenaline charge of momentum investing. Its goal is to identify companies with bright futures. That means by definition that there’s less emphasis on the company’s current attributes and more on its potential.

- There’s more. If you’ve settled on the value approach to investing and come up with an intrinsic value for a security or asset, the next important thing is to hold it firmly.

- A firmly held view on value can help you cope with this disconnect. Let’s say you figure out that something’s worth 80 and have a chance to buy it for 60. Chances to buy well below actual value don’t come along every day, and you should welcome them. Warren Buffett describes them as “buying dollars for fifty cents.” So you buy it and you feel you’ve done a good thing. But don’t expect immediate success. In fact, you’ll often find that you’ve bought in the midst of a decline that continues. Pretty soon you’ll be looking at losses. And as one of the greatest investment adages reminds us, “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.” So now that security worth 80 is priced at 50 instead of 60.

- My attempts to provide valuable annotations will concentrate on four important themes that run through the book; you’ll see reference to them in many places.

There, many people tend to fall further in love with the thing they’ve bought as its price rises, since they feel validated, and they like it less as the price falls, when they begin to doubt their decision to buy. This makes it very difficult to hold, and to buy more at lower prices (which investors call “averaging down”), especially if the decline proves to be extensive.

- An important question remains: how do they measure that risk? First, it clearly is nothing but a matter of opinion: hopefully an educated, skillful estimate of the future, but still just an estimate. Second, the standard for quantification is nonexistent. With any given investment, some people will think the risk is high and others will think it’s low. Some will state it as the probability of not making money, and some as the probability of losing a given fraction of their money (and so forth). Some will think of it as the risk of losing money over one year, and some as the risk of losing money over the entire holding period. Clearly, even if all the investors involved met in a room and showed their cards, they’d never agree on a single number representing an investment’s riskiness. And even if they could, that number wouldn’t likely be capable of being compared against another number, set by another group of investors, for another investment. This is one of the reasons why I say risk and the risk/return decision aren’t “machinable,” or capable of being turned over to a computer.

- While on the subject of probability distributions, I want to take a moment to make special mention of the normal distribution. Obviously investors are required to make judgments about future events. To do that, we settle on a central value around which we think events are likely to cluster. This may be the mean or expected value (the outcome that on average is expected to occur), the median (the outcome with half the possibilities above and half below) or the mode (the single most likely outcome). But to cope with the future it’s not sufficient to have a central expectation; we have to have a sense for the other possible outcomes and their likelihood. We need a distribution that describes all of the possibilities. Most phenomena that cluster around a central value—for example, the heights of people—form the familiar bell-shaped curve, with the probability of a given observation peaking at the center and trailing off toward the extremes, or “tails.” There may be more men of five feet ten inches than any other height, somewhat fewer of five feet nine inches or five feet eleven inches, a lot less of five feet three inches or six feet five inches, and almost none of four feet eight inches or seven feet. Rather than enumerating the probability of each observation individually, standard distributions provide a convenient way to summarize the probabilities, such that a few statistics can tell you everything you have to know about the shape of things to come. The most common bell-shaped distribution is called the “normal” distribution. However, ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1202))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- people often use the terms bell-shaped and normal interchangeably, and they’re not the same.

- In the years leading up to the crisis, financial engineers, or “quants,” played a big part in creating and evaluating financial products such as derivatives and structured entities. In many cases they made the assumption that future events would be normally distributed. But the normal distribution assumes events in the distant tails will happen extremely infrequently, while the distribution of financial developments—shaped by humans, with their tendency to go to emotion-driven extremes of behavior—should probably be seen as having “fatter” tails. Thus, when widespread mortgage defaults began to occur, events thought to be unlikely befell mortgage-related vehicles on a regular basis. Investors in vehicles that had been constructed on the basis of normal distributions, without much allowance for “tail events” (some might borrow Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s term “black swans”), often saw the wheels come off.

- The reality of risk is much less simple and straightforward than the perception. People vastly overestimate their ability to recognize risk and underestimate what it takes to avoid it; thus, they accept risk unknowingly and in so doing contribute to its creation. That’s why it’s essential to apply uncommon, second-level thinking to the subject. Risk arises as investor behavior alters the market. Investors bid up assets, accelerating into the present appreciation that otherwise would have occurred in the future, and thus lowering prospective returns. And as their psychology strengthens and they become bolder and less worried, investors cease to demand adequate risk premiums. The ultimate irony lies in the fact that the reward for taking incremental risk shrinks as more people move to take it. Thus, the market is not a static arena in which investors operate. It is responsive, shaped by investors’ own behavior. Their increasing confidence creates more that they should worry about, just as their rising fear and risk aversion combine to widen risk premiums at the same time as they reduce risk. I call this the “perversity of risk.” ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1491))

- I’m firmly convinced that investment risk resides most where it is least perceived, and vice versa:   •    When everyone believes something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually reduces its price to the point where it’s not risky at all. Broadly negative opinion can make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its price. •    And, of course, as demonstrated by the experience of Nifty Fifty investors, when everyone believes something embodies no risk, they usually bid it up to the point where it’s enormously risky. No risk is feared, and thus no reward for risk bearing—no “risk premium”—is demanded or provided. That can make the… ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1511))

- CHRISTOPHER DAVIS: I agree—there are a number of dangers that come from using a term like “quality.” First, investors tend to equate “high-quality asset” with “high-quality investment.” As a result, there’s an incorrect presumption or implication of less risk when taking on “quality” assets. As Marks rightly points out, quite often “high-quality” companies sell for high prices, making them poor investments. Second, “high quality” tends to be a phrase that incorporates a lot of hindsight bias or “halo effect.” Usually, people referring to a “high-quality” company are describing a company that has performed very well in the past. The future is often quite different. There is a long… ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1525))

- Whatever few awards are presented for risk control, they’re never given out in good times. The reason is that risk is covert, invisible. Risk—the possibility of loss—is not observable.

- This is a very important point, so let me give you a couple of analogies to make sure it’s clear. Germs cause illness, but germs themselves are not illness. We might say illness is what results when germs take hold. Homes in California may or may not have construction flaws that would make them collapse during earthquakes. We find out only when earthquakes occur. Likewise, loss is what happens when risk meets adversity. Risk is the potential for loss if things go wrong. As long as things go well, loss does not arise. Risk gives rise to loss only when negative events occur in the environment. ([Location 1558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1558))

Will Rogers said, “You’ve got to go out on a limb sometimes because that’s where the fruit is.” None of us is in this business to make4 percent. So even though the first tenet in Oaktree’s investment philosophy stresses “the importance of risk control,” this has nothing to do with risk avoidance. It’s by bearing risk when we’re well paid to do so—and especially by taking risks toward which others are averse in the extreme—that we strive to add value for our clients. When formulated that way, it’s obvious how big a part risk plays in our process. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=1692))

- few years ago I came up with an allegory applicable to low-return environments. It was called “The Cat, the Tree, the Carrot and the Stick.” The cat is an investor, whose job it is to cope with the investment environment, of which the tree is part. The carrot—the incentive to accept increased risk—comes from the higher returns seemingly available from riskier investments. And the stick—the motivation to forsake safety—comes from the modest level of the prospective returns being offered on safer investments. The carrot lures the cat to higher ([Location 2767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=2767))

- branches—riskier strategies—in pursuit of its dinner (its targeted return), and the stick prods the cat up the tree, because it can’t get dinner while staying close to the ground. Together, the stick and the carrot can cause the cat to climb until it ultimately arrives high up in the tree, in a treacherous position. The critical observation is that the cat pursues high returns, even in a low-return environment, and bears the consequences—increased risk—although often unknowingly. Bond investors call this process “reaching for yield” or “reaching for return.” It has classically consisted of investing in riskier credits as the yields on safer ones decline, in order to ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SWH6OQ&location=2772))

But since markets overshoot all the time—and price declines continue long after they should have stopped at fair value—there’s no way to know when the price has reached a level below which it won’t go. It’s essential to understand that “cheap” is far from synonymous with “not going to fall further.” I try to look at it logically.
