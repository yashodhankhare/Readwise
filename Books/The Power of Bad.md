## Highlights
- You are most affected by the negativity effect during your younger years, when you most need to learn from failures and criticism. As you age, the need to learn diminishes while perspective increases. Old people tend to be more contented than young people because their emotions and judgments aren’t as skewed by problems and setbacks. They counteract the power of bad by appreciating pleasures each day and recalling happy moments instead of dwelling on past miseries. Their lives may not seem better by objective standards (particularly if they have health problems), but they feel better and can make sounder decisions because they can afford to ignore unpleasant learning opportunities and focus on what brings joy. That’s the sort of wisdom we’re promoting in this book. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=83))

- The upside of bad is its power to sharpen the mind and energize the will. By understanding the impact of painful feedback, you become better at dealing with criticism—at absorbing the useful lessons without being demoralized. You also become better at dispensing criticism, a rare skill. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=105))

- To investigate, Baumeister started by looking for situations in which bad events didn’t have such a strong ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=128))

- impact. It was a logical enough approach: To understand the source of something’s strength, look for examples of its weakness. To find out what’s supporting a roof, look for spots where it’s sagging. Baumeister and his colleagues proposed to “identify several contrary patterns” that would enable them to “develop an elaborate, complex, and nuanced theory about when bad is stronger versus when good is stronger.” But they couldn’t. To their surprise, despite scouring the research literature in psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, and other disciplines, they couldn’t find compelling counterexamples of good being stronger. Studies showed that bad health or bad parenting makes much more difference than good health or good parenting. The impact of bad events lasts longer than that of good events. A negative image (a photograph of a dead animal) stimulates more electrical activity in the brain than does a positive image (a bowl of chocolate ice cream). The pain of criticism is much stronger than the pleasure of praise. Penalties motivate students and workers more than rewards. A bad reputation is much easier to acquire and tougher to lose than a good reputation. The survey of the research literature showed bad to be relentlessly stronger than good.

- Almost by chance, the psychologists had discovered a major phenomenon, one that extended into so many different fields that the overall pattern had escaped notice. While he was writing up the results, Baumeister happened to visit the University of Pennsylvania and present his findings. A professor in the audience, Paul Rozin, came up afterward and told him he was working on a similar project, although from a different approach. Rozin was already well known for his highly creative research into neglected topics, including magical thinking and disgust. In a memorable set of experiments, he showed how little it took to contaminate something good. When a sterilized, dead cockroach was dunked into a glass of apple juice and then quickly removed, most people refused to take a sip. (The notable exception: little boys, who seemed incapable of being grossed out.) Most adults became unwilling to drink any apple juice at all, not even when it was freshly poured from a new… ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=137))

- you willing to eat the bugs? Can you imagine any food so good that merely touching it to the plate would render the cockroaches edible? No, because there is no “anti-cockroach.” Rozin’s study of disgust and contagion confirmed an old Russian saying: “A spoonful of tar can spoil a barrel of honey, but a spoonful of honey does nothing for a barrel of tar.” As Rozin pondered this asymmetry, he saw that this negativity bias applied to a wide range of phenomena. In many religious traditions, a person can be damned by a single transgression or possessed by a demon in an instant, but it takes decades of good works and dedication to become holy. In the Hindu caste system, a Brahman is contaminated by eating food prepared by someone from a lower caste, but an untouchable does not become any purer by eating food prepared by a Brahman. A few linguistic peculiarities also struck both Baumeister and Rozin. Psychologists generally describe emotional states with pairs of opposites: happy or sad, relaxed or anxious,… ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=146))

- single event. The term for it is trauma, but what is the opposite? What word would describe a positive emotional state that lingers for decades in response to a single event? There is no opposite of trauma, because no single good event has such a lasting impact. You can consciously recall happy moments from your past, but the ones that suddenly pop into your head uninvited—the involuntary memories, as psychologists call them—tend to be unhappy. Bad moments create unconscious feelings that don’t go away. Fifty years after World War II, when researchers compared American veterans who’d fought in the Pacific with those who’d fought in Europe, there was a distinct difference in tastes: The Pacific veterans still avoided Asian food. One bad sexual experience can haunt a person for life, but the most blissful tryst will become a hazy memory. One infidelity can destroy a marriage, but no act of devotion can permanently bond a couple. One moment of parental neglect can lead to decades of angst and… ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=156))

- to name one, there was no consensus. Some people couldn’t think of any word; others suggested words that were not quite right, like savior (a broader term typically used for spiritual redemption and other kinds of rescue) and lifesaver (which brings to mind something on a ship’s deck). Previous researchers had studied languages around the world and found a negativity bias in the distribution of words: There are more synonyms for a bad concept like pain than for its opposite, pleasure. But for murderer there is no opposite. The Penn researchers looked for other such “unique nouns,” either good or bad, and came up with just a handful—all of them bad. They could find synonyms for sympathy (like compassion and pity) but no single word to connote empathizing with someone’s good fortune. There was a word for an unexpected negative event, accident, and also for the chance that something bad could occur, risk, but most people couldn’t think of an opposite for either one.

- We are richer, healthier, freer, and safer than our ancestors could have ever hoped to be, yet we don’t enjoy our blessings. We prefer to heed—and vote for—the voices telling us the world is going to hell. Instead of seizing opportunities and expanding our horizons, we seethe at injustices and dread disasters—and all too often respond by making things worse. The negativity bias causes us to pay special attention to external threats and thus exaggerate those dangers, but we’re prone to a different bias when looking inward. We typically exaggerate our virtues, and our capacity for self-delusion can be astonishing.

- time for assault, robbery, fraud, and other crimes were asked to compare themselves with the general population, they rated themselves as being more moral and honest, and also more compassionate and self-controlled. There was just one quality in which they didn’t outshine the rest of society. When it came to being law-abiding, these convicted criminals modestly rated themselves as only average. We’re all prone to overestimate our abilities as well as our power to control our destiny. People have a false sense of security on the highway because they consider themselves above-average drivers and expect their skill to protect them, even though many accidents are caused by factors beyond their control. Similarly, when asked how long it will take to complete a project, people typically underestimate the time because they’re too confident in themselves and don’t allow for delays beyond their control. This “optimism bias” causes people to underestimate the risk of some types of negative events in their own lives. They’re fully aware that something bad can happen—in fact, they often have an unrealistically high expectation it will happen—but they tell themselves it will happen to someone else.

- Why was Germany so eager for a war that proved so futile? Before the war, Germany was the greatest economic and military power in Europe, so strong that its neighbors would have been foolhardy to attack. Yet German leaders obsessed over any signs of hostility from other nations. In 1912 the German chancellor wondered whether it would be worthwhile to plant trees on his estate because he assumed “the Russians would be here in a few years in any case.” While historians have struggled to come up with rational reasons for this paranoia, the best explanation lies in the psychological literature, according to the political scientists Dominic Johnson and Dominic Tierney (no relation). They’ve recently drawn on the work of Baumeister and Rozin to explain the fears that led German leaders into World War I and also spurred the American decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Like the Germans, the Americans overestimated the threat from their enemy, mistakenly believing Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And like the Germans, who expected a quick victory, the… ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=258))

The result is a self-perpetuating process that Timur Kuran and Cass Sunstein have termed an availability cascade: News coverage of a danger creates public fear, inspiring further coverage and more fear, which is why 40 percent of Americans worry that they or a family member will die in a terrorist attack. Meanwhile, lacking the sensational media coverage of their death toll, bathtubs fail to inspire dread, and millions of Americans climb in and out without pausing to fear for their lives.

- In his romantic quandary, the young Baumeister fell back on the classic strategy of confused social scientists: collect data. He devised a crude binary measure. Each evening, he would look back on the day, ask himself if he was glad to be in the relationship, and mark a yes or no answer in his notebook. He also established a couple of limits. If it turned out that the bad days outnumbered the good days, he told himself, that would be a clear reason to break up. If there were at least four good days for every bad day, that would be a reason to stay together. In between would be, well, in between. He realized these parameters were arbitrary, but he was desperate for some kind of clarity. After several months of record keeping, he could see that the ratio was remaining fairly steady—and that there was still no clarity. They had two good days for every bad day, a ratio midway between his limits. What to do? He could see that the good days outnumbered the bad days by a sizable margin, yet he was feeling more miserable than ever on the bad days. He decided to break up with her, a decision based on his gut rather than his data, but eventually other scientists provided a rationale for his decision—and also for his research method. With those daily entries in his notebook, he had happened on a concept that would later be termed the positivity ratio, which is the number of good events for every bad event. This simple ratio can’t measure the full complexity of love or life, but it’s a valuable tool for understanding the negativity effect. It enables researchers to measure bad and gauge its impact. It gives therapists and counselors a way to diagnose problems and assess progress. Perhaps most important, it gives all of us a way to deal with the power of bad: to use the rational part of the brain to understand and override the debilitating fears and anxieties that constrict lives, warp decisions, and ruin relationships. To figure out how well a person or a couple or a group is doing, and to overcome the negativity bias, you need a method of weighing the positive against the negative to determine their relative strength. You need to ask: Just how bad is bad? ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=331))

- Other researchers have been unpoetically counting the ways in which people love each other—or don’t. One simple method has been to count the number of times a couple had sex and the number of times they argued. Neither number by itself is revealing: Some happy couples have few arguments and little sex, and some have lots of fights and makeup sex. But the ratio between sex and arguing has turned out to be a reliable predictor of a marriage’s prospects. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=358))

- This “Gottman ratio” of 5 to 1 has proved a useful standard for gauging quite different types of relationships. Some happy couples show little affection but flourish because they hardly ever fight; other successful couples fight more often but make up for it with lots of warmth and kindness. Informally, some researchers refer to this ratio as the “five fucks for every fight” rule. That’s an oversimplification—there are many forms of affection besides sex—but it’s a quick way of assessing the fundamental issue: Does the good significantly outweigh the bad? The Gottman ratio is a worthwhile target for couples,… ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=366))

- In experiments more than half a century ago, researchers quickly noticed that people would sometimes make irrational bets in their lust to make money—a finding that was not news to casino operators. But the experiments showed that people were even more irrational when there was a risk of losing money. This phenomenon later acquired a name, loss aversion, after research by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They found that most people are unwilling to make even-money bets on a coin toss. They won’t risk losing $20 on a coin toss unless they’re offered a potential gain of double that amount, $40. Why not? “Losses loom larger than gains,” Kahneman and Tversky concluded. But there’s also another reason for those bettors’ caution, as other researchers have recently found. It’s not just that people hate losing money. They don’t really believe that the coin toss is a 50-50 bet. They have a gut feeling that if they pick heads, then the coin is more likely to come up tails. That sounds crazy—it’s certainly irrational—but it’s common because of how people envision the future. If, say, they’re given identical weather forecasts for London and Madrid, a 10 percent chance of rain in each city, they’ll typically think it’s more likely to rain in London. It makes no sense mathematically, but the rain seems likelier in London because it’s easier to envision wet weather in England than in Spain. The more familiar a scenario is—the more images of it that we’ve seen or imagined—the more likely it seems. That delusion can distort judgments about a coin toss. Experiments tracking gamblers’ eye movements show that… ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=373))

- We’ve seen that it takes somewhere between two and five good things to offset one bad thing. It’s not surprising that the results at the lower end of the range come from studies involving money, because in those situations it’s easier for the brain to overcome the negativity bias by concentrating on numbers instead of feelings. As much as it hurts to lose money, you can tell yourself that a loss of $100 is fully offset by a gain of $100. Gamblers routinely train themselves to play according to the mathematical odds rather than their gut instincts. Not everyone can do that, but in… ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=389))

- When money is not involved, though, it’s much tougher to make precise comparisons, and most of the good and bad events in our lives don’t evoke such rational responses.

- Fredrickson developed what she called the “broaden and build” theory: Positive emotions broaden your perspective and enable you to build skills that help you flourish both personally and professionally. The theory became one of the most influential ideas in positive psychology, and the study with the students’ diaries offered real-world confirmation as well as a method for gauging how well someone is doing.

- Researchers kept finding similar positivity ratios when measuring other kinds of good and bad effects. One of the simplest measures—and our favorite, because it was what Baumeister did during his troubled romance—is to count the number of good and bad days. Some researchers have done this by asking people whether they’re having a good day, a bad day, or a typical day, as the psychologist Randy Larsen did in studies that tracked people’s daily moods over periods ranging from one to three months. Besides identifying which positive and negative emotions they’d experienced, people also singled out the best and worst event of the day, and rated how intensely each event had affected them. Larsen combined all these answers to classify each day as predominantly positive or negative. Overall, he found that the typical person had three good days for every bad day. To do better than average, then, you’d want to have at least four good days for every bad one. That strikes us as a useful goal, and not just because it happens to be the same one that the young Baumeister picked when he was counting the good and bad days of his romantic relationship. Since he made that guess, researchers have repeatedly found that bad things are at least twice as powerful as good things, and generally at least three times as powerful when dealing with emotions and relationships rather than with dollars and cents. For the good to outweigh the bad, that means the positivity ratio should be at least 3 to 1, and preferably a little higher. So we’ll suggest a guideline that we’ve taken to calling the Rule of Four: It takes four good things to overcome one bad thing.

- Whether you’re evaluating a romantic partner or an employee, plan on at least four compliments to make up for one bit of criticism. (We’ll have more to say later about how and when to blend the compliments.) You can’t always take the rule literally, of course. It doesn’t mean that you should send four orders of flowers to make up for one faux pas. But it does mean that one batch of flowers probably won’t undo the damage. Throw in some other forms of reparation. Remembering that ratio can help you deal with mistakes in relationships, at work, and in the rest of your life.

- In discussing the Rule of Four, so far we’ve been guilty ourselves of the negativity bias by stressing how much attention you need to pay to your own mistakes and problems. But there’s also a flip side to this rule, a positive lesson to keep in mind when managing your reaction to external problems: Remember that the negativity effect can distort your judgment, and that you can override the brain’s irrational impulses.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You can’t repeal the Rule of Four, because one bad event is going to have more visceral impact than a couple of good events, but you don’t have to make long-term judgments based on those gut feelings. If one thing goes wrong, don’t interpret it as a harbinger of inevitable doom, whether you’re dealing with a personal setback or contemplating the state of the world. Whatever dismal event leads a newscast, on most days there are a lot more than four good things happening for every bad one. That’s why life has been improving for most people in the world. And that’s why, when you lose perspective and overreact to the bad, you’re liable to make things worse. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=487))

- Consider how the American public and government responded to the plane hijackings on September 11, 2001. Until that morning, the best strategy during a hijacking was for the pilot to let the hijacker take control of the plane, because it was assumed that the hijacker wanted to land the plane safely rather than kill himself along with everyone else. That tragically mistaken assumption created a vulnerability that allowed hijackers to crash three planes into their targets on September 11. But the fourth plane failed to reach its target, because the hijackers were overpowered by passengers who’d gotten word of the earlier attacks and quickly realized that this new tactic required a new response: Don’t let the hijackers pilot the plane. From that moment on, no terrorist could count on this hijacking strategy to work again. Even if passengers weren’t willing to intervene, a pilot could simply seal himself in the cockpit and ignore the hijackers’ demands. The one bit of good news on September 11 was that this new terrorist threat to aviation was already obsolete. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=496))

In the ensuing year, millions of them avoided air travel and chose instead to drive to their destinations, resulting in what has been dubbed “9/11, Act II.” Since driving is riskier than flying, it’s been estimated that the switch from planes to cars resulted in an additional 1,600 deaths.

- A coach can try telling himself that the odds are in his favor, but he’s got those images of past highlight reels in his head, so he can much more vividly imagine failure than success—and therefore, as in those coin-toss experiments, his gut overestimates the chance of failure. Even if he went into the game resolved to make the smart statistical play, when the moment comes he’ll be reluctant. He’ll look for an excuse to play it safe, telling himself that the statistics don’t apply here because the other team’s defense is so strong, or one of his linemen is injured, or his running back is having a bad day. He’ll ignore the numbers, send in the punter, and breathe a sigh of relief. Whatever happens, no one will blame him for playing it safe. The power of bad has prevailed.

- When asked how he became the football coach who never punts, Kevin Kelley’s first explanation involves his reading habits. He spends less time reading books on football than books on psychology and behavioral economics. He knows all about the principle of loss aversion. He realizes that the power of bad can make everyone irrational, including himself. Just before he spoke with us, he’d been trying to plug a charging cable into his phone, and on his first try he’d inserted it upside down. “It feels like I do that just about every time,” he said. “I know the odds must be fifty-fifty of plugging it in right, but I would swear I get it wrong ninety percent of the time. It’s amazing how we all think so negatively.” To overcome that bias in his job, Kelley has trained himself to shift perspective. The training and execution weren’t easy, but Kelley considered it a necessity when he became the coach at Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Arkansas. He was supposed to turn the high-school team from an also-ran into a title contender, but he’d be competing against bigger schools with more talent to draw on, and there was no way to eliminate that disadvantage. He figured he had one psychological advantage over his rivals: “I don’t care a whole lot what other people say as long as I think I’m doing the right thing.” He was willing to try something unconventional even if it brought him criticism and boos. Before the season began, he studied football statistics and forced himself to focus on the good things that could happen to a team that went for it on fourth down. It was his version of a strategy that had been tested in some of the coin-tossing experiments by psychologists. As we mentioned earlier, one reason for people’s irrational belief that the odds are against them in a coin toss is that they spend more time contemplating the prospect of a loss rather than a gain. When researchers prodded people to spend equal amounts of time contemplating gains, they subsequently became more rational in their bets. Kelley achieved the same effect by contemplating the extra points… ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=556))

- So Kelley made a simple rule for himself: no punting. His rule allowed exceptions in only a few very specific situations, like the last few seconds of a half when the team was near its own goal line and there was no time to score even if it made the first down. During his first season, the team averaged one punt per game, and then he further tightened the rule so that the team has since averaged just one punt per season. He doesn’t merely go for it on fourth and short. Even if it’s fourth and thirty on his own one-yard line, he follows his no-punt rule. Life is more complicated than football, but this technique can often work off the field, too: Take the decision out of your hands. Instead of trusting your feelings in the moment, make a rule beforehand. A simple rule—if I’m in x situation, I will do y—can help you avoid safety addiction as well as other self-defeating behavior caused by the same failure to consider the big picture. It’s a defense against the negativity bias—a rule that the rational brain can deploy against irrational impulses.

- whether it’s to safety or to a harmful habit, is to follow a rule instead of your gut. When you’re in a situation that doesn’t lend itself to rules, you can take the decision out of your hands by following the guidance of someone else. In those loss-aversion experiments with gambling, when people were asked what bet someone else should make, they made smarter decisions than the bettor himself. The outsiders weren’t fearful of losing their own money, so when the odds were favorable they were more willing to bet, and for higher stakes. This was an important finding, because it showed that the negativity bias doesn’t sway all decisions equally. The effect is stronger for things that matter more to us, like preserving and protecting the self and presumably also a romantic partner or a family member. But if the decision involves a stranger, as it did for the people in the gambling experiments, then the brain isn’t as susceptible. So when you’re facing a potentially costly decision of any kind, you can avoid safety addiction by heeding someone who understands the risks but has nothing personal to lose, like a colleague or a friend or a counselor. In the stock market, for instance, one of the most common mistakes that investors make is to hold on to a falling stock for too long because they’re reluctant to take the loss. This is a version of what economists call the sunk-cost fallacy,… ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=585))

- That’s one strategy to subdue the power of bad: overwhelm it with good. There are various techniques for accentuating the positive, and we’ll be discussing them later. But first we’ll focus on a more efficient strategy: eliminating the negative. Because of that 4-to-1 ratio, you get a lot more leverage by starting with the bad stuff.

- There’s an elegant symmetry to the traditional wedding vows: for better or for worse. But love is not symmetrical, and most of us don’t realize how lopsided it can be. The worse matters far more than the better in marriage or any other relationship. A slight conflict can have ruinous consequences when the power of bad overwhelms your judgment, provoking you to actions that further alienate your partner or your friend or your child. The negativity effect magnifies their faults, real or imagined, starting with their ingratitude, because you’re also biased by that internal overconfidence that magnifies your own strengths. So you wonder how your partner or your friend or your child can be so selfish and so blind to your virtues—to all that you’ve done for them. You contemplate one of life’s most exasperating mysteries: Why don’t they appreciate me? ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=637))

- What mattered was the bad stuff, as the psychologists concluded: “It is not so much the good, constructive things that partners do or do not do for one another that determines whether a relationship ‘works’ as it is the destructive things that they do or not do in reaction to problems.” When you quietly hang in there for your partner, your loyalty often isn’t even noticed. But when you silently withdraw from your partner or issue angry threats, you can start a disastrous spiral of retaliation. “The reason long-term relationships are so difficult,” said Caryl Rusbult, who led the couples study, “is that sooner or later one person is liable to be negative for so long that the other one starts to respond negatively too. When that happens, it’s hard to save the relationship.” Negativity is a tough disease to shake—and it’s highly contagious. Other researchers have found that when partners are separately asked to ponder aspects of their relationship, they spend much more time contemplating the bad than the good. To get through the bad stuff, you need to stop the negative spiral before it begins. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=686))

Negativity hits young people especially hard, which is one reason that people who marry earlier in life are more likely to divorce than ones who delay marriage.

When Baumeister asks his students why they think they would be a good partner, they list positive things: being friendly, understanding, good in bed, loyal, smart, funny.

- There was a dark side to the propinquity effect. When it came to getting along with the neighbors, bad was stronger and quicker than good.

That finding wasn’t such a cheery addition to psychology textbooks, but there is a practical and reassuring lesson to be drawn from it and the other discoveries about the negativity bias in relationships.

- The same pattern holds for the emotional aspects of child rearing. The Yale psychologist Sandra Scarr and other researchers have found that as long as parents avoid being violent, abusive, or neglectful, then it doesn’t matter significantly what else they do. Bad parenting scars children, but being especially conscientious doesn’t reliably make children happier or healthier. Nor does it make much difference during adolescence, as a team of Dutch researchers concluded after interviewing a large sample of teenagers about their parents’ good and bad qualities. The good qualities, like being loving and emotionally supportive, had little effect. What mattered, at least when it came to predicting which kids were unhappy or got in trouble with the law, were bad qualities like getting angry and disciplining too harshly and unfairly. Because of these findings, a few psychologists have been advising parents to give themselves a break. Instead of trying to be perfect, instead of feeling obliged to attend every soccer game and help with every school project, just be a “good enough” parent. Your child will still do fine, and you’ll reap benefits in your marriage and the rest of your life. The good-enough concept hasn’t caught on with today’s legions of helicopter parents and tiger mothers, but it’s excellent advice that deserves to be extended to other relationships, too. Be a good-enough husband, a good-enough wife, a good-enough friend or neighbor, a good-enough teacher or boss. Focus not on achieving perfection but rather on avoiding elementary mistakes, both in your behavior and in the way you interpret others’ behavior.

- Suspend judgment. Being able to overlook your partner’s offenses, imagined or real, is one of the surest ways to stay married. A friend of ours keeps his wife’s faults in perspective by taping a message to his bathroom mirror: “You’re no bargain either.” Others seem to do it automatically, as researchers were surprised to discover by scanning the brains of lovers. The social psychologists Xiaomeng Xu and Arthur Aron teamed with the neuroscientist Lucy Brown to study couples in Beijing who were still in the early stage of infatuation. When these people were shown a photo of their partner as well as a photo of someone else, the image of their beloved triggered lots more activity in the circuits associated with the dopamine-reward system, the same system activated by cocaine and other intense pleasures. But what happened once the infatuation wore off? Three years later, only half of the couples were still together. To understand their longevity, the researchers went back to these lovers’ original data and compared it with that of the couples who would later break up. A crucial—and unexpected—difference emerged: When the people destined for romantic success looked at a photo of their partner, there was reduced activity in a region of the prefrontal cortex used in making negative judgments. Their critical faculties were suspended, and the relationship thrived. This finding was confirmed in a brain-scanning study of couples in New York City who had been married for over two decades. The social psychologist Bianca Acevedo and the anthropologist Helen Fisher found that the spouses who were most satisfied with their marriage (as measured on a questionnaire) showed less activity in this same brain region associated with negatively judging other people. They, too, tamped down their negativity bias when looking at the photo of their beloved. Their spouses undoubtedly had flaws, but their marriages happily endured as their brains automatically followed a principle described by the poet William Blake: “Love to faults is always blind.” Blake’s wisdom has been further confirmed in other studies tracking the illusions of couples. These illusions were measured by asking people to rate their own qualities as well as their partners’ qualities. The most unrealistic couples—the ones who idealized their partners, giving them higher ratings than the partners gave themselves—were most likely to remain satisfied and stick together over the course of the study. And there was an added bonus from this positive illusion: Eventually the partners would come to share this idealized view of themselves. Everyone felt better. If these positive illusions don’t come naturally to you, cultivate them by consciously reminding yourself of your partner’s strengths. When she demonstrates one of those strengths, tell her you admire that quality. When you’re irritated by one of his habits, try to understand why he does it, and look for an upside: Sure, he obsessively overpacks for vacations… ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=908))

- The prefrontal cortex is involved in all sorts of very human, nonreptile activities, such as logical reasoning, conscious thought, and executive control. It can assess the symbolic meaning of events, including thinking with language. It is thus much more flexible and specialized than the basal ganglia or the limbic system, but it can activate those older systems. If a thought—That lake means I’m only fifteen minutes from the suit—triggers a basic sense of fear or danger, the person may react emotionally and irrationally.

- This neural bias also shows up in experiments with the Stroop test, a classic technique for studying the brain’s automatic processes by showing people words and asking them to identify the color of the letters. The trick to answering quickly is to ignore the meaning of the word and focus only on the color, but that’s tougher to do with some words. If you see green spelled in red letters, you have to override your brain’s automatic interpretation of the word’s meaning, so it takes you longer to answer red. The same sort of delay occurs when people are shown words for negative traits. It takes them longer to answer for a word like dishonest than for a word like friendly, because the brain automatically pays more attention to bad traits than good traits. That bias affects their memories, too. When they’re asked later to recall as many of the words as they can, they’re twice as likely to remember a word like dishonest than friendly.

- The amygdala is important for making evaluations, because whether something is seen as good or bad depends on what your wants and needs are. When you’re hungry, food looks and tastes good because it satisfies your desires. The amygdala is involved in unconscious processing but can also be affected by conscious instructions and goals, so its responses can be regulated to some degree. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1058))

- To test its flexibility, researchers measured activity in the amygdala of subjects who were shown photographs of famous people. When the subjects were told to look for positive images, the amygdala was more active when seeing a beloved movie star or Mother Teresa than when seeing a villain. Conversely, when the subjects were told to look for negative images, the amygdala responded more strongly to pictures like Adolf Hitler’s. So the amygdala’s emotional reactions could be moderated by the conscious mind (and the experimenter’s instructions). But the power of bad was still obvious. When the person was looking for bad things, processing of positive information was reduced, suggesting that the brain is pretty skilled at suppressing good news when it’s irrelevant. But the brain is not so good at suppressing irrelevant bad news. It responded to good people only when looking for goodness, but it never stopped responding to bad people. Even when things are going your way, the amygdala keeps looking for the cloud behind the silver lining. Experimenters have found that when subjects make a series of choices that either win or lose them money, the amygdala remains on alert for potential losses no matter how much money has been made. Even after someone makes all the right profitable choices, the amygdala goes on reacting to the threats that didn’t materialize. Some people become sensitive to a possible danger or threat, and their brain continues to sound the alarm at every hint that that danger might return—even though it never does. The normal pattern is for the mind to cease reacting to things that never happen, through a process known as extinction, but this gradual fading out is tricky to manage because it’s hard to tell the difference between avoiding a real threat and avoiding a nonexistent threat. If you fear that Earth will explode unless you eat a doughnut for breakfast, you’ll end up eating a lot of doughnuts—hey, it’s worked so far, hasn’t it?

- That particular phobia may be harmless enough (unless you’re trying to lose weight), and there are certainly other times when it’s useful to have a gut-level fear of threats. The amygdala’s negativity bias is so strong that it remains partially protective even after physical injury to the brain, as researchers found when they posed a series of choices to people with partial damage in the amygdala. Sometimes the choice was framed as a loss: Would you rather pay a penalty of 25 cents or make a 50-50 bet that would cost you nothing if you won but a dollar if you lost? (It’s smarter to pay the quarter than make a bet that, over the long term, would cost you an average of 50 cents.) How about paying a quarter or making a bet with a 10 percent chance of losing a dollar? (Make the bet.) Even with a damaged amygdala, the people generally made the right choices to minimize their losses. But when the choices were framed in a positive way—Would you rather be paid a quarter or make a bet to win a dollar?—they became… ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1075))

- The autonomic nervous system can be aroused by both bad and good things, but researchers have found that bad holds its customary sway. Breathing gets especially short and quick in response to bad things, and the eyes’ pupils dilate, another sign of arousal. When people are asked to guess which of two playing cards is higher, the wrong guesses cause more dilation in the pupils than a correct guess. When there’s money on the line, people become more aroused by potential losses than gains, and this bias is evident even when they’re not consciously fearful. In one experiment, when participants were given a choice between a high-stakes bet and a low-stakes bet, they didn’t show any conscious preference: Their prefrontal cortexes presumably realized that the odds were the same either way, so they divided their bets pretty evenly. But their hearts beat faster and their pupils dilated more when they chose the high-stakes bet and the prospect of a bigger loss. To make the jump from the stratosphere, Felix somehow had to master his gut fears, to control his amygdala, and short-circuit the fight-or-flight response in his autonomic nervous system. He’d thought he could do it himself, but he needed help from someone who understood the mind thing. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1092))

- Taylor later theorized that bad events, unlike good events, evoke two distinct and in some ways opposite responses: mobilization and minimization. Mobilization cranks you into high gear—Wake up and deal with this!—through the unconscious physiological responses we mentioned earlier as well as through conscious efforts to think more deeply and analyze more carefully. Taylor noted that mobilization can differ by sex. Whereas men often use the classic fight-or-flight response by turning aggressive or withdrawing socially, women often react by showering more affection on their children and other loved ones, a response that Taylor called tend-and-befriend. Mobilization can be useful in the short term, but there’s no point in pumping adrenaline and cortisol and other stress hormones indefinitely. Once the shock wears off, there are automatic minimization responses that release endorphins, serotonin, and oxytocin to produce good feelings. Novice skydivers go through a moment of terror when they jump out of the plane, but they’re often euphoric by the time they land. The scarier a horror movie is, the better the audience likes it, because they emerge feeling happy and relaxed. Fortunately for the film industry, this minimization effect doesn’t work in reverse: People who sit through a comedy don’t leave the theater saturated with anxiety, hatred, or depression. The body did not need to evolve mechanisms to minimize good events. Going through life in a happy stupor wouldn’t be a great evolutionary strategy—you wouldn’t see the lion coming—but there’s no danger of succumbing to perpetual bliss, because the impact of good events is relatively small and wears off quickly. It’s the bad event that must be minimized so that its power doesn’t cripple you. Besides dosing yourself with feel-good hormones, you can minimize bad through conscious and unconscious mental strategies. Freud referred to this technique as a defense mechanism, and the idea has held up much better than most of his other theories. Psychologists have amassed experimental evidence that people do indeed deal with bad feelings by using defense mechanisms like displacement (berating their children when they’re really mad at their spouse or their boss) or projection (You’re the hostile one, not me). We’re marvelously adept at convincing ourselves that others are to blame for our own mistakes and failures. This self-deception can be destructive, but as Taylor observed in the women dealing with breast cancer, positive illusions can be quite useful in overcoming the power of bad.

- Felix was understandably skeptical at the pep talk, but this was a well-established technique from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which has emerged as the gold standard for psychological treatment. CBT is essentially a set of strategies for overcoming the negativity bias. It was developed by psychologists who broke with the traditional Freudian method of treating anxiety and depression. Instead of trying to unearth the childhood traumas supposedly responsible for these conditions, the CBT pioneers focused on the present. They found that depressed people suffer from extreme negativity bias in the way they see themselves, the world, and the future. Depressed people focus relentlessly on their weaknesses and failures, ignoring their strengths and dismissing their successes as flukes. They interpret one setback as a fatal mistake and imagine it leading to the worst possible outcome. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1176))

- Bad distorts your judgment, but it can also sharpen your wits. As we’ll see in this chapter and the next, the power of bad can spur students, help adults flourish, and promote the noblest of causes. To use its force, you first need to understand the impact of criticism—the pain it causes as well as the benefits it provides—and a good place to start is with Stephen Potter. Potter was a British humorist with a keen appreciation for the negativity effect long before psychologists came up with the term. He realized how useful it could be—and didn’t pretend to harness it for any noble cause. Potter’s books were compilations of sly social gambits designed to “make the other man feel that something has gone wrong, however slightly.” His 1947 bestseller, Gamesmanship, introduced a term that he defined as “the art of winning games without actually cheating.” He later broadened the concept to the rest of life and added another word to the language, one-upmanship, a strategy enabling the ignorant and unskilled to prevail against their superiors. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1320))

- Potter viewed criticism as an opportunity for one-upmanship as long as it was delivered deftly, in a pseudofriendly fashion. The essence of reviewmanship, as he called his technique of writing book reviews, is “to show that it is really you yourself who should have written the book, if you had had the time, and since you hadn’t, you are glad that someone has, although obviously it might have been done better.” Again, no expertise is required. You don’t need to know a thing about botany, for example, to review Dr. Preissberger’s Rhododendron Hunting in the Himalaya. You don’t even need to read the book. Randomly pick a name cited in a footnote and lament that the author doesn’t give credit in the main text “to that impeccable scholar, P. Kalamesa” (whoever that is). Or find the Latin name of a plant not in the book’s index and ruefully note, “Dr. Preissberger leaves the problem of Rhododendron campanulatum entirely unanswered.” We don’t recommend this approach to criticism—and definitely not to anyone reviewing this book. But we do admire Potter’s insights. He understood the effects of mixing praise and blame better than most parents and executives today. It took researchers a while to appreciate his theory of literary one-upmanship, but eventually it was tested in some clever experiments, like the one in which people were shown a positive book review: In 128 inspired pages, Alvin Harter, with his first work of fiction, shows himself to be an extremely capable young American author. A Longer Dawn is a novella—a prose poem, if you will—of tremendous impact. It deals with elemental things: life, love and death, and does so with such great intensity that it achieves new heights of superior writing on every page. How intelligent does the critic seem to you? How likable? Now consider this review: In 128 uninspired pages, Alvin Harter, with his first work of fiction, shows himself to be an extremely incapable young American author. A Longer Dawn is a novella—a prose poem, if you will—of negligible impact. It deals with elemental things: life, love and death, but does so with such little intensity that it achieves new depths of inferior writing on every page. The syntax and analysis in each review are identical, but replacing each positive word with its opposite does wonders for the critic’s reputation. In the experiment, people who saw the negative version of the review rated the critic as significantly more intelligent than did the people who read the positive version. The naysayer got lower ratings for kindness, fairness, and likability, but he was rated higher for literary expertise. Teresa Amabile, the psychologist who did the experiment, also tested this effect by using two reviews that had been published in the New York Times Book Review—one a rave, the other a pan. Both were written by the same critic, but Amabile disguised that by changing the bylines when she asked people to rate the author of each review. Sure enough, the author of the… ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1331))

- To seem brilliant yet not cruel, you can try tempering the criticism with kindness, or at least the faux kindness taught by Potter. One of his favorite ploys was to preface a negative comment with “I’m afraid,” as in “I’m afraid that Dr. Preissberger’s prose makes for some rough sledding.” Potter called the strategy I’m Afraidmanship and declared it “admirable for showing that you are a nice man.” Once again, Potter’s wisdom has been confirmed by experimenters, who have their own name for this stratagem: the dispreferred marker. That’s the linguistic term for a phrase like “I’m afraid” because it serves as a signal (a marker) that the sentence includes something negative (dispreferred). We often use these markers at the start of a sentence, as with To be honest or With all due respect or Sad to say.

- For too long, business executives have been force-feeding their subordinates the “criticism sandwich.” The idea, also called the “feedback sandwich,” was popularized in the 1980s by Mary Kay Ash, the founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, who advised managers to sandwich any critical remarks between layers of praise. It sounds logical enough, and it makes the annual evaluation less painful for the manager. Giving criticism face-to-face is difficult for most people, so it’s more pleasant to start with the good stuff. The manager goes on at length about the employee’s strengths and achievements before getting to the meat of the criticism. Then she switches back to conclude with a few nice words and end on a happy note—or so it seems to the manager. But that’s usually not how it feels to the employee. By this time all the opening praise has been forgotten. The employee can’t get the bad stuff out of his mind. He’s choking on the middle of the sandwich. A conversation that was supposed to inspire better work has left him demoralized. This problem, of course, is not limited to annual evaluations. It’s one of the oldest and most awkward social conundrums: How do you deliver bad news? When Douglas Maynard, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin, began systematically analyzing this question, he noted the answers that have evolved in folklore over the centuries. One view is found in a joke about the man who takes care of his sister’s beloved cat while she’s traveling. A week into her trip, he calls her and promptly delivers the bad news: “Your cat is dead.” The sister is devastated and rebukes him for his abruptness. He should have broken it to her gently, she says, suggesting he could have first called to say that the cat was on the roof of the house with no way to get down safely. “Then we would hang up,” the sister explains, “and you would call a little later and say that the cat had fallen off the roof and was injured. And then you could call again to say the cat had died. That way I could have gotten used to the idea.” Her brother apologizes, and she continues on her trip. A week later she gets another call from him. “Hello,” he says. “Um, Mom’s up on the roof, and we can’t get her down.” ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1386))

- For praise or other good news to make a lasting impact, the brain must transfer it from the short-term working memory into long-term memory. This process gets disrupted when the good news is followed by something negative. The brain uses so much energy to focus on the new threat that the previous pleasantness gets lost because of an effect called retroactive interference. Just how it’s lost is a subject of debate among researchers; some think it’s actually erased from memory, while others believe it’s still there but difficult to retrieve because of competition from the new negative information. Either way, it explains why people often can’t recall what they were doing just before something bad happened. It’s why so many employees walk out of meetings obsessing about the one or two bits of criticism they got instead of all the praise that preceded it. The criticism sandwich may be logical, but the brain doesn’t logically process threatening information. The power of bad can short-circuit the ability to remember good. When you have something painful to say, you need to take the negativity effect into account—and then put it to work for you.

- When Ronald Reagan was president, he visited New York one day and was cheered by tens of thousands of people lining the streets as he rode through midtown with Mayor Ed Koch. As they were crossing Forty-Second Street, Reagan looked out the car window and exclaimed, “Look at that guy—he gave me the finger!” Koch couldn’t understand the reaction. “Mr. President,” he said, “don’t be so upset. Thousands of people are cheering you and one guy is giving you the finger. So what?” “That’s what Nancy always says,” Reagan replied. “She says I only see the guy with the finger.” No one is immune to criticism. Lee Daniels has directed an Oscar-winning movie (The Butler) and created a hit TV show (the critically acclaimed Empire), but he still can’t bear reading anything negative about his work. He’ll read a rave review and obsess about the single sentence of criticism. “It’s like taking a knife and stabbing you in the heart over and over,” he says. “So I’ve learned to protect myself by not reading reviews.” No matter what line of work you’re in, we recommend using Daniels’s strategy: Let someone else read your reviews. (And make sure it’s someone who won’t let that killer sentence get through.) The rise of social media means that just about every business or profession is now fair game for critics. You can’t ignore them altogether, and you shouldn’t—there may well be some useful guidance from customers on Yelp or students on RateMyTeachers. But if you scroll through all the vitriol yourself, you’ll get so obsessed by the nasty insults and cheap shots that you won’t remember anything else.

- Better to let someone else read through the reviews, pick out the fair criticism, and then give you a synopsis along with some excerpts—a carefully edited mix of positive and negative comments. Your personal censor should be kind enough to follow up any criticism with lots of praise, but also tough enough to recognize how useful the bad stuff can be. “Criticism,” Winston Churchill observed, “is like pain in the human body. It is not pleasant, but where would the body be without it?” Like physical pain, criticism is essential because it focuses attention on something that’s gone wrong and is liable to get worse. When delivered properly, with the right mixture of praise, a few negative words are often powerful enough to correct the problem. Sometimes, though, it takes a more potent form of bad.

- Whether you’re trying to improve yourself or someone else, criticism does only so much. If it’s not producing results, or if you’re looking to avoid future problems, you need to use direct incentives, positive or negative. That means considering one of the oldest questions in social science, and also one of the most dubious clichés: The carrot or the stick?

- So we draw a different lesson from the old carrot-or-stick stories. What they really illustrate is our desire to believe that rewards work better than punishment. Dangling a carrot is more pleasant than wielding a stick, so we tell ourselves that it’s more effective even when there’s contradictory evidence. This belief persists in today’s parents, teachers, and managers even as researchers keep confirming the power of bad in their experiments with incentives. It also persists among another group of professionals, the clergy, who have been conducting a much longer-running experiment in the motivation of virtuous behavior.

- Why did America suddenly get religion? Historians have struggled to explain the First Great Awakening, as they call the revival led by Whitefield and American preachers like Jonathan Edwards. Theories have variously linked it to cultural shifts, social turmoil, and economic fears. But the simplest and most convincing explanation comes from two sociologists, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, who study the rise and fall of churches—and have independently confirmed the negativity effect.

In their incisive sociological analysis, The Churching of America, Finke and Stark conclude that it’s not because Americans are an inherently spiritual people or suffer from peculiar cultural anxieties. The difference is that while European governments have continued to officially recognize and subsidize the establishment churches, the United States hasn’t given any church a monopoly.

- The history of Christianity in America isn’t a controlled experiment, but the data set is impressive: hundreds of millions of people exposed to competing incentives. They must have enjoyed hearing sermons about a kinder, gentler deity, but what actually packed them into the pews were the threats from an angry God. And this effect has been demonstrated in more controlled conditions by the psychologist Azim Shariff and his colleagues.

- In one experiment, Shariff gave students a math test and asked them not to cheat on it by exploiting a computer glitch. Naturally, he’d rigged it so that he could tell if they did. When he looked for factors that distinguished cheaters from noncheaters, he found that it didn’t matter much whether the student was male or female, or how the student scored on a personality test. It didn’t matter if the student was religious or not—the devout students were just as likely as the others to cheat. What did matter was how the students conceived of God. If they described God with words like vengeful, fearsome, punishing, and angry, then they were significantly less likely than average to cheat on the test. But if they used words like forgiving, comforting, and loving to describe God, then they were more likely to cheat. Jonathan Edwards would have approved of the title of the resulting paper: “Mean Gods Make Good People.” Looking far beyond the lab, Shariff compared crime rates in dozens of countries. His regression analysis showed that a country’s rate of homicide (the most reliable barometer of crime) is much less strongly related to the level of poverty or income inequality than it is to religious beliefs, as reported in surveys of nearly 150,000 people in sixty-seven countries. These surveys included separate questions about heaven and hell. In some countries, many more people believe in heaven than in hell—and in those countries the homicide rate tends to be higher than average. The promise of celestial rewards apparently doesn’t do much to deter murderers in those places. In other countries, though, there does seem to be a supernatural deterrent, because the higher the belief in hell, the lower the homicide rate. The power of bad extends from this world into the next, at least when it comes to restraining people’s violent impulses: Hell is stronger than heaven.

- Three centuries after George Whitefield, experimental psychologists had their own great awakening. This was in the 1950s, when the study of animal learning was the main business in just about all American psychology departments. B. F. Skinner’s methods and other forms of similar learning by association were dominant. One of the universally accepted principles was that reward and punishment had to be immediate. To teach an animal not to do something, it had to be punished right after its transgression—within half a second, according to the best estimates of the day. But then a young psychologist named John Garcia reported something strange. Working in a U.S. Navy lab in San Francisco, he was using rats to study the effects of radiation, a topic of keen interest in those early days of atomic weapons. Rats were put in chambers and exposed to various levels of radiation. They had plastic water bottles in there, but Garcia observed that they soon became reluctant to drink from those bottles. He wondered whether they might start to associate the taste of water from those plastic bottles with the sick feeling they got from the radiation. (He himself was well acquainted with nausea. In World War II, he had been a pilot in the Army Air Corps, but he’d had to give up flying after being plagued with motion and altitude sickness.) Garcia started testing rats’ responses to various tastes, sights, and sounds. He let some rats drink sugary water, which they loved, before going into the radiation chamber. Later, after exposure to radiation, they no longer wanted any more of the sweet beverage. Garcia’s findings caused a sensation. Learning by association was supposed to take multiple rounds of reinforcement (the famous “learning curve”), but Garcia’s rats would avoid the sweet-tasting water after just one bad experience. Moreover, learning was supposed to ensue only if the reinforcement occurred within half a second of the experience, but Garcia’s rats learned to hate the sweet water even if the negative reinforcement—the nausea experienced in the radiation chamber—didn’t occur until several hours after drinking the water. Many experts thought Garcia’s results must be wrong, or possibly fake, but further studies confirmed what came to be known as the “Garcia effect.” Rats really could learn even when the reinforcement came hours later—but only if the reinforcement was… ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1633))

- many endeavors, so they concluded that promoting self-esteem would help students thrive. Those researchers, unfortunately, had the causation backward: Being successful will indeed raise your self-esteem, but having a high opinion of yourself will not make you more successful. The self-esteem theory was soon enough discredited among research psychologists, but it has persisted among many educators and supposed experts in child development. The establishment consensus, as spelled out in a widely used guide for teachers titled Best Practice, urges “less emphasis on competition and grades” in favor of collaborative activities in “an atmosphere of friendliness and mutual support.” So children have been playing games in which everyone gets a trophy and going to schools where failure is rarely an option. Many school districts embrace a policy of “social promotion,” allowing more students to go all the way through high school without mastering basic reading and arithmetic. The rationale for not flunking students and making them repeat a grade is to avoid damaging… ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1693))

- esteem didn’t suffer that year. Instead, it rose along with their grades, and the improvement was maintained for years thereafter. Similar benefits showed up in a study of elementary-school students in Florida. No doubt it’s initially embarrassing to repeat the grade year with younger classmates, but then you adjust to them, and the material is definitely easier the second time around. So you get higher grades, feel more confident, and are better prepared for the next grade’s material than if you’d been socially promoted. An unmerited promotion won’t make you feel better, and it certainly won’t help you learn. Nor will an unmerited grade on your report card, but that’s becoming the norm now that schools are reluctant to penalize students. Many schools have eliminated the F grade; some have eliminated grades altogether. And the ones who do give grades have gotten much more lenient. High-school grades have been rising in recent decades—the average is now a B—and it’s not because students are getting smarter.

- These lenient policies have had a relatively small effect on students from affluent and well-educated families, because they and their parents—and their tutors—have been aiming at the longer-term goal of getting into an elite college. They work hard because they know they’ll face a penalty for not scoring well on the SAT and other standardized exams. Other students, though, are being hurt. In 1980 half of college students were male, but today women outnumber men by nearly 3 to 2 because so many males are floundering academically. Teachers lament that boys waste time mastering video games instead of schoolwork, but instead of simply blaming the boys, they should consider the games’ appeal. Players learn by competing for points and higher rankings. Instead of being shielded from failure to protect their self-esteem, they’re repeatedly killed and forced to start over. The penalties enable them to learn from their mistakes and eventually earn success by outscoring other players. If school offered them the same incentives, they’d learn there, too. Boys don’t mature as quickly as girls do, so they’re slower to develop self-control, and that can be especially difficult for boys in homes where there’s just a single (frequently overburdened) parent to guide and discipline them. Researchers have repeatedly found that a single-parent home has more negative consequences for boys than for girls. If discipline is lax in school, too, they’re more liable to struggle academically. Traditional educators relied on clear rules and penalties to keep boys on track, emphasizing competition, not collaboration, because they knew it was one of the best ways to motivate boys. Some American educators have tried similar tactics in helping both boys and girls in low-income minority communities. As schools were embracing the everybody-gets-a-trophy philosophy, these reformers became alarmed by the worsening gap in achievement separating black and Hispanic students from white and Asian students. The gap in scores on reading and mathematics tests, as measured nationally by the U.S. Department of Education, had been narrowing in the 1970s and 1980s but then widened in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, the average Hispanic twelfth grader was scoring about the same as a white or Asian eighth grader, and the average African American twelfth grader was scoring lower.

- Since then, organizations around the world have adopted Grote’s system. This “discipline without punishment,” as he calls it, exploits the long-term power of bad while avoiding short-term costs to workers or managers. Just as the supervisors at Frito-Lay dreaded being the bad guys, no one except a sadist enjoys administering punishment. And sometimes the punishment makes it harder for everyone to get the job done. A threat can be more practical than a penalty, and Grote’s system isn’t the only way to make one. Another method, called “discipline in abeyance,” is to impose a penalty but postpone it. A worker might be given a two-week unpaid suspension but told it will not take effect until six months later—and that the penalty will be waived if he keeps a clean record until then. Instead of being angry and vengeful, the worker focuses on averting a future loss. Ideally, the worker is also feeling something else: guilt, which is an underrated emotion. Although guilt is commonly thought of as a personal neurosis—an internal curse variously blamed on Catholic nuns, Jewish mothers, and Asian parents—it serves an essential social purpose. Most other negative emotions, like anger or anxiety or depression, tend to make people less productive, but guilt can be quite useful, as Baumeister, June Tangney, Francis Flynn, and other psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated. Psychologists carefully distinguish guilt from shame, which doesn’t have the same social benefits. To feel shame is to think, “I’m a bad person,” and since you can’t change your essential self, you tend to withdraw and hide or lash out in anger. In contrast, to feel guilt is to think, “I did a bad thing,” and that’s fixable. Guilt motivates people to improve relationships with their partners and friends by confessing, apologizing, making amends, and reaffirming their commitment. It also motivates them at their jobs. Experiments in the lab and surveys of workers have shown that the more prone people are to guilt, the harder they work at tasks and the more committed they feel to their companies. The results support the management philosophy of one of Tierney’s editors at the New York Times: “Control the guilt and you control the reporter.” That may sound cynically manipulative, and it would be if you were making workers—or friends or students or children—feel guilty when they’d done nothing wrong. But we all make mistakes, and we all need to learn how to do better. The quickest way to help anyone improve is to use the negativity effect properly. Once the workers at the Munchos plant took responsibility for their actions, once their anger was transformed into guilt, they didn’t need to be penalized immediately. A single threat in the future was enough. Grote’s approach seemed revolutionary to modern executives, but in fact there was nothing new about it. George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards knew all about inducing guilt, and they didn’t bother with immediate penalties, either. When it comes… ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=1903))

The ones most relevant to bad apples are the first three, which have been found to correlate with job performance. Conscientiousness is a measure of self-control, discipline, and the willingness to work hard. Agreeableness measures how well you get along and go along with others, as opposed to disagreeing a lot and picking fights. Neuroticism is a measure of emotional instability: how anxious and depressed you are, how easily you’re irritated, how much complaining you do.

- What are the most basic instincts that drive humans? Sex and aggression, Freud famously said, but his conclusions now seem dubious. Some people, after all, lead contented lives without seeking sexual partners or picking fights. While sexuality and aggression are important drives, psychologists and neuroscientists have recently focused on another urge that’s much deeper and more basic. It was nicely summarized by Warren Jones, a psychologist at the University of Tennessee who spent decades studying loneliness. “I have met many people who say they have no friends,” he observed. “I have never met anyone who doesn’t want to have friends.” Psychologists didn’t pay much attention to this urge until the past couple of decades, starting with a paper by Baumeister that introduced a formal term for it: “The Need to Belong.” He was hardly the first, of course, to recognize that people yearn for social connections. Baumeister and his coauthor, Mark Leary of Wake Forest, cited previous observations of this need, including John Donne’s in the seventeenth century: “No man is an island.” (They refrained from citing the more recent observation from Barbra Streisand about people who need people.) But while this desire was well known, Baumeister and Leary argued, psychologists had failed to appreciate its significance as a “fundamental human motivation.” The need to belong should be almost as strong as the need to eat, because our ancestors on the savanna couldn’t survive alone. Staying alive depended on being part of a group, so the human brain must have evolved with innate cognitive and emotional systems that craved frequent contacts with other humans who cared about them. That, at least, was the hypothesis put forward in the 1995 paper, which urged scientists to test it by systematically exploring the need to belong.

- Using these techniques, plus others, researchers have now conducted several hundred studies of the need to belong. They’ve developed a scale for measuring it and confirmed that it’s a fundamental and universal motivation. Every single person of the thousands surveyed has expressed some desire for social acceptance. The good opinion of others matters even to famously solitary souls like the “North Pond Hermit,” Christopher Knight, who shunned human contact for twenty-seven years while hiding in the Maine woods. When he was finally discovered by the police in 2013, he was embarrassed to show them his hideaway because he hadn’t had a chance to tidy it up first. The need to belong is hardwired in the brain, and there’s a clear pattern to it: that familiar negativity bias. Social rejection is much stronger than social acceptance. People who suddenly feel popular, like the students who were told “Everyone chose you,” typically react about the same as, or only slightly better than, the people in a neutral control group. The ones made to feel like wallflowers, however, react quite differently and generally worse. Their self-control suffers, as demonstrated in experiments showing them more prone to procrastinating on work, eating unhealthy food, taking risky gambles, and going on spending binges. They even score lower on tests of intelligence and short-term memory, whereas the popular students don’t score any higher.

- Being socially accepted didn’t make much difference—the popular students behaved similarly to the control group—but the wallflowers became significantly less helpful and cooperative. In one study, the experimenter would knock over a cup of pencils, spilling them onto the floor near the student. The students in the control group and the popular group quickly bent down to help pick up the pencils, but the wallflowers just sat there watching the experimenter pick up all the pencils. That churlish attitude wasn’t going to improve their social standing—it would have been smarter for them to be extra nice—but it was self-protective, just as it’s self-protective for real-life wallflowers to slink away by themselves and for jilted lovers to sit home alone listening to songs like “Harden My Heart” or “I’ll Never Fall in Love Again.” ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2125))

That research, blended with my own observations of what managers do, has changed my view of what makes for effective leaders, teams, and organizations. The first order of business should be to eliminate the negative, not accentuate the positive.” In his consulting work, he has helped companies prosper by eliminating the negative—but he has also found that most organizations still haven’t learned how to do it. The first step in dealing with bad apples is to identify them. If you’re trying to decide whether or not someone deserves the label, Sutton suggests starting with two questions: After talking to the alleged asshole, do you feel worse about yourself—oppressed, humiliated, de-energized, or belittled? Does the alleged asshole aim his or her venom at people who are less powerful rather than at those people who are more powerful?

- Isolate the bad apples. When the young Steve Jobs started working for $5 an hour at Atari, he literally smelled like a bad apple thanks to his fruit-heavy vegetarian diet and his aversion to deodorant and showers. He called older colleagues “dumb shits.” His boss responded by assigning him to work the night shift, an isolation strategy that restored peace in the office. Other companies have successfully used physical isolation: setting up a bad apple in a distant office to work by himself. A more daring isolation strategy, when there’s a job requiring teamwork, is to put all the bad apples on the same team. The result can be awful fights, but sometimes they get along relatively well with one another. Someone who would ordinarily come off as a bully may seem normal when everyone else on the team is hyperaggressive. When the team is composed entirely of me-firsters who assume everyone else is just as selfish, at least they know what to expect from one another.

The Internet has amplified the negativity effect, giving cranks and slanderers and trolls instant access to bigger audiences than ever, but the Casablanca has figured out how to prevail in this new arena. Every night nearly five hundred hotels in New York compete to earn good reviews on TripAdvisor, and every morning the Casablanca triumphs.

- The Casablanca streak is all the more remarkable considering the ingrates who have stayed there. They book the smallest, cheapest room—listed as having just one narrow bed—and then post a 1-star review because it won’t accommodate four people. They don’t bother to open the window and then whine about the lack of fresh air. They complain that the complimentary breakfast is “not worth the money” and sneer that the free wine served at happy hour is the “$12 a bottle variety.” Many are appalled to discover that there is street noise in midtown Manhattan. A 1-star reviewer complained that there were crowds of people near the Casablanca, a problem he apparently never imagined when choosing a hotel that touts its location on West Forty-Third Street “steps from Times Square.” Another critic declared himself “summarily disappointed” to discover that Times Square is “crass”—a failing that he blamed, of course, on the hotel. And then there was the Moon Lady. She checked in after midnight and informed the hotel, for the first time, that she required a room with a view, and not just any view. She needed to see the moon. Since the hotel is a six-story building surrounded by skyscrapers, this would have been a difficult request to fulfill under any circumstances, and at that moment—one ([Location 2256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2256))

- one A.M.—the only empty room was the one reserved for her on the fifth floor. The clerk, who was not equipped with an astronomical chart of that night’s lunar trajectory, said he couldn’t guarantee the moon but hoped the room would otherwise satisfy. It did not. Upon inspecting it, she called the front desk to complain that the room had no windows at all. The clerk, knowing it had two windows with wooden blinds, volunteered to go up and raise the blinds so she could see the windows, but she refused the offer and declared the room unacceptable. The clerk offered to provide her with another room at a sister hotel, but she refused that offer, too. Instead, she took her suitcase, left the hotel, and posted a review on TripAdvisor describing the horrors of the Casablanca. “If this is your first time in New York City and you stay in this motel, most likely you will never return to New York again,” she wrote. “There was NO WINDOW. NO WINDOW in the room, I couldn’t believe it. . . . The closet size room without window is like sleeping in the coffin.” The 1-star review was headlined “Very Dissapointed!!! Don’t Go There!!!” In the pre-TripAdvisor era, a hotelier could happily say good-bye to a guest like her, safe in the knowledge that she would never darken his lobby again. But today guests like her never really leave, not when their 1-star reviews remain for years on TripAdvisor, frightening away thousands of potential guests. Whatever your business, unhappy customers matter more than ever in the online world. They’ve gained so much power that there’s a new underground industry exploiting the negativity effect. Blackmailers shake down hotel managers and restaurateurs by posting a bad review on TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google, or Facebook, sometimes accompanied by staged photos of dirt or vermin, and then offering to delete it if the bill is waived. (The blackmailers know how devastating a single accusation of food poisoning or bedbugs can be.)

- Other studies confirm this online negativity bias: People planning a vacation spend more time studying negative reviews and are more influenced by them than by positive reviews, and people are swayed even by negative reviews that don’t identify any specific problem. An analysis of sales trends at Amazon and Barnes & Noble revealed the familiar negativity effect for both fiction and nonfiction books: A 1-star review did more to hurt sales than a 5-star review did to boost sales. Angry people like Pat or the Moon Lady do so much damage that business researchers place them in a special category of customers—“terrorists”—a term coined well before the 1-star reviews on TripAdvisor and other online sites. Studies of old-fashioned word of mouth showed that dissatisfied customers were more likely than satisfied ones to discuss their experience—and also to tell more people about it. Some of the pioneering work was done in the 1980s at Xerox, which each month asked a sample of forty thousand customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5, with 3 being neutral. The initial goal was to convert all customers to a 4 (“somewhat satisfied”) or a 5 (“very satisfied”), but then the company discovered that 4 wasn’t nearly good enough to guarantee repeat business. Those “somewhat satisfied” customers weren’t much more loyal than the neutral or dissatisfied customers. Realizing that any niggling discontent could kill a sale, Xerox changed its goal to getting all its customers up to 5. It was the same story with car buyers, airline passengers, hospital patients, telephone-company customers, and computer shoppers. After analyzing tens of thousands of their ratings in the 1990s, researchers at the Harvard Business School concluded that the only loyal customers are the ones who give you a 5 rating—and most of them aren’t going to spread the word about your business. Only a minority of the 5s are enthusiastic enough to be “apostles,” as they were categorized by the researchers. You can’t expect apostolic work from the rest of the 5s or any of the other customers. Most of them fit into the researchers’ category of “mercenaries” who will instantly switch to another company if they can get a better deal. Some are “hostages” who buy your product only because they have no choice—and will gladly escape if there’s a new option. Worst of all are the “terrorists,” who are not only dissatisfied but also determined to spread the bad word. Which customers should you pay most attention to? The Harvard researchers, Thomas O. Jones and W. Earl Sasser Jr., calculated that the returns would be meager from trying to woo neutral or slightly dissatisfied customers. It would be more lucrative to concentrate on turning 4s into 5s, and ideally into apostles. But the biggest payoff of all would come from focusing on the most unhappy customers. Preventing a customer from turning into a terrorist would yield a fourfold return on investment—not from that customer, but from future… ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2306))

- Once a bad review is posted, though, the negativity effect can start to skew the discussion. Others become reluctant to praise something even if they liked it themselves. In one experiment, after people gave their opinions of a brief clay-animation film, some of them were shown a review of it on a website and asked to post their own review. When they saw a positive review, it didn’t affect their judgment—they posted the same rating as did people who hadn’t seen any review at all. But when people saw a negative review, they tempered their own enthusiasm for the film and posted a lower rating. They didn’t actually change their private opinion of the film, but they became less willing to express it publicly. No one wants to come off as a naïf who lacks the discernment to spot flaws. This anxiety causes many satisfied customers to avoid posting anything once a bad review appears, and researchers have repeatedly found that the ratings tend to drop over time for a book on Amazon and for other online products. As soon as a product gets one or two scathing reviews, other customers lose interest in posting reviews, and as the online discussion slows down, it comes to be dominated by a minority of activists—the kind of customers who like to distinguish themselves from the crowd by posting lots of negative reviews of different products.

- Online pans get more attention partly because of our negativity bias, and partly because we’re understandably suspicious of positive reviews. We know that the raves about a restaurant’s cuisine or a novel’s prose could be coming from friends and family—or the connection could be even more direct. When a glitch at Amazon’s Canadian website briefly revealed the real names of some reviewers, it turned out—to no one’s surprise—that some of the 5-star reviews of books were coming from the authors. But online fraud goes both ways. There’s a black market in reviewers for hire who will either boost your business or trash your competitors. One ad on Craigslist solicited people with “established Yelp accounts with over 50 reviews” to provide “well-written reviews for a restaurant” at $25 per review. If you’re less picky, you can find online offers from bulk operators who will post fake reviews for $5 apiece. Chris Emmins, a British consultant who helps businesses combat online defamation, identified one reviewer on TripAdvisor who claimed to have stayed in fifty-one hotels in Paris in a single month—while also finding time that month to stay at dozens of hotels in Germany, Italy, and Spain. Emmins further embarrassed TripAdvisor by submitting fake reviews of his own that propelled a restaurant to seventeenth place in the London rankings, ahead of thousands of rivals, even though the restaurant had been closed for months. No one knows exactly how prevalent this sort of fraud is, but it’s statistically significant, as demonstrated in an ingenious study by a team of marketing researchers led by Dina Mayzlin of the University of Southern California. By comparing the hotel reviews on TripAdvisor and Expedia, the researchers noticed a suspicious pattern when there was a local independent hotel competing with a nearby chain hotel. In that situation, the owner of the local hotel presumably cares more about generating business through online reviews, which aren’t as important to chain hotels because travelers already know what to expect from a Marriott or a Hampton Inn. The local hotelier needs to woo out-of-towners away from a known brand, so he would be tempted to arrange for his hotel to get raves and his chain competitor to get panned. And he would be especially tempted to do that on TripAdvisor, because it allows anyone to create an identity and post a review for no charge, whereas Expedia allows reviews only from customers who have actually paid (through Expedia) to stay at the hotel. Sure enough, when the researchers did the comparisons, they found that the local hotel would consistently have a higher share of 5-star ratings on TripAdvisor than on Expedia, while the nearby chain hotel would have more 1-star reviews on TripAdvisor than on Expedia. Somebody was trying to make the chain hotel look worse on TripAdvisor, and the obvious suspect was right next door. In general, the local fraudsters put more effort into boosting themselves than into tearing down… ([Location 2371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2371))

- What’s the secret sauce? Adele Gutman gets asked that question a lot. She is the mastermind behind the success of the Casablanca as well as the half-dozen other boutique hotels of its parent company, the Library Hotel Collection. The hotels in New York, Toronto, and Prague all rank perennially in TripAdvisor’s top ten for their cities, and the one in Budapest, the Aria, took TripAdvisor’s annual award in 2017 as the number one hotel worldwide. So Gutman has been barraged with queries from other hoteliers and invitations to give master classes at trade conferences. She can talk the business-school talk, expounding on “best practices in reputation management” and offering mantras like “Service Is Marketing,” but there’s one phrase she keeps coming back to: “sparkling sunshine.” She says it with a smile and a fluttering of her perfectly manicured fingers to illustrate the sunshine her staff is sparkling over every guest. “You have to double up on the good things,” she says. “If you manage to connect with every single guest, you’ve given yourself an insurance policy against bad reviews because they’re not likely to say something negative about somebody who’s their friend. You have to go over the top so they forget the bad things. I never use phrases like ‘meeting people’s expectations’ or ‘satisfying customers.’ I say ‘sparkling sunshine,’ and our staff gets exactly what I mean.” There is nothing haphazard about this sunshine. It’s a system she developed after taking over the marketing of the Casablanca and its sister hotels in 2005, when they were ranked lower on TripAdvisor. She realized that they couldn’t compete with low-end hotels for price or high-end hotels for luxury. They were small hotels with a sense of style—the Casablanca had a Moroccan theme taken from the Humphrey Bogart movie—but they didn’t offer palatial suites or sweeping views. She also knew, though, that luxury was not the formula for getting to the top of TripAdvisor’s rankings. Deluxe hotels in New York like the St. Regis and the Plaza were routinely outranked by cheaper hotels because their guests expected so much and would find something to complain about. The secret to making that crucial first web page on TripAdvisor was to avoid negative reviews. After studying the reviews, she drew up a list of all the “contact points” between a guest and the hotel, from making the reservation to checking out, and resolved to sparkle sunshine at every point. The front desk started keeping a diary listing every request or complaint from a guest and how it was handled. Gutman focused on hiring cheery extroverts and coaching them to engage the guests whenever possible. The telephone reservation agents at the Casablanca don’t just book a room; they ask why the guest is coming to New York and if there’s anything special they need. From the doorman to the front-desk clerk to the bellhop, everyone is supposed to beam—“Welcome to our hotel!”—and treat the guest’s arrival as a singularly… ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2407))

- Gutman has also created one more “contact point” with the guests by luring them into the lounge throughout the day, where complimentary snacks and coffee are offered around the clock, and there’s a reception every evening with wine and cheese. The point isn’t just to propitiate the guests with freebies. It gives Gutman and the staff more chances to sparkle sunshine and forestall complaints. “When you’re constantly taking the guests’ temperature,” she says, “you can find out if there’s some little thing they were too shy to ask for—something that could be the difference between a four-star and five-star review.” As we’ve seen, listening to bad is a crucial step in overcoming it. Thanks to all its strategies, the Casablanca has maintained a 5-star rating on TripAdvisor for over a decade. Close to 90 percent of the reviews are for 5 stars, and only 3 percent are below 4 stars. While some of Gutman’s tactics are peculiar to the hotel industry—most businesses don’t offer a chance to mingle with customers every day at a wine-and-cheese reception—the basic strategies can be applied in other businesses. Gutman’s secret sauce is a set of techniques for overcoming the negativity bias and the peak-end rule: Focus on making a good first impression. Look for ways to create many more good impressions. (If “sparkling sunshine” seems too corny a mantra, come up with your own.) Anticipate and eliminate any irritant that could become a negative peak. Keep monitoring your customers’ reactions to watch for unanticipated problems. When a complaint arises, respond quickly no matter how petty it seems. Don’t just correct something bad. Overwhelm it with good. No matter how crazy or obnoxious the customer, end on a good note. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2469))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The “end” part of the peak-end rule is especially tough in the online world, because a customer who leaves angry is much likelier to post a review than a happy one. To offset that negativity bias, Gutman sends all guests an email after their departure urging them to post a review, and she subscribes to a service that instantly streams the latest reviews from TripAdvisor and dozens of other sites. Some businesses make a point of posting a response to every review, but the Casablanca usually doesn’t if the review is positive—a wise strategy, according to Chris Anderson, a professor at Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration who has analyzed the effects of responses on TripAdvisor. He finds that hotels improve their online ratings and boost their revenues by posting responses, but only if they don’t overdo it. Potential customers get annoyed—and start shopping for another hotel—if they have to keep scrolling through thank-you notes for 5-star raves. He advises responding to no more than 40 percent of the reviews, and to concentrate on the negative ones, just as Gutman does. As soon as a review for 3 or fewer stars appears, Gutman or the hotel manager will post an online response and write the guest directly. Often the guest will be sufficiently mollified to delete or revise the review. Even when the critic leaves the review intact, the response ensures that their anger isn’t the last thing that readers will see. This particular story will end on a good note. “We were devastated to hear you did not enjoy your one night stay with us,” the Casablanca’s manager, John Taboada, wrote to a 1-star reviewer complaining about street noise. To show how devastated he was, he explained that he’d discussed the situation with the staff and went through all the efforts they’d made to accommodate this guest, like trying to find him a quieter room and offering him a white-noise machine and other sleeping aids (which, as Taboada tactfully noted, the guest had declined). Taboada’s responses can run to five hundred or a thousand words, much longer than the critical reviews—and again, that’s the point. It’s a business version of the strategy we discussed earlier in dealing with a romantic relationship: Listen to the other person, take their negative reaction seriously, and offset it with lots more positivity. By explaining all the details of the situation, all the efforts of his staff, and his new plans for making sure this will never ever happen again, he’s overwhelming the bad and getting the last word. The reader goes away thinking not about the critic’s complaint but about the hotel’s devotion to pleasing guests: They’re nice even to the worst cranks. The Casablanca has thrived by sparkling sunshine even on guests like the Moon Lady. After ranting about the windowless coffin that was her room, she ended her review with a vow: “I will be reporting this incident anywhere I can. This is not right. No tourist should ever go through such experience anywhere.” The… ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2500))

- Pollyanna endures because she offers something valuable: a psychological strategy for overcoming the negativity effect. What researchers call the Pollyanna principle is a genuine insight no matter how annoying she sounds when describing it. She reveals it early in the novel, shortly after arriving at the home of her aunt in a small Vermont town. The aunt, a nasty piece of work who lives alone in a mansion, greets Pollyanna coldly and leads her upstairs, where the girl marvels at the lush carpets and furnishings in the unoccupied bedrooms. But then Pollyanna finds she’s been relegated to a tiny room in the attic. She quickly sees an advantage to the bare walls and lack of curtains: nothing to distract from the view out the window! Pollyanna explains to her aunt’s servant that she’s playing a game her late father taught her back at their mission outpost in the West, starting on the day some donated goods arrived. Pollyanna had asked for a doll, but the only item in the shipment for a child was a pair of small crutches. She was disappointed until her father taught her to always look for some reason to rejoice: Be glad you don’t need the crutches! Pollyanna teaches this Glad Game to her new neighbors, and it promptly brightens the lives of everyone in town. Even the mean aunt learns to smile and is duly rewarded with a wonderful husband. Pollyanna suffers a brief crisis of faith after she is hit by a car and her legs are paralyzed, but then her spirits rally, and at the end of the novel she miraculously walks again. You can see why the movie appalled Pickford and other Hollywood luminaries like the director D. W. Griffith. He called it “the most immoral story ever produced on screen” because of its “false philosophy of gilded bunkum.” But it wasn’t bunkum. Bad art, yes. But as science, the Glad Game’s not bad at all.

- Scholars who pored through dictionaries in a variety of languages reached a similar conclusion: There are lots more words for bad emotions than for good emotions. These negativity biases in language make intuitive sense, given what we know about the power of bad. People pay more attention to negative emotions, so there are more ways to describe them. But which words do people use more often? Here the answer is not so intuitive. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2559))

- Now that the Pollyanna hypothesis has been confirmed—and upgraded to the Pollyanna principle—the next question is why it exists. One possible explanation is simply that good is more common than bad, so we have more good things to talk about. Even newspapers, those great purveyors of ill tidings, turned up quite positive on the hedonometer analysis because the depressing stories from around the world were outweighed by other sections of the paper reporting on athletic victories, artistic achievements, philanthropic bequests, groundbreaking ceremonies, weddings, and awards. As we noted earlier, studies of diaries show that people typically have three good days for every bad day, so there are more good things in their lives than bad things. But the diary research has also shown that the bad days have a bigger impact: If today is bad, it increases the chances that tomorrow will be bad, too, but a good day doesn’t carry over to the next. Other researchers have found that when people are asked about good and bad events in their lives, they’ll spend more time thinking about the bad ones and will tell longer stories about them. As news editors know, people also spend more time reading horror stories than feel-good features. So the mere frequency of good events doesn’t fully explain why we keep using positive words. Given how much extra attention we pay to bad, there seems to be something else prompting us to sound upbeat, as Boucher and Osgood speculated when they proposed the Pollyanna hypothesis in 1969.

- The press has eagerly reported studies linking social-media use to loneliness, anxiety, and depression, but many of the alarming conclusions are based on dubious correlations and problematic experiments. Meanwhile, careful studies have produced more reassuring (and less publicized) results. Researchers have reported that social-media users actually have more close relationships than other Internet users, that many reap psychological benefits, and that more social networking doesn’t lead to more depression or other psychological and behavioral problems. Some users do feel bad, but they tend to be people who were already troubled by insecurities. There’s no doubt that young people struggle with peer pressure and hostility and ostracism online, but they’ve always struggled in the real world, too. After reviewing social-media research, the psychologist Christopher Ferguson concludes that the online harms have been hyped—and that young people are still mainly affected by their offline peers and interactions. His meta-analysis of studies on body dissatisfaction finds that the images on social media have no significant impact on men’s satisfaction with their bodies, and only a small impact on some women: those who were already quite worried about the issue. The lesson is not to avoid social media but rather to use it wisely. Researchers who have analyzed online social norms and users’ feelings find that most people consider it a duty to avoid insulting others while presenting themselves “positively but honestly,” and that it is indeed a winning ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2624))

When researchers at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed the New York Times’ most emailed list for six months, they found that negative articles were less likely to be shared than positive ones. People couldn’t help reading about scandals and shootings, which were often at the top of the most viewed list, but they preferred sharing articles that were cheery (“Wide-Eyed New Arrivals Falling in Love with the City”) or that inspired awe, like a new theory about the structure of the universe.

- The most compelling evidence for Pollyannaism in old age—and yet another blow to the hedonic-treadmill theory—comes from surveys around the world asking people to rate their happiness and their satisfaction with life. Over and over, researchers have found that happiness declines in middle age and then rebounds. It typically bottoms out around age fifty and then keeps rising for decades, so that people in their sixties are happier than they were in their twenties, and they remain happier in their seventies and eighties. This U curve of happiness, as it’s known because of its shape, has been observed in dozens of countries, and it’s been confirmed by tracking people’s happiness over the course of decades.

They’ve used a questionnaire to measure levels of nostalgia around the world. Most people report nostalgizing at least once a week, and many do it three or four times. Whether they live in England or China, people tend to do it more often on cold days, and experiments have shown that nostalgizing in a cool room actually makes them feel warmer. They also do it more often when something bad happens, or when they’re feeling down—and it boosts their spirits, as repeatedly demonstrated in the lab and in people’s daily lives.

- People of all ages engage in nostalgia, even children as young as seven, who like to replay their memories of birthday parties and vacations. But the level varies with age. Nostalgia dips in middle age and then rises again in old age—the same U-shaped curve found in plotting people’s happiness over their lives, and it’s not a coincidence. Sedikides and his colleagues have found a direct correlation: The more time that adults spend nostalgically reflecting on their past, the more satisfied they are with the present, and the more optimistic they become about the future. As people age, they become happier by getting better at reaping the benefits of nostalgia. These results have inspired Sedikides to do more nostalgizing of his own, and he’d like to see more of it in other people of all ages.

- This Golden Age fallacy has been deluding people for thousands of years. It’s the bad form of nostalgia that we warned against in the previous chapter: looking at the past as a better time that can never be regained. The fallacy was formally introduced in the eighth century B.C. by Hesiod, a Greek poet and farmer who has been called history’s first economist. Like today’s doomsayers, he bemoaned the dangers of new technology. He explained that humans had once “dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods.” But after Prometheus stole fire from Zeus, the gods punished this technological innovation by inflicting humanity with Pandora’s box of troubles. The Golden Age gave way to inferior ages of silver and bronze, and ultimately to the current Iron Age, when men “never rest from labour and sorrow.” Soon, things would be even worse: ‘‘Zeus will destroy this race of mortal men.” ([Location 2950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=2950))

We’ve escaped the Four Horsemen, but our brains are still governed by the negativity bias. We react in accordance with an old proverb: No food, one problem. Much food, many problems. We discover First World problems and fret about remote risks. ([Location 3003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3003))

- But after the Industrial Revolution, as democracy and education spread in Europe, a new class of secular doomsayers emerged armed with charts, theories, and printing presses. They’ve grown into an industry of journalists, politicians, and an ever-widening array of “experts” in academia, think thanks, corporations, and nonprofit groups. When something goes wrong, or at least seems to go wrong, they proclaim it an unprecedented threat. They have no patience for analyzing long-term trends, and no faith that people may already have the tools to solve this problem. Catastrophe cannot be averted without the experts’ guidance.

- We’ve called these groups the merchants of bad, but we don’t mean they’re all in it just for the money. Many of them are genuinely alarmed. The most effective doomsayers are the ones who believe their own prophecies. Chicken Little was truly convinced that the sky was falling. The issue wasn’t her sincerity but her misinterpretation of the acorn that fell on her head and her plan for dealing with it. She and the other animals were so fearful of this imaginary hobgoblin, in Mencken’s words, that their clamor for safety led them to seek shelter in the den of the Fox, who promptly made a meal of them. That’s the cautionary lesson from the story, and it applies to the Crisis Crisis. There are a lot of hungry foxes out there.

- Even if the prophets of doom are exaggerating, don’t they still serve some purpose? After all, the negativity effect makes losses loom large, so shouldn’t we take extra precautions even if they turn out to be unnecessary? What if the prophets are right this time? That’s the crisis industry’s standard rationale. But there’s a larger problem to consider: a “social stupidity,” in the words of Mancur Olson. Olson was a brilliant American economist who identified the greatest obstacle to prosperity in democratic societies. He studied collective-action problems, in which individuals pursuing their own rational self-interest end up harming the entire society—a social stupidity. His most famous book, The Rise and Decline of Nations (1982), analyzed the puzzling pattern of economic growth after World War II. Why did the losers, Germany and Japan, recover so quickly and unexpectedly that it was called an “economic miracle”? Why did one of the winners, Great Britain, become known as the “sick man of Europe”? Once the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution, it grew so slowly in the twentieth century that economists looked for causes of “the British disease.” Olson diagnosed it as a hardening of the economic arteries—“demosclerosis,” as it was later dubbed by the author Jonathan Rauch—caused by the gradual accumulation of favors to special-interest groups. Olson showed how countries suffer when groups of industrialists, unions, farmers, professional societies, and other special interests use their power to fix prices, inflate profits and wages, and lobby for subsidies, tariffs, tax loopholes, and regulations to restrict competition. The results are terribly costly to society, particularly to the poor, who don’t have powerful special-interest groups to defend them. But a social stupidity is at work: The average citizen has no personal motivation to battle any single lobby. Unless there’s a major disruption, such as the war that destroyed Germany’s and Japan’s power structures and gave their economies a fresh start, the special-interest groups go on gradually enriching themselves at the public’s expense. “It’s death by a thousand cuts,” Olson explained. “A kind of status-quo bias gets built into society by all these powerful groups. The rules discriminate against new people, new companies, new ideas—precisely where the dynamic forces of a society should be coming from. So a kind of institutional sclerosis sets in, a clogging of the national arteries. I think it’s the single most important problem in societies. It’s hard to see, because no single one of these social stupidities is fatal, but enough of them can eventually do a society in.” Crisismongering is an integral part of demosclerosis, Olson recognized, because it’s exploited so readily by politicians and special-interest groups. They follow the dictum famously articulated by Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor and White House chief of staff: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” Society… ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3144))

- The crisis may not be real, and the solution may not do any long-term good, but politicians are in too much of a hurry to find out. They can reap immediate publicity and other benefits (like campaign contributions) by rushing to the rescue. Whatever policies they enact, the effects will linger long after the crisis has passed. When a nation expands its army to fight a war, the military establishment will not shrink back to its former size afterward. As the economist Robert Higgs chronicled in his history of government growth, Crisis and Leviathan, bureaucracies and regulations and subsidies do not disappear when the a crisis is over; nor do the special interests that benefit from those… ([Location 3168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3168))

- Nicotine has a bad reputation because it’s linked to cigarette smoking, which is rightly feared as the leading preventable cause of death. But nicotine isn’t what makes cigarettes fatal. Smokers are killed by the thousands of toxins and carcinogens in cigarette smoke. Nicotine in itself is “no more harmful to health than caffeine,” as Britain’s Royal Society for Public Health puts it. Like caffeine, it creates dependence but provides significant benefits. Nicotine has been shown to help people control their weight, to reduce anxiety, and to improve concentration, mood, memory, and alertness. That’s why so many people go on smoking even though they know how dangerous it is. Despite a half century of exhortations to quit, at least 15 percent of adults still smoke in every European country except one. The sole exception is Sweden, where the smoking rate has fallen to just 7 percent because so many people have turned to an alternative source of nicotine called snus, a form of smokeless tobacco absorbed orally from a small packet. Thanks to this cigarette substitute, Sweden has the lowest rates of smoking-related diseases in Europe, and it’s estimated that 350,000 lives would be saved annually if the rest of Europe followed Sweden’s example. But instead of encouraging this trend, the European Union has banned snus everywhere except Sweden. How could public officials deprive people of a lifesaving product? Because of fears fomented by an unlikely alliance of special-interest groups. It’s the type of alliance, commonly deployed in the Crisis Crisis, that economists call a Baptist-bootlegger coalition. The term comes from the Baptist preachers who campaigned for blue laws and the bootleggers who wanted liquor stores closed on Sunday so that they could sell alcohol illegally. The Baptists provided politicians with a virtuous excuse for increasing the profits of the bootleggers (and also an opportunity to collect kickbacks from the grateful bootleggers). In the coalition against nicotine, the role of the virtuous Baptists is played by the hard-liners in the antismoking movement who are opposed to nicotine in any form, insisting that abstinence is the only acceptable strategy. The bootleggers are the industries that benefit by suppressing competition from smokeless tobacco: cigarette companies (for obvious reasons) and pharmaceutical companies that sell nicotine-replacement therapies like nicotine gum, lozenges, and patches—none of which has proved popular with smokers trying to quit. This coalition, with the usual help from alarmist journalists, has created a popular conception that smokeless tobacco is dangerous even though researchers have concluded that it is at least 99 percent safer than smoking. Long-term studies of snus users have found little or no increased risk of oral cancer, nor any increase in the risk of heart attacks, strokes, or any other illness linked to smoking. But the fearmongering, plus adept lobbying behind the scenes, has kept snus… ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3199))

- You’d think this development would be welcomed by antismoking groups—and it has been by some—but most of them have developed a virulent case of what’s called the March of Dimes syndrome. It’s a common condition in crisismongering groups, although it’s named after a much worthier institution. The March of Dimes, created to fight polio, did not declare victory and disband once the polio vaccine largely ended that threat. It found new diseases to fight. Antismoking groups and public-health officials are in a similar situation. They’ve largely succeeded in their mission to educate the public about the hazards of smoking and make it illegal in most public spaces. What’s left for them to do now that smoking is universally reviled? How can they attract media attention to a threat that’s such old news? They need a new threat to justify their jobs, and unfortunately the most convenient one is vaping. Their scare campaign has been good for the budgets of public-health officials and activists, but it has been a disaster for the public’s health. Surveys over the past decade show a reversal in popular opinion toward vaping. It was initially considered safer than smoking, but now the prevailing view among Americans is that it’s just as harmful—or even more harmful. Europeans are similarly misinformed. That means that millions of smokers have been dissuaded from making the switch, and many of them will end up in that invisible graveyard of victims killed by the Crisis Crisis.

- We need to close the gap in public-opinion surveys showing that most people are pessimistic about the world but optimistic about the prospects for themselves and their own community. Researchers call it the Optimism Gap, also known as the “I’m OK, They’re Not” syndrome. In America and other affluent countries surveyed, most people expect their own financial situation to improve in the next year, but they’re pessimistic about the economy of their nation and the world. When asked about topics like immigration, unemployment, teenage pregnancy, crime, and illegal drugs, most people say these aren’t a problem in their own community but are a serious problem for their country. They’re much more satisfied with environmental quality in their own area than with the quality nationally, and still less satisfied with the quality globally. Not surprisingly, researchers have found that the Optimism Gap is related to the crisis industry: The more time and attention you devote to television news, the more pessimistic you tend to be about the world. How could you not be? No matter how good your day, roving correspondents will find—or… ([Location 3258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3258))

- Reducing the profits of doom would elevate public discourse, but the merchants of bad will stay in business as long as there are customers. Ultimately, the best way to discourage terror pornography or any other form of crisismongering is for people to stop paying attention. That may sound hopelessly utopian, given the mass appeal of the power of bad and the round-the-clock opportunities for doomsaying. The Digital Revolution has made it easier than ever to spread misinformation and fear, and it has indeed made some people more anxious and angry at one another. But, as usual, the future isn’t as dire as you’ve heard. ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3369))

- The Rule of Four, as we’ve said, is not a universal law of nature, but it’s a useful rough guide. If you remind yourself that it usually takes four good things to overcome one bad thing, you’ll know not to trust your immediate responses to bad events. Instead of catastrophizing when there’s a setback, you can rationally weigh it against the progress you’ve made. Instead of assuming the worst when your partner lets you down, you can force yourself to see it from their perspective or rely on someone’s else perspective. When you do something wrong, you can understand why a mistake that seems trivial to you makes so much difference to your partner or your family or your boss. If you remember the Negative Golden Rule—it’s what you don’t do unto others that matters most—you can avoid grief and save energy. Avoiding broken promises will do much more for you than going the extra mile. Instead of striving for perfection, be good enough. By recognizing the impact of criticism—and the ineffectiveness of the criticism sandwich—you can deliver it more usefully, and you can receive it more constructively, too, so that it teaches rather than devastates. By recognizing how much more powerful penalties are than prizes, you can be a better parent or teacher or manager.

- We hope to see a similar trend in the consumption of information: the low-bad diet. The merchants of bad are no more irresistible than the merchants of junk food. The same basic approaches for dealing with the power of bad in your personal relationships and business—minimize the negative, accentuate the positive—can enable you to overcome the negative bias that skews politics and public opinion. When there’s a school shooting or a terrorist attack, don’t wallow for hours watching the live coverage. When politicians and pundits are assailing each other, switch channels. If you try to follow the Rule of Four by watching four uplifting stories for every bad one, you’ll spend a lot less time on all-news stations. This takes some effort, but it’s getting easier now that there are so many new alternatives. ([Location 3456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3456))

- We share the optimism of Charles Mackay, the Scottish journalist who identified the Crisis Crisis long before we did. He didn’t use that label, but he clearly recognized the problem in his classic book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Published in 1841, it recounted the manias that inspired witch hunts, speculative economic bubbles, end-of-the-world panics, and other “popular follies” throughout history. Mackay didn’t offer much in the way of diagnosis—this was long before social psychologists and economists were theorizing about negativity bias and social stupidities—and he didn’t pretend to offer any grand political solutions. He did not propose to remake society. His goal, like ours, was simply to enlighten each of his readers. “Men, it has been well said, think in herds,” he wrote. “It will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” We’re all subject to the negativity effect. But one by one, each of us can overcome it or turn it to the advantage of ourselves and society. That is how life improves and civilization advances. Bad is stronger, and at times it may seem indomitable, but we’re confident that good will prevail. ([Location 3472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3NHPGZ&location=3472))
