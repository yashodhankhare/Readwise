## Highlights
- The biggest reason for that was our ability to find opportunity in adversity. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=52))

- When it comes to business, Sindhis are opportunity-centric and sector-agnostic. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=55))

- The Sindhis were predominantly Hindu by religion, but some later converted to Islam and Sikhism. There was a time when some Sindhi families promised their eldest sons to Sikhism, who wore turbans in the same way as Sikhs.

- The early perception of the Sindhworki6 who had moved to India and lived in Bombay in the post-Partition days was that a Sindhi would do almost anything to make even a small amount of money. If the shops around sold sugar for Re 1 a kg in bags of 50 kg, Sindhi businessmen would buy 50-kg bags of sugar and sell the commodity on the streets for 99 paise a kg. Their price being 1 paise cheaper per kg, they sold hundreds of bags of sugar, making a loss of 50 paise per 50-kg bag. This amazed others and made them wonder why a person would work so hard to lose money. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=87))

- What they failed to realize was that every time a Sindhi businessman sold an empty bag for Re 1, he made a net profit of 50 paise on every 50-kg bag of sugar. Sindhis were known to sacrifice profit margins for a large turnover. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=91))

- They believed that inherent business sense could be cultivated by practice and experience and not necessarily through formal education. The general sentiment in the community has been that a Sindhi’s purpose in life is to make money. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=105))

- For years, many Sindhi businessmen have felt the need to display their wealth because businessmen require a constant supply of large-scale credit, and that can only be attained by presenting a picture of success and abundance.

- The Embassy Group has made a permanent mark on India’s real estate horizon. It has 1,700 acres of land in India and 37 million sq. ft of prime commercial, residential, retail, hospitality, industrial and warehousing space overseas. As one of the top three real estate brands in India—also named one of ‘India’s best companies to work for’ by Forbes in 2015—the group has earned its place in the business of redefining spaces.

- Jitu’s style of doing business has changed over time. For instance, when he worked with the Garg brothers of Vrindavan Technology Park, who had an excellent property of 106 acres, the value of land was pretty high, and Jitu had to employ a completely different strategy from his usual methods. Jitu needed presence on the Outer Ring Road, and this was just the place. Many companies, such as Accenture, GICs, RMZ and even Blackstone, had tried to do business with Vrindavan but had failed. That only encouraged Jitu, as he has always liked a chase and enjoyed challenges. He decided to buy the property and approached ([Location 2253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2253))

- Blackstone for the capital. Blackstone agreed, but only once all the details were finalized and all the Garg brothers had agreed to sell. This proved to be a very difficult job, but over time Jitu got two of the brothers to sell. One cashed out while the other stayed on with the project and became a partner. The last Garg brother turned out to be the toughest. He was very insecure, threw tantrums and delayed the project. Through it all, Jitu humoured him endlessly, spending time with him and his family, bringing him around finally. That was when Jitu informed Tuhin Parikh, senior managing director of Blackstone, that they could go ahead. When they had to settle on a price, Jitu agreed to what the brothers were asking for without a fuss. He decided it was better to keep them happy than to bargain with them. Negotiating would have got Jitu the land for Rs 25–30 crore less, but he decided he would rather do business with them and retain their friendship since he was in it for the long run. He felt the bargaining would rankle them and they would feel cheated. So Jitu showed them a ‘non-Sindhi’ attitude by agreeing immediately. But he also knew that he had done the very Sindhi thing by thinking long term. The brothers were totally sold on Jitu’s tactic, and that’s when they gave him control of everything, including the negotiations with Blackstone. ([Location 2258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2258))

- Jitu had also locked in the property by buying the Garg brothers’ management company, Assets, for Rs 100 crore and becoming their 20 per cent partner in their main company. At one point the same company had been available to Jitu for Rs 35-40 crore, but his CEO, Gopinath, hadn’t quite seen the sense in buying it. Once all the Garg brothers were convinced to sell, Blackstone decided to come in as an investor. Jitu pumped in Rs 350 crore of his own money, which he had never done earlier. Blackstone only wanted an 18 per cent stake in the project. But Jitu was thinking way ahead. To him, getting 106 acres of land in one piece right in the city was a rare thing, and if somebody like Flipkart rented 3 million sq. ft, he knew he would make a killing. Jitu knew very well that equity is not based on land value but mainly on rental value. Tuhin recognized that Jitu’s way of working was to relentlessly pursue a matter till he got what he wanted. If he found the client to be straightforward, he would do everything in his power to engage him, but if somebody tried to browbeat or bully him, he would make sure to pay him back in the same coin.… ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2268))

- This mammoth development has commercial, retail and residential components. Its tenants are Cisco, Great-West Financial, KPMG, Seagate, Sears, Software AG, Sony-Wells Fargo and Quest. It was developed with green initiatives and won the MIPIM Asia Green Building Award and the Best Environmental Friendly Commercial Project at Realty Plus Excellence Awards in 2014. HDFC A State Bank of India official once advised Jitu that bank relationships are a must because banks are the ‘people who build people’. When Jitu took on the Embassy Golf Links project, he approached ING Vyasa for a loan since its managing director stayed in Embassy Woods. They offered Rs 25 crore, which HDFC Bank countered with Rs 40 crore. His tryst with Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, India’s leading housing finance company, started at that time. Deepak, a Padma Bhushan awardee, says Jitu’s reputation as a smart developer precedes him. His quality of construction is very good, as is evident from his Golf Links property. Early on, Deepak found Jitu aggressive,… ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2278))

- especially because the world we live in right now is uncertain and times are unpredictable. Every IT back office company is worried about its survival because of Trump. Jitu’s diversification out of Bengaluru, into Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune, has been good, and he has shown that he is a true entrepreneur, willing to take greater risks as he grows. Jitu’s track record as a good borrower has prompted HDFC Bank to sanction more and more loans to him. But no amount of persuasion from Deepak, asking him to slow down, has had an impact on Jitu. According to the HDFC chairman, Jitu’s business is 70–80 per cent commercial, and some portion residential. Deepak says, ‘In order to capture the Indian potential, he will have to build more affordable homes because they are the future of India, since the government in this budget has also given proper incentives for affordable homes. The demand is insatiable, and the shortages are huge.’ His advice to Jitu would be to go the Tata, Godrej and Mahindra way, since even they have started building affordable housing. The government has also made the first five years of construction tax-free, and affordable housing is aided by policies such as… ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2288))

Things are going to change drastically when Trump finishes dealing with North Korea, Russia and Mexico and his trade pacts, his fighting of tax reductions and Obama-care, and turns his sights to Asia, particularly India. Diversification Jitu likes keeping his tenants happy, and is known to go the extra mile for them. To manage this side of the business, the group started Embassy Services in 1993, which he has entrusted to a loyal friend, Pradeep Nenumal Lala, who is the CEO. It is Embassy’s own professional property management division, which improves rental values and continues to enhance the long-term commitment of the group to its projects. This company manages everything from housekeeping and maintenance to organizing buses and running crèches across 20 million sq. ft of IT parks, commercial and residential spaces across the country, in cities such as Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune and Noida. Backed by a team of 100 core employees, aided by 3,000 others to whom work has been outsourced, Embassy Services is… ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2299))

- Plans were set up for individual hotels to be built on each Embassy property for tenants and visitors. Embassy Hospitality was created for this purpose. A retired old friend of Jitu’s, Sartaj Singh, agreed to be the president of this company. Sartaj comments that Jitu surrounds himself with friends so that he can work with them as colleagues and place immense trust in every working relationship. He calls Jitu ‘a Sindhi with the heart of a sardar’. Michael Holland, Embassy’s CEO of commercial spaces, has always found Jitu very compelling. He feels Jitu has always had a certain amount of business pragmatism, reaching out to people first and bridging differences, if any, later. Synergy Sankey Prasad and Tuhin Parekh of Blackstone had been colleagues at TCG Real Estate. In 2002, Sankey built two of the first buildings in Golf Links for Embassy. When his project management company, Synergy, was being sold in 2003, he asked Jitu to buy it. Jitu knew that Sankey had done a good job, and knew fully well he would need Synergy for all his further businesses. He agreed to buy it. He was offered a 70 per cent stake in it, and the sellers kept 30 per cent for themselves. Jitu invested Rs 25 lakh with them and another Rs 50 lakh for expanding the company. Sankey continued working for Jitu. A year later, when the company wanted to announce a dividend, Sankey decided to dilute his 30 per cent stake among some new professionals. Jitu felt that if this happened he would not have much skin in the game, so he told Sankey not to deal with his heart but with his mind. Exactly a year later, Synergy brought in Tuhin Parekh to buy 35 per cent equity in the company and asked Jitu if he would be willing to sell 20 per cent for Rs 30 crore. He agreed. Jitu remains a shareholder in Synergy to date, but does not sit in on board meetings. Over time, Sankey has become an integral part of Embassy. Jitu strongly believes that his success has been due to Embassy’s staff, RSP’s designs and Synergy’s ability to build. Blackstone Blackstone as a company is always on the lookout for opportunities for risk-adjusted returns. It… ([Location 2308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2308))

- spending all his energy to find the right piece of land, choosing the right customers and keeping them happy. That was why his partnership with Synergy happened. Blackstone reconnected with Jitu in 2011, when Jitu mentioned that he needed funding for his project, Embassy Terraces. Tuhin Parikh, the senior managing director, liked that particular piece of land and agreed that Blackstone would invest Rs 130 crore. When Blackstone exited, they did so with good returns, but in between they worked with Jitu on other projects too. They reconnected again when Jitu brought up the matter of the 11-million-sq-ft Embassy Manyata Tech Park, from which HDFC wanted to exit. Both Tuhin and Jitu have always connected over numbers, so Tuhin met with him in Singapore and struck the deal. Soon afterwards, in 2012, Blackstone and Jitu joined hands to form an equal joint venture, Embassy Office Parks. The rent from the office parks in the property was enough to take care of the interest costs. Embassy Office Parks currently consists of four office parks and is aiming to take the rental income up to Rs 1,300 crore in the next two years, from Rs 48 per sq. ft to Rs 70 per… ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2328))

- should be taking.’ They always keep their eyes open for the next deal to go into together. In 2015, Tuhin brought in the Four Seasons deal, which was in trouble with Goldman Sachs, with the landowner and also with the banks. It was a messy deal, with an abandoned site that was actually underwater, and on which even the contractors had walked out. But Jitu was by now known for his knack of cleaning up messy deals. He had somehow figured out how he could tap into the highest value of any project. Tuhin says, ‘What I personally like about Jitu is that he has figured out in life what his strengths and weaknesses are, so much so that he collects all kinds of loyal people around him who grow with him, while he primarily focuses only on what he does best.’ Blackstone says of Embassy today: ‘In Embassy we found a partner who is willing to embrace challenges and newer ideas, keep striving for excellence and taking joint decisions for overall value creation for the stakeholders.’ The last five years have been very good for Embassy as a group, simply because Jitu moved to developing office… ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2339))

- REIT One would imagine that Jitu has his plate full, but this self-proclaimed workaholic is now setting up a REIT which acts as a vehicle for investments in real estate. The Embassy Office Parks REIT, a JV between Blackstone PE and the Embassy Group, is likely to materialize in 2018. It is the first REIT in India, one of the largest in Asia (with over 35 million sq. ft of grade A commercial office space) and is expected to set a high benchmark for others. This is also another way for Jitu to consolidate his office portfolio under one vehicle which will continue to undertake large office parks and ensure the groups’ expansion is fuelled by tax-free dividends. REITs have the potential to create a virtuous cycle of lower finance cost, increased liquidity, higher employment, and act as catalysts for commercial real estate growth. Additionally, they serve as an excellent and… ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2349))

- Logistics, Warehousing, Solar Power The Embassy Group has come a long way from its early days, but is also ready for its next phase of growth.* If we are to go by any of the numbers projected in consumption growth in the e-commerce sector ($15 billion) and the FMCG sector ($49 billion), 14 per cent growth in GDP in the manufacturing sector, 8 per cent contribution to the total global agricultural output, 10 million tonnes of estimated shortage in the cold storage sector and 30 per cent wastage of harvest, then we realize the quantum of warehousing services that is required in the country. To bridge the need for warehousing space, Embassy has started developing warehouses in seven key cities across India—Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. The group has acquired 52 acres of industrial land, strategically located in Chakan/Pune (with development potential of 1.1 million sq. ft), 300 acres in Bhiwandi/Mumbai (with development potential of 6.5 million sq. ft), ([Location 2401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2401))

- and 150 acres in Delhi NCR (with development potential of 3 million sq. ft). It has already acquired 198 acres in Sriperumbudur (off Chennai) for two industrial parks, with links to ports and airports. Factories will be set up for manufacturing needs, and 60 per cent of the space will be reserved for warehousing. Plans are afoot for acquiring more land parcels near Delhi. Anshul Singhal, CEO of Embassy Industrial Parks, worked at JSW for seven years before joining Jitu. An absolute go-getter, he met Jitu while selling him a building in 2011–2012. Embassy Industrial Parks was created to take care of the burgeoning demand for modern industrial and warehousing space. Now, with a $250 million joint venture with an American private equity firm, Warburg Pincus, the funding of the project is to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore. It is FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) compliant and there are plans to set up warehouses all over India, for which land has been acquired as described earlier. Embassy will put in Rs 1,600 crore and Warburg Pincus, $1 billion. Big names like Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, ITC, Procter & Gamble and Unilever are part of the deal. ‘A happy employee is not about the salary but all about empowerment, trust and treatment,’ says Anshul. He is absolutely certain that his decision to move companies has been good because there is no one else who places so much trust in and gives so much freedom to his co-workers as ([Location 2409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2409))

- Conversing with Jitu Virwani provides one a lot of insight into his life. He feels he has seen many upheavals, challenges and struggles in his life and career, often finding himself at a crossroads and being forced to make intuitive decisions. But all that has worked in his favour, as he has achieved more than just success in his endeavours; he says he has also achieved peace and happiness in good measure. For the last three years, the Embassy Group has been streamlining itself by hiring heads for each of its key verticals—offices, residential and industrial parks—who will handle all day-to-day operations. He spends most of his time focusing on the larger trends and maintaining relationships with his stakeholders, tenants, land partners and financiers—a long list of people. With an average of 34 million sq. ft being leased every year, the market is ready to accommodate another 300 million sq. ft in the next ten years. There are half a dozen companies in the market today that can provide this kind of real estate in the market: DLF, GIC, Brookfield, RMZ, Prestige and DivyaSree. Jitu also recently bought the Le Meridien hotel in Bengaluru which his father had wanted to buy at one time from a Sindhi gentleman, Pardhnani. Jitu bought all the shares of the gentleman’s publicly listed company, which ([Location 2453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2453))

- has office spaces and a hotel in Cochin too. The gentlemen treated Jitu like a son and made it viable for him to buy the property. In the hotel space, Embassy has also strengthened its partnership with the Hilton by signing a management agreement for one of the largest dual-branded hotels in India located in Embassy Manyata Business Park, featuring the Hilton Hotels and Resorts and the Garden Hilton brands, to be developed and owned by the Embassy Group and managed by the Hilton. This project is slated for completion in 2020. In 2016, Bengaluru saw the launch of its largest integrated master-planned city, Embassy Springs, which is one of the latest offerings from the Embassy Group. It is a 300-acre integrated residential city in north Bengaluru, the new growth corridor of India’s Silicon Valley and the epicentre of the real estate boom in the city. It lies 9 km from the new international airport with great road connectivity, what with an express highway running nearby and having close proximity to the Ring Road. There are plans for a monorail… ([Location 2462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2462))

- either. The other offerings here are a man-made lake, acres of promenade, a road network, green spaces, solar street lights, bus bays and acres of neighbourhood retail. The group launched its flagship luxury branded residences by Four Seasons, called Embassy One, in 2017. This is going to be India’s first Four Seasons hotel with private residences, exclusive retail outfits in the Central Plaza, and office spaces at the Pinnacle. All this is in a 7-acre space at Mekhri Circle in the heart of Bengaluru. Embassy Splendid Techzone, a landmark property on a 30-acre land parcel on the Thoraipakkam-Pallavaram Road in Chennai is also by the group. This is along the lines of the Embassy Manayata in Bengaluru. The total potential here is 4.5 million sq. ft; 1.11 million sq. ft of it to be completed in 2018. The group has also extended its footprint in Hyderabad, joining hands with the Phoenix Group to build parks in the most happening micro-market of Gachibowli, a major IT hub in the city.

Jitu attributes his success to having great instinct and the right eye for identifying co-workers with great business sense. He’s a man tight with his money, who agrees that old Sindhi habits die hard even though he makes million-dollar deals all the time. In comparison with his scale of earning, his spending is limited and he is very careful about it. Even in his busy business life he keeps an eye on his sons’ expenses, knowing fully well when their spending patterns change. A New Kid on the Block Growing up through the family separation, Karan saw his father struggle in the business. But he has also seen the immense turnover his father’s business has notched up over the years. Seeing his father work late hours and hearing the constant business chatter on the phone was like background music to Karan during his childhood. Karan studied at Mallya Aditi International School (Bengaluru) and then did business administration at… ([Location 2481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2481))

He took a loan of around Rs 3 crore from his father at 14 per cent interest to start his venture. In less than two years he returned the money. Sanchez did well due to the partners’ constant surveillance, their good networking and its location. Karan understands that his father has made enough money for the next two generations and maybe more. An ‘absolute beast’, is what he laughingly calls his father. He admires him unabashedly and feels lucky to be his son. It is obvious that father and son share an amazing relationship. In September 2014, Karan started working with his father by shadowing him. He confesses, ‘I did not learn anything much in business school about Indian business. Instead I learnt way more from being a fly on the wall in my father’s presence, being in the actual situation, watching him deal with people, seeing him crunch numbers,… ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0761STYV1&location=2491))

Jitu’s inherent strength, according to his son, is that he is always positive and, like a true entrepreneur, never talks about defeat. WeWork Shared workspaces around the world are making news. New Indian start-ups too are realizing the need for such spaces. WeWork is an American co-working giant, with the largest network of over 120,000 members in more than 149 physical locations in fifteen countries around the world. It had been looking at the Indian market for a while when Karan brought them to his father’s notice. Karan then went on to initiate and lead the year-long negotiations with the group. WeWork met many Indian developers but decided on Embassy Group, as they felt the promoters were culturally aligned with them.

- WeWork Galaxy (housing 2,000 desks) in Bengaluru will be the first co-working space to be started by the partnership. This city was chosen because it is demographically diverse and is referred to as the Silicon Valley of India. This will be followed by WeWork BKC (Mumbai) and then a facility in Delhi. The smart part is that for WeWork it means a low-cost entry into India, as it is not putting in any money of its own. Embassy will invest in the real estate, and WeWork will provide the design, technology and training for a management fee and a slice of the profits. WeWork India is a global company with a local playbook. Jitu is happy that Karan chose something of his interest and sees the potential of a giant like WeWork in the country. When asked why Sindhis do not have big corporate business families like the Ambanis, he replies that except for the Hindujas, Sindhis haven’t really ventured out on account of a few reasons.
