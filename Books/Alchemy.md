## Highlights
- The opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea. Don’t design for average. It doesn’t pay to be logical if everyone else is being logical. The nature of our attention affects the nature of our experience. A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget. The problem with logic is that it kills off magic. A good guess which stands up to observation is still science. So is a lucky accident. Test counterintuitive things only because no one else will. Solving problems using rationality is like playing golf with only one club. Dare to be trivial. If there were a logical answer, we would have found it.

- The mythical ‘butterfly effect’ does exist, but we don’t spend enough time butterfly hunting. Here are some recent butterfly effect discoveries, from my own experience: A website adds a single extra option to its checkout procedure – and increases sales by $300m per year. An airline changes the way in which flights are presented – and sells £8m more of premium seating per year. A software company makes a seemingly inconsequential change to call-centre procedure – and retains business worth several million pounds. A publisher adds four trivial words to a call-centre script – and doubles the rate of conversion to sales. A fast-food outlet increases sales of a product by putting the price . . . up.

- All these disproportionate successes were, to an economist, entirely illogical. All of them worked. And all of them, apart from the first, were produced by a division of my advertising agency, Ogilvy, which I founded to look for counterintuitive solutions to problems. We discovered that problems almost always have a plethora of seemingly irrational solutions waiting to be discovered, but that nobody is looking for them; everyone is too preoccupied with logic to look anywhere else. We also found, rather annoyingly, that the success of this approach did not always guarantee repeat business; it is difficult for a company, or indeed a government, to request a budget for the pursuit of such magical solutions, because a business case has to look logical.

- Here’s the thing. To a logical person, there would have been no point in testing three of these variables, but they are the three that actually work. This is an important metaphor for the contents of this book: if we allow the world to be run by logical people, we will only discover logical things. But in real life, most things aren’t logical – they are psycho-logical. There are often two reasons behind people’s behaviour: the ostensibly logical reason, and the real reason. I have worked in advertising and marketing for the last 30 years. I tell people I do it to make money, to build brands and to solve business problems; none of these are things I dislike, but, truthfully, I do it because I am nosy.

- To someone who is unfamiliar with cryptic crosswords it will seem almost insane that the correct answer to this clue is ‘deer’, because there is no hint of the animal in the surface meaning of the clue. A simple crossword would have a clue like ‘Sylvan ruminants (4)’. But to a cryptic crossword aficionado, solving this clue is relatively simple – provided you accept that nothing is as it appears.

- Most people spend their time at work trying to look intelligent, and for the last fifty years or more, people have tried to look intelligent by trying to look like scientists; if you ask someone to explain why something happened, they will generally give you a plausible-sounding answer that makes them seem intelligent, rational or scientific but that may or may not be the real answer. The problem here is that real life is not a conventional science – the tools which work so well when designing a Boeing 787, say, will not work so well when designing a customer experience or a tax programme. People are not nearly as pliable or predictable as carbon fibre or metal alloys, and we should not pretend that they are. Adam Smith, the father of economics, identified this problem in the late eighteenth century,* but it is a lesson which many economists have been ignoring ever since. If you want to look like a scientist, it pays to cultivate an air of certainty, but the problem with attachment to certainty is that it… ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=232))

- This book is intended as a provocation, and is only accidentally a work of philosophy. It is about how you and other humans make decisions, and why these decisions may differ from what might be considered ‘rationality’. My word to describe the way we make decisions – to distinguish it from the artificial concepts of ‘logic’ and ‘rationality’ – is ‘psycho-logic’. It often diverges dramatically from the kind of logic you’ll have been taught in high school maths lessons or in Economics 101. Rather than being designed to be optimal, it has evolved to be useful. Logic is what makes a successful engineer or mathematician, but psycho-logic is what has made us a successful breed of monkey, that has survived and flourished over time. This alternative logic emerges from a parallel operating system within the human mind, which often operates unconsciously, and is far more powerful and pervasive than you realise. Rather like gravity, it is a force that nobody noticed until someone put a name to it. I have chosen psycho-logic as a neutral and non-judgemental term. I have done this for a reason. When we do put a name to non-rational behaviour, it is usually a word like ‘emotion’, which makes it sound like logic’s evil… ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=244))

- For instance, as the anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu observes, gift giving is viewed as a good thing in most human societies, but it only takes a very small change in context to make a gift an insult rather than a blessing; returning a present to the person who has given it to you, for example, is one of the rudest things you can do. Similarly, offering people money when they do something you like makes perfect sense according to economic theory and is called an incentive, but this does not mean you should try to pay your spouse for sex.* The alchemy of this book’s title is the science of knowing what economists are wrong about. The trick to being an alchemist lies not in understanding universal laws, but in spotting the many instances… ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=258))

- Similarly, if you expose every one of the world’s problems to ostensibly logical solutions, those that can easily be solved by logic will rapidly disappear, and all that will be left are the ones that are logic-proof – those where, for whatever reason, the logical answer does not work. Most political, business, foreign policy and, I strongly suspect, marital problems seem to be of this type. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=277))

- The need to rely on data can also blind you to important facts that lie outside your model. It was surely relevant that Trump was filling sports halls wherever he campaigned, while Clinton was drawing sparse crowds. It’s important to remember that big data all comes from the same place – the past. A new campaigning style, a single rogue variable or a ‘black swan’ event can throw the most perfectly calibrated model into chaos. However, the losing sides in both these campaigns have never once considered that their reliance on logic might been the cause of their defeats, and the blame was pinned on anyone from ‘Russians’ to ‘Facebook’. Maybe they were blameworthy in part, but no one has spent enough time asking whether an overreliance on mathematical models of decision-making might be to blame for the fact that in each case the clear favourite blew it. In theory, you can’t be too logical, but in practice, you can.

- logical solutions to fail. After all, if it makes sense, how can it possibly be wrong? To solve logic-proof problems requires intelligent, logical people to admit the possibility that they might be wrong about something, but these people’s minds are often most resistant to change – perhaps because their status is deeply entwined with their capacity for reason. Highly educated people don’t merely use logic; it is part of their identity. When I told one economist that you can often increase the sales of a product by increasing its price, the reaction was one not of curiosity but of anger. It was as though I had insulted his dog or his favourite football team. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=310))

Being slightly bonkers can be a good negotiating strategy: being rational means you are predictable, and being predictable makes you weak.

- This example goes to the heart of how we see the world. Do we look at things from a single perspective, where you do one thing to achieve another, or do we accept that complex things are rather different? In a designed system, such as a machine, one thing does serve one narrow purpose, but in an evolved or complex system, or in human behaviour, things can have multiple uses depending on the context within which they are viewed.

- If you are a technocrat, you’ll generally have achieved your status by explaining things in reverse; the plausible post-rationalisation is the stock-in-trade of the commentariat. Unfortunately, it is difficult for such people to avoid the trap of assuming that the same skills that can explain the past can be used to predict the future. Like a criminal investigation, what looks neat and logical when viewed with hindsight is usually much messier in real time. The same is true of scientific progress. It is easy to depict a discovery, once made, as resulting from a logical, and linear process, but that does not mean that science should progress according to neat, linear and sequential rules. There are two separate forms of scientific enquiry – the discovery of what works and the explanation and understanding of why it works. These are two entirely different things, and can happen in either order. Scientific progress is not a one-way street. Aspirin, for instance, was known to work as an analgesic for decades before anyone knew how it worked. It was a discovery made by experience and only much later was it explained. If science did not allow for such lucky accidents,* its record would be much poorer – imagine if we forbade the use of penicillin, because its discovery was not predicted in advance? Yet policy and business decisions are overwhelmingly based on a ‘reason first, discovery later’ methodology, which seems wasteful in the extreme. Remember the bicycle. Evolution, too, is a haphazard process that discovers what can survive in a world where some things are predictable but others aren’t. It works because each gene reaps the rewards and costs from its lucky or unlucky mistakes, but it doesn’t care a damn about reasons. It isn’t necessary for anything to make sense: if it works it survives and proliferates; if it doesn’t, it diminishes and dies. It doesn’t need to know why it works – it just needs to work.

- I’ll admit it: I have only become qualified to write this book by accident. I am a classicist, not an anthropologist, but have, almost by chance, spent 30 years in the advertising industry – mostly in what is known as ‘direct response’, the form of advertising where people are urged to respond directly to your advertisement. It consists of well-funded behavioural experiments on a grand scale, and what this teaches us is that the models of human behaviour devised and promoted by economists and other conventionally rational people are wholly inadequate at predicting human behaviour. What are the great achievements of economics? Ricardo’s Theory of Comparative Advantage, perhaps? Or The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by John Maynard… ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=399))

- I’m not joking. I recently had a meeting with a client where I learned that a customer prize draw to win ‘free energy for a year – worth over £1,000’ received 67,000 entries. The subsequent draw, where you could win a cute penguin nightlight (with a value of £15) received over 360,000 entries. One customer even turned down an offer of a £200 refund on their bill, saying, ‘No, I’d rather have a penguin.’ Even though I know this is true, so great is my desire to appear rational that I would find it very hard to stand in front of a board of directors and recommend that their advertising should feature rabbits, or perhaps a family of lemurs, because it sounds like nonsense. It isn’t, though. It’s a different kind of thing, which I call ‘non-sense’. Behavioural economics is an odd term. As Warren Buffett’s business partner Charlie Munger once said, ‘If economics isn’t behavioural, I don’t know what the hell is.’ It’s true: in a more sensible world, economics would be a subdiscipline of psychology.* Adam Smith was as much a behavioural economist as an economist – The Wealth of Nations (1776) doesn’t contain a single equation. But, strange though it may seem, the study of economics has long been detached from how people behave in the real world, preferring to concern itself with a parallel universe in which people behave as economists think they should. It is to correct this circular logic that behavioural economics – made famous by experts such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Dan Ariely and Richard Thaler – has come to prominence. In many areas of policy and business there is much more value to be found in understanding how people behave in reality than how they should behave in theory.* Behavioural economics might well be described as the study of the nonsensical and the non-sensical aspects of human behaviour. Sometimes our behaviour is nonsensical because we evolved for conditions different to those we now find ourselves in.* However, much ‘irrational’ human behaviour is not really nonsensical at all; it is non-sensical. For instance, viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology, the effectiveness of cute animals in advertising should not shock us. Advertising exists to be noticed, and we have evolved, surely, to pay attention to living… ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=406))

- Business, creativity and the arts are full of successful non-sense. In fact the single greatest strength of free markets is their ability to generate innovative things whose popularity makes no sense. Non-sense includes things that are useful or effective, even though (or perhaps because) they defy conventional logic. Almost all good advertising contains some element of non-sense. At first glance this might make it look silly – it can certainly make selling it to a sceptical group of clients painfully embarrassing. Imagine you are the board of an airline and have just spent three hours debating whether to buy 13 Airbus A350s or 11 Boeing 787s, each of which costs around $150 million. At the end of the meeting, you are presented with an idea for an advertising campaign that does not show an aircraft at all, but instead proposes to focus on the cucumber sandwiches and scones that might be served on board. This is non-sense – however, around 90 per cent of people have no idea what sort of aircraft they are travelling on or how a jet engine works but will infer a great deal about the safety and quality of the experience offered by an airline from the care and attention it pays to on-board snacks.* Presenting such things in a business setting packed with MBA graduates is slightly embarrassing; you start to envy people in IT or tax-planning, who can go into a meeting with rational proposals on a chart or spreadsheet. However, this fixation with sense-making can prove expensive. Imagine you are a company whose product is not selling well. Which of the following proposals would be easier to make in a board meeting called to resolve the problem? a) ‘We should reduce the price’ or b) ‘We should feature more ducks in our advertising’. The first, of course – and yet the second could, in fact, be much more profitable. This is a book written in defence of things that don’t quite make sense, but it is also a book that – conversely – attacks our fetishisation of things that do. Once you accept that there may be a value or purpose to things that are hard to justify, you will naturally come to another conclusion: that it is perfectly possible to be both rational and wrong. Logical ideas often fail because logic demands universally applicable laws but humans, unlike atoms, are not consistent enough in their behaviour for such laws to hold very broadly. For example, to the despair of utilitarians, we are not remotely consistent in whom we choose to help or cooperate with. Imagine that you get into financial trouble and ask a rich friend for a loan of £5,000, who patiently explains that you are a much less needy and deserving case for support than a village in Africa to which he plans to donate the same amount. Your friend is behaving perfectly rationally. Unfortunately he is no longer your friend. It is impossible for human relations to work unless we accept that our obligations to some people will always exceed our obligations to others. Universal ideas like… ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=457))

- Does a tax rise cause you to work less because the returns for your labour are lower, or does it cause you to work harder, in order to maintain your present level of disposable wealth? It kind of depends. Logic requires that people find universal laws, but outside of scientific fields, there are fewer of these than we might expect. And once human psychology has a role to play, it is perfectly possible for behaviour to become entirely contradictory. For instance, there are two equally potent, but completely contradictory, ways to sell a product: ‘Not many people own one of these, so it must be good’ and ‘Lots of people already own one of these, so it must be good.’ As the brilliant Robert Cialdini highlights in Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, the principles of selling and behaviour change are imbued with contradictions. On the one hand, luxury goods would be destroyed if they were too widespread – no one would want a designer bag that was owned by five million other people.* On the other hand, many foodstuffs seem to be popular only because they are popular. I have always been puzzled by the popularity of miso soup. Imagine if it did not exist, but one day my daughter brought me a bowl of it: ‘Look, Dad, I’ve just invented a new soup.’ After removing the strange green leafy thing from it and taking a sip, would I really say, ‘Wow, call Heinz immediately, we’re onto a winner here’? I doubt it. A more likely reaction would be ‘Hmm, don’t give up the day job.’ Yet millions of people* drink this peculiar substance every week – we like it because it’s popular in Japan. Scarcity and ubiquity can both matter, depending on the context. While in physics the opposite of a good idea is generally a bad idea, in psychology the opposite of a good idea can be a very good idea indeed: both opposites often work. I was once asked to improve a two-page letter selling an insurance product. Paragraphs had gradually been added, each of which seemed to improve the response to it – the number of sales had gradually increased. How could I improve the letter? I suggested that it be rewritten so that it contained no more than seven or eight lines of text. My reasoning? It was an inexpensive and sensible product, being sold by a financial company with whom the customer already had a relationship. My argument was that this simple product could be explained and understood quickly. A short letter would convey that this was a no-brainer. The existing letter, which had grown to a disproportionate length, was in danger of creating confusion* – if this product was as simple and sensible as it really seemed, why were they selling it so hard? We tested a two-paragraph letter. Fortunately, I was right. What had emerged was that there were two ways to sell this product: with a very long letter – which was reassuring because it was long, and with a very short letter – which was reassuring because it was very short. The two categories of retailer who have weathered the global… ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=497))

- People are highly contradictory. The situation or place in which we find ourselves may completely change our perception and judgement. As a good illustration of this, one reliable way to lose money is to go on holiday to some exotic locale, fall in love with the local speciality alcoholic drink and decide to import it to your home country. I once heard of someone who fell in love with a banana liqueur in the Caribbean and bought the right to sell it in the UK. On returning home with his suitcase half full of the stuff, he opened a bottle in his kitchen, hoping to impress his friends with his astute decision. Everyone, including him, found the drink practically vomit-inducing; it had only tasted good when he was in the Caribbean.* Our very perception of the world is affected by context, which is why the rational attempt to contrive universal, context-free laws for human behaviour may be largely doomed.* ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=534))

- Why is this? In his book Skin in the Game (2018), Taleb includes what might be the most interesting quotation on an individual’s politics I have ever read. Someone* explains how, depending on context, he has entirely different political preferences: ‘At the federal level I am a Libertarian. At the state level, I am a Republican. At the town level, I am a Democrat. In my family I am a socialist. And with my dog I am a Marxist – from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.’ In solving political disputes ‘rationally’ we are assuming that people interact with all other people in the same way, independent of context, but we don’t.

- With just a few lessons from behavioural economics and a bit of evolutionary psychology, you’ll soon see where this logical worldview comes dangerously unstuck. Meanwhile your finance director, lovely guy though he may be, hates experiments involving alchemy because alchemy works erratically; he prefers small certain gains to those which on average will be higher but where the payoff is hard to calculate in advance.* However, this natural human love of certainty may also prevent businesses from making more valuable discoveries. After all, no big business idea makes sense at first. I mean, just imagine proposing the following ideas to a group of sceptical investors: ‘What people want is a really cool vacuum cleaner.’ (Dyson) ‘. . . and the best part of all this is that people will write the entire thing for free!’ (Wikipedia) ‘. . . and so I confidently predict that the great enduring fashion of the next century will be a coarse, uncomfortable fabric which fades unpleasantly and which takes ages to dry.

- No sane person would have invested a penny in these schemes. The problem that bedevils organisations once they reach a certain size* is that narrow, conventional logic is the natural mode of thinking for the risk-averse bureaucrat or executive. There is a simple reason for this: you can never be fired for being logical. If your reasoning is sound and unimaginative, even if you fail, it is unlikely you will attract much blame. It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative. The fatal issue is that logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors. At Ogilvy, I founded a division that employs psychology graduates to look at behavioural change problems through a new lens. Our mantra is ‘Test counterintuitive things, because no one else ever does.’ Why is this necessary? In short, the world runs on two operating systems. The much smaller of them runs on conventional logic. If you are building a bridge or building a road, there is a definition of success that is independent of perception. Will it safely take the weight of X vehicles weighing Y kg and travelling at Z mph? Success can be defined entirely in terms of objective scientific units, with no allowance for human subjectivity.* ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=586))

- So there are logical problems, such as building a bridge. And there are psycho-logical ones: whether to paint the lines on the road or not. The rules for solving both are different; just as I make a distinction between nonsense and non-sense, I also use a hyphen to distinguish between logical and psycho-logical thinking. The logical and the psycho-logical approaches run on different operating systems and require different software, and we need to understand both. Psycho-logic isn’t wrong, but it cares about different things and works in a different way to logic. Because logic is self-explanatory, our preference is to use it in all social and institutional settings, even where it has no place. The result is that we end up using inappropriate software for the operating system, neglecting the psycho-logical approach.

- To understand this book you have to realise that there is a duality in the human brain that is rather similar to the relationship between the logic of the GPS and the wider wisdom of the driver, between logic and psycho-logic. There is the unambiguously ‘right’ answer, where certainty is achieved by limiting the number of data points considered. The downside of this is that, in the wrong context, it can be hopelessly wrong. Then there is the pretty good judgement of psycho-logic, which considers a far wider range of factors to arrive at a not-perfect-but-rarely-stupid conclusion. The credibility we should attach to these two modes of thinking varies according to context. Sometimes it is best to obey your GPS slavishly, but at other times you should ignore it completely and use the wider parameters of judgement. Once again, the reason we don’t always obey our GPS is not because we are wrong: it is because there are important factors in our journey-planning that the GPS is completely ignorant of. A lot of supposed ‘irrationality’ can be explained by this. The reason we don’t always behave in a way which corresponds with conventional ideas of rationality is not because we are silly: it is because we know more than we know we know. I did not decide to travel to the airport by back roads because I had calculated the level of variance in journey time – I did it instinctively, and was only aware of my unconscious reasoning in retrospect. ‘The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing,’ as Pascal put it.* ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=649))

- Just as your GPS has not yet been configured to understand a wider set of human motivations, our conscious brain has not evolved to be aware of many of the instinctive factors that drive our actions. A fascinating theory, first proposed by the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers and later supported by the evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban, explains that we do not have full access to the reasons behind our decision-making because, in evolutionary terms, we are better off not knowing; we have evolved to deceive ourselves, in order that we are better at deceiving others. Just as there are words that are best left unspoken, so there are feelings that are best left unthought.* The theory is that if all our unconscious motivations were to impinge on our consciousness, subtle cues in our behaviour might reveal our true motivation, which would limit our social and reproductive prospects. Robert Trivers gives an extraordinary example of a case where an animal having conscious access to its own actions may be damaging to its evolutionary fitness. When a hare is being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random and not conscious, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer. Over time, dogs would learn to anticipate these cues – with fatal consequences. Those hares with more self-awareness would tend to die out, so most modern hares are probably descended from those that had less self-knowledge. In the same way, humans may be descended from ancestors who were better at the concealment of their true motives. It is not enough to conceal them from others – to be really convincing, you also have to conceal them from yourself. I think Robert Trivers is right in his theory of self-deception; if he were not, our job as advertisers would be much easier than it is. We could just ask people why they did things or whether they would buy them, and they would reply honestly: ‘No I wouldn’t normally pay $4.65 for a coffee, but if you put a fancy green logo on a paper cup so I could display it to everybody as I walk into the office then I might just be interested . . .’ In reality, no one will ever tell you that. The late David Ogilvy, one of the greats of the American advertising industry and the founder of the company I work for, apparently once said, ‘The trouble with market research is that people don’t think what they feel, they don’t say what they think, and they don’t do what they say.’* Trivers and Kurzban explained the evolutionary science behind that conundrum: we simply don’t have access to our genuine motivations, because it is not in our interest to know. Here’s Ogilvy’s contemporary, Bill Bernbach: ‘Human nature hasn’t changed for a million years. It won’t even change in the next million years.

- What we think about how we feel may have little to do with our real reasons for feeling it, so it pays often to ask naïve questions to which the answers seem completely self-evident. ‘Why do people go to restaurants?’, say. ‘Because they are hungry,’ comes the answer. But if you think about it a little, someone merely hungry could satisfy their urge to eat far more economically elsewhere. Restaurants are only peripherally about food: their real value lies in social connection, and status.* ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=727))

- For the last fifty years or so, most issues involving human behaviour or decision-making have been solved by looking through what I call ‘regulation-issue binoculars’. These have two lenses – market research and economic theory – that together are supposed to provide a complete view of human motivation. There’s only one problem: the binoculars are broken. Both the lenses are pretty badly cracked, and they distort our view of every issue. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=786))

- The first lens is market research or, to give it a simpler name, asking people. However, the problem with it is that, if we remember David Ogilvy’s words: ‘The trouble with market research is that people don’t think what they feel, they don’t say what they think, and they don’t do what they say.’ People simply do not have introspective access to their motivations. The second lens is standard economic theory, which doesn’t ask people what they do and doesn’t even observe what they do. Instead it assumes a narrow and overly ‘rationalistic’ view of human motivation, by focusing on a theoretical, one-dimensional conception of what it believes humans are trying to do. Again, behavioural economics has shown that it provides an incomplete and sometimes misleading view of human behaviour – neither the business nor the policy worlds have paid sufficient attention to the failings of economics and research. Why might this be? Generally, it is safe for anyone making business or policy decisions to act as though everything seen through these binoculars is accurate – not least because everyone else they work with – and everyone who might hire, promote or fire them – sees the world through the same binoculars.

People may be accurate commentators on their emotional state, but the causes of that emotional state (in this case, uncertainty) are often a complete mystery to them. If the experiment works, and early indications are positive, we have performed a form of alchemy, using psycho-logic to conjure up value from nowhere. Experimentation is the only reliable way of testing, so we measure the effect of engineers’ texts on customer satisfaction against a control group who receive no such early warning.

- As Nassim Nicholas Taleb remarks, ‘There is no such thing as a rational or irrational belief – there is only rational or irrational behaviour.’ And the best way for evolution to encourage or prevent a behaviour is to attach an emotion to it. Sometimes the emotion is not appropriate – for instance, there is no reason for Brits to be afraid of spiders, since there are no poisonous spiders in the UK – but it’s still there, just in case. And why take the risk? Other than in a few specialist jobs in zoos, there’s not much to be gained from not being afraid of spiders. So, as with tooth brushing, behaviours which have a rationally beneficial outcome do not have to be driven by a rational motivation. Cleaning our teeth is good for dental health even if we do it for reasons of vanity. As far as evolution is concerned, if a behaviour is beneficial, we can attach any reason to it that we like.

- If you confine yourself to using rational arguments to encourage rational behaviour, you will be using only a tiny proportion of the tools in your armoury. Logic demands a direct connection between reason and action, but psycho-logic doesn’t. This is important, because it means that, if we wish people to behave in an environmentally conscious way, there are other tools we can use other than an appeal to reason or duty. Similarly, if we wish to discourage people from drink-driving, we do not have to rely solely on rational arguments; if that approach does not work – and often it doesn’t – there is a whole other set of emotional levers we can pull to achieve the same effect. Just ask the 1920s ad industry. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=1105))

- Imagine you are climbing a large mountain that has never been climbed before. From the bottom, it is impossible to tell which slopes are passable, because much of the terrain is hidden behind the lower foothills. Your climb involves a great deal of trial and error: routes are tried and abandoned; there is frequent backtracking and traversing. Many of the decisions you take may be based on little other than instinct or good fortune. But eventually you do make it to the summit, and once you are there, the ideal route is apparent. You can look down and see what would have been the best path to have taken, and that now becomes ‘the standard route’. When you describe the route you took to your mountaineering friends, you pretend it was the route you took all along: with the benefit of hindsight, you declare that you simply chose that route through good judgement.

- Is this a lie? Well, yes and no.* It may be that, in the course of your climb, you did end up at various times covering most or all of the optimal route.* What you say is also true in so far as it confirms that there is a navigable pathway to the top, which you did not know for sure when you first attempted the climb. And the route you describe does exist, so in that sense your description of the climb is perfectly accurate. However, in one respect it is a monstrous lie, because it completely misrepresents the process by which you progressed to the top. It pays an undue tribute to rational decision-making, optimisation and sequential logic – a tribute that really should be laid at the altar of trial and error, good instincts, and luck.* ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=1549))

- The reason the alchemists gave up in the Middle Ages was because they were looking at the problem the wrong way – they had set themselves the impossible task of trying to turn lead into gold, but had got it into their heads that the value of something lies solely in what it is. This was a false assumption, because you don’t need to tinker with atomic structure to make lead as valuable as gold – all you need to do is to tinker with human psychology so that it feels as valuable as gold. At which point, who cares that it isn’t actually gold? If you think that’s impossible, look at the paper money in your wallet or purse; the value is exclusively psychological. Value resides not in the thing itself, but in the minds of those who value it. You can therefore create (or destroy) value it in two ways – either by changing the thing or by changing minds about what it is.

A great deal of the effectiveness of advertising derives from its power to direct attention to favourable aspects of an experience, in order to change the experience for the better. Strangely, there is one form of enhancement to a menu that seems to be the kiss of death: adding photographs of dishes to a menu seems to heavily limit what you can charge for them. Opinion is divided on why. Some people think that the practice is strongly associated with downmarket restaurants, while others believe that attractive photographs may raise expectations too high, leading to inevitable disappointment when the real food arrives. It is certainly interesting to me that many cult burger restaurants, including Five Guys and In-N-Out, have simple textual menus and no photographs, while McDonald’s uses photographs on its LCD screens extensively.

And then there is the ‘local pub’ approach, where you may make less money from people on each visit, but where you will profit more over time by encouraging them to come back. The second type of business is much more likely to generate trust than the first. How might we distinguish the second type of business from the first? Well, the scoop of extra fries you get at Five Guys is one such gesture – an immediate (if modest) expense with a deferred pay off, and a reliable signifier that the business is investing in a repeat relationship and not milking a single transaction.

This explains why working with an advertising agency can be frustrating: it is difficult to produce good advertising, but good advertising is only good because it is difficult to produce. The potency and meaningfulness of communication is in direct proportion to the costliness of its creation – the amount of pain, effort, talent (or failing that, expensive celebrities or pricey TV airtime) consumed in its creation and distribution.

- Quite simply, all powerful messages must contain an element of absurdity, illogicality, costliness, disproportion, inefficiency, scarcity, difficulty or extravagance – because rational behaviour and talk, for all their strengths, convey no meaning. When Nike chose to use Colin Kaepernick, the American football player who had instigated the practice of kneeling rather than standing for the US national anthem before games, as the figurehead for their 2018 campaign, it was an example of a kind of costliness through bravery. He was not an expensive choice – his career was in limbo – but he was a brave one, since he was so closely identified with the NFL protests against police brutality. As this campaign demonstrated, meaning is conveyed by the things we do that are not in our own short-term self-interest – by the costs that we incur and the risks we take.

- And to make such calculations we use mental processes, which take place beyond the reach of conscious awareness. We draw unconscious inferences from environmental cues everywhere we go, without having the slightest awareness that we are doing so – it is thinking without thinking that we are thinking. These mental processes are psycho-logical rather than conventionally logical, and rely on a different set of rules to those we adopt when we use conscious reasoning, but they are not necessarily irrational, given the conditions under which our brains have evolved. Our brains did not evolve to make perfect decisions using mathematical precision – there wasn’t much call for this kind of thing on the African savannah. Instead we have developed the ability to arrive at pretty good, non-catastrophic decisions based on limited, non-numerical information, some of which may be deceptive. Far from being irrational, the inferences we are able to draw just from seeing chairs outside a café are surprisingly clever, once you uncover the reasoning behind them.

- Having worked in advertising for over 25 years, usually for large companies with big budgets, it still fascinates me how great an effect unconscious signalling can have on the fortunes of a tiny business. And more than that, it frightens me to think how many perfectly worthwhile businesses have failed that might not have done if they’d implemented a few trivial signals.* Relatively small businesses that might not be able to afford to advertise in any conventional sense, could transform their fortunes by paying a little attention to the workings of psycho-logic. The trick involves simply understanding the wider behavioural system within which they operate. Cafés could boost sales by improving their menu design. Many small shops are inadequately lit, and so passers-by assume they are closed – how much business do they lose as a result?* Pubs are often needlessly intimidating because their windows are made of frosted glass, preventing people from looking inside before entering. Pizza delivery firms could differentiate themselves in a crowded market by agreeing to deliver tea, coffee, milk and toilet paper alongside a pizza. Restaurants might increase sales by allowing the kerbside collection of take-away meals – or by adding a sign which says ‘parking at rear’.* ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2271))

- I will now take my idea one step further. Not only would we reliably infer from the presence of tables and chairs that the café is open, I also believe we go deeper still – I think we subliminally deduce that any place that goes to the trouble of erecting chairs on the street will serve coffee that, at the very least, is unlikely to be terrible. That seems a silly use of mental energy – surely the way to determine whether the coffee is good is to buy one and find out?

- However, the theory of sexual selection was a truly extraordinary, outside-the-box idea, and it still is; once you understand it, a whole host of behaviours that were previously baffling or seemingly irrational suddenly make perfect sense. The ideas that emerge from sexual selection theory explain not only natural anomalies such as the peacock’s tail, but also the popularity of many seemingly insane human behaviours and tastes, from the existence of Veblen goods* such as caviar, to more mundane absurdities such as the typewriter.

- The tension between sexual and natural selection – and the interplay between them – may be the really big story here. Many innovations would not have got off the ground without the human instinct for status-signalling,* so might it be the same in nature? In other words, as Geoffrey Miller says, might sexual selection provide the ‘early stage funding’ for nature’s best experiments? For example, might the sexual signalling advantages of displaying an increasing amount of plumage on a bird’s sides* have made it possible for them to fly? The human brain’s capacity to handle a vast vocabulary may have arisen more for the purposes of seduction than anything else – but it also made it possible for you to read this sentence. Most people will avoid giving credit to sexual selection where they possibly can because, when it works, sexual selection is called natural selection. Why is there a reluctance to accept that life is not just a narrow pursuit of greater efficiency and that there is room for opulence and display as well? Yes, costly signalling can lead to economic inefficiency, but at the same time this inefficiency establishes valuable social qualities such as trustworthiness and commitment – politeness and good manners are costly signalling in a face-to-face form. Why are people happy with the idea that nature has an accounting function, but much less comfortable with the idea that it also has a marketing function? Should we despise flowers because they are less efficient than grasses? Even Darwin’s great contemporary and collaborator Wallace hated the idea of sexual selection; for some reason, it sits in the category of ideas that most people – and especially intellectuals – simply do not want to believe.

- First of all, you didn’t know which one to buy – some had lights or Bluetooth speakers,* some had larger wheels and some had a higher or lower price. And in the absence of recognisable brands, it was impossible to make sense of the category – as neuroscientists have observed, we don’t so much choose brands as use them to aid choice. And when a choice baffles us, we take the safe default option – which is to do nothing at all. ([Location 2501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2501))

- Secondly, we felt uneasy buying something that cost a few hundred pounds without the reassurance of a recognisable name. British ad-man Robin Wight calls this instinct ‘the Reputation Reflex’ – although instinctive and largely unconscious, it is perfectly rational, because we intuitively understand that someone with a reputable brand identity has more to lose from selling a bad product than someone with no reputation at risk.* Finally, while we were still wondering whether to take the plunge, news spread that several boards had burst into flames while charging, in one case setting fire to a house. The problem was confined to a few makes, but without knowing which specific brands to avoid, it sullied the whole category.

- In many ways, expensive advertising and brands arise as a solution to a problem identified by George Akerlof in his 1970 paper ‘The Market for Lemons’ in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. The problem is known as ‘information asymmetry’, whereby the seller knows more about what he is selling than the buyer knows about what he is buying. This lesson was learned the hard way in Eastern Bloc countries under communism; brands were considered un-Marxist, so bread was simply labelled ‘bread’. Customers had no idea who had made it or whom to blame if it arrived full of maggots, and couldn’t avoid that make in future if it did, because all bread packaging looked the same. Unhappy customers had no threat of sanction; happy customers had no prospect of rewarding producers through repeat custom. And so the bread was rubbish.

- Neighbours Like Reggae’. Again, these need contain no additional ingredients: the only distinguishing feature would be the packaging and the promise. I’m not being entirely frivolous: research into the placebo effect shows that branded analgesics are more effective. Furthermore, promoting a drug as a cure for a narrowly defined condition, as Nurofen did, also increases placebo power, as does raising its price or changing the colour: everything the company was doing added to the efficacy of the product. It is impossible to buy expensive aspirin in the UK, yet it is a waste of this wonder drug to sell it for 79p in drab packaging, when you could make it much better by packaging it lavishly, colouring the pills red* and charging more. Sometimes I have a £3.29 headache rather than a 79p one. I try to stockpile the pricier brands I buy in the US, because I find they work better. Yes, I know it’s bullshit but, as we’ve already seen, placebos work even if you tell people they are placebos. Or, to put it another way, a dock leaf might soothe the pain of a nettle sting on even Richard Dawkins’s leg, regardless of any scientific evidence he had of their uselessness. The psychologist Nicholas Humphrey argues that placebos work by prompting the body to invest more resources in its recovery.* He believes that evolution has calibrated our immune system to suit a harsher environment than the current one, so we need to convince our unconscious that the conditions for recovery are especially favourable in order for our immune system to work at full tilt. The assistance of doctors (whether witch or NHS), exotic potions (whether homeopathic or antibiotic) or the caring presence of relatives and friends can all create this illusion, yet policymakers hate the idea of any solution that involves such unconscious processes – too little is spent on researching the placebo effect in proportion to its importance.* Understanding the placebo effect is a useful way to begin to understand other forms of unconscious influence; it explains why we often behave in… ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2583))

This means that we often cannot alter subconscious processes through a direct logical act of will – we instead have to tinker with those things we can control to influence those things we can’t or manipulate our environment to create conditions conducive to an emotional state which we cannot will into being. Think about it. There are some phrases that just wouldn’t appear in the English language:* ‘I chose not to be angry.’ ‘He plans to fall in love at 4.30pm tomorrow.’ ‘She decided that she was no longer to feel uneasy in his presence.’ ‘From that moment on, she determined no longer to be afraid of heights.’* ‘He decided to like… ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2603))

Things like this aren’t in our software – they are in our hardware.

On nearing the brow of a hill, for instance, you might instinctively take your foot off the accelerator to prevent the gearbox from changing down unnecessarily for the remaining short climb. Manual car devotees are blind to this skill, because it is something you only learn to do through repeatedly driving the same automatic car. The truth is that you can control the gearbox of an automatic car, but you just have to do it obliquely. The same applies to human free will: we can control our actions and emotions to some extent, but we cannot do so directly, so we have to learn to do it indirectly – by foot rather than by hand. This indirect process of influence applies to all complex systems, of which the automatic gearbox and human psychology are merely two examples.* The problems we face arise because policy problems are given to the intellectual equivalent of manual car drivers, who believe… ([Location 2632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2632))

For instance, you can contract your pupils by staring at a light bulb or dilate them by walking into a darkened room.* You can increase your heart rate through jogging or decrease it through the practice of yoga or meditation.

And rather than simply waking up when they wish, they program a strange machine which sounds a bell at an appointed time, to nudge them back into consciousness.

- It’s interesting that Humphrey suggests that our body’s immune system is calibrated to suit a much tougher environment than the one in which we find ourselves.* My parents’ generation lived through the food shortages during the Second World War and the long period of rationing which followed. My aunt, late in life, could still not bring herself to throw food away uneaten, even when the contents of her fridge had decayed to the point of becoming a biohazard – her attitude to waste had been calibrated during a time of great scarcity. In the same way, the human immune system has over time been calibrated to promote survival in conditions far harsher than those of today. Previously, you could not risk squandering resources too hastily when there was an ever-present risk that you might starve to death, freeze to death or be immobilised by the body’s immune ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2698))

When I met Nicholas Humphrey at an Indian restaurant in London,* he had by this point expanded his theory beyond health and the immune system: as well as hacking the immune system, he believes that humans regularly deployed oblique methods to generate bodily states and emotions which, like our immune response, we cannot consciously will into action – but which we can coax into existence. In particular, he mentioned bravery placebos,… ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2705))

So, as Humphrey explained, much of the paraphernalia and practice of the military – flags, drums, uniforms, square-bashing, regalia, mascots and so forth – might be effectively bravery placebos, environmental cues designed to foster bravery and solidarity. As with getting to sleep, the trick in generating bravery lies in consciously creating the conditions conducive to the emotional state. With sleep this might mean fluffy pillows, darkness and silence;* in the case of bravery it might involve trumpets, drums, banners, uniforms, camaraderie and so on. Soldiers live together, call themselves ‘brothers in arms’, march in lockstep, wear the same clothes and are allocated to ‘fictive-kin’ groups such as platoons, regiments and divisions – much of this fosters the illusion that you might be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the people within your group.

- One of Nicholas Humphrey’s rules about what makes an effective placebo is that there must be some effort, scarcity or expense involved. Folk remedies may be effective placebos simply because the plants needed to make them aren’t all that common. If there is one area that is worthy of future scientific research, this is it. At the moment, we spend many billions of dollars each year trying to improve drugs but almost nothing, as far as I can see, is being spent on the better understanding of placebos – they look too much like alchemy. I would also like to find out why the health outcomes for hospital patients appear to be better when they have a bed with a view of some trees. And what stories, I wonder, could doctors tell… ([Location 2815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2815))

The scientists who devised it had been briefed to come up with an effective cold and flu medicine: they succeeded, but with one problematic side effect – the formulation led to severe drowsiness. Despairingly, they were at the point of starting again when an alchemist from the marketing department came up with an idea. ‘If we position the product as a night-time cold and flu remedy, the drowsiness isn’t a problem – it’s a selling point. It will not only minimise your cold and flu symptoms, but it will help you sleep through them too.’ Night Nurse was born: a masterclass in the magic of reframing. Since my wife was going to be away for a few days last month, she anxiously read me the instructions on the bottle of Night Nurse, knowing full well that I wouldn’t do so myself.* ‘It says here that you should under no… ([Location 2822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2822))

- Red Bull is among the most successful commercial placebos ever produced – its powers at hacking the unconscious are so great that it is repeatedly studied by psychologists and behavioural economists all over the world, including the great Pierre Chandon at INSEAD, one of the top business schools in Europe. So potent are the drink’s associations that the very presence of the logo seems to change behaviour. However, no command economy could ever have produced Red Bull, and nor could a bureaucratic large multinational – it took an entrepreneur. The most plausible explanation for the incredible success of Red Bull lies in a kind of placebo effect. After all, it shares many of the features of a great placebo: it’s expensive, it tastes weird and it comes in a ‘restricted dose’.

Greenwood explained that in 2010, the sale of such pre-packaged drinks was already banned by the FDA because of a concern that caffeine would mask the alcohol’s effects. This theory seemed to be confirmed by a 2013 study which found that people consuming such drinks were twice as likely to be involved in an alcohol-linked car accident or a sexual assault as those who had drunk alcohol without caffeine. A more recent study described by Greenwood suggests that the effect might be psychological rather than chemical.… ([Location 2842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2842))

First, they played a gambling game in which they won money each time they inflated a balloon a little further, with a chance that they would lose everything if it popped. The next task involved looking at photos of women and considering whether they thought they would get their numbers if they approached them in a bar. Finally, they completed surveys describing how drunk they felt and how long they would wait before driving. The results showed a clear trend: although everyone had drunk exactly the same drink, the ‘vodka Red Bull group’ reported feeling much drunker, took more risks than the others and were more confident when it came to approaching women. Furthermore, the effect appeared to be stronger in men who believed that mixing energy drinks and alcohol makes you take risks and reduces inhibitions, suggesting that the altered behaviour is… ([Location 2851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2851))

For instance, rather than merely putting medications in containers with a childproof cap, might they insist that they are kept in a metal container with a combination lock?

Our body is calibrated not to notice the taste of pure water, because it is valuable in evolutionary terms that we notice any deviation from its normal taste. The qualities we notice, and the things which often affect us most, are the things that make no sense – at some level, perhaps it is necessary to deviate from standard rationality and do something apparently illogical to attract the attention of the subconscious and create meaning. Cathedrals are an over-elaborate way of keeping rain off your head. Opera is an inefficient way of telling a story. Even politeness is effectively a mode of interaction that involves an amount of unnecessary effort. And advertising is a hugely expensive way of conveying that you are trustworthy. My contention is that placebos need to be slightly absurd to work.* All three elements that seem to make Red Bull such a potent mental hack* make no sense from a logical point of view. People want cheap, abundant and nice-tasting drinks, surely? And yet the success of Red Bull proves that they don’t. Something about these three illogicalities may well be essential to its unconscious appeal, or to its potency as a placebo. If we are to subconsciously believe that a drink has medicinal or psychotropic powers, perhaps it can’t taste conventionally nice. Imagine a doctor saying, ‘I have some pills here to treat your extremely aggressive cancer – take as many as you like. Now, would you like them in strawberry or blackcurrant flavour?’ Somehow, that last sentence doesn’t quite work. If you look at behaviours to hack the unconscious, they all seem to have an element that is wasteful, unpleasant or downright silly. Cosmetics are insanely overpriced and time-consuming to apply.

However, as soon as we leave school or university, the vast majority of decisions we all have to take are not of that kind at all. Most of the decisions we face have something missing – a vital fact or statistic that is unavailable, or else unknowable at the time we make the decision. The types of intelligence prized by education and by evolution seem to be very different. Moreover, the kind of skill that we tend to prize in many academic settings is precisely the kind that is easiest to automate. Remember, your GPS is computationally much more capable than you are.

Now, I accept that the need to solve ‘narrow context’ problems is much greater today than it was a million years ago, and there’s no denying the contribution that rational approaches have made to our lives – in fields such as engineering, physics and chemistry. But I would also contend that our environment has not changed all that much: most big human problems, and the majority of business decisions, are still ‘wide context’ problems. The problems occur when people try to solve ‘wide’ problems using ‘narrow’ thinking. Keynes once said, ‘It is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong’, and evolution seems to be on his side. The risk with the growing use of cheap computational power is that it encourages us to take a simple, mathematically expressible part of a complicated question, solve it to a high degree of mathematical precision, and assume we have solved the whole problem. So my GPS answers a narrow question like ‘How long will it take to drive to Gatwick?’ brilliantly, but the wider questions like ‘How should I get there and when should I set off?’ still remain.

In the same way, companies can, for instance, optimise their digital advertising spend to a huge degree of precision, but this does not necessarily mean that they have answered the wider marketing questions, such as ‘Why should people trust me enough to buy what I sell?’ We fetishise precise numerical answers because they make us look scientific – and we crave the illusion of certainty. But the real genius of humanity lies in being vaguely right – the reason that we do not follow the assumptions of economists about what is rational behaviour is not necessarily because we are stupid. It may be because part of our brain has evolved to ignore the map, or to replace the initial question with another one – not so much to find a right answer as to avoid a disastrously wrong one.

- It may be that in situations like this what people do is substitute a completely different question to the ones they have been given, and answer that instead. This practice of answering an easier proxy question is what leads to a lot of ‘irrational’ human behaviour. It may fall short of being perfectly rational and it may not even be conscious, but that’s not to say that it isn’t clever. Never call a behaviour irrational until you really know what the person is trying to do. A few years after university, I was living in London with a group of friends and we had each accumulated just about enough money to buy our first ever second-hand cars. We all did exactly the same thing without knowing why – we returned to the small towns where we had grown up and bought a car from someone vaguely known to our parents, whether an acquaintance, friend or relative. To an alien onlooker, this behaviour would seem bizarre, especially since second-hand cars in the provinces are slightly ([Location 2953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2953))

- more expensive than they are in London. But the question we were unconsciously asking was not, ‘What car should I buy, and where?’, but ‘Who could I find trustworthy enough to sell me a really cheap car?’ We weren’t trying to buy the best car in the world – we were trying to avoid the risk of buying a terrible car. The question we were asking, ‘Who can I find who won’t rip me off?’, was a sensible one: the one thing you can’t afford to do when your budget is so tight, is fall victim to a con artist, which is why we needed someone with reputation at stake. That substitute question – ‘Who do I trust to sell me an X?’ – seems a perfectly reasonable proxy for buying good products. Find someone who has reputational skin in the game, ask their advice, and buy from them.* Like bees with flowers, we are drawn to reliable signals of honest intent, and we choose to do business where those signals are found. This explains why we generally buy televisions from shops rather than from strangers on the street – the shop has invested in stock, it has a stable location and it is vulnerable to reputational damage. We do this instinctively; what we are prepared to pay for something is affected not only by the item itself but by the trustworthiness and reputation of the person selling it.

In scenario A, the door is opened by a vicar.* In scenario B, the door is opened by a man naked except for a pair of underpants. The car has not changed, but what has changed is its provenance. The vicar is likely to be a man with a great deal invested in his reputation for probity, while the second man is clearly immune to any sense of shame. Would you seriously say that the amount you are prepared to pay would not increase in the first instance and decrease in the second?

- In the 1950s, the economist and political scientist Herbert Simon coined the term ‘satisficing’, combining as it does the words ‘satisfy’ and ‘suffice’. It is often used in contrast with the word ‘maximising’, which is an approach to problem-solving where you obtain, or pretend to obtain, a single optimally right answer to a particular question. As Wikipedia* helpfully explains, ‘Simon used satisficing to explain the behaviour of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He maintained that many natural problems are characterised by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimisation procedures. Consequently, as he observed in his speech on winning the 1978 Nobel Prize, “decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other, and both ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=2983))

- There is a parallel in the behaviour of bees, which do not make the most of the system they have evolved to collect nectar and pollen. Although they have an efficient way of communicating about the direction of reliable food sources, the waggle dance, a significant proportion of the hive seems to ignore it altogether and journeys off at random. In the short term, the hive would be better off if all bees slavishly followed the waggle dance, and for a time this random behaviour baffled scientists, who wondered why 20 million years of bee evolution had not enforced a greater level of behavioural compliance. However, what they discovered was fascinating: without these rogue bees, the hive would get stuck in what complexity theorists call ‘a local maximum’; they would be so efficient at collecting food from known sources that, once these existing sources of food dried up, they wouldn’t know where to go next and the hive would starve to death. So the rogue bees are, in a sense, the hive’s research and development function, and their inefficiency pays off handsomely when they discover a fresh source of food.

- Joel Raphaelson and his wife Marikay worked as copywriters for David Ogilvy in the 1960s. We recently ate dinner at Gibson’s Steakhouse at the Doubletree Hotel near O’Hare Airport in Chicago,* and talked about Joel’s 50-year-old theory concerning brand preference. The idea, most simply expressed, is this: ‘People do not choose Brand A over Brand B because they think Brand A is better, but because they are more certain that it is good.’* This insight is vitally important, but equally important is the realisation that we do not do it consciously. When making a decision, we assume that we must be weighting and scoring various attributes, but we think that only because this is the kind of calculation that the conscious brain understands. Although it suits the argumentative hypothesis to believe something is ‘the best’, our real behaviour shows relatively few signs of our operating in this way. Someone choosing Brand A over Brand B would say that they thought Brand A is ‘better’, even if really ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3021))

- they meant something quite different. They may unconsciously be deciding that they prefer Brand A because the odds of its being disastrously bad are only 1 per cent, whereas the risk with Brand B might be 2.8 per cent. This distinction matters a great deal, and it is borne out in many fields of decision science. We will pay a disproportionately high premium for the elimination of a small degree of uncertainty – why this matters so much is that it finally explains the brand premium that consumers pay. While a brand name is rarely a reliable guarantee that a product is the best you can buy, it is generally a reliable indicator that the product is not terrible. As explained earlier, someone with a great deal of upfront reputational investment in their name has far more to lose from selling a dud product than someone you’ve never heard of, so, as a guarantee of non-crapness, a brand works. This is essentially a heuristic – a rule of thumb. The more reputational capital a seller stands to lose, the more confident I am in their quality control. When people snarkily criticise brand preference with the phrase, ‘you’re just paying for the name’, it seems perfectly reasonable to reply, ‘Yes, and what’s wrong with that?’ ([Location 3029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3029))

Habit, which can often appear irrational, is perfectly sensible if your purpose is to avoid unpleasant surprises. Social copying – buying products or adopting behaviours and fashions that are popular with others – is another safe behavioural approach. After all, the bestselling car in Britain is unlikely to be terrible. Another reliable risk reduction strategy when making decisions under uncertainty is simply to substitute a different question from the one that conventional logic assumes you should be asking. So you would not ask ‘What car should I buy?’, but ‘Whom can I trust to sell me a car?’ Not ‘What’s the best television?’, but ‘Who has most to lose from selling a bad television?’ Or not ‘What should I wear to look great?’, but ‘What’s everyone else going to be wearing?’ A common approach when recruiting staff is to ask your existing employees to recommend people – indeed, this is how most entry-level jobs in mid-sized companies seem to be filled. This might seem to involve fishing in a very narrow pool, and it is, but a personal recommendation from an existing staff member is a good way to avoid hiring someone terrible. People are keen to do favours for their mates, of course, but no one is going to jeopardise their reputation at work by recommending an alcoholic, a kleptomaniac or an arsonist.

If the flight from JFK is delayed by three hours, your boss will blame the airline, but if the flight from Newark is, your boss will probably blame you, because with option 2 you made a noticeable decision – you deviated from the default.

- You may have never heard the term ‘psychophysics’, which is essentially the study of how the neurobiology of perception varies among different species, and how what we see, hear, taste and feel differs from ‘objective’ reality. For instance, different species, as I will soon explain, perceive colour very differently, since receptors in the eyes are sensitised to different parts of the light spectrum. More importantly, our different senses – though we don’t realise this – act in concert; what we see affects what we hear, and what we feel affects what we taste.* ([Location 3201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3201))

- You probably aren’t aware of this, but your television is cheating you. The same applies to the computer screen* and also to the colour pictures in magazines. Not everything on an LCD screen involves deceit: when the screen shows pure blue, green or red, it is more or less telling the truth – blue lights produce pure blue photons, green lights produce green photons and red lights produce red photons. Each pixel on the screen contains three LCD lights – one in each of those three colours. If the red lights alone are displayed, the screen is red. But yellow on television is a big fat lie. It may look yellow, but it isn’t really – it’s a mixture of red and green light, which hacks our optical apparatus to make us think we are looking at something genuinely yellow. The yellow is created in our brains, not on the screen. Colour mixing is a biological, not a physical phenomenon – you can’t mix green and red photons to make yellow photons, but by sending an image of a mixture of red and green photons to the brain in the right ratio, the resulting stimulus is indistinguishable from that of yellow photons, and you see yellow as a result. Even so, yellow isn’t as much of a lie as purple* is – yellow does, at least, exist on the light spectrum.* Purple does not exist at all: indigo and violet are in a rainbow, but magenta isn’t – the colour exists only in our heads.

- The lesson to take from this is that it is possible for something to be objectively wrong but subjectively right. TVs are designed around how we see, not what they show. There is a lot of clever engineering involved in making a television,* but the real genius in it is psychological alchemy, not technology – without an understanding of how humans perceive colour, making one would be almost impossible. As I have argued, psycho-logic and psychophysics need to be applied not just to the design of televisions, but also to welfare programmes, tax, transportation, healthcare, market research, the pricing of products and the design of democracy. There is no point in struggling to create changes in objective reality if human perception can’t see it, so all these things need to be perception optimised for humans. Moreover, just as with the colour purple, we should remember that if you design something in a certain way, people can perceive something which doesn’t exist in reality.* What really is and what we perceive can be very different. This is where physical laws diverges from psychological ones. And it is this very divergence which makes Alchemy possible.

- There is a whole academic discipline devoted to the idea that human behaviour can be modelled as if it were a physical phenomenon: it’s called economics. However, the simple fact is that, in all facets of human behaviour, reality and perception are like two different languages, each with concepts that are more or less untranslatable into the other.* ([Location 3277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3277))

- Another problem with data models is that they may suffer from a psychophysics problem. They match reality with behaviour as though the one maps perfectly onto the other. But this is wrong. For example, the data might say that people won’t pay £49 for a jar of coffee and that’s true, mostly. However people will pay 29p for a single Nespresso capsule which amounts to a similar cost – without understanding human perception it is unable to distinguish between the two. Will people pay £100 for a pair of shoes? In Walmart, no chance, but in the designer store Neiman Marcus, easily. Will people pay £500 for a mobile phone handset? Nokia’s data said no, but Apple discovered they would. Big data makes the assumption that reality maps neatly on to behaviour, but it doesn’t. Context changes everything. Perception may map neatly on to behaviour, but reality does not map neatly onto perception. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3394))

- It is arguable that even the ancient Greeks grasped the principles of psychophysics. Study the Parthenon, and you’ll notice that there is barely a straight line in it; the floor curves upwards in the middle, the sides bow out and the columns swell in the middle.* This is because it is not designed to be perfect – it’s designed to look perfect to a human standing a hundred yards or so downhill. And long before the Parthenon, nature learned the same trick. Nature spends a great deal of resources on what might be called ‘perception hacking’ or, in business terminology, marketing.

By contrast, caterpillars that don’t want to be eaten have evolved to taste disgusting to their predators.

- If you are a scientist, your job is to reach beyond the quirks of human perception and create universally applicable laws that describe objective reality. Science has developed sensors and units of measurement, which measure distance, time, temperature, colour, gravity and so on. In the physical sciences we quite rightly prefer these to warped perceptual mechanisms: it does not matter whether a bridge looks strong – we need to know that it really is strong. A problem arises when human sciences – politics, economics or medicine, say – believe this universalism to be the hallmark of a science and pursue the same approach; in the human sciences, just as in TV design, what people perceive is sometimes more important than what is objectively true. In medicine, the obsession with objectivity leads to neglect of the placebo… ([Location 3415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3415))

Alchemy, precisely because it is not an exact science, has always been rife with charlatanry, and we should be on our guard for this. Many of the remedies proposed by people in advertising and design are wrong, and many of the findings of behavioural scientists have already been or will be proved wrong. Some parts of this book are also undoubtedly wrong – I am conscious that I have written this book from an incredibly optimistic perspective, but my argument is not that alchemy is always reliable, ethical or beneficial.

- Remember that words do not only affect the price of a dish – they can also change its taste. Five years ago, we received a worried phone call from Belgian colleague. One of their largest biscuit manufacturers had replaced their most popular brand with a new, lower-fat variant, but as soon as they released it onto the market, sales plummeted. They were bamboozled; they had performed extensive research and testing and many people could notice no difference in the taste of the new biscuit, and yet no one was buying the new version. This was one of those problems which I was able to solve without even leaving my chair. ‘I see,’ I said over the speakerphone, ‘And did you put “Now with lower fat” on the packaging of the biscuits?’ ‘Of course we did!’ they replied. ‘We’d spent months reducing the fat content of the biscuits – what’s the point of doing that if you don’t tell people about it?’ ‘There’s your problem,’ I said. ‘It doesn’t matter what something tastes like in blind tastings, if you put “low in fat” or any other health indicators on the packaging, you’ll make the contents taste worse.’ In the testing that they had conducted the biscuits had been unpackaged, and they had forgetten that packaging will also affect the taste.

- The Polish-American academic Alfred Korzybski (1879–1950) is perhaps most famous for his dictum that ‘The map is not the territory.’ He created a field called general semantics, and argued that because human knowledge of the world is limited by human biology, the nervous system and the languages humans have developed, no one can perceive reality, given that everything we know arrived filtered by the brain’s own interpretation of it. Top man! One day, Korzybski offered to share a packet of biscuits, which were wrapped in plain paper, with the front row of his lecture audience. ‘Nice biscuit, don’t you think?’ said Korzybski, while the students tucked in happily. Then he tore the white paper and revealed the original wrapper – on it was a picture of a dog’s head and the words ‘Dog Cookies’. Two students began to retch, while the rest put their hands in front of their mouths or in some cases ran out of the lecture hall and to the toilet. ‘You see,’ Korzybski said, ‘I have just demonstrated that people don’t just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.’ ([Location 3470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3470))

- Attention affects our thoughts and actions far more than we realise. Daniel Kahneman, along with Amos Tversky, is one of the fathers of behavioural economics; ‘the focusing illusion’, as he calls it, causes us to vastly overestimate the significance of anything to which our attention is drawn. As he explains: ‘Nothing is as important as we think it is while we are thinking about it. Marketers exploit the focusing illusion. When people are induced to believe that they “must have” a good, they greatly exaggerate the difference that this good might make to the quality of their life. The focusing illusion is greater for some goods than for others, depending on the extent to which the goods attract continued attention over time. The focusing illusion is likely to be more significant for leather car seats than for books on tape.’ ([Location 3493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3493))

- It is interesting that Kahneman uses leather seats in cars as an example of the focusing illusion. I had always wondered whether they were chosen purely because of status signalling: status probably ranks higher on your list of priorities when you buy a car than it does later on in the car’s life, when reliability, running costs and comfort are more significant. Actually, whether leather seats are better than cloth seats also depends on the focusing illusion. There are many dimensions by which you can compare what seats are covered in, including not only status and price, but slippiness, smell, ease of cleaning, durability, ethics and even whether they can be painful to sit on in hot weather.* Depending on which of these qualities you choose to use as a discriminator, leather is either vastly superior to cloth or a senseless extravagance.* ([Location 3516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3516))

- It is fair for Kahneman to say that the focusing illusion plays a huge part in marketing, but I would argue that it is not actually an illusion at all but is rather an evolutionary necessity. Furthermore, rather than marketers ‘exploiting’ the focusing illusion, it is the illusion which makes marketing necessary. Nevertheless, one way you can improve your happiness is by learning that such an illusion exists, and by controlling what you pay attention to. I have a soft spot for the religious practice of saying grace before a meal, since paying attention to good things that one might easily take for granted seems a good approach to life – a pause to focus attention on a meal should add to its enjoyment.* ([Location 3523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3523))

- The focusing illusion is indeed an illusion, but so is almost all our perception, because an objective animal would not survive for long. As neuroscientist Michael Graziano explains, ‘If the wind rustles the grass and you misinterpret it as a lion, no harm done. But if you fail to detect an actual lion, you’re taken out of the gene pool.’* It is thus in our evolutionary best interests to be slightly paranoid, but it is also essential that our levels of attention vary according to our emotional state. When walking on our own down an unlit street, the sound of footsteps will occupy more of our attention than it would on a crowded street in daylight. It is wrong to consider such illusions as things that should be corrected or avoided – it is worth understanding them and the role they might play in distorting our behaviour, but the idea that it is better not to experience them is highly dangerous.

- Both smoke detectors and car alarms are significantly less paranoid today than they were in the 1980s but they are both calibrated to err on the side of caution, which is the way it should be. There is always a trade-off, and illusions are the price we pay. In the same way, facial recognition software must make the same trade-off in order to work. If it never recognises a face mistakenly, it is too insensitive – such high standards would mean that it would fail to recognise faces at a slight angle, or if one eye were closed, which would render it useless. As a result, facial recognition algorithms experience exactly the same pareidolic illusions as humans and some form of calibration is always necessary when dealing with imperfect or ambiguous information. What this all means is that no living creature can evolve and survive in the real world by processing information in an objective, measured and proportionate manner. Some degree of bias and illusion is unavoidable. ([Location 3558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3558))

The next time you are thinking about replacing your car, don’t. Instead, wait at least a year, or maybe two or three. In the meantime, rather than selling it, take it to a good valet service from time to time and have it thoroughly cleaned, inside and out. This will cost you about £50–£100 each time, but you will have a much better car. Not just a cleaner car, but a better car – as well as looking nicer, it will drive more smoothly, accelerate more quickly and take corners more precisely. Shiny cars are also simply much more enjoyable to drive. Why? Because of psychophysics. ([Location 3569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3569))

- In the 1950s, the General Mills food company launched a line of cake mixes under the Betty Crocker brand that included all the dry ingredients, including milk and eggs. All you needed to do was add water, mix and stick the pan in the oven – what could go wrong? However, despite the many benefits of this miracle product, it did not sell well, and even the Betty Crocker name could not convince anyone to buy it. General Mills brought in a team of psychologists to find out why consumers were avoiding it. One of their explanations was guilt: the product was so damned easy to make compared to traditional baking that people felt they were cheating. The fact that the cake tasted excellent and received plaudits didn’t help – this simply meant that the ‘cook’ felt awkward about getting more credit than they had earned. In response to these results, General Mills added a little psychological alchemy – or ‘benign bullshit’. They revised the instructions on the packaging to make baking less convenient: as well as water, the housewife was charged with adding ‘a real egg’ to the ingredients. When they relaunched the range with the slogan ‘Just Add an Egg’, sales shot up. The psychologists believed that doing a little more work made women* feel less guilty, while still saving time, but making just enough effort to give the sense of having contributed to the cake’s creation. There is a name for the addition of consumer effort to increase someone’s estimation of value. It should perhaps be called the Betty Crocker effect, since they spotted it first, but it’s instead known as the IKEA effect, because the furniture chain’s eccentric billionaire founder Ingvar Kamprad was convinced that the effort invested in buying and assembling his company’s furniture added to its perceived value. When working with IKEA I was once advised: ‘Do not, under any circumstances, suggest ways of making the IKEA experience more convenient. If you do, we shall fire you on the spot.’ ([Location 3608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3608))

- As I mentioned earlier, the human brain to some extent automatically assumes that there are trade-offs in any decision. If a car is more economical, its performance is assumed to be more sluggish; if a washing powder is kinder to the environment, it is assumed to be less effective. This is why promoting a product as being ‘kind to the planet’ comes at a risk – might it be easier to save the planet if we talked less about doing so? The error of the environmental movement seems to me to be assuming that it is not only necessary for people to do the right thing, but that they must do the right thing for the right reasons. My own view is more cynical, and also pragmatic: if people adopt behaviours that benefit the environment, we shouldn’t really care what their motives are. Demanding people do the right thing and for the right reason is setting the bar rather too high. When Ogilvy was asked to increase the level of waste recycling in British homes we made the suggestion of shelving all discussion of what a household thinks about the growth of landfill or the loss of polar bears; instead we suggested that the principal behavioural driver of recycling is to do with circumstances rather than attitude. Put bluntly, if you have two bins in your kitchen, you’ll separate your recyclable rubbish and recycle quite a lot, but if you have only one bin you probably won’t. Under the slogan ‘One bin is rubbish’ we focused our campaign entirely around encouraging people to have more than one bin in their household – avoiding the issue of how to convert people to be card-carrying members of the green movement.* We were not being defeatist in this campaign, or giving up on the attempt to make people more environmentally aware – we were just solving the problem backwards. Conventional wisdom about human decision-making has always held that our attitudes drive our behaviour, but evidence strongly suggests that the process mostly works in reverse: the behaviours we adopt shape our attitudes. Perhaps someone who separates their rubbish into waste and recyclables will become more environmentally conscious as a result of having adopted the behaviour, just as Tesla drivers will wax enthusiastically about the environmental purity of their vehicles, regardless of their initial reasons for buying the car.* ([Location 3634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3634))

- After landing at Gatwick Airport, the plane taxied for five minutes or so before coming to a halt, the terminal still somewhere in the distance. I heard the engines wind down and a horrible thought occurred to me: we might be about to be loaded onto a bus. I had always felt mildly resentful about being bussed to the terminal, suspecting that it was a tactic used by airlines to save landing fees by parking far away from the terminal building and avoid paying for an airbridge. Then the pilot made an announcement that was so psychologically astute that I felt like offering him a job at Ogilvy. ‘I’ve got some bad news and some good news,’ he said. ‘The bad news is that another aircraft is blocking our arrival gate, so it’ll have to be a bus; the good news is that the bus will drive you all the way to passport control, so you won’t have far to walk with your bags.’ After decades of flying, I suddenly realised that what he had said was not just true on that occasion – it was always true! The bus drops you off exactly where you need to be, meaning that you don’t have to lug your carry-on bags through miles of corridors before you can get to the exit – this was a revelation. We soon arrived at passport control, and were all rather grateful for the bus. Nothing had changed objectively, but we now saw the bus not as a curse but as a bit of a bonus. The pilot’s alchemical approach had redirected my attention to a different judgement.* ([Location 3664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3664))

- One characteristic of humans is that we naturally direct our attention to the upside of any situation if an alternative narrative is available, minimising the downside. By giving people good news and bad news at the same time, you can make them much happier than they would be if left with only one interpretation: that pilot was perhaps cleverer than he knew. One of most amusing and telling stories in the recent history of behavioural economics appears in Richard Thaler’s memoir, Misbehaving (2015), when he describes what happened when the University of Chicago Economics Faculty was required to move to a new building. These people are, in theory, the most rational in the world, who should have had at their disposal every possible strategy for collective decision-making in allocating the offices, which varied slightly in size and in status (a corner office being more desirable than an office with one window). Some of them suggested an auction, but this idea was quickly rejected – it was regarded as unacceptable for elderly Nobel Laureates to have smaller offices than their younger colleagues just because the latter had lucrative consulting practices and could afford to pay for the best offices. There was a great deal of feuding and obsessing over tiny differences in size.* I suggested to Professor Thaler that there might have been a simpler way to solve the problem by using a little psychological alchemy: why not rank both the offices and the faculty parking spaces between 1 and 100 in order of desirability before allocating them by lottery, with the people who received the best offices receiving the worst parking spots, and vice versa? Under these conditions, people allocate greater importance to the part of the lottery in which they have come out best, while those in the middle reframe the result as being a happy compromise. I was familiar with this system because it was how rooms had been allocated at my university college, a practice that I believe has gone on for centuries. In their first year, everyone is allocated a fairly standard room in college – none of the markedly good ones are given to first-year students. In their second year, a ballot is run, with the person at the top receiving the first pick, the second the second, and so on; and in the third year, the positions on the ballot are reversed. I never met anybody who was unhappy with the result. This seems to offer an extraordinarily valuable psychological insight into the best way to divide unequal resources between a random collection of people – when presented with either good plus bad, bad plus good or average plus average, everybody seems equally ([Location 3677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3677))

- content. In fact, we seem well-disposed to explicit trade-offs. A sentence which contains bad and good news, along the lines of, ‘Yes we admit downside x, but also think of upside y,’ seems particularly persuasive. Robert Cialdini has observed that, as you are closing a sale, the admission of a downside oddly adds persuasive power: ‘Yes, it is expensive, but you’ll soon find it’s worth it,’ seems to be a strangely persuasive construction – explicitly mentioning a product’s weakness enables people to downplay its importance and accept the trade-off, rather than endlessly worrying about the potential downside. If you are introducing a new product, it might pay to bear this in mind. When you think about it, it is rather strange how explicit low-cost airlines are about what their ticket prices don’t include: a pre-allocated seat, a meal, free drinks, free checked luggage – such deficiencies help to explain and destigmatise the low prices. ‘Oh, I see,’ you can say, when you see a flight to Budapest advertised for £37, ‘the reason that low price is possible is because I won’t be paying for a lot of expensive fripperies that I probably don’t want anyway.’ It’s an explicit, well-defined trade-off, and one that we feel happy to accept.

- My airport bus transfer experience illustrates a simple truth about human psychology that was spotted over two thousand years ago by a wise storyteller called Aesop. It appears in several of his fables including, most famously, the story of the fox and the grapes. A fox gazes longingly at a beautiful bunch of grapes hanging from the high branch of a tree, his mouth watering. He jumps to reach them, but misses by a long way. He tries again and again, but each time it is in vain. Sitting down, he looks at the grapes in disgust. ‘What a fool I am,’ he says, ‘wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes* that are not worth the effort.’ The moral of the fable is that many pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. This seems fair enough, though it is worth asking how our lives would feel if we did not play this mental trick on ourselves – we might go about in a constant state of resentment because we were not the billionaire recipient of a Nobel Prize. The opposite phenomenon to sour grapes is often called ‘sweet lemons’, where we ‘decide’ to put a positive spin on a negative experience. Both these mental tricks are types of ‘regret minimisation’ – given the chance, our brain will do its best to lessen any feelings of regret, though it does need a plausible alternative narrative to do this.

Public services are sometimes disliked by the people who use them not because they are worse than private sector services, but because the link between what you pay and what you gain is so opaque that it prevents people from creating a positive narrative about the taxes they pay.* I once examined a breakdown of what my local taxes are spent on: it seemed that I paid £25 per year for weekly refuse collection – reframing this as 50p per week, I was struck by what good value it was. For less than the cost of a stamp, someone would come to my house and remove and dispose of several bags of refuse; suddenly the council seemed more impressive than they had before.

- Imagine a set of four cards is placed on a table – each of them has a number on one side and a colour on the other. The visible faces on the cards are 5, 8, blue and green. Which card (or cards) must you turn over in order to test the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is blue?* Illustration by Greg Stevenson Wason Cards – and how context matters. This test baffled most Princeton students. A surprising number of bright people get the answer wrong – including, in one test, the majority of Princeton students. Overall, fewer than one in ten people gets this right first time, though no one has any difficulty understanding the problem once the correct answer is explained. The most common mistake is to assume that you should turn over the blue card; in fact, because the rule says nothing about odd numbers at all, a blue patch accompanied by either an odd or even number would not invalidate the rule – hence there is no need to turn over the blue card. Instead you should turn over the green card, since if this were backed by an even number the rule would be broken. As evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby observed, if the same problem is framed in the language of social relations rather than in the rarefied language of logic, the success rate is much higher. For instance, imagine instead that the rule is that you must be over 21 to drink alcohol – on one side of the cards is the age of a drinker, and on the other is the drink they have in their hand. In this presentation of the problem, nearly everybody gets it right: they check the 19-year-old and the age of the person drinking the beer. The can of Coke doesn’t matter, and the person over 21 can drink whatever they like. No one has any problem coping with that logic, even though it’s the same problem as previously, just framed in a different way.* ([Location 3805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3805))

- The job of the alchemist is to find out which framing works best. I persuaded my father to pay for TV at the age of 82, simply by reframing the cost. He begrudged paying £17 a month for a satellite television package – it seemed like a waste of money to him. However, when I pointed out that £17 each month worked out to around 50p a day and he already spent £2 each day on newspapers, everything changed. As 50p a day rather than £17 a month,* the same cost seemed perfectly reasonable. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071DCWRG3&location=3825))
