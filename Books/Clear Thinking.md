- Each moment puts you in a better or worse position to handle the future. It’s that positioning that eventually makes life easier or harder. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=169))

- the world make consistently good decisions is they rarely find themselves forced into a decision by circumstances. You don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when they’re in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they’re in a bad one.

- What a lot of people miss is that ordinary moments determine your position, and your position determines your options. Clear thinking is the key to proper positioning, which is what allows you to master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. It doesn’t matter what position you find yourself in right now. What matters is whether you improve your position today. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=183))

- So our first step in improving our outcomes is to train ourselves to identify the moments when judgment is called for in the first place, and pause to create space to think clearly. This training takes a lot of time and effort, because it involves counterbalancing our hardwired biological defaults evolved over many centuries. But mastery over the ordinary moments that make the future easier or harder is not only possible, it’s the critical ingredient to success and achieving your long-term goals.

- the African savanna, but territory isn’t just physical, it’s also psychological. Our identity is part of our territory too. When someone criticizes our work, status, or how we see ourselves, we instinctively shut down or defend ourselves. When someone challenges our beliefs, we stop listening and go on the attack. No thoughts, just pure animal instinct. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=270))

- Knowing Your Defaults While there are many such instincts, four stand out to me as the most prominent, the most distinctive, and the most dangerous.

- automatically execute when triggered unless we stop and take the time to think. They have many names, but for the purposes of this book, let’s call them the emotion default, the ego default, the social default, and the inertia default. Here’s how each essentially functions: 1. The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons and facts. 2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy. 3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger social group. 4. The inertia default: we’re habit forming and comfort seeking. We tend to resist change, and to prefer ideas, processes, and environments that are familiar. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=297))

- When we respond without reasoning, we’re more likely to make mistakes that seem obvious in hindsight. In fact, when we respond emotionally, we often don’t even realize that we’re in a position that calls for thinking at all. When you are possessed by the moment, all the reasoning tools in the world won’t help you. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=328))

- Desperate to satisfy the ego, either personally or professionally, you stop thinking and do things you otherwise wouldn’t, like approach a competitor or flirt with someone at a party. One example I’ve seen too many times in the workplace is when you stop putting in 100 percent of what you are capable of because you feel underappreciated.[*] The ego grabs your unconscious, throws your long-term goals out the window, and sets you sailing on a path toward destruction.

- Our desire to feel right overpowers our desire to be right. The ego default urges us to feel right at the expense of being right. Few things feel better than being right—so much so that we will unconsciously rearrange the world into arbitrary hierarchies to maintain our beliefs and feel better about ourselves.

- Most people go through life assuming that they’re right . . . and that people who don’t see things their way are wrong.[2] We mistake how we want the world to be with how it actually is. The subject doesn’t matter: we’re right about politics, other people, our memories; you name it. We mistake how we want the world to work for how it does work.

- Later I’ll discuss more about how to combat the ego default. For the time being, keep in mind how to recognize it when it rears its head. If you find yourself expending tremendous energy on how you are seen, if you often feel your pride being wounded, if you find yourself reading an article or two on a subject and thinking you’re an expert, if you always try to prove you’re right and have difficulty admitting mistakes, if you have a hard time saying “I don’t know,” or if you’re frequently envious of others or feel as though you’re never given the recognition you deserve—be on guard! Your ego is in charge. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=443))

- If you do what everyone else does, you’ll get the same results that everyone else gets.[*] Best practices aren’t always the best. By definition, they’re average. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=488))

- It’s easy to take comfort in the fact that other people agree with us. As legendary investor Warren Buffett pointed out, though, “The fact that other people agree or ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=497))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The people executing established practices say they want new ideas, but they just don’t want the bad ones. And because they so want to avoid the bad ones, they never deviate enough to find new good ones. While we need divergence from the norm to make progress, not all divergence is advantageous. To be successful, it’s not enough to do something different; you also need to be right. To do something different, you need to think different. And that means you will stand out.[*] Lou Brock might have put it best when he said, “Show me a guy who’s afraid to look bad, and I’ll show you a guy you can beat every time.” In other words, someone who’s possessed by the social default is easy to defeat.

- The inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something.[1] We resist change even when change is for the best. The Latin word inertia means literally “inertness”: that is, laziness or idleness. In physics, “inertia” refers to an object resisting a change in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating Newton’s first law of motion—the law of inertia—is this: “A body in motion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at rest.” Objects never change if they’re left alone. They don’t start moving on their own, nor do they stop moving till something stops them.[*] This law of physics can also be applied to human behavior and our instinct to resist even beneficial change. The physicist Leonard Mlodinow sums it up this way: “Once our minds are set in a direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted upon by some outside force.”[2] This cognitive inertia is why changing our minds is hard. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=539))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- One reason we resist change is that keeping things the way they are requires almost no effort. This helps explain why we get complacent. It takes a lot of effort to build momentum but far less to maintain it. Once something becomes “good enough,” we can stop the effort and still get decent results. The inertia default leverages our desire to stay in our comfort zone, relying on old techniques or standards even when they’re no longer optimal. Another reason we tend to push back against change is that doing something different might lead to worse results. There is an asymmetry to change—we take negative results to heart more than positive ones. Worse results make us stand out for the wrong reasons. Why risk looking like an idiot when you can remain average? We’d rather be average than risk the possibility of landing somewhere below average. Inertia is evident in many of our daily habits, such as when we stick to the same grocery store brand even if a new, superior one appears on the market. This reluctance to try new products is often due to the uncertainty and effort involved in evaluating them. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=551))

- We like to think we’re open-minded and willing to change our beliefs when the facts change, but history has shown otherwise. When the automobile was first introduced, many critics dismissed it as a mere fad, arguing that horses and carriages were a more reliable mode of transportation. Similarly, when the airplane was first invented, people were skeptical of its practicality and safety. The radio, television, and internet all faced similar initial skepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a profound impact on the way we live today. The “zone of average” is a dangerous place when it comes to inertia. It’s the point where things are working well enough that we don’t feel the need to make any changes. We hope things will magically improve. Of course, they rarely do. For example, staying in a… ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=560))

- As the famous quote often falsely attributed to Charles Darwin goes, “It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”[3] Even though it’s a misquotation, it’s not useless just because it’s not Darwin. When circumstances change, we need to adapt. But inertia closes minds and stifles the motivation to change how we’ve been doing… ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=569))

- Inertia also prevents us from doing hard things. The longer we avoid the hard thing we know we should do, the harder it becomes to do. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=579))

- Inertia keeps us doing things that don’t get us what we want. It operates in our subconscious largely undetected until its effects are too hard to counter. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=594))

- Think of your default patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting as algorithms you’ve been programmed to run unconsciously in response to inputs from other people or the environment. We don’t think about moving our knee when the doctor hits it with a reflex hammer. It just moves. The same thing happens with your thoughts and actions. We receive some type of input from the world and then execute an algorithm that processes that input and automatically produces an output.

- You unconsciously adopt the habits of the people you spend time with, and those people make it easier or harder for you to achieve progress toward what you want to achieve. The more time you spend with people, the more likely you start to think and act as they do. Eventually, almost everyone loses the battle with willpower; it’s only a matter of time. Consider my parents. Neither of them smoked when they joined the armed forces, but it didn’t take long for them to follow the lead of their smoking coworkers. At first, they resisted, but as the days turned into weeks, the grind of constantly saying no wore them down. Decades later, quitting proved nearly impossible because everyone around them smoked. The very same force that encouraged them to start was now preventing them from stopping. They were only able to kick their habit when they changed their environment. They had to find new friends whose default behavior was their desired behavior. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=612))

- The way to improve your defaults isn’t by willpower but by creating an intentional environment where your desired behavior becomes the default behavior. Joining groups whose default behaviors are your desired behavior is an effective way to create an intentional environment. If you want to read more, join a book club. If you want to run more, join a running club. If you want to exercise more, hire a trainer. Your chosen environment, rather than your willpower alone, will help nudge you toward the best choices.

- Inertia is a double-edged sword. We saw earlier that inertia is a tendency to maintain the status quo. If the status quo is sub-optimal or dysfunctional, inertia works against us. But the status quo doesn’t have to be sub-optimal. If you train yourself to consistently think, feel, and act in ways that further your most important goals—if, in other words, you build strength—then inertia becomes a nearly unstoppable force that unlocks your potential.

- Establishing rituals is the key to creating positive inertia. Rituals focus the mind on something other than the moment. They can be as simple as taking a quick pause before responding to someone’s point of contention at work. One of my old mentors used to tell me, “When someone slights you in a meeting, take a deep breath before you speak and watch how often you change what you’re about to say.” ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=648))

- Self-accountability means taking responsibility for your abilities, your inabilities, and your actions. If you can’t do that, you might never move forward. You might not have someone in your life who holds you accountable, but that doesn’t matter. You can hold yourself accountable. Others might not expect more from you, but you can expect more from yourself. No one else need reward or punish you into it. External rewards are nice, but they’re optional; you don’t need them to do your best. Your honest judgments about yourself are more important than anyone else’s. And when you screw up, you should be strong enough to look in the mirror and say, “This was my fault. I need to do better.” While you may never have asked for it, you’re in charge of your own life—and a larger part of your outcomes than you may think. People who lack self-accountability tend to run on autopilot. This is the exact opposite ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=682))

- of commanding your own life. These people constantly succumb to external pressure: seeking rewards, avoiding punishments, and measuring themselves against other people’s scoreboards. They’re followers, not leaders. They don’t take responsibility for their mistakes. Instead, they always try to blame other people, circumstances, or bad luck—nothing’s ever their fault. Well, I have news for you. It’s all your fault. There is always something you can do in the moment today to better your position tomorrow. You might not be able to solve the problem, but your next action will make the situation better or worse. There is always an action you can control, however tiny, that helps you achieve progress.

- Too often, the people we ask for feedback are kind but not nice. Kind people will tell you things a nice person will not. A kind person will tell you that you have spinach on your teeth. A nice person won’t because it’s uncomfortable. A kind person will tell us what holds us back even when it’s uncomfortable. A nice person avoids giving us critical feedback because they’re worried about hurting out feelings. No wonder we end up thinking other people will be interested in our excuses.[*] ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=738))

Exceptional people know they can’t change the hand they’ve been dealt, and don’t waste time wishing for a better one.

Nothing is ever their fault; it is always someone or something else that got in the way. No one begins life wanting to be a chronic victim, but the slow accumulation of responses that avoid responsibility makes it hard for people to see that’s what they’re becoming. Eventually, it’s just who they are. There are points in the process of becoming a chronic victim when people realize they’re lying to themselves. They realize the story they’re telling themselves isn’t quite true. They know they’re responsible. But facing reality and taking responsibility is hard. It’s uncomfortable. It’s so much easier to hide and to blame other people, circumstances, or luck. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=817))

- Self-accountability is the strength of realizing that even though you don’t control everything, you do control how you respond to everything.

- When I took my youngest son cliff jumping, we faced a serious dilemma. After reaching the top and looking down at the twenty-five-foot drop, he got scared and wanted to climb back down. That wasn’t possible, however, because the climb down was far more dangerous than the jump—one small error and he would have landed on a bed of sharp rocks. The more he looked down, the more nervous he became. I had to do something to help him help himself out of this situation. The first thing we did was to focus on our breathing. Your breath is a powerful tool that helps you calm your mind. We started taking a normal inhale and then immediately inhaling again with a smaller breath. It’s the same way we naturally breathe when we’re sobbing, and the results are similarly soothing. Only once we had relaxed our physical bodies could we change our inner dialogue. I asked him how he was talking to himself at that moment—and it wasn’t good. He was beating himself up, telling himself how dumb it had been to climb up in the first place, how he should have known better, and how scared he was. This is the same way we all tend to talk to ourselves sometimes—or at least it is in my experience. The second thing we did was change the conversation he was having inside his head. We know how the words we say to other people impact how they feel, but we rarely think of how the words we say to ourselves impact us.

All of them are ready to accept your invitation to be on your personal board. All you need to do is collect the best of them together and unite them in your mind. As Montaigne put it, “I have gathered a garland of other men’s flowers, and nothing is mine but the cord that binds them.”[5] You’re never alone if you have a personal board of directors. They’re always there. You can imagine them watching you make decisions and power moves. And once you imagine them watching, your behavior is bound to reflect this new audience. They will help set the standards that you strive to live up to, and give you a ruler against which to measure yourself. You’re not a failure if you come up short—if you don’t write a bestselling book, or become a billionaire, or work out every day. You’re not in competition with your exemplars.

- While we can only guess why other people do what they do in poker or any other situation, our biggest blind spot tends to be knowing our own weaknesses. There’s a famous quote from Richard Feynman: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.”[1] We fail to see our own weaknesses for three main reasons. First, those flaws can be hard for us to detect because they’re part of the way we’re accustomed to thinking, feeling, and acting. Flawed behavior has become ingrained through a long process of habit formation. Those flaws are part of who we are, even if it’s not in line with who we want to be. Second, seeing our flaws bruises our egos—especially when those flaws are behaviors that are deeply ingrained. They’re different from shortcomings like, say, lacking a technical skill, ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1351))

- because they feel like a referendum on the kind of person we think we are. We are territorial about how we see ourselves and tend to dismiss information that challenges our self-image. Third, we have a limited perspective. It is very hard to understand a system that we are a part of. Just as you look back on your sixteen-year-old self and wonder what you were thinking, your future self will look back on your current self and think the same thing. Your present self is blind to the perspective of your future self. Perspective and human nature make it hard to see our own flaws, and yet it’s easy to see the flaws in others. We are practically experts about where our colleagues and friends are weak and where they are strong. It’s hard to accept, however, that others might see us just as clearly in kind. When we get feedback about our own weaknesses from the world, it’s a rare opportunity for getting better and getting closer to the kind of people we really want to be. Use these opportunities wisely!

- From the start, Abrashoff knew you can’t simply order people to be better. Even if that appears to work, the results are short term and the consequences enormous. It doesn’t matter if you’re on a ship or running a manufacturing company. You don’t tap into people’s resourcefulness, intelligence, and skills by command-and-control. “Show me an organization in which employees take ownership, and I will show you one that beats its competitors,” says Abrashoff. “Captains need to see the ship from the crew’s perspective. They need to make it easy and rewarding for crew members to express themselves and their ideas.”[3] There is a gap in our thinking that comes from believing that the way we see the world is the way the world really works. It’s only when we change our perspective—when we look at the situation through the eyes of other people—that we realize what we’re missing. We begin to appreciate our own blind spots and see what we’ve been missing. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1391))

- In a quirk of psychology, people typically don’t argue with your personal rules. They just accept them as features of who you are. People question decisions, but they respect rules. Kahneman told me his favorite rule was never to say yes to a request on the phone. He knows that he wants people to like him, so he wants to say yes in the moment, but after filling up his schedule with things that didn’t make him happy, he decided to be more vigilant about what he agrees to do and why. When people ask him for things over the phone now, he says something along the lines of, “I’ll have to get back to you after I think about it.” Not only does this give him time to think without the immediate social pressure, but it also allows a lot of these requests to just drop away because people choose not to follow up. He rarely gets back to any of these people and says yes.[*] After speaking with Kahneman, I spent some time thinking about what automatic rules I could create for myself so that my desire in the moment didn’t overpower my ultimate desire. The way I did this was to imagine a film crew following me around documenting how successful I was.[*] Regardless of whether I was a success or not, how would I act to show someone I deserved my success? What would I want them to see? What am I doing that I would want them not to see because I’m embarrassed or ashamed? When I run this experiment by people, I am constantly surprised. We all know something we could do to improve our odds of success. And we all know something we can stop doing that would also improve our odds of success.

- ONCE YOU HAVE reprogrammed your defaults to create space for clear thinking, you must master the skill of decision-making. Decisions are different from choices. If you casually select an option from a range of alternatives, you’ve made a choice. If you react without thinking, you’ve made an unconscious choice. But neither of these is the same as a decision. A decision is a choice that involves conscious thought. The decision = the judgment that a certain option is the best one Often what seems like poor judgment in hindsight doesn’t even register as a decision in the moment. When the defaults conspire, we react without thinking. And that reaction doesn’t even count as a decision. Once we register the opportunity to make a conscious choice, the question becomes: How can we make the best decision possible? The decision itself should represent the outcome of the decision-making process.

- Not every bad decision is rushed, nor is every good one made slowly. It’s not that simple. People mistake choosing for decisiveness and the decision-making process for waffling. Part of what makes slowing down and reasoning through a problem difficult is that, to the outside observer, it might look like inaction. But inaction is a choice. When the stakes are low, inaction hurts you more than speed. Sometimes it’s better just to make a quick choice and not spend time deliberating. Why waste time evaluating if an action is inconsequential and its effects are easily reversed? For example, if there are two identical squat racks in the gym and both are momentarily open, it makes no difference which one you take. If you wait and decide, they’ll both be taken by someone else. Just choose either one. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1665))

- Defining the problem starts with identifying two things: (1) what you want to achieve, and (2) what obstacles stand in the way of getting it. Unfortunately, people too often end up solving the wrong problem. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1695))
    - Tags: [[asking the right questions]] 
- This is what happens when you put a bunch of smart, type A people together and tell them to solve a problem. Most of the time, they end up missing the real problem and merely addressing a symptom of it. They react without reasoning. Many of us have been taught that solving problems is how we add value. In school, teachers give us problems to solve, and at work our bosses do the same. We’ve been taught our whole lives to solve problems. But when it comes to defining problems, we have less experience. Things are often uncertain. We seldom have all the information. Sometimes, there are competing ideas about what the problem is, competing proposals to solve it, and then lots of interpersonal friction. So we’re much less comfortable defining problems than solving them, and the ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1707))

- the definition principle: Take responsibility for defining the problem. Don’t let someone define it for you. Do the work to understand it. Don’t use jargon to describe or explain it. the root cause principle: Identify the root cause of the problem. Don’t be content with simply treating its symptoms.

- The root cause of any problem like this is customer satisfaction, and that’s not necessarily the same as getting new customers. It could also be keeping existing customers happy.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- people who have insight that you don’t have. One way to keep meetings short and avoid the signaling that comes from repeating information that everyone knows is simply asking everyone, “What do you know about this problem that other people in the room don’t know?” That question makes people think. They stop filling the air with ideas everyone already knows and start explaining how they think about the problem. Not only do you start learning from each other, but you come to understand the problem at a deeper level because you start to see (and hopefully appreciate) different perspectives. Later, when you reconvene at the second meeting, the solutions often become obvious to everyone. And because everyone understands the problem, each person knows how to move their part of the organization in a way that solves it for everyone, not just themselves. An apocryphal quote often attributed to the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein sums up this idea: “To understand is to know what to do.”[*] ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1775))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- safeguard: Use the test of time. Test whether you’re addressing the root cause of a problem, rather than merely treating a symptom, by asking yourself whether it will stand the test of time. Will this solution fix the problem permanently, or will the problem return in the future? If it seems like the latter, then chances are you’re only treating a symptom.

- Short-term solutions might make sense in the moment, but they never win in the long term. You feel like you’re moving forward when you’re actually just going in circles. People gravitate toward them because finding a short-term fix signals to others that they’re doing something. That’s the social default at work. It fools people into mistaking action for progress, the loudest voice for the right one, and confidence for competence. Time eventually reveals short-term solutions to be Band-Aids that cover deeper problems. Don’t be fooled! ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1802))

- Once you’re clear on the problem, it’s time to think of possible solutions—ways of overcoming the obstacles to get what you want. The way to come up with possible solutions is by imagining different possible futures—different ways the world could turn out. One of the most common errors at this stage of the decision-making process is avoiding the brutal realities. In his book Good to Great, author Jim Collins tells the story of his interview with Admiral James Stockdale. During the Vietnam War, Stockdale was ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1815))

- the highest-ranking US military officer at the notorious Hỏa Lò prisoner of war camp (sarcastically dubbed the “Hanoi Hilton”). He was tortured over twenty times during an eight-year imprisonment and given no release date, no prisoner rights, and no certainty whether he would survive to see his family again. When Collins asked Stockdale about his fellow prisoners who didn’t survive the camp, the admiral singled out the optimists. “Oh, they were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by Christmas.’ And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by Easter.’ And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.” After a long pause, he turned to Collins and said, “This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”[1] ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1819))

- We all face difficult problems. The defaults narrow our perspective. They narrow our view of the world and tempt us to see things as we wish them to be, not as they are. Only by dealing with reality—the often-brutal truth of how the world really works—can we secure the outcomes we want. The worst thing we can do with a difficult problem is resort to magical thinking—putting our heads in the sand and hoping the problem will disappear on its own or that a solution will… ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1831))

If we’re in a happy relationship, we can look back and see the years of effort, communication, negotiation, luck, and (possibly) therapy that got us to this point. If we wake up bleary-eyed and muddleheaded, we can see how excessive drinking the night before disrupted our sleep. If we’re operating a successful business, we can see how running lean at the right times, or perhaps doubling down when things weren’t so certain, contributed to our current success.

You have to deal with it as it happens. The best decision-makers know that bad things happen, and that they’re not immune. They don’t just wing it and react. They anticipate and make contingency plans. And because they’re ready, their confidence doesn’t crack. The venture capitalist Josh Wolfe likes to say, “Failure comes from a failure to imagine failure.”[3] The bottom line: people who think about what’s likely to go… ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1861))

- the second-level thinking principle: Ask yourself, “And then what?” When you solve a problem, you make a change in the world. That change can be either in line with your long-term objectives or not. For example, if you’re hungry and you eat a chocolate bar, you’ve solved the immediate hunger problem, but that solution has consequences: the inevitable sugar crash an hour or two later. If your longer-term goal is to be productive that afternoon, the chocolate bar is not the best solution to your immediate problem. It’s true that eating a chocolate bar once won’t ruin your diet or your day.

Our future self sees the benefits or consequences of the accumulation of our seemingly insignificant choices.

First-level thinking looks to solve the immediate problem without regard to any future problems a solution might produce.

- We take the new job or we don’t. We get married or we don’t. It’s black and white: “do” or “do not.” There isn’t any middle ground. Most of the time, though, this type of thinking is limiting. Some decisions might seem to come down to a choice between this or that, but there’s often another option. The best decision-makers know this, and see binary thinking as a sign that we don’t fully understand a problem—that we’re trying to reduce the problem’s dimensions before fully understanding them. When we start exploring a problem in detail, things become more complicated before we understand it well enough to see the alternatives. Problem-solving novices try to reduce a decision to just two options because it creates the false sense that they’ve gotten to the problem’s essence. In reality, they’ve just stopped thinking. And you never want to stop thinking! Novices fail to see the complexities of a problem that are apparent to a master. Masters see the simplicity hiding in the complexity. As Frederic Maitland purportedly once wrote, “Simplicity is the end result of long, hard ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1953))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Binary framing is as comfortable as it is passive. Doing the work to add a third option forces us to be creative and really dig into the problem. Even if we don’t choose the third option, forcing ourselves to develop it helps us understand the problem better. It gives us more opportunities to align our decisions with our goals, offers more optionality in the future, and increases the chances that we’ll be happier with our decision down the road. There are two safeguards against binary thinking. The first is this: ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1967))

- Sometimes we can’t do what we want when we want, like leaving a job that’s become difficult to endure. But that doesn’t mean we’re stuck. We can always do something to move forward, putting ourselves in a better position to get more of what we want and less of what we don’t. If we can’t leave our job, we can at least improve it. If we can’t stay, we can prepare to leave. Reframing the problem shows us the next step. Remember: Limiting ourselves to binary thinking before fully understanding a problem is a dangerous simplification that creates blind spots.

- dualities prevent you from seeing alternative paths and other information that might change your mind. On the other hand, taking away one of two clear options forces you to reframe the problem and get unstuck. Here’s the second safeguard against binary thinking: safeguard: Come up with Both-And options. Try to find ways of combining the binary. Think not in terms of choosing either X or Y, but rather having both X and Y. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1987))

- F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.” Unlike Fitzgerald, though, I don’t think you need to have first-rate intelligence to come up with Both-And options. The capacity for combinatorial solutions isn’t reserved for the gifted. It’s a skill that can be learned and used; it’s just a skill that goes untaught. The key is learning to live with the uncomfortable tension between opposing ideas long enough to see that there’s a solution that combines the best elements of both. And that’s what integrative thinking is all about. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1997))

- Thinking better isn’t about filling your brain with answers to questions you’ve seen before. It’s not about memorizing what to do and when. It’s not about letting other people think for you either.

- The real world is full of trade-offs, some of which are obvious, and others that are hidden. Opportunity costs are the hidden trade-offs that decision-makers often have trouble assessing. Every decision has at least one of them. Because we can’t always do everything we want, picking one thing usually means forgoing another. The ability to size up hidden trade-offs is part of what separates great decision-makers from the rest. It’s also a core element of leadership.

That’s how we make all of our decisions.”[6] Improving our thinking isn’t just about having the answers to questions we’ve encountered before. It’s not about memorizing a set of predetermined actions. It’s not about relying on others to do the thinking for us. It’s about delving deeper, beyond the surface level, and uncovering what lies hidden from our view.

- Thinking through opportunity costs is one of the most effective things you can do in business and in life. The optimal way of exploring your options is to take all the relevant factors into account. You can’t do this without considering opportunity costs. There are two principles concerning opportunity costs. The first is this: the opportunity-cost principle: Consider what opportunities you’re forgoing when you choose one option over another. The second principle is closely related: the 3-lens principle: View opportunity costs through these three lenses: (1) Compared with what? (2) And then what?

- Money is not the only opportunity cost to consider. It’s just the most direct and visible, and for that reason people tend to focus on it.

First, I couldn’t expect my team to make decisions on their own unless I told them how I wanted them to make those decisions. That meant focusing on the single most important thing and not inundating them with hundreds of variables to consider. Second, if they made the decision with the most important thing in mind, and it turned out wrong, I couldn’t get upset with them. If I did that, they’d never make decisions without me. The third lesson was perhaps the most revealing: I myself didn’t know what the most important thing was. That’s why I couldn’t tell them.

- If I could have only one of these—if either earning a return on my investment required managing people, or not managing people entailed making less money—which would it be? I’d choose earning more money even if it involved managing people. So I’d move that criterion higher. Of course, I’d be willing to manage people only up to a point. If doing that became too time-consuming, I might have to reverse the order. That leads us to the next step: adding quantities. As your criteria battle one another, you’ll find quantities make a difference. Add them to each criterion as they battle. Suppose I find that I’m willing to spend five to ten additional hours per week managing people or being hands on, so long as my ROI is at least 15 percent per year. If I’d have to invest ten-plus hours per week, my ROI would have… ([Location 2193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2193))

- When you’ve finished ordering these two criteria, go to the next pair. Move from top to bottom, make your criteria battle one another for priority, and add the quantities that matter to you along the way. When people do this exercise, they often look at a pair of criteria and think, “I don’t necessarily have to choose between those two.” Make them battle anyway! The point isn’t really to compare them, it’s to find out which one is more important. Maybe in real life you can satisfy both criteria—maybe, for instance, you can get a high ROI while investing in a socially responsible company, or you can get in shape while still eating out three times a week, or you can buy a house in a great location that fits your budget.

- Assigning quantitative values to your criteria often helps at this point. When you start comparing things and thinking how much you’ll pay for them—and whether in a currency of time, money, collective brain power—you gain clarity about what matters most to you and what doesn’t. You’re forced to think in terms of benefits and risks, and you start to see things you didn’t see before—previously invisible costs become visible. For all of these reasons, making your criteria battle moves you toward objectivity and accuracy, and helps reveal what you think is most important.

While you might value getting everyone’s opinion, that doesn’t mean each opinion should be equally weighted or considered. A lot of the information we consume is in the form of highlights, summaries, or distillations. It’s the illusion of knowledge. We learn the answer but can’t show our work. Consider what happens when you consult a nutritionist. They take their years of experience and knowledge and compress it into a list of foods to eat and behaviors to implement.

You end up saving time at the cost of missing important information. Skimming inadvertently creates blind spots. Information is food for the mind. What you put in today shapes your solutions tomorrow. And just as you are responsible for the food that goes into your mouth, you are responsible for the information that goes into your mind.

Real knowledge is earned, while abstractions are merely borrowed. Too often decision-makers get their information and observations from sources that are multiple degrees removed from the problem. Relying on these abstractions is a prime opportunity for the ego default to work its mischief. It conjures the illusion of knowledge: we feel confident about what to do without really understanding the problem. You can’t make good decisions with bad information.

- happens when information travels through an organization. It goes through multiple filters, including individual levels of understanding, political interpretation, and biases. Details are abstracted from the original, and the signal is lost. The various incentives people have when they communicate information end up complicating things even further. The problem isn’t merely that people are unreliable transmitters of information; the problem is also that there are limitations on the information that abstractions can represent. Think of a road map. It’s an abstract representation of a real landscape. That landscape includes rocks, plants, animals, cities, wind, and weather, along with many other things. We don’t represent all of them when we map the landscape, only those things that interest us—for example, roads, rivers, and geographical boundaries. We pull these features away from the original and represent them in a way that makes them stand out. (That’s in fact what the word “abstract” means: “to pull away from.”) ([Location 2277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2277))

- Removing what doesn’t serve our interests is what makes a map useful. But somewhere in the process, someone has decided what’s useful and what isn’t based on what interests them. What if we’re interested in something else? What if we’re interested in population densities or geological strata? A road map isn’t designed to highlight these concepts, so it’s not going to be very useful to us. What’s true of maps is true of any other abstractions: by nature, they’re designed to serve the interests of their designers. If those designers don’t have the same interests as you, their abstractions aren’t going to give you the information you need. Similarly, any information you may get from a secondhand source has likely been filtered through that source’s interests. Since your interests are likely different from theirs, their summaries, highlights, and descriptions are likely to leave out relevant information that could help you with your decision.

That requires more than building an inventory of data points; it requires understanding the why and how behind those data points—the principles that good decision-makers use in this area.

If you have any anxieties of this sort, the first thing to understand is that experts love sharing what they’ve learned when they know it’ll make a difference. Helping others achieve their goals is one of the things that make life and work meaningful. To put it in perspective, think of a time in your life when someone asked you for help on something you excel at, and you came through for them. How did it feel? For most of us, sharing expertise feels pretty good. We enjoy exercising an ability we have, and we also enjoy gaining recognition for having it. Experts don’t treat all requests for help equally, though. Some requests really don’t feel good to receive. Usually these are requests of the tell-me-what-I-should-do type. Often these people haven’t done the work ahead of time, they just want you to decide for them. I get hundreds—if not thousands—of these requests a year.

- Here are some things to look for: Imitators can’t answer questions at a deeper level. Specific knowledge is earned, not learned, so imitators don’t fully understand the ideas they’re talking about.[*] Their knowledge is shallow. As a result, when you ask about details, or first principles or nonstandard cases, they don’t have good answers. Imitators can’t adapt their vocabulary. They can explain things using only the vocabulary they were taught, which is often full of jargon. Because they don’t fully understand the ideas behind the vocabulary, they can’t adapt the way they talk about those ideas to express them more clearly to their audience. Imitators get frustrated when you say you don’t understand. That frustration is a result of being overly concerned with the appearance of expertise—which they might not be able to maintain if they have to really get into the weeds with an explanation.

Experts can tell you all the ways they’ve failed. They know and accept that some form of failure is often part of the learning process. Imitators, however, are less likely to own up to mistakes because they’re afraid it will tarnish the image they’re trying to project. Imitators don’t know the limits of their expertise. Experts know what they know, and also know what they don’t know. They understand that their understanding has boundaries, and they’re able to tell you when they’re approaching the limits of their circle of competence. Imitators can’t.

Another big reason we find action hard is that we’re afraid of being wrong. In this case inertia holds us in place as we gather more and more information in the false hope that we can ultimately eliminate uncertainty.

How do you know when it’s finally time to act? When the cost of failure is cheap, the speed at which you come to a decision matters as much as the decision itself. When failure is expensive, it makes sense to learn more before taking action. Defaults can transform caution into an excuse not to act if you don’t resist them. Anyone who has held on to a failing job, relationship, or investment too long knows that information gathering reaches a point of diminishing returns—at some point the cost of getting more information is exceeded by the cost of losing time or opportunity.

- Here’s a simple heuristic for creating a margin of safety so you know when “enough is enough.” tip: The margin of safety is often sufficient when it can absorb double the worst-case scenario. So the baseline for a margin of safety is one that could withstand twice the amount of problems that would cause a crisis, or maintain twice the amount of resources needed to rebuild after a crisis.

- For example, if you want to feel financially secure even if you lose your job, you can estimate how long it will take you to gain employment again, and then save enough to live off savings for double that amount of time. That’s our baseline. But we need to adapt our margin of safety to the individual and situational circumstances. If the cost of failure is high, and outcomes are more consequential, you want a large margin of safety. For instance, if you’re worried about losing your job, and you’re in a sector or economy that’s volatile, you’ll want to increase the length of time you can take care of yourself while unemployed. If the cost of failure is low, and outcomes are less consequential, you can often reduce or skip the margin of safety. The longer something exists and performs well, the higher the probability that its pattern of success will continue. Coca-Cola isn’t going anywhere in the near future; neither is Johnson & Johnson. Yet even established patterns aren’t foolproof. As Nassim Taleb writes in The Black Swan, “Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race ‘looking out for its best interests,’ as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.” Our outcomes can sometimes upend even our most well-established expectations.

But announcing right away can be like the email you can’t unsend. It starts things moving, and makes changing your mind much harder. That’s why I created a rule for myself: I make major decisions and then sleep on them before telling anyone.[*] However, it turned out that sleeping on decisions by itself wasn’t enough. I added another element to the rule: before going to bed, I would write a note to myself explaining why I’d made the decision. Doing so allowed me to make the invisible visible. When I woke up in the morning, I’d read the note. More often than I’d like to admit, my best thinking from the day before fell short upon inspection in the harsh light of the morning. Sometimes I’d realize I really didn’t understand the problem as well as I thought I did. Other times, it just didn’t feel right anymore. And I’ve come to learn that this feeling is important to explore. Living with a decision before announcing it allows you to look at it from a new perspective and verify your assumptions. Once you’ve made the decision—even if you haven’t communicated it—you start seeing things in a new light.[*] Your brain processes all the potential results of the decision as though it had already been made and put into action. This can often help you see nuances you might have missed, and those might, in turn, change how you implement the decision. Maybe you’re promoting someone, and you’re worried about their ability to lead a meeting and organize a team. Living with the decision might spur you to have them organize a meeting, see what happens, and recalibrate if necessary. Also, living with a decision on your own for a day—or even two—allows you to check it with your emotions. Does this decision feel good in your bones? Do your brain and your heart and your guts all agree with it? Most decisions will feel fine. But ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2727))

- One sign that you’ve failed to empower your team is that you can’t be away from the office for a week without things falling apart. Some leaders think it makes them indispensable—that the team’s inability to function without them is a sign of how important they are. Don’t be fooled! This is the ego default at work. Effective leaders shouldn’t have to be available 24/7 for their team to make decisions and achieve objectives. If you can’t be away, it doesn’t mean that you’re indispensable or a supremely competent leader; it means that you’re an incompetent communicator. Another sign that you’re in the grips of the ego default is that you insist on controlling how everything happens. Good leaders determine what needs to get done and set the parameters for getting there. They don’t care whether something gets done differently from how they themselves would’ve done it. As long as it advances to the objective within the limits they’ve set, they’re satisfied. Poor leaders insist that everything must be done their way, which ultimately demoralizes their team and undermines both loyalty and creativity—exactly the opposite of commander’s intent. fail-safe: Tie your hands to keep your execution on track.

- Our tendency to equate the quality of our decision with the outcome is called resulting. Results are the most visible part of a decision. Because of that, we tend to use them as an indicator of the decision’s quality. If the results are what we wanted, we conclude that we made a good decision. If the results aren’t what we wanted, we tend to blame external factors. It’s not that our process was lacking; it’s that a crucial bit of information was.

- at which point we assume it’s because they made a bad decision.) Obviously, we all want good outcomes, but as we’ve seen, good decisions can have bad outcomes, and bad decisions can have good ones. Evaluating decisions—ours or others’—based on the outcome (or how we feel about the outcome) fails to distinguish luck from skill and control. Because of that, engaging in resulting doesn’t help us get better. The result of resulting is instead stagnation. If you’ve ever ruminated over a bad outcome—asking yourself again and again, “How did I not see that coming?”—then you’ve experienced how challenging and ultimately useless it is to judge your decisions on the basis of how you feel about them in retrospect. You think, “If only I had talked to that person (whom I didn’t know at the time)!” or, “If I had only known that piece of information (which didn’t exist at the time), I would have made the right choice.” Even the best decision-makers get bad results from time to time, though.

And when you start confusing luck with skill, you’re bound to squander opportunities to learn from your decisions, to improve your process, and to secure better results over the long term.

- Many of us have a hard time learning from our decisions. One reason is that our thinking and decision-making process is often invisible to us. We inadvertently conceal from ourselves the steps we took to reach our final decision. Once that decision gets made, we don’t stop to reflect, but just move forward. And when we look back at our decision later, our ego manipulates our memories. We confuse what we know now with what we knew at the time we made the decision. And we see the outcomes and read them back into our intentions: “Oh, I meant to do that.” If you don’t check your thinking at the time you made the decision—what you knew, what you thought was important, and how you reasoned about it—you’ll never know whether you made a good decision or just got lucky.

You can truthfully answer questions like, “What did I know at the time I made the decision?” and, “Did the things I anticipated happening come about for the reasons I thought they would?” A second benefit of recording your thoughts is that in the process of writing something, you often realize you don’t really understand it as well as you thought you did.

- when we fail to live a life true to ourselves, when we fail to play by our own scoreboard. Each default plays a role in setting us up for regret. The social default prompts us to inherit goals from other people, even if their life circumstances are very different from ours. The inertia default encourages us to continue pursuing the goals we’ve pursued in the past, even after we’ve come to realize that achieving them doesn’t make us happy. The emotion default sends us this way and that, chasing whatever captures our fancy in the moment, even at the expense of pursuing long-term goals that matter more. And the ego default convinces us to pursue things like wealth, status, and power, even at the expense of happiness and well-being—our own and that of the people around us. If you give any of the defaults command of your life, your ultimate destination is regret. Don’t live life by another person’s scoreboard. Don’t let someone else choose your objectives in life. Take responsibility for where you are and where you are headed. Real wisdom doesn’t come from chasing success but from building character.

- Ebenezer Scrooge is one of Charles Dickens’s most memorable characters—an embodiment of greed and pursuing wealth at the expense of everything else. Scrooge is visited by three spirits who show him images of the past, the present, and a future that might be. In that future, Scrooge is dead, and the spirit allows him to eavesdrop on people’s conversations about him: they’re pleased Scrooge is gone, spiteful at his memory, unrepentant about stealing his things, and relieved that he’s no longer a presence—a curse—in their lives. Scrooge sees the long-term consequences of the decisions he’s ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=3008))

- made, regrets them, begs for a second chance, and gets an opportunity to change course.[*] Scrooge played by society’s scoreboard—the one that amplifies our biological instinct toward hierarchy and leads us to pursue money, status, and power at all costs. But his vision of the long-term future made him realize that none of these things really mattered, that a life lived according to someone else’s scoreboard is not a life worth living. He realized before it was too late that the key to a successful life is good company and meaningful relationships. The quality of what you pursue determines the quality of your life. We think things like money, status, and power will make us happy, but they won’t. The moment we get them, we’re not satisfied. We just want more. The psychologists Philip Brickman and Donald T. Campbell coined a term for this phenomenon: the hedonic treadmill.[1] Who hasn’t taken a run on it?

Back when you didn’t have a car, you used to compare yourself with other people who didn’t have cars. But now that you had a car, you began comparing yourself with other car owners. You noticed who had a better car, and were no longer happy with what had once made you ecstatic. You reverted to your old base-level discontent—the lowest gear on the hedonic treadmill. Comparison is the thief of joy.[*] Social comparison happens all the time. Sometimes it’s about possessions like houses or cars, but more often it’s about status.

In fact, the things they wanted ended up disfiguring their lives. They were missing what Scrooge gains at the happy turning point of his story—that ingredient that makes the difference between the unhappy masses and the happy few. The ancient Greeks had a word for this ingredient: phronesis—the wisdom of knowing how to order your life to achieve the best results. When you look back to the decisions you made as a teenager, they probably seem pretty silly now. The time you stole (I mean borrowed) the car from your parents, the time you got too drunk at a party and maybe did some stuff you shouldn’t have (thankfully there were no camera phones back then), the time you got into a fight with a friend over a potential mate.

Wisdom requires all the things we’ve talked about: the ability to keep the defaults in check, to create space for reason and reflection, to use the principles and safeguards that make for effective decisions. But being wise requires more. It’s more than knowing how to get what you want. It’s also knowing which things are worth wanting—which things really matter. It’s as much about saying no as saying yes. We can’t copy the life decisions of other people and expect better results. If we want to live the best life we can, we need a different approach. Knowing what to want is the most important thing. Deep down, you already know what to do, you just need to follow your own advice. Sometimes, it’s the advice we give other people that we most need to follow ourselves.

- None said that to be happy you should work as hard as you can to get money. None said it was important to be as wealthy as the people around you. None said you should choose your career based on its earning potential. None said they regretted not getting even with someone who slighted them. And the biggest regret people had? Worrying about things that never happened: “Worrying wastes your life,” one respondent said. These are important insights from the people that Pillemer describes as “the most credible experts we have on how to live happy and fulfilled lives during hard times.” But there’s another insight that’s even more important. Pillemer asked one of his interviewees for help understanding the source of her happiness.

Happiness is not a passive condition dependent on external events, nor is it the result of our personalities—just being born a happy person. Instead, happiness requires a conscious shift in outlook, in which one chooses—daily—optimism over pessimism, hope over despair.” The more we age, the more we come to see things the way Marcus Aurelius did: “When you are distressed by an external thing, it’s not the thing itself that troubles you, but only your judgment of it. And you can wipe this out at a moment’s notice.”[2] This insight has dramatic implications. It places happiness on a continuum with other decisions we’ve talked about.
