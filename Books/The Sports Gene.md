## Highlights
- The speed gene must run in that family. But is there even such a thing? Do “sports genes” exist at all? ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=78))

- The broad truth is that nature and nurture are so interlaced in any realm of athletic performance that the answer is always: it’s both. But that is not a satisfactory endpoint in science. Scientists must ask, “How, specifically, might nature and nurture be at work here?” and “How much does each contribute?” In pursuit of answers to these questions, sports scientists have trundled into the era of modern genetic research. This book is my attempt to trace where they have gone and to examine much of what is known or haggled over about the innate gifts of elite athletes.

- Along the way, I learned that some characteristics that I assumed were entirely voluntary, like an athlete’s will to train, might in fact have important genetic components, and that others that I figured were largely innate, like the bullet-fast reactions of a baseball batter or cricket batsman, might not be.

- The intuitive explanation is that the Albert Pujolses and Roger Federers of the world simply have the genetic gift of quicker reflexes that provide them with more time to react to the ball. Except, that isn’t true. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=163))

- So, in 1975, as part of her graduate work at Waterloo, Starkes invented the modern sports “occlusion” test. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=190))

- It was a strong clue that one key difference between expert and novice athletes was in the way they had learned to perceive the game, rather than the raw ability to react quickly. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=207))

- This held true from basketball to soccer. It was as if every elite athlete miraculously had a photographic memory when it came to her sport. The question, then, is how important these perceptual abilities are to top athletes and whether they are the result of genetic gifts.

- In order to explain what they saw, Chase and Simon proposed a “chunking theory” of expertise, a pivotal idea in the study of games like chess, but also in sports, that helps explain what Janet Starkes found in her work with field hockey and volleyball players. Chess masters and elite athletes alike “chunk” information on the board or the field. In other words, rather than grappling with a large number of individual pieces, experts unconsciously group information into a smaller number of meaningful chunks based on patterns that they have seen before. Whereas the average club player in de Groot’s study was scanning and attempting to remember the arrangement of twenty individual chess pieces, the grandmaster needed to remember only a few chunks of several pieces each, because the relationships between the pieces had great meaning for him.* ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=242))

- Most important in sports, perceiving order allows elite athletes to extract critical information from the arrangement of players or from subtle changes in an opponent’s body movements in order to make unconscious predictions about what will happen next.

- As an individual practices a skill, whether it be hitting, throwing, or learning to drive a car, the mental processes involved in executing the skill move from the higher conscious areas of the brain in the frontal lobe, back to more primitive areas that control automated processes, or skills that you can execute “without thinking.” ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=291))

- The result of expertise study, from de Groot to Abernethy, can be summarized in a single phrase that played like a broken record in my interviews with psychologists who research expertise: “It’s software, not hardware.” That is, the perceptual sports skills that separate experts from dilettantes are learned, or downloaded (like software), via practice. They don’t come standard as part of the human machine. That fact helped spawn the most well-known theory in modern sports expertise, and one that has no place for genes.

- In the now-famous paper—“The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance”—the authors extended their conclusions to sports, citing Janet Starkes’s occlusion tests that showed learned perceptual expertise is more important than raw reaction skills. Accumulated hours of practice, they suggested, were masquerading as innate talent in both music and sports. The lead author of the paper, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, now at Florida State, came to be viewed as the father of the “10,000 hours” to expertise rule—though he himself never called it a “rule”—or the “deliberate practice framework,” as it is often known among those who study skill acquisition. Ericsson is regarded as an expert on experts. He and other proponents of the framework went on to suggest that accumulated practice is the real wizard behind the curtain of innate ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=333))

- talent in fields from sprinting to surgery. As genetic science became more prominent, Ericsson worked genes into his writing. In a 2009 paper, “Toward a Science of Exceptional Achievement,” Ericsson and his coauthors write that the genes necessary to be a pro athlete (or a pro anything, really) “are contained within all healthy individuals’ DNA.” In that view, experts are differentiated by their practice histories, not their genes. The media interpretation of Ericsson’s work has often been to say that 10,000 hours is both necessary and sufficient to make anyone an expert in anything. No one, the idea goes, achieves expertise with less, and everyone achieves expertise with that amount. On the backs of several bestselling books and reams of articles, the 10,000-hours rule (alternately known as the ten-year rule) has become embedded in the world of athlete development and an impetus for starting children early in hard training. In some cases, popular writers describing Ericsson’s work have allowed for individual genetic differences in addition to differences born of practice, while others have taken a rigid view of the 10,000-hours rule as absolute, with no room for genetic gifts. During the reporting of this book, I ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=339))

- saw the 10,000 hours referenced as the recipe for success in arenas as disparate as an interview given by a U.S. Olympic Committee scientist and the annual letter from a hedge fund to its investors explaining the fund’s tenets of success. I even became acquainted with a golfer who is putting the rule to a very personal test. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=348))

- In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports—and acquiring a range of other athletic skills—before zeroing in on one. A study of ultraendurance triathletes found that the better athletes had practiced far more on average but that there was a tenfold difference in practice hours among athletes who performed similarly.

- In 1908, Edward Thorndike, who would become known as the father of modern educational psychology, came up with a way to test whether nature or nurture dominated an individual’s ability at a task. Thorndike was a leading proponent of the then-controversial idea that older adults—meaning, at the time, those over thirty-five—can continue to learn new skills. He figured that the way to distinguish nature from nurture was to give people the same amount of practice at a certain task and to see whether they became more or less alike. If their skill levels converged, Thorndike reasoned, then the impact of practice was overwhelming any innate individual differences. If they diverged, then nature was overpowering nurture. In one experiment, Thorndike had adults practice multiplying three-digit numbers by three-digit numbers in their heads as quickly as they could. He was astounded by their improvement. “The fact that these mature and competent minds improved in the course of so short a training so much,” Thorndike wrote, “is worthy of attention.” After one hundred practice trials, many of the subjects cut their mental computation time in half. And every single subject improved. Just as in chess, language, music, and baseball, as practitioners improve at mental multiplication, they internalize patterns and systems of breaking problems into pieces that allow for increasingly rapid calculation. But while Thorndike saw across-the-board improvement, he also noted what sociologists often call a “Matthew effect.” The term derives from a passage in the biblical Gospel of Matthew: For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. Thorndike saw that the subjects who did well at the start of the training also improved faster as the training progressed compared with the subjects who began more slowly. “As a matter of fact,” Thorndike wrote, “in this experiment the larger individual differences increase with equal training, showing a positive correlation with high initial ability with ability to profit by training.” The passage from the Bible doesn’t quite capture Thorndike’s results accurately because every subject improved, but the rich got relatively richer. Everyone learned, but the learning rates were consistently different. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=604))

- When World War I erupted, Thorndike became a member of the Committee on Classification of Personnel, a group of psychologists commissioned by the U.S. Army to evaluate recruits. It was there that Thorndike rubbed off on a young man named David Wechsler, who had just finished his master’s degree in psychology. Wechsler, who would become a famous psychologist, developed a lifelong fascination with tracing the boundaries of humanity, from lower to upper limits. In 1935, Wechsler compiled essentially all of the credible data in the world he could find on human measurements. He scoured measures of everything from vertical jump to the duration of pregnancies to the weight of the human liver and the speeds at which card punchers at a factory could punch their cards. He organized it all in the first edition of a book with the aptly momentous title The Range of Human Capacities. Wechsler found that the ratio of the smallest to biggest, or best to worst, in just about any measure of humanity, from high jumping to hosiery looping, was between two to one and three to one. To Wechsler, the ratio appeared so consistent that he suggested it as a kind of universal rule of thumb. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=621))

- Phillip Ackerman, a Georgia Tech psychologist and skill acquisition expert, is a sort of modern-day Wechsler, having combed the world’s skill-acquisition studies in an effort to determine whether practice makes equal, and his conclusion is that it depends on the task. In simple tasks, practice brings people closer together, but in complex ones, it often pulls them apart. Ackerman has designed computer simulations used to test air traffic controllers, and he says that people converge on a similar skill level with practice on the easy tasks—like clicking buttons to get planes to take off in order—but for the more complex simulations that are used for real-life controllers, “the individual differences go up,” he says, not down, with practice. In other words, there’s a Matthew effect on skill acquisition. Even among simple motor skills, where practice decreases individual differences, it never drowns them entirely. “It’s true that doing more practice helps,” Ackerman says, “but there’s not a single study where… ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=629))

- in the time the new people get across one. But the fastest person with ten years’ experience will still be about three times faster than the slowest person with ten years’ experience.” Scientists who study skill performance attempt to account for “variance” between people. Variance is a statistical measure of how much individuals deviate from the average. In a sample of two runners, if one athlete completes the mile in four minutes and the other runs it in five minutes, then the average is four and a half minutes and the variance is half a minute. The question for scientists is: What accounts for that variance, practice, genes, or something else? It is a critical inquiry. It is not enough for scientists to say that practice matters. That point is entirely uncontroversial. As Joe Baker, a sports psychologist at York University in Toronto, says, “There isn’t a single geneticist or physiologist who says hard work isn’t important. Nobody thinks Olympians are just jumping off the couch.” Scientists must go beyond saying that practice matters and attempt the difficult task of determining exactly how much practice matters. By the strictest 10,000-hours thinking, accumulated practice should explain most or all of the variance in skill. But that never, ever happens. From swimmers and triathletes to piano players, studies report that the amount of variance accounted for by practice is generally between low and moderate. In a study that K. Anders Ericsson himself coauthored of darts players, for example, only 28 percent of the variance in performance between players was accounted for after fifteen… ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=638))

- Over four years of testing, and 387 minor and major league players, Rosenbaum and his team found an average visual acuity around 20/13. Position players (players who have to hit) had better vision than pitchers, and major league players had better vision than minor leaguers. Major league position players had an average right eye visual acuity of 20/11 and an average left eye visual acuity ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=682))

- of 20/12. In the test of fine depth perception, 58 percent of the baseball players scored “superior,” compared with 18 percent of a control population. In tests of contrast sensitivity, the pro players scored better than collegiate baseball players had in previous research, and collegiate players scored better than young people in the general population. In each eye test, pro baseball players were better than nonathletes, and major league players were better than minor league players. “Half the guys on the Dodgers’ major league roster were 20/10 uncorrected,” Rosenbaum says. The two largest population studies of visual acuity, one from India and one from China, give a sense of just how rare 20/10 vision might be. In the Indian study, out of 9,411 tested eyes, one single eye had 20/10 vision. In the Beijing Eye Study, only 22 out of 4,438 eyes tested at 20/17 or better.

- So while major league hitters might not have any faster reaction time than you or I do, they do have the superior vision that can help them pick up the anticipatory cues they need earlier, making raw reaction speed less important.* ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=708))

- Each year for five years, the scientists gauged the children first on tennis-specific skills and then on measures of general athleticism. Schneider’s expectation was that tennis-specific skills acquired through practice—like the accuracy with which a player could return a ball back to a specific target—would have predictive value for how highly ranked the children would be as adults. And he was correct. When the researchers eventually fit their data to the actual rankings of the players later on, the children’s tennis-specific skill scores predicted 60 to 70 percent of the variance in their eventual adult tennis ranking. But another finding surprised Schneider. The tests of general athleticism—for example, a thirty-meter sprint and start-and-stop agility drills—influenced which children would acquire the tennis-specific skills most rapidly. “When we omitted these motor abilities, our model no longer fit the ranking data,” Schneider says. “So we said, okay, we have to keep that in our model.” In other words, over the five years of the study, the kids who were better all-around athletes were better at acquiring tennis-specific skills. As with the study that examined depth perception and the ability to learn a catching skill, superior hardware was speeding the download of tennis-skill software. Schneider’s study received significant attention in Germany, but because it was published in German, it garnered scant notice in the rest of the world.

- Steffi Graf, two of the most dominant players in history. “We called Steffi Graf the perfect tennis talent,” Schneider says. “She outperformed the others in tennis-specific skills and basic motor skills, and we also predicted from her lung capacity that she could have ended up as the European champion in the 1500-meters.” Graf was at the top of every single test, from measures of her competitive desire to her ability to sustain concentration to her running speed. Years later, when Graf was the best tennis player in the world, she would train for endurance alongside Germany’s Olympic track runners.

- Some of the traits that help predict the future pros are behavioral. The future pros not only tend to practice more, but they take responsibility for practicing better.

- For his first endurance run with the cross-country team the boy was paired with Doug Boyle, another tenth grader who was blessedly like-minded and equally inexperienced. “We turned to each other and said, ‘I’ve never run five miles before without stopping,’” the boy would recall decades later. “‘Let’s help each other. Let’s run slow enough that we can run the whole way.’” And so they did, and they were both elated. And then the going got steeper.

- In 2011, the HERITAGE research group reported a breakthrough in exercise genetics: they identified twenty-one gene variants—slightly different versions of genes between people—that predict the inherited component of an individual subject’s aerobic improvement. That still leaves the half of aerobic trainability due to other factors, but the twenty-one gene markers had the power to delineate the high and low responders. HERITAGE subjects who had at least nineteen of the “favorable” versions of the genes improved their VO2max nearly three times as much as subjects who had fewer than ten.

- When I suggested to Tuomo Rankinen, one of the HERITAGE study scientists, that some people appear to be “aerobic time bombs” awaiting training, he laughed and suggested “trainability bombs” would be a better term. It is an idea that muddles the notion of innate talent as something that appears strictly prior to training. As to the other end of the trainability spectrum, an editorial in the Journal of Applied Physiology noted: “Unfortunately for the low responders in these studies, the predetermined (genetic) alphabet soup just may not ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1301))

- spell ‘runner.’” There is a bright side, though, even for them. The ultimate goal of the HERITAGE research was in line with the original promise of the Human Genome Project: to move toward personalized medicine. If doctors know how a patient responds to exercise, they can determine whether an exercise plan can usher in a desired health benefit, such as a drop in blood pressure or rise in cardiovascular power, or whether a particular low responder needs to be medicated. Fortunately, every single HERITAGE subject experienced health benefits from exercise. Even those who did not improve at all in aerobic capacity improved in some other health parameter, like blood pressure, cholesterol, or insulin sensitivity. (Then again, a small number of exercisers with two copies of a particular gene variant actually went in the wrong direction in terms of insulin sensitivity, suggesting that while physical activity moves most people away from becoming diabetic, it might actually move a small number of people closer.) A spectrum of low to high responders appeared in every physical quality measured, and the research team is busy looking for genes that predict trainability for each trait. Already, genes that help account for an individual’s drop in blood pressure and heart rate with training have been identified. Variations of the CREB1 gene, which influences the heart’s pacing, were found to help predict the magnitude of the drop in a person’s heart rate as he or she became more fit. A side effect of the HERITAGE findings was to identify genetic underpinnings, at least in that study sample, that tell the Doug Boyles from the Jim Ryuns. Not that Boyle was a slouch. In the mile time trial at the beginning of his senior year, he was third on the Wichita East team in 4:39. Ryun, meanwhile, cruised to a 4:06. By that point, though, Ryun and Boyle, initially equally intimidated by the prospect of a five-mile run, were continents and oceans apart in terms of their skill levels. Ryun had already been to the Tokyo Olympics and was one of the best runners in the world. Besotted with the success he had dreamed of back when he was making Superman shakes, and bolstered by personal attention from his coach, Ryun made the most of a high responder’s body, pushing through 120-mile weeks and crushing workouts that are painful for most runners even to think about. Undoubtedly, Ryun’s single-minded dedication to running as fast as possible foisted him into the athletic pantheon. But that followed on his body’s extraordinary ability to respond to training.

- One can only wonder where on the HERITAGE study spectrum the Ryun family would fall. When posed the question of whether other Ryun family members showed signs of being very responsive to endurance training, Ryun says: “That’s a good question. But I was the only person in my family who was athletic. Nobody else was interested.” What about his younger sister? “I don’t think she’s run at all,” he says. “She’s not very gifted in that area.” Then again, neither was big brother. Or so it seemed, before he started training. This is a story that plays out on every track in America—similar boys and girls miraculously become less similar despite training similarly—albeit in far… ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1322))

- So why had the natural suddenly decided, before the gun had even gone off, to drop out of the race at 600 meters? Scott was struggling mentally that season. His times weren’t improving, and planning to drop out was a safety valve that would release the pressure built up around him. If you drop out at 600, no one can say you failed, again, to improve your 800 time. No one can say that you have talent everyone else would kill for, but because you’re not getting faster you must be a head case. I, meanwhile, had improved relatively rapidly. I came to track late in a high school career that included football, basketball, and baseball, so I was less experienced than my recruited training partners. But, looking back, I believe that I was like a set of the HERITAGE subjects, a high responder with a low baseline.

- In Scott’s case, he would come into the season in relatively good shape and improve slowly and modestly, making it easy to brand him as a big talent who didn’t capitalize on his formidable gifts.

- When one HERITAGE study scientist examined some of my genetic data, he indicated that I am likely an above-average responder to aerobic training. I also know that my blood pressure drops rapidly when I exercise. And I suspect, based on the kind of training that most benefited me in college, that I am an even greater responder to sprint-based workouts. Just as for aerobic training, low and high responders have been documented in experiments that use training programs based on explosive exercise. (If there is a lesson to be gleaned from this branch of exercise genetics, it’s that there is no one-size-fits-all training plan.

- Cuban runner Alberto Juantorena, who in 1976 became the only athlete ever to win gold medals in both the 400- and 800-meters, had been an aspiring basketball player in 1971 when the national team basketball coach suggested he switch to running. “Thanks for the offer, but no, I’d rather not,” Juantorena insisted. “You know basketball is my life.” To which the coach responded: “We’re sorry, but it’s already been decided that you will change sports. Starting tomorrow, you are a runner, not a basketball player.” Juantorena made the Munich Olympics the very next year. But it could also be that some naturally fit people are not like Wellington or Wheating, but are instead like the low responders in the HERITAGE study, in which case they would not improve rapidly with training. (Bouchard’s research group also has DNA from three hundred endurance athletes with very high VO2max scores. Based on their gene variants, unsurprisingly, none of them is predicted to be at the low end of the responder spectrum.) Based on his data, Bouchard estimates that between one in ten and one in twenty people start with elevated aerobic capacity—though not nearly as high as the naturally fit six—and between one in ten and one in fifty people are high aerobic responders. “The probability that a person will be highly endowed and highly trainable is the product of those two probabilities,” Bouchard says. “It’s not pretty. It’s between one in one hundred and one in one thousand.” The ultimate combination, of course, would be a person who starts with a highly elevated aerobic capacity and has a rapid training response. It is very difficult to identify those people before they start training, as athletes are not normally subjected to lab tests until they have already accomplished something. Science is far better at looking at an elite athlete and retrospectively suggesting why that individual is succeeding than in finding someone who might ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1484))

- A portion of the improvements, though, even in straightforward athletic endeavors, are very clearly the result of technological enhancements. Biomechanical video analysis of legendary sprinter Jesse Owens, for example, has shown that his joints moved as fast in the 1930s as those of Carl Lewis in the 1980s, except Owens ran on cinder tracks that stole far more energy than the synthetic surfaces where Lewis set his records. But technology is not the only source of improvement that is often overlooked. Undoubtedly, the increasing amount and precision of practice has helped push the frontiers of performance. But the winner-take-all effect, combined with a global marketplace that has allowed many more people to audition for the minuscule number of increasingly lucrative roster spots, has indeed altered the gene pool. Not the gene pool in all of humanity, but certainly the gene pool within elite sports. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1725))

- At the time, anthropometrists felt that human physique was distributed along a bell curve, and the peak of the curve—the average—was the perfect form, with everything to the sides deviating by accident or fault. So they asserted that the best athletes would have the most well-rounded, or average, physical builds. Not too tall or too small, neither too skinny nor too bulky, but rather a just-right Goldilocks-porridge version of a man. (And it was only men.) That was the belief for any sport: the average human form would be ideal for all athletic pursuits. This confluence of subjective theory and philosophy dominated the agenda for coaches and physical education instructors in the early twentieth century, and it showed in athletes’ bodies. In 1925, an average elite volleyball player and discus thrower were the same size, as were a world-class high jumper and shot putter.

- But, as Norton and Olds saw, as winner-take-all markets emerged, the early-twentieth-century paradigm of the singular, perfect athletic body faded in favor of more rare and highly specialized bodies that fit like finches’ beaks into their athletic niches. When Norton and Olds plotted the heights and weights of modern world-class high jumpers and shot putters, they saw that the athletes had become stunningly dissimilar. The average elite shot putter is now 2.5 inches taller and 130 pounds heavier than the average international high jumper. On a height-versus-weight graph, the duo plotted the average physiques of elite athletes in two dozen sports; one data point for the average build of an athlete in each sport in 1925, and another for the average build of an athlete in that same sport seventy years later. When they connected the dots from 1925 to the present for each sport, a distinct pattern appeared. Early in the twentieth century, the top athletes from every sport clustered around that “average” physique that coaches once favored and were grouped in a relatively tight nucleus on the graph, but they had since blasted apart in all directions. The graph looked like the charts that astronomers constructed to show the movement of galaxies away from one another in our expanding universe.

- And the Big Bang of body types goes down to the body-part level as well. While tall athletes have grown taller at a much faster rate than humanity as a whole, and small athletes have shrunk relatively smaller, athletes in certain sports have increasingly needed extremely specialized body traits. Measurements of elite Croatian water polo players from 1980 to 1998 show that over two decades the players’ arm lengths increased more than an inch, five times as much as those of the Croatian population during the same period. As performance requirements become stricter, only the athletes with the necessary physical structure consistently make the grade at the elite level. The shorter-armed athletes are more often weeded out. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1768))

- One reason that marathon runners tend to be diminutive is because small humans have a larger skin surface area compared with the volume of their body. The greater one’s surface area compared with volume, the better the human radiator and the more quickly the body unloads heat. (Hence, short, skinny people get cold more easily than tall, hefty people.) Heat dissipation is critical for endurance performance, because the central nervous system forces a slowdown or complete stop of effort when the body’s core temperature passes about 104 degrees.* ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1794))

- The more that elite sports markets have shifted from participatory affairs to events for bulging masses of spectators, the more rare the bodies required for success have become, and the greater the money needed to attract those rare bodies to a particular sport. In 1975, athletes in the major American sports averaged roughly five times the median salary for an American man. Today, the average salaries in those sports are between about forty and one hundred times the median full-time salary. In order to match a single year’s salary of the highest-paid athletes, an American man making the country’s median annual income for a full-time job would have to work for five hundred years.

One bookcase that is four inches wider than another will weigh only slightly more. But fill both cases with books and suddenly the little bit of extra width on the broader bookcase translates to a considerable amount of weight. Such is the case with the human skeleton. In measurements of thousands of elite athletes from soccer to weight lifting, wrestling, boxing, judo, rugby, and more, Holway has found that each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms (11 pounds) of muscle. Five-to-one, then, is a general limit of the human muscle bookcase.* ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1867))

- Heaving sports performance to untouched heights requires both specialized training and specialized bodies to be trained. Today, the expanding universe of athletic body types is slowing down. Much of the self-sorting, or artificial selection, is finished. The tall athletes are no longer getting taller compared with the rest of humanity at the rate they were two decades ago, nor the small smaller. And the march of constantly shattered world records is slowing right along with it. Over most of the twentieth century, the adage “records were made to be broken” rang chronically true. But athletic records in most, but certainly not all, events that have high historical participation are now inching forward—if, that is, they are moving forward at all. The coveted world records in the men’s mile and 1,500-meters (the race close to the mile that is run outside the United States) were broken collectively about eight times per decade from the 1950s to 2000, but not at ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1886))

- all since. Other records have continued to creep down, but usually by small margins. It will be intriguing to see whether the financial success of Usain Bolt, who dropped records by rather large margins, draws more athletes with his unusual combination of explosiveness and height away from other sports to sprinting. “There are still some unexploited parts of the world, but we’ve reached much of the global market,” says Tim Olds, one of the Big Bang of body types scientists. “We’re getting closer to reaching the limit of our source populations for bodies. Population progression is slowing globally, so we’re going to see slowing growth in both body size and body shapes, and in records as well.” Just as exploring the earth must once have seemed like an endless endeavor for adventurers, perhaps the era of constant record shattering is largely in the past, and the future will be one of baby steps forward. As the expanding universe of sports physiques has sped outward, finding those increasingly rare bodies has fostered an increasingly extensive, and expensive, global talent search. In that endeavor, no league has been more successful than the National Basketball Association. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=1893))

- Height is an incredibly narrowly constrained trait among humans. Fully 68 percent of American men are in just the six-inch range from 5'7" to 6'1". The bell curve of adult height is a Himalayan slope that falls off precipitously on either side of the mean. A mere 5 percent of American men are 6'3" or taller, while the average height of an NBA player perennially hovers around 6'7". Suffice it to say that there is startlingly little overlap—far less than Cowherd suggested—between the heights of humanity and those of NBA players. While inhabitants of the industrialized world grew taller over much of the twentieth century at a rate of about one centimeter per decade—at least partly because of increased protein intake and the decline of growth-stunting childhood infections, and perhaps because people are mixing genes more widely, with “tall” genes dominating “short” genes—NBA players have been growing at more than four times that rate, and the tallest of the tall NBA players at ten times that rate.

- Repeatedly, studies of families and twins find the heritability of height to be about 80 percent. That means that 80 percent of the difference in height between people in the group that is being studied is attributable to genetics, and around 20 percent to the environment. (In nonindustrialized societies, the heritability of height is lower, as many citizens, like plants in poor soil, are prevented by nutritional ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2023))

- deficiencies or infections from reaching their genetic height potential.) So if the tallest 5 percent of citizens in a given population are a foot taller than the shortest 5 percent, genetics will account for about ten inches of the disparity. For much of the twentieth century, denizens of industrialized societies were growing taller at a rate of about one centimeter per decade. In the seventeenth century, the average Frenchman was 5'4", which is now the average for an American woman. The first generation of Japanese born to immigrant parents in America, known as the Nisei, famously towered over their parents. In the 1960s, growth expert J. M. Tanner examined a set of identical twins that suggested the range of height variability caused by the environment. The identical boys were separated at birth, one brother raised in a nurturing household, and the other reared by a sadistic relative who kept him locked in a darkened room and made him plead for sips of water. In adulthood, the brother from the nurturing household was three inches taller than his identical twin, but many of their body proportions were similar. “The genetic control of shape is more rigorous than that of size,” Tanner wrote in Fetus into Man.

Modern Japanese people are still short compared with Europeans, but not as short as they once were. And they now have more similar proportions.

Every study that has examined race differences in body types has documented a disparity between black and white people that remains whether they reside in Africa, Europe, or the Americas. For any given sitting height—that is, the height of one’s head when one is sitting in a chair—Africans or African Americans have longer legs than Europeans. For a sitting height of two feet, an African American boy will tend to have legs that are 2.4 inches longer than a European boy’s. Legs make up a greater proportion of the body in an individual of recent African origin.* And this holds for elite athletes.

- Asians have a long history of success in weight lifting and gymnastics,” write Norton and Olds, the Big Bang of body types gurus, in their textbook Anthropometrica. The limb-length difference manifests in NBA data as well.* In NBA predraft measurements for active players, the average white American NBA player was 6'7½" with a wingspan of 6'10". The average African American NBA player was 6'5½" with a 6'11" wingspan; shorter but longer. Both white and black players in the NBA have wingspan-to-height ratios much greater than the population average, but there’s a sizable gap between white and black players. The average ratio for a white American NBA player is 1.035, and for an African American NBA player 1.071. Still, there is wide variation among players within a given ethnicity. Two white players, Coby Karl (height: 6'3½", wingspan: 6'11") and Cole Aldrich (height: 6'9", wingspan: 7'4¾"), for example, have wingspan-to-height ratios approaching 1.10, but they are significant outliers compared with the other white players in the NBA. No other white players are even close, whereas a number of black players have larger ratios. When I showed this data to a scientist who studies athletes’ bodies, he responded: “So maybe it’s not so much that white men can’t ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2070))

- jump. White men just can’t reach high.”* In a sense, this is last millennium’s news to scientists who have been studying body forms. In 1877, American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen published a seminal paper in which he noted that the extremities of animals get longer and thinner as one travels closer to the equator. African elephants can be distinguished from Asian elephants by their sail-like floppy ears. This is because the ears, like your skin, act as a radiator to release heat. The greater the surface area of the radiator compared with its volume, the more quickly heat is released. The African elephants, having evolved closer to the equator, have developed larger ears for cooling purposes. “Allen’s rule,” that animals from warmer climates tend to have longer limbs, has been extended to humans by a veritable filing cabinet full of studies. A 1998 analysis of hundreds of studies of native populations from around the world found that the higher the average annual… ([Location 2080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2080))

- length, they grouped by geography. Low-latitude Africans and Australian Aborigines had the proportionally longest legs and shortest torsos. So this is not strictly about ethnicity so much as geography. Or latitude and climate, to be more precise. Africans with ancestry in southern regions of the continent, farther from the equator, do not necessarily have especially long limbs. But whether an African person in the study was from a population in Nigeria or from a genetically and physically distinct population in Ethiopia, so long as he was from low latitude his legs were likely longer than those of a height-matched European. And certainly longer than those of an Inuit from northern Canada, as Inuit tend to be short and stocky with compact limbs and a wide pelvis.* In the nineteenth century, Allen surmised that the long limbs of low-latitude animals were a direct result of a warm climate. In other words, he guessed that if a baby African elephant were adopted by Asian elephant parents and raised at high latitude in Asia, it would… ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2089))

Why not just use a tape measure? All that ACTN3 can tell us, it seems, is who will not be competing in the 100-meter final in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. And it is not even doing a very specific job of that, given that it is only ruling out about one billion of the seven billion people on earth.

- Simpson’s story is emblematic of the best of the Jamaican system: nearly every kid is made to sprint at some point in youth races (Simpson’s first wins came as a five-year-old in relays at the annual sports day held for Jamaican schoolkids), and adult track enthusiasts, like Fuller and Gayle, keep their eyes peeled for speedy youth and recruit them to good track high schools. There, they are developed very slowly, but get big-race experience at Champs, where they earn adoration and scholarships by performing well. Or, for the best of the best, a shoe company endorsement and membership in a pro club. The Jamaican sprint system resembles football in the United States, replete with its own shady boosters. (Several high school coaches at Champs told me that they are now banned from giving refrigerators to parents in an effort to recruit their children.) This island-wide, sprint-talent-spotting-and-capture system has paid off ([Location 2551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2551))

- in Olympic gold for Jamaica. None other than Usain Bolt pined to be a cricket star in his youth (his second choice was soccer) until he started blowing away his peers in sprints on sports day and was pushed into track and field as a fourteen-year-old—and even then was renowned for ditching practice—ultimately setting Champs records in the 200 and 400 in 2003. Yohan Blake, Bolt’s training partner who finished second to him in the 100 and 200 at the 2012 London Olympics, also wanted to be a cricketer, but was identified as a sprinter during sports day at age twelve. Even top American sprinters often come via the Jamaican talent-spotting system. Sanya Richards-Ross, an American who won gold in the 400-meters in London, lived in Jamaica until she was twelve and was plucked by a primary school track coach when, at seven years old, she outstripped older girls in races on sports day. “The coach said, ‘Yep, you’re coming out for the track team,’” Richards-Ross says. Physiology findings indicate that endurance training can enhance the ability of fast-twitch muscle fibers to resist fatigue, but that sprint training does not increase the speed at which slow-twitch fibers contract. So being endowed with a large proportion of fast-twitch fibers is essential for an elite sprinter.

- football coaches: “You can’t teach speed.” This is an exaggeration, as speed—and certainly the ability to sustain speed—can be improved. But recall the Netherlands’ Groningen soccer talent studies. No matter the training, the slow kids never catch up to the fast kids in sprint speed. And the words of Justin Durandt, manager of the Discovery High Performance Centre at the Sports Science Institute of South Africa: “We’ve tested over ten thousand boys, and I’ve never seen a boy who was slow become fast.” Slow kids never make fast adults. So keeping the swiftest kids in the sprint pipeline is paramount. And in what country other than Jamaica could a boy with blinding speed and who stands 6'4" at the age of fifteen, as Bolt did, end up anywhere but on the basketball or volleyball court or the football field? If he’s born in the United States, Bolt is no doubt ushered toward the… ([Location 2566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2566))

- It is the island-wide talent-spotting system—in which every kid is made to try sprinting at some point—that Pitsiladis credits with Jamaican sprint success. Not to say that genes don’t matter. “You absolutely must choose your parents correctly to be a world record holder,” he says, rhetorically. “But Jamaica has thousands and thousands sprinting, and you get the best coming through. That’s what accounts for this phenomenon. If you had this in any other country, you would see exactly the same thing.” When a Scottish publication solicited Pitsiladis’s advice for aspiring United Kingdom athletes, he responded: “Go into sprinting. Don’t worry because you’re white. It’s got nothing to do with the color of your skin.” His friend and colleague Errol Morrison would heartily disagree.

- The scientists’ most unique finding, though, was not the length of the legs, but their girth. The volume and average thickness of the lower legs of the Kalenjin boys was 15 to 17 percent less than in the Danish boys. The finding is substantial because the leg is akin to a pendulum, and the greater the weight at the end of the pendulum, the more energy is required to swing it.* Biologists have demonstrated this in humans in controlled conditions. In one particularly well-controlled study, researchers experimented with adding weights onto different parts of runners’ bodies: the waist, the upper thigh, the upper shin, and around the ankle. Even when the weight stayed the same, the farther down the leg it was placed the greater the energetic cost to the runners. In one phase, each runner had to wear eight pounds around his waist, which required about 4 percent more energy to run at a given pace compared with when he wasn’t wearing eight pounds of weights. But when the runners were subsequently equipped with a four-pound weight on each ankle they burned energy 24 percent more rapidly while running at the same pace, ([Location 2893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2893))

- even though their total weight had not changed one ounce from the previous condition. Weight that is far out on the limbs is called “distal weight,” and the less of it a distance runner has, the better (i.e., if you have thick calves and ankles, you won’t be winning the New York City Marathon). A separate research team calculated that adding just one tenth of one pound to the ankle increases oxygen consumption during running by about 1 percent. (Engineers at Adidas replicated that finding in the process of constructing lighter shoes.) Compared with the Danish runners, the Kalenjin runners tested by the Danish scientists had nearly a pound less weight in their lower legs. The scientists calculated the energy savings at 8 percent per kilometer. “Running economy” is the measure of how much oxygen a runner utilizes to run at a given pace. Much like the fuel economy of a car, you get a certain amount of bang for a certain amount of gas, and that differs according to the size and shape of the car. Elite distance runners have both high VO2max and good running economy. Or, to continue the car analogy, the rare mix of a big engine and good fuel economy. Among elite runners, all of whom have large engines, running economy ([Location 2901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2901))

Proportionally long legs and thin lower legs contribute separately to good running economy, and they had both.* Even the Kalenjin city boys, who were less active and less aerobically fit than the Danish boys, started with better running economy. Both within and between groups of Kenyan and Danish runners, lower leg thickness was an important predictor of running… ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2910))

- among Kenyans. German teams won the team dressage competition at every Olympics from 1984 to 2008, which, on a strictly population basis, is very unlikely. Still, we can all probably agree that German equestrians probably don’t have dressage genes in greater frequency than is found among equestrians in neighboring European countries. But dressage is not a mass participation sport, so, frankly, any nation that is trying hard—German dressage was partly funded by the horse breeding industry—will do well. Canada produces the most NHL players because Canada invented ice hockey and, really, how many countries even have significant participation in hockey? The answer: not all that many. Or consider baseball’s World Series, which is anything but a world series. Plus, for years, the rest of the world was helping Kenya by getting slower. Even before Kenya commandeered the international running scene, the countries that had dominated distance running—Britain, Finland, the United States—were growing increasingly wealthy, increasingly overweight, increasingly interested in other sports, and increasingly less likely to train seriously in distance running. Between 1983 and 1998, the number of U.S. men who ran under 2:20 in the marathon for the year declined from 267 to 35. Great Britain ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2974))

- declined from 137 to 17 over the same time period. The American nadir was 2000, when the United States qualified only one man for the Sydney Olympic marathon. Finland, which was the top distance running power in the world between World Wars I and II, when it was a poor rural country, did not qualify a single distance runner in any event at the 2000 Olympics. As Brother Colm O’Connell, a Patrician brother who came from Ireland to Kenya to teach high school in 1976 and stayed to coach elite runners—including current 800-meter world record holder David Rudisha—told me: “The genes didn’t go away in Finland, the culture did.” A few countries held steady from the 1980s through the millennium, like Japan, which has between 100 and 130 sub-2:20 men just about every year. Meanwhile, Kenya jumped from a single sub-2:20 man in 1980 to 541 in 2006. (Kenyan marathoners really exploded in the mid-nineties, as the notion in Kenya that marathon training caused male infertility receded, and after Kenya’s sports commissioner, KenSAP’s own Dr. Mike Boit, allowed agents into the country and alleviated travel restrictions on athletes.) Here’s the conclusion of Peter Matthews, the track-and-field statistician who compiled those numbers: “In these days of computer games, sedentary pursuits, and ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=2983))

- Interestingly, a system that thrives on the hard work of many is fueled by an abiding belief in natural talent. The Kenyan coaches and runners I spoke with almost uniformly said that it was never too late to begin training. If one has talent, they said, then one just needs to start training hard and elite status will come swiftly. A number of Kenya’s most luminous running stars have succeeded precisely because they did not assume it was too late. In a hotel in Nairobi I met Paul Tergat, ([Location 3030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3030))

- former marathon world record holder and the greatest cross-country runner in history, who told me that he played volleyball in high school and didn’t start running until “between nineteen and twenty, when I started the military. There I met a number of great runners I used to read about, like Moses Tanui and Richard Chelimo. So I trained, and by twenty-one I realized I had the talent.” And by twenty-five he had won the first of five consecutive world cross-country championships. The similarity to Jamaican sprinting—or to Canadian hockey, or to Brazilian soccer—is that there is a large number of athletes put in the top of the funnel, and a smaller number who display talent and survive the rigorous training and come out the bottom as world beaters. While some of Kenya’s best runners have entered the game very late, for scores of others, training starts very early in life, before they even know it.

- No one has conducted a study of the running economy of untrained Ethiopian children, as the Danish scientists did in Kenya, so it is unknown how the Oromo compare with the Kalenjin in that respect, but it is clear that these two groups both embrace running as a way of life. “You have all these kids running,” says Pitsiladis, “and then a boy or girl sees that they can run faster than the others. You absolutely must have the right genes. You must choose your parents correctly, but you have thousands of kids running and the cream rises to the top. After ten years of work, I have to say that this is a socioeconomic phenomenon.” When I asked Ethiopian icon Derartu Tulu—Olympic 10K gold medalist in 1992 and 2000—if any of her two biological or four adopted kids like to run with her, she replied: “No, they say they get tired when I take them ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3065))

I think it is because they go to school by car.” Says Moses Kiptanui, the Kenyan former steeplechase world record holder, of his children: “A vehicle came and took them to school . . . they like to do easier sports.” “How many of the top Kenyan runners have sons or daughters who are excelling at running?” Pitsiladis asks, rhetorically, after noting that there are plenty of Kenyan siblings and cousins who excel. “Almost none. Why? Because their father or mother becomes a world champion, has incredible resources, and the child never has to run to school again.” ([Location 3071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3071))

- Pitsiladis believes adamantly that in addition to the large number of running kids, there is another essential component to Kenyan running success. It is exactly what the Rift Valley ledges that are home to both the Kalenjin in Kenya and the Oromo in Ethiopia share: altitude. “You must live at altitude,” Pitsiladis says. “Some have said that the best way is to live high and train low.

- Preferable to moving to altitude to train is being born there. Altitude natives who are born and go through childhood at elevation tend to have proportionally larger lungs than sea-level natives, and large lungs have large surface areas that permit more oxygen to pass from the lungs into the blood.

- When I last spoke with Berardelli he had just begun to coach a group of Indian athletes who came to Kenya to train. On the face of it, they have incredible environmental similarities to his Kenyan runners: impoverished backgrounds, high motivation, and childhoods filled with running for transportation. If distance running success requires only monetary incentives, childhood running, and world-class training, then expect to see some of Berardelli’s Indian pupils alongside the Kenyans soon. “So,” Berardelli said, with a doubtful smirk. “We will see.” Berardelli believes that the Kenyans are, in general, more likely to be gifted runners. But he also knows that no matter their talent or body type or childhood environment or country of origin, 2:05 marathoners do not fall from the sky. Their gifts must be coupled with herculean will. Although that, too, is not entirely separable from innate talent. ([Location 3267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3267))

Those that weren’t directly from Zorro included his half-brother Larry, his nephew Battel, and Zorro himself. Just more than nine days later, with tears frozen to his face, Mackey passed beneath the burled arch in first place. “Life just changed,” Mackey told his dogs. And so did dogsled racing. Suddenly, Mackey’s competitors wanted to copy the marathon style. Overnight his kennel went from home of cheap castoffs to a yard full of coveted bloodlines, with dogs worth four figures each, at least. (According to Tonya Mackey, Zorro’s son Hobo was purchased by another musher and then “tossed all around Norway breeding, at a couple grand for each breeding.”) In 2008, Mackey won the Iditarod again, his second of four straight. In a race a few weeks later, a drunk snowmobile driver rammed his team. Zorro had to be airlifted to Seattle with three broken ribs, a bruised lung, internal bleeding, and spinal damage so severe he couldn’t stand. Zorro survived, but a veterinarian ordered that he be retired from breeding and racing. Mackey built Zorro a doghouse in the yard, but quickly saw that his relentless runner would whine and tug at his chain if he was passed over while other dogs were taken out on a run. So Mackey built him the “condo on the hill,” his fenced-in area in front of the house. “He’s still the badass in the ([Location 3377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3377))

Particular versions of dopamine receptor genes have been associated with higher physical activity and lower body mass index. Multiple studies—including a meta-analysis of all published studies—have also replicated the finding that one of those variants, the 7R version of the DRD4 gene, increases an individual’s risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Tim Lightfoot, director of the Sydney and J. L. Huffines Institute for Sports Medicine and Human Performance at Texas A&M, has authored papers on voluntary physical activity in rodents and humans, and he sees a connection between ADHD, exercise, and dopamine genes. “The high active mice we bred in the lab,” Lightfoot says, “they mimic ADHD kids, at least as far as the dopamine system goes. . . . They’re low on [a particular kind of] dopamine receptors, and if you can drive the amount of dopamine up, their physical activity decreases.” ([Location 3507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=3507))

- Steve Jobs famously said that he had long thought his personality was entirely the result of his life experiences until, as an adult, he met for the first time novelist Mona Simpson, the sister he did not know he had. Jobs marveled at how similar he was to Simpson despite having grown up with a different family. “I used to be way over on the nurture side, but I’ve swung way over to the nature side,” Jobs told the New York Times in 1997. “And it’s because of Mona and having kids. My daughter is fourteen months old, and it’s already pretty clear what her personality is.” As the study of genes matures, we will increasingly find genetic inputs—some large and many trivial—behind the sports stories we tell. But we are unlikely ever to receive complete answers from genetics alone, and not merely because environment and training are always critical factors. Recall that even for height, an easily measurable trait, scientists needed several thousand subjects and hundreds of thousands of spots of DNA ([Location 4168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=4168))

- code to account for even half of the variance in height between adults. It is increasingly clear that many traits are influenced by the interplay of large numbers of DNA variations. Thus, studies will require hundreds or even thousands of subjects to get at the genetic root of such traits. But there aren’t thousands of elite 100-meter runners in the world. Additionally, the gene variants that make one sprinter fast may be completely distinct from those that make her competitor in the next lane fast. Remember, with HCM, the disease that leads to sudden death in athletes, most of the distinct, known gene variants that cause the disease are “private” mutations. That is, they have thus far been located only in a single family. The same physical outcome can sometimes be reached via many different genetic pathways. Nonetheless, as I am writing this, headlines are erupting with the news that Japanese scientists have created fertile eggs from mouse stem cells. On the radio, a scientist just speculated that the breakthrough will ultimately lead to the ability to engineer offspring for specific traits, including athleticism.

And one month after that, a Kenyan man and a Kenyan woman won their respective races at the New York City Marathon. But don’t be deceived by the word Kenya. As if to put an exclamation point on chapters 12 and 13 of this book, every single one of those athletes was from the minority Kalenjin tribe—source population: five million. That’s the size of Costa Rica. Can you imagine if Costa Rican runners went one through five in a major marathon? In Kalenjin runners, we are witnessing the greatest overrepresentation of world-class athletic prowess that humanity has ever seen. Try this for perspective: as of this writing, seventeen American men—and fourteen Brits—in history have run a marathon faster than 2:10 (or 4:58 per mile pace); seventy-two Kalenjin have done it this year. It is a testament to both the unique physiology and the training environment of the Kalenjin people. And also to a certain psyche exemplified by Dennis Kimetto, who was not a particularly prominent name in the running world before he won the 2013 Chicago Marathon in a blistering, course record time. Upon crossing the line, the twenty-nine-year-old Kimetto confessed that he was a running neophyte. “Before 2010,” he said, “I was concentrating on farming and had never run before. I had literally never run before. I was farming maize and tending cows.” When I visited Kenya for the reporting of this book, I marveled at the never-too-late mentality of Kalenjin runners, in addition to their slender bodies. Kimetto began serious running only in his mid-twenties after a famous marathoner met him in a shopping center and invited him to train. I can’t help but think how that meeting would have transpired had Kimetto been living in the United States or Europe. Perhaps he would have considered it for a moment and smiled to himself at the ([Location 4251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=4251))

- fanciful thought of transforming from a farmer into a professional athlete; of raising his arms to break the finishing tape at a big-city marathon and coming home to the rural Rift Valley a hero with a six-figure payday. And then the daydream would break, and he would realize that it was too late. The time for that had passed. Too many others had too big a head start. That is, after all, the oft-unspoken underbelly of strict 10,000-hours-rule thinking, which says that only accumulated practice matters for achievement. If only practice matters, and your competitors have logged far more practice hours than you, success is a lost cause. Thank goodness, then, that the “rule” hasn’t made its way to the western Rift Valley Province. A staple of the Kalenjin running phenomenon has been twenty-something men and women beginning serious training for the first time on the assumption that, if they have sufficient talent, momentous motivation, and are willing to suffer through vigorous training, they can catch up to those who have logged many more hours. It is the never-too-late mentality that gave the sports world (and this book) the wonderful stories of athletes like high jumper Donald Thomas and triathlete Chrissie Wellington. I mention this because The Sports Gene reached a broader audience than I ever considered possible. (President Barack Obama was photographed picking up a copy on Small Business Saturday.) The book’s success emboldened me in my belief that readers want to understand cutting-edge science and are not afraid of complexity. It also meant that the ink was barely dry on the first printing when the implications of my critique of the 10,000-hours rule became a topic of mainstream news coverage. One of my staunchest critics was British journalist Matthew Syed, author of Bounce, a popular book about high performance that leans heavily on the 10,000-hours rule (also known as the ten-year rule) and seeks to minimize the importance of genes.

- After The Sports Gene came out, Malcolm Gladwell addressed my critique of the 10,000-hours rule in several venues, always thoughtfully, including when (to my surprise) he joined in via phone during a radio interview I was doing with KPCC public radio in California. On the program, Gladwell said that the 10,000-hours idea shouldn’t be applied to sports, and was meant only for “cognitively complex” activities. Joe Baker, a sports psychologist who studies skill development, noted in response: “Perception and action in sports are among the most complex things humans can do. Not only is execution complex, but there’s often ([Location 4364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AEDDQKE&location=4364))

- somebody trying to prevent you from executing.” During our KPCC interview, Gladwell elaborated and said that his point was that learning difficult skills that require a large body of knowledge, like playing chess or music or computer programming, requires a lot of practice, often much more than most people assume. I suppose that depends on what most people assume. If the idea is that loads of practice—and specifically high-quality practice—is critically important, then I wholeheartedly agree.
