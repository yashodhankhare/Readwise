## Highlights
- How, for instance, do we draw a coherent picture that encompasses both human meanings and fragmented bits of information? In what ways do stories (say, of the woman and her corpulent uncle) and statistics (say, of legal malpractice) prove cogent and binding? Are not statistical notions refinements and distillations of ideas suggested by repetitive stories and events? What are the narrative implications of the mathematical notions of complexity and “order for free”? What do interpretations of literature have in common with applications of statistics? What does literary criticism have to do with cryptography? ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=83))

- In the following connected essays I hope to cast an oblique but penetrating light on these questions. Some of the oddities and problems associated with the obvious gulf between stories and statistics (such as mistaking anecdotes for statistical evidence or, conversely, taking averages to be descriptive of individual cases) are the result of applying a logic appropriate in one domain to another, quite disparate, one. Unlike the logic of mathematics and the physical sciences, the truths of informal, everyday logic depend critically on context and on the individual, nonsubstitutable aspects of any situation. Projecting specific conditions of a ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=88))

- game or activity, say, or particular religious beliefs onto the physical universe—or, conversely, deriving strategies for such a game or activity or for an individual’s religious beliefs from the laws of physics—is only one example of this confusion of domains. So too, in a slightly different way, is the ascribing of significance to biblical codes. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=92))

- Since synecdocheis a literary term for a figure of speech in which the part is substituted for the whole, or sometimes the other way around, its use is somewhat analogous to substituting a sample for the whole population. With this bit of pedantry we have already landed our first piece of kite string across the chasm. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=122))

- Admit it or not, we are all statisticians, as when we make grand inferences about a person from that tiny sample of behavior known as a first impression. The difference between mathematical statistics and the everyday variety often is simply the degree of formalization and objective rigor.

- We want answers to questions such as how many, how likely, and what percentage, of course. But we also want to know whether the numbers on homelessness or child abuse, say, come from police blotter reports (in which case they are likely to be low) or whether they come from scientifically controlled studies (in which case they are likely to be somewhat higher) or whether they come from the press releases of groups with an ideological axe* to grind (in which case they are liable to be extremely high—or extremely low, depending on the ideology).

- informal logic are as essential to this task as an understanding of the formal statistical notions; both are preconditions for numeracy. Although many stories need no numbers, some accounts without supporting statistics run the risk of being dismissed as anecdotal. Conversely, while some figures are almost self-explanatory, statistics without any context always run the risk of being arid, irrelevant, even meaningless.

- A similar point can be made about the birth order effect, the topic of a book by Frank Sulloway in which he maintains that despite sharing 50 percent of their DNA siblings differ systematically from each other owing to their order of birth. Sulloway ascribes this difference to family dynamics: firstborns establish a niche in the family, and to protect it they remain more attentive to their parents’ desires and therefore tend to be conservative and supportive of the status quo. Laterborns must find more creative ways to compete with their older siblings for ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=208))

- parental favors, and thus tend to be more innovative. Both the topic and the book are huge and statistics plays a key role in Sulloway’s argument, but as in the case of the Consumer Price Index, the ambient story and its assumptions are necessary and open to criticism (even if the formal mathematics is unexceptionable). Why, for example, are only children considered firstborns? They’re also the “babies” of their families. Is functional birth order (due to adoption, sibling death, desertion, etc.) a reasonable substitute for biological birth order? How does one decide whether a scientist or political figure (those whom Sulloway studied) should be classified as a conservative or a liberal? What effects might be a consequence of limiting the study to only those historical figures famous enough to have been written about? Without going into such complex issues, I do want to stress that denial of the mutual dependence of stories and statistics—and the pedagogy that results from such denial—is one reason for the disesteem in which statistics, and mathematics and science generally, are widely held. Its practitioners are ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=212))

- Stories not only provide context for statistical statements but can illustrate and vivify them as well:* A bookish, somewhat nerdy man is telling his kids the Leo Rosten story about the famous rabbi who was asked by an admiring student how it was that the rabbi always had a perfect parable for any subject.

- Stories and statistics offer us the complementary choices of knowing a lot about a few people or knowing a little about many people. The first option leads to the common observation that novels illuminate great truths of the human condition. Novels are multivalent and bursting with ironies, details, and metaphors, while social science and demographic statistics can seem simple-minded and repellingly earnest by comparison. We can easily delude ourselves, however, into thinking that more of a general nature is being revealed to us by a memoir, personal reminiscence, novel, or short story than is truly the case. Biased and small samples are always major problems, of course, ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=342))

- To tell us anything useful, multiple correlation analysis must be based on a relatively large number of people and a much smaller number of characteristics. Yet the insights that commonly come from stories and everyday life are precisely the opposite. We each know in a full-bodied way relatively few people, and for these people the number of characteristics, relationships, characteristics of relationships, relationships of characteristics, and so on that we are aware of is indeterminately large. Thus we tend to overestimate our general knowledge of others and are convinced of all sorts of associations (more complicated variants of “more shy, less intelligent”) that are simply bogus. By failing to adjust downward our multiple correlation coefficients, so to speak, we convince ourselves that we know all manner of stuff that just isn’t so.

- The so-called null hypothesis in statistics is the assumption that the phenomenon, relationship, or hypothesis under observation is not significant but merely the result of chance. To reject the null hypothesis it is conventional to require that the probability of the phenomenon occurring merely by chance be less than 5 percent. (This is the source of the story about the statistician who witnessed the decapitation of twenty-five cows, noted that one survived the ordeal, and dismissed the phenomenon as not significant.) In my peregrinations through this world I’ve observed that few people regularly make decisions like this in their personal lives; it would be too boring even if such precision were possible. (Having offered a partial defense of stereotypes, ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=409))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- I should mention that a common related stereotype of statisticians is that they are people who chose their profession because they couldn’t stand the excitement of accounting.) The idea of boredom suggests yet another difference between stories and statistics. In listening to stories we are inclined to suspend disbelief so as to be entertained, whereas in evaluating statistics we are inclined to suspend belief so as not to be beguiled. In statistics we are said to commit a Type I error when we reject a truth and a Type II error when we accept a falsehood. Of course, there is no way to always avoid both types of error, and we have different error thresholds in different endeavors. Nevertheless, the type of error people feel more comfortable making gives some indication of their intellectual personality type. People who like to be entertained and beguiled and hate the prospect of making a Type I error may be more likely to prefer stories to statistics. Those who do not like being entertained or beguiled and hate the prospect of making a Type II error may be more likely to prefer statistics to stories. In any case, this speculation is a short story with no statistics to back it up, so make of it what you wish. Although wrong much of the time, we have more confidence in our own gut decisions than we do in public ones. We all (not just right-wing Republicans) distrust decisions that are made far from us. We insist on exacting statistical protocols in public decision making, yet oftentimes accept the sloppiest reasoning from those closest to us. In small groups there is trust and little perceived need for statistics. As Theodore Porter has shown in his Trust in Numbers, quantitative methods and controls often arise owing to the political weakness of expert communities and a suspicion of their findings by the larger community. Those anticipating distrust are most likely to undergird their conclusions with substantial statistics, or at least adorn them with fake statistical finery. The sheer impersonality of statistics is attractive to those who dislike the messiness, intimacy, and (melo) drama of particular stories, situations, and people. Stories, it would seem, appeal more to stereotypical women, statistics to stereotypical men (according to conventional wisdom; I have no ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=414))

- MURPHY'S LAW AND THAT PUT-UPON FEELING Another instance of the connection between the personalization of events and mild paranoia is Murphy’s Law. First formulated by the engineer Edward Murphy, it ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=555))

- states that generally whatever can go wrong will go wrong. Contrary to the tongue-in-cheek aspect of this characterization, there is something profound about the phenomenon it describes. In many situations the failure of things to work right is not a result of personal bad luck but a consequence of the complexity and interdependence of many systems. A homely, counterintuitive example of Murphy’s Law comes from probability theory and was recently elaborated on by science writer Robert Matthews. Imagine you have 10 pairs of socks and that despite your best efforts 6 socks disappear. (The solution to the problem of the socks’ disappearance and their whereabouts is yet another holy grail.) The question is, what is more likely— that you’re lucky and end up with 7 complete pairs (i.e., the 6 missing socks come from only 3 pairs), or that you’re unlucky and end up with only 4 complete pairs (i.e., that the 6 missing socks come from 6 different pairs)? The surprising answer is that you’re more than 100 times as likely to end up with the worst possible outcome, only 4 pairs (plus 6 single socks), than you are ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=558))

- to end up with the best possible outcome, 7 pairs (and no singles). More precisely, the probability of 7 pairs is .003, of 6 pairs .130, of 5 pairs .520, and of only 4 pairs .347. The solution (details of which I will omit) derives from the notion of statistical independence, which is of fundamental interest and thus worth a digression. Two events are said to be independent when the occurrence of one of them does not make the occurrence of the other more or less probable. If you flip a coin twice, each flip is independent of the other. If you choose two people from the phone book, the birth month of one is independent of that of the other. Calculating the probability of two independent events occurring is easy to do: simply multiply their respective probabilities. Thus, the probability of obtaining two heads is 1/4: 1/2 x 1/2. The probability that two people chosen from the phone book are each born in July is 1/144: 1/12x1/12. This… ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=566))

- in a row, (1/2)6; of someone’s surviving three shots in Russian roulette, (5/6)3. The tendency of socks to shed their mates is certainly Murphy’s Law with a vengeance! Nevertheless, we should expect this to happen and need not invoke bad luck to account for our incomplete pairs of socks. I realize that most people who speak of a series of minor personal mishaps are merely embellishing a story or trying to establish rapport with others and don’t necessarily subscribe to their pronouncements, just as most who refer to the bogeyman don’t believe in one. Still, we often feel genuinely perplexed and that the world is conspiring against us, and mathematical debunkings help dispel this illusion. Self-aggrandizement is the key to the appeal of the illusion and of paranoia in general. The feeling is a consequence of the perhaps subconscious inference that if the world is out to get me, I… ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=575))

- The derivation isn’t as important as the bottom line: any variation in the buses’ arrival times results in a longer waiting time for you even if the average number of buses per day remains the same. The buses aren’t abusing you; longer waits are simply what happens with any variation in the bus arrival times. Longer waiting times occur generally in situations ranging from supermarket lines ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=598))

- to doctors’ offices. Even though the average number of customers or patients arriving per hour and the average time spent on each should not result in bottlenecks, the expectation that bottlenecks will not occur usually hinges on the evenly spaced arrival of people and the same amount of time being spent on each. When this isn’t the case, variation is the reason for your delay, not some cosmic malevolence. Of course, we should not always count long waiting times as something negative; if we are waiting for obnoxious dinner guests to arrive, for example, long waiting times could be deemed positive. We do seem to have a genius for focusing on the negative. Doing so probably confers survival value, and this may be the true basis for Murphy’s Law and the usually misplaced albeit common feeling of being put-upon.

- People’s sensitivities and vulnerabilities make frank disapproval difficult. Gossip allows us to express some disapproval, but once again there is a gulf between the spite we usually attribute to others who gossip about us and the evenhandedness we feel we demonstrate when we gossip about others. Confidentially expressing a modicum of ridicule or disparagement toward others is perfectly consistent with our affection and respect for them. Unfortunately, few can tolerate others’ (non-family members’) ridicule or disparagement and still believe in their affection or respect.

- A person who is terrified by every new disease and unimpressed by the hazards of smoking or drunk driving is different (not fundamentally different, but not trivially so either) from someone with a more accurate appreciation of the relative risks we all face. A voluminous psychological literature exists on our perception of risk and chance. Views on many issues are greatly affected by the ease with which one can retrieve various items from memory, as suggested by answers to the following questions: Do more words have “r” as a first letter or as a third letter? What about the letter “k”? Most people judge incorrectly that more words have these letters in the first position than in the third position since, as Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnemann have theorized in their classic Judgement Under Uncertainty, the former words are more readily available to our memories. Words such as road, radio, Rembrandt, ratatouille, and rheumatism are easier to dredge up than such words ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=628))

- as abroad, daring, Vermeer, vermicelli, and thrombosis. A number of refinements and corollaries to the so-called availability error have been identified. Prominent among them are the halo effect—the inclination of people to judge a person or thing in terms of one salient characteristic (say, ivy-league credentials) and the anchoring effect—the tendency of people to accept, or at least to not stray far from, the first number or fact presented to them within a given discussion (say, the number of slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere). Each of these tendencies describes a very common conceptual shortcoming. In moving from the raw givenness of statistics to the malleable interpretations of stories, such tendencies play a pivotal, although largely unrecognized, role.

If 15 of 100 burglars are brown, and the witness is correct 80 percent of the time, then she will likely identify 12 (80 percent of 15) as brown and the other 3 as pink. She will also classify 68 of the 85 pink burglars (80 percent of 85) as pink and the other 17 as brown. So of the 29 burglars she would identify as brown, in fact only 12 are brown. Thus the conditional probability that the burglar is brown given the witness’s testimony that the burglar is brown is by Bayes’ Theorem 12/29, or only 41 percent!

- Our personal viewpoints and psychological foibles also play a role when we choose one of several alternatives based on how they are presented to us. Even in mathematically equivalent cases, we’re swayed by artful phrasing. In one investigation subjects generally choose to receive 300 dollars with probability 20 percent rather than receiving 200 dollars with probability 25 percent. This is reasonable since the average gain in the first case is 60 dollars (20 percent of 300), whereas the average gain in the second is only 50 dollars (25 percent of 200). What isn’t so reasonable is that subjects generally made the opposite choice when their options were stated in terms of stages. The alternative framing posits two stages: With a probability of 75 percent ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=699))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- the subject is eliminated at the first stage and receives nothing. If someone reaches the second stage, he or she has the option of receiving 200 dollars for certain or 300 dollars with probability 80 percent. This is equivalent to a choice between 200 dollars with probability 25 percent (since 25 percent is 100 percent minus 75 percent) or 300 dollars with probability 20 percent (since 80 percent of 25 percent is 20 percent). In this case, however, the majority choose the seemingly safer 200 dollars option, influenced apparently by the idea of certainty. In another study subjects generally choose to receive a certain gain of 800 dollars rather than gamble on winning 1,000 dollars with probability 85 percent and winning nothing with probability 15 percent. This occurs even though the second alternative yields 850 dollars on average. Subjects generally make the opposite choice when similar options are stated in terms of losses. If asked to choose between a certain loss of 800 dollars or an 85-percent chance of losing 1,000 dollars and a 15-percent chance of losing nothing, the majority choose the second ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=705))

- Although we may lack lucidity on some of these probabilistic puzzles, rarely are we short of confidence. If Yeats was right when he wrote, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity,” then investigations by Boris Fischhoff and others on overconfi-dence suggest that most of us aren’t very admirable. (Interestingly, some studies have indicated that one of the few categories in which American math students are ranked first in international studies is self-confidence.) We’re so often cocksure of our decisions, actions, and beliefs because we fail to look for counterexamples, pay no attention to alternative views and their consequences, distort our ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=717))

- Because the stories we believe become, at least metaphorically, a part of us, we are disposed, perhaps out of a sense of self-preservation, to look always for their confirmation, seldom their disconfirma-tion. (I’m tempted to say that even a cursory glance around us confirms this.) One very simple notion from statistics, were it used regularly by people, would go a long way toward minimizing the blinding effects of this natural tendency and insuring more critical thinking about confirmation and disconfir-mation. The notion is a so-called two-by-two table in which the frequencies of all four possible relations between any two simple phenomena, A and B, are examined: not just A and B, which usually strikes us first, but also A and not B, not A and B, and not A and not B. The idea is so elementary it can be taught to young children and career politicians. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=740))

- There is another psychological foible that ought to be mentioned. In trying to make sense of things, people are much more likely to attribute an event to an agent’s will than to chance if the event has momentous implications. In one experiment, for example, a group of subjects is told that a man has parked his car on an incline and that subsequently it has rolled down into a fire hydrant. Another group is told that the car has rolled into and injured a pedestrian. The members of the first group generally view the event as an accident; the second group is more likely to hold the driver responsible. Other studies confirm that the more emotionally fraught an event or phenomenon is, the more eagerly people search for a story to make sense of it. This psychological tendency, together with our natural preference for confirmation over disconfirmation and our fascination with coincidence, help explain the ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=748))

- The Bible codes are just one of the latest manifestations of our natural tendency to read significance into coincidence. I’ve written in Innumeracy and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper of the stunning insignificance of the vast majority of coincidences. That 2 people in a group share a birthday, for example, is quite likely if the group numbers 30 or more. If there are 23 people in the group the probability is 1/2 that at least 2 share a natal day. And if 2 people, A and B, are chosen at random from national phone books, the probability is overwhelming that they will be linked by 2 intermediates: that is, person A will know someone who knows someone ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=803))

- World-class coincidences are sometimes termed miracles—with the proviso that the result be positive. (It’s generally not termed a miracle when a rare earthquake levels a building on the only day of the year it is full of schoolchildren.) As with more mundane versions, the vast majority of “miracles” mean nothing; some point to valuable yet overlooked connections; and a few suggest a void in our understanding. David Hume’s insight about this latter variety of miracle is too little appreciated. Hume observed that every piece of evidence for a miraculous coincidence—that is, for a violation of natural ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=812))

The most amazing coincidence of all would be the complete absence of all coincidences. This statement is a rough rephrasing of the gist of the aforementioned theorem by the English mathematician Frank Ramsey and his intellectual heirs (I reiterate most of these points despite the fact that repetition of nonsense is much better tolerated than repetition of its debunking, which generally comes across as scolding and earnest).

- The properties that all accounts of probability seem to possess were listed by the Russian mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov and capture such elementary understandings as the following: The probability of an event occurring, measured by some number between 0 and 1 (or, equivalently, by some percentage between 0 percent and 100 percent), should be equal to 1 (or 100 percent) minus the probability of the event not occurring. The probability of one of several mutually exclusive events occurring (say a 1, 3, or 5 turning up on a die) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the events (1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6). The probability of several independent events all occurring is the product of their respective probabilities. These and other properties or axioms are not the topic of this book, but I would like to examine an important consequence of them. Conditional probabilities are probabilities in the light of, or given, certain evidence. The probability of a randomly chosen adult weighing less than 130 pounds is, let’s assume, 25 percent. The conditional probability that someone weighs less than 130 pounds given that he or she is over 6 feet 4 inches tall is, I would estimate, much smaller than 5 percent. Note also that the conditional probability that one can speak Spanish given that one is a citizen of Spain is, let us say, approximately 95 percent, whereas the conditional probability that one is a Spanish citizen given that one can speak Spanish may be less than 10 percent. Bayes’ Theorem is a formula that tells us how we should modify our sometimes subjective conditional probabilities, and hence, indirectly, how we should alter the stories ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=888))

- that give them context and meaning. The network of conditional probabilities each of us assigns in idiosyncratic ways to myriad events and hypotheses is quite intricate. We differ in the way we attach rough probabilities to happenings, and differ even more in the probabilities we assign to the associations between happenings. This tangled network of probability estimates, propensities, and beliefs is, in a sense, a map of our minds and dynamically interacts with new experiences and old stories that we constantly edit. This network also depends, as we’ll see in the next chapter, on other people’s probability estimates, propensities, and beliefs. Revision of our subjective conditional probabilities generally brings our personal viewpoint—no matter how unreasonably idiosyncratic—into better agreement with new, more objective evidence. Thus, despite our immunity to facts on occasion, conditional probabilities are a crucial link between the impersonal world and the stories we tell about ourselves and others. What exactly is Bayes’ Theorem? Although we each use it implicitly in revising our probability estimates, only statisticians ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=900))

- regularly use the formal version. For the record and without formal notation, Bayes’ Theorem states that the conditional probability of a hypothesis given some new piece of evidence is equal to the product of (a) the initial probability of the hypothesis before the evidence and (b) the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by (c) the probability of the new evidence. The formula and its derivation are not important here, since often it is easier to construct tables (as in the preceding burglar example) than to derive or use the formula. What is important is that Bayes’ Theorem provides us with a way to incorporate new, objective information into our personal, subjective outlooks. Unfortunately, it can sometimes lead to correct but counterintuitive results, especially in situations involving individuals or rare events. Another problem with Bayes’ Theorem is that real-life… ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=909))

- The Austrian journalist Karl Kraus once remarked, “Psychoanalysis is that mental illness for which it regards itself as therapy.” Although I share his low regard for the narrowly scientific merits of Freudianism, the quip does nicely suggest the self-building aspects of intensional logic. Hearing, telling, and ultimately internalizing stories are necessary steps in the construction of a self. We adopt pieces and patterns from others’ personas and make them elements of our own, these pieces and patterns having evolved from simple, animal-like propensities. The empathy we feel for our families, our friends, and in an attenuated form, for the larger community makes us human.

- A PARABLE OF FURIOUS FEMINIST AND THE STOCK MARKET I wrote this parable a week after the precipitous decline in the stock market in October 1997. It takes place in a benightedly sexist village of uncertain location. In this village there are 50 married couples, and each woman knows immediately when another woman’s husband has been unfaithful but never when her own has. The strict feminist statutes of the village require that if a woman can prove her husband has been ([Location 1407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=1407))

- unfaithful, she must kill him that very day. Assume also that the women are statute-abiding, intelligent, aware of the intelligence of the other women, and, mercifully, that they never inform other women of their philandering husbands. As it happens, all 50 of the men have been unfaithful, but since no woman can prove her husband has been so, the village proceeds merrily and warily along. Then one morning the tribal matriarch from the far side of the forest comes to visit. Her honesty is acknowledged by all and her word taken as law. She warns darkly that there is at least one philandering husband in the village. Once this fact, only a minor consequence of what they already know, becomes common knowledge, what happens? The answer is that the matriarch’s warning will be followed by 49 peaceful days and then, on the 50th day, by a massive slaughter in which all the women kill their husbands. To see this, assume there is only one unfaithful husband, Mr. A. Everyone except Mrs. A already knows about his infidelity, so when the matriarch makes her announcement only Mrs. A learns something new from it.

- Being intelligent, she realizes that she would know if any other husband were unfaithful. She thus infers that Mr. A is the philanderer and kills him that very day. Now assume there are only two unfaithful men, Mr. A and Mr. B. Every woman except Mrs. A and Mrs. B knows about both cases of infidelity, Mrs. A knows only of Mr. B’s, and Mrs. B knows only of Mr. A’s. Mrs. A thus learns nothing from the matriarch’s announcement, but when Mrs. B fails to kill Mr. B the first day, she infers that Mr. A must also be guilty. The same holds for Mrs. B, who infers from the fact that Mrs. A has not killed her husband on the first day that Mr. B is also guilty. The next day Mrs. A and Mrs. B both kill their husbands. If instead there are exactly three guilty husbands, Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C, then the matriarch’s announcement would make no impact the first day, but by a reasoning process similar to the one just… ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=1420))

Now if you replace the warning of the matriarch from the far side of the forest with that provided by the Thai, Malaysian, and other Asian currency problems this past summer, the nervousness and uneasiness of the wives with the nervousness and uneasiness of investors, the wives’ contentment as long as their own oxen weren’t goring with the investors’ contentment as long their own oxes weren’t being gored, killing husbands with selling stocks, and the 50-day gap between the warning and the killings with the delay between the East Asian problems and the big sell-off, you have it. More explicitly, the interested financial parties may have suspected that the other Asian economies were vulnerable, but didn’t act until someone said so publicly and… ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=1429))

- Whatever one’s response to the question about the relative merits of narratives and numbers (mine is this book), it’s clear that storytelling and statistics citing afford alternative sorts of insights into alternative sorts of entities, usually individuals versus collections thereof. I’ve discussed the extensional nature of statistical data, which contrasts with the necessarily intensional descriptions typical of autobiography. The issue of autobiography, however, suggests other more general (dis)similarities between statistical studies and narratives of all sorts, especially novels.

- Likewise, almost identical plot lines can give rise to very different novels. Most traditional romances, for example, have the schematic plot: Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy wins girl. A schematic recipe exists for thrillers as well. Still, the books that result are certainly not all alike. The same is true for answers to the canonical riddle “What’s black and white and re(a)d all over?” which number in the hundreds, as M. B. Barrick demonstrated in The Journal of American Folklore in his “The Newspaper Riddle Joke.” They range from a newspaper to such nonstan-dard models of the riddle’s conditions as an embarrassed zebra, Santa Claus coming down a dirty chimney, a wounded nun, a rabid racist’s view of an interracial couple, and a skunk with diaper rash.

- humorously illustrates how difficult it is to pin down an indefinitely rich reality with a few assumptions. As in the newspaper riddle, alternative models almost always can be found for any set of assumptions. In philosophy this is sometimes known as the “underdetermination problem.” Since a Roman religious scholar was visiting the court of the Turkic Emperor Timur, the Emperor asked a famous Mulla to prepare for a battle of wits with the scholar. The first thing the Mulla did was to burden his donkey with books having nonsensical titles. The day of the contest the Mulla appeared in court with his donkey, and despite the language barrier between them, overwhelmed the Roman scholar with his native charm and intelligence. The scholar finally decided to test the Mulla’s knowledge of theoretical matters. He held up one finger. The Mulla answered with two fingers. The Roman held up three fingers.

- The Mulla responded with four. The scholar waved his open hand to which the Mulla responded with a closed fist into his palm. The scholar then opened his briefcase and took out an egg. The Mulla responded by digging an onion out of his pocket. The Roman asked, “What’s your evidence?” The Mulla gestured uncomprehendingly toward his books. The Roman looked and was so impressed at the titles that he conceded defeat.   Since no one had understood any of this, later, after refreshments had been served, the Emperor leaned over and asked the Roman scholar the meaning of it all. “He is a brilliant man, this Mulla,” the Roman explained. “When I held up one finger, meaning that there was only one God, he… ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=1535))

The Mulla produced an onion indicating the layers of heavens about the earth. I asked him to support his claim that the number of layers of heavens is the same as the number of layers of onion skin, and he pointed to all those learned books of which I, alas, am ignorant.

- One more example to demonstrate my thesis that any account of humor will also be an account of cognition: In his book Full House, Stephen Jay Gould writes of the misconceptions caused by focusing only on averages or extremes of a distribution. Doing so often imparts a spurious sense of movement, of decline or growth, that is not borne out by looking at the statistical distribution as a whole. Consider, for example, his explanation for the disappearance of the .400 hitter in baseball in which he argues convincingly that the absence of such hitters in recent decades is not due to any decline in baseball ability but rather to a decrease in the disparity between the worst and best players (both pitchers and hitters). When almost all players are as athletically gifted and well trained as they are today, the distribution of batting averages shows less variability than it did in the past, and hence .400 averages are rare. (The average of all batting averages has remained relatively constant over the decades, sometimes through fiddlings with the rules.) This last is a somewhat abstract point, but a joke statistic cited earlier depends on the same understanding and is much easier to apprehend. The statistic is that the average resident of Miami, Florida, is born Hispanic and dies Jewish. Here the suggestion of spurious movement (conversion, in this case) is more easily resisted, but the intellectual content is the same.

- A more profound version of this line of thought can be traced to British mathematician Frank Ramsey, who proved a theorem stating that for a sufficiently large set of elements (people or numbers or geometric points) every pair of whose members are, let’s say, either connected or unconnected, there will always be a large subset of the original set with a special property. Either all of the subset’s members will be connected to each other, or all of its members will be unconnected to each other. This subset is an inevitable island of order (there are more interesting islands in the archipelago) in the larger unordered set; it is the free lunch guaranteed to exist if the garbage dump is large enough. The problem may be phrased in terms of guests at a dinner party. The Ramsey question for the island of order of size 3 is: What is the smallest number of guests who need to be present so that it will be certain that at least 3 will know each other or that at least 3 will be strangers to each other? (Assume that if Martha knows George, then George knows Martha.) That the answer is 6 may be seen by pretending that you’re a guest at the ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=2135))

- party. Since you know or don’t know each of the other 5, you will either know at least 3 of them or not know at least 3 of them. Why? Suppose that you know 3 of them (the argument is the same if you don’t know at least 3) and consider what relationships hold among your 3 acquaintances. If any 2 know each other, then these 2 and you constitute a group of 3 guests who know each other. On the other hand, if none of your 3 acquaintances know each other, they constitute a group of 3 who don’t know each other. Thus 6 guests are sufficient. To see that 5 guests are not enough, pretend you’re at a smaller party where you know exactly 2 of the other 4 guests, and each knows a different 1 of the 2 people you don’t know. For the island of order of size 4, the number of guests necessary is 18, and for 5, between 43 and 55. For larger numbers the analysis gets much more complicated, and answers to Ramsey-type questions are known for very few numbers. Since Ramsey died in 1930, a whole cottage industry has grown up devoted to proving theorems of the same general form: How big does a set have to be so that there ([Location 2143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B77AF8M&location=2143))

- will always be some subset of a given size that will possess some regular pattern, an island of order of some sort? The prolific and peripatetic mathematician Paul Erdos discovered many such islands, some of them ethereally beautiful. The details of the particular islands are complicated, but in general the answer to the question about the necessary size of the set often boils down to Diaconis’s dictum: if it’s big enough, almost any damn thing will happen. As I suggested in the segment on biblical codes, Ramsey-type theorems may even be part of the explanation for some of the equidistant letter sequence results.

- More generally, any situation having many outcomes, one of which is conventionally favored by the society at large, will seem to generate the conventionally favored outcome more frequently than chance would suggest. This in turn will tend to make that outcome even more of a conventional favorite. In this attenuated sense, wishes and beliefs do become facts.

- The stock market is also a kind of lottery, but the large number of traders gives it a decidedly different, more jittery flavor. Its size and complexity offer even more scope for turning wishes into facts and justify taking at least two very different stances toward it. Do we invoke only statistics—mathematical notions such as random walks, efficient markets, and beta values—or are narrative ingredients—such as fear, exuberance, and disproportionate response—part of the picture? Again, some straddling of the story-statistics line is the most appealing option. The failure of most highly paid fund managers, with all their charts and figures, to do better than blind indexed funds is something of a scandal and suggests that the theoretical statistical arguments are sound. Given a level of risk, only a certain level of return can be expected over the long term. Why try to outsmart dice? On the other hand, the normal bell-shaped distribution does not accurately reflect the extreme volatility often displayed by the market. Investor psychology and the lockstep behavior it sometimes engenders (compare the parable of the furious feminists and the idea of probabilistic coupling discussed earlier) also suggest that to a limited extent, the market can itself be considered a kind of agent. A better term than agent is complex adaptive system, an important but rather technical notion studied by Per Bak, Brian Arthur, and other researchers at the Santa Fe Institute. Complex adaptive systems—of which we ourselves are instances—eventually may help clarify the nature of the gap between stories and statistics. It might even turn out that we’re not always being absurdly anthropomorphic when we tell stories about such systems and their moods.
