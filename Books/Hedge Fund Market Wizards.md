## Highlights
- Even if one does not accept the argument that the greater role of hedge funds has made the game more difficult, at the very least, it has made the game different. Markets change and good traders adapt. As hedge fund manager Colm O’Shea states in his interview, “Traders who are successful over the long run adapt. If they do use rules, and you meet them 10 years later, they will have broken those rules. Why? Because the world changed.” Part of that change has been brought about by the increasing prominence of hedge funds themselves.

- Markets have changed in the generation since I wrote the first Market Wizards book, but in another sense, they have not. A bit of perspective is useful. When I asked Ed Seykota in Market Wizards whether the increasing role of professionals had changed the markets (a shift that the intervening years have demonstrated was then only in its infancy), he replied, “No. The markets are the same now as they were 5 to 10 years ago because they keep changing—just like they did then.” ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=185))

- When did you first become interested in markets? It was one of those incredible chance occurrences. When I was 17, I was backpacking across Europe. I was in Rome and had run out of books to read. I went to a local open market where there was a book vendor, and, literally, the only book they had in English was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. It was an old, tattered copy. I still have it. It’s the only possession in the world that I care about. The book was amazing. It brought everything in my life together. What hooked you? What hooked me early about macro was . . . No, I meant what hooked you about the book? The book has nothing to do with macro. I disagree. It’s all there. It starts off with the protagonist just reading the tape, but that isn’t what he developed into. Everyone gives him tips, but the character Mr. Partridge tells him all that matters, “It’s a bull market.”2 ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=293))

- That’s a fundamental macro person. Partridge teaches him that there is a much bigger picture. It’s not just random noise making the numbers go up and down. There is something else going on that makes it a bull or bear market. As the book’s narrator goes through his career, he becomes increasingly fundamental. He starts talking about demand and supply, which is what global macro is all about. People get all excited about the price movements, but they completely misunderstand that there is a bigger picture in which those price movements happen. Price movements only have meaning in the context of the fundamental landscape. To use a sailing analogy, the wind matters, but the tide matters, too. If you don’t know what the tide is, and you plan everything just based on the wind, you are going to end up crashing into the rocks. That is how I see fundamentals and technicals. You need to pay attention to both to make sense of the picture. Reminiscences is a brilliant book about the journey. The narrator starts out with an interest in watching numbers go up and down. I started out with an interest in politics and economics. But we both end up in a place that is not that far apart. You need to develop your own market experience. You are only going to fully understand what the traders in your books were saying after you have done it yourself. Then you realize, “Oh, that’s what they meant.” It seems really obvious. But before you experience it and learn it, it’s hard to understand. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=306))

- You are a macro trader. You see the problem. How do you play it? I don’t. That is why it’s a bit of a distraction. You don’t because the timing is so uncertain? Because no one cares. As long as no one cares about it, there is no trend. Would you be short Nasdaq in 1999? You can’t be short just because you think fundamentally something is overpriced. What can you do? You can wait until people start to care. Taking Nasdaq as an example, you want to be selling Nasdaq at 4,000, but only after it has gone to 5,000. So you are selling the market on the way down, not on the way up. Because in a bubble, who is to say how far a market can go. Even though something might be a good idea, you need to wait for and recognize the right time. I am not particularly original. If you read the Financial Times, it’s all there. You don’t have to be a brilliant economist; you just have to recognize when something matters. The financial crisis is another example of the need to wait for the right time. During 2006 to 2007, I was thinking the markets were in a completely unsustainable bubble. It was ridiculous. You saw insanity everywhere.

- Why was the market at the time expecting monetary policy to ease? I try to avoid conceptualizing the market in anthropomorphic terms. Markets don’t think. Just like mobs don’t think. Why did the mob decide to attack that building? Well, the mob didn’t actually think that. The market simply provides a price that comes about through a collection of human beings.

- One reason I like macro so much is because I am a small fish swimming in a sea of real money. Fundamentals matter. I am not playing a game against people like me. That would be a zero-sum, difficult game. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=468))

- At the time, I was doing my own prop trading with no contacts. At the start of the crisis, there was nothing about LTCM in the press, either. I had no idea of any reason for what was going on in the markets, and I had no way of finding out. All I knew was that T-bond futures were going up limit every day. That told me there was something going on. I didn’t need to know why. Once you realize something is happening, you can trade accordingly. Trades don’t have to start based on fundamentals. If you wait until you can find out the reason for the price move, it can be too late. A great Soros quote is “Invest first; investigate later.” You don’t want to get fixated on always needing a nice story for the trade. I am an empiricist at heart. The unfolding reality trumps everything. I believe in hypothesis testing. The hypothesis is that something big is happening. I don’t know what it is, but it is so powerful that it will carry on for a long time. I should participate in this. But I will do it in a way that is liquid so that if it turns around again, I can get out quickly. If I am wrong, I will have a limited loss. If I am right, who knows what could happen.

- Well, since you’re refusing to give me any kind of answer [he laughs], I’ll give you my answer. Fundamentally, housing prices started to go down in 2006, which didn’t start the crisis, but provided a reason for one. The subprime credit indexes started going down in January 2007. Subprime credit is a niche market, and the equity market was ignoring it. Then in July 2007, there was a broad selloff in the credit markets, but it still was considered a contained credit market issue. Equity people tend to trace the start of the financial crisis to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008. For me, the true start of the financial crisis was in August 2007 when money markets stopped working. Basically, banks didn’t trust other banks. That was the month the world broke, and no one noticed. How did you see the money markets breaking down? The most obvious way was that LIBOR rates spiked. [LIBOR is the rate at which banks lend to other banks.] It was an indicator that the underlying assumption that money would flow smoothly was no longer true. If you spoke to money market desks to find out what was going on, they told you that liquidity had dried up. They had never seen anything like it. If a similar event happened in any other market, it would be front-page news. But the fact that it happened in the most important market—the money market, which is at the heart of capitalism—was largely ignored. Wasn’t the stress in money markets reported in the financial press? It was reported. It was all public information, but the point is that no one thought it mattered. Even more than three years later, we are sitting here, and you are saying, “Really, money markets broke down in August 2007? Really?” Well, I have to admit, when I think of money markets breaking down in the financial crises, I think of the breaking of the buck by some money market funds in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent freezing up of the commercial paper market. But these events occurred more than a year later in September 2008. That’s my point. No one seemed to think it was important. The S&P actually went on to make new highs in the next two months.

- But you made your transition from bullish positions to bearish in August 2007? Yes, I turned bearish when money market liquidity dried up in August 2007. Declining housing prices were the impending storm clouds, but it started raining when money markets stopped working. Most people, however, didn’t notice. Fundamentals are not about forecasting the weather for tomorrow, but rather noticing that it is raining today. The great trades don’t require predictions. The Soros trade of going short the pound in 1992 was based on something that had already happened—an ongoing deep recession that made it inevitable that the U.K. would not maintain the high interest rates required by remaining in the ERM. Afterward, everyone said, “That was incredibly obvious.” Most of the great trades are incredibly obvious. It was the same in late 2007. In my mind, it was clear that the financial system was imploding and that most market participants hadn’t noticed.

- If you live in a world where everyone assumes that everything goes up forever, then it is inconceivable that prices might go down. Big price changes occur when market participants are forced to reevaluate their prejudices, not necessarily because the world changes that much. The world really didn’t change that much in 2008. It was just that people finally noticed there was a problem. Consider the current U.S. debt problem. A lot of people say there is apparently no inflationary threat from the growing U.S. debt because bond yields are low. But that’s not true. Bond yields will only signal that there is a problem when it is too late to fix it. You have to believe in market efficiency to believe that the market will adequately price fiscal risk. Could there be a crisis in five years? Sure. Why? Because people start to care. Currently, it’s not in the price. But one day, it might be. If a major financial catastrophe happens, people will talk about how it was caused by this event or that event. If it happens, though, it will be because there were fundamental reasons that were there all along. There will always be something that happens at the same time. Calling it a catalyst isn’t very helpful in explaining anything. Did World War I start because the Archduke was assassinated? Well, kind of, but mainly not. I don’t subscribe to the catalyst theory of history. But most people love it, especially in markets, because they can point to that one cause and say, “Who knew that could happen?” ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=549))

- Yes, because what I am trying to do is find trades that won’t lose much money even if I am wrong. Your reasoning was that if you were wrong, long rates would go up about as much as short rates, so you wouldn’t lose much money, but if you were right most of the rate decline would occur in short rates. Yes, exactly. So, you are not only looking for the right trade, but also for the best way to express it. Yes, I think implementation is the key in everything. Implementation is more important than the trade idea behind it. Having a beautiful idea doesn’t get you very far if you don’t do it the right way. The point is that I tried to do the trade in a way so that my timing didn’t have to be perfect. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=595))

- One problem with buying equity puts is that equity volatility tends to be very expensive. Who is the natural seller of equity puts? No one. Who is the natural buyer of equity puts? Everyone. The world is long equities, and people like owning insurance, so there is an excess of natural buyers for equity puts. That is why equity option prices are structurally expensive.

- I thought that was clearly wrong. The big mistake people were making, and still make, was to confuse liquidity with solvency. People were acting on the premise that Bear Stearns and the banking system were solvent. They thought there was a liquidity crisis, which was just a matter of lack of confidence. The reality was that the banking system didn’t have a liquidity problem; it had a liquidity problem because it had a solvency problem. You can’t fix a solvency problem by adding more liquidity. If you have a house worth $100,000 with a $200,000 mortgage, I can lend you another $100,000, but it won’t solve the underlying problem. You’ll just end up with more debt. As long as housing prices kept going down, the solvency problem was getting worse and worse. The market, however, was behaving as if there was no problem.

- Never underestimate the ability of people to be optimistic and believe that everything is going to be okay. Historically, what is important to the market is not whether growth is good or bad, but whether it is getting better or worse. Growth started getting less negative, and less negative is good news. Asia started going up. The Australian dollar started going up. The S&P was actually one of the last markets to turn higher in March 2009. By March to April, you were seeing a broad-based recovery in global markets. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=692))

- Implementation and flexibility. You need to implement a trade in a way that limits your losses when you are wrong, and you also need to be able to recognize when a trade is wrong. George Soros has the least regret of anyone I have ever met. Even though he will sometimes play up to his public image as a guru who knows what is going on, it is in no sense what he does as a money manager. He has no emotional attachment to an idea. When a trade is wrong, he will just cut it, move on, and do something else. I remember one time he had this huge FX position. He made something like $250 million on it in one day. He was quoted in the financial press talking about the position. It sounded like a major strategic view he had. Then the market went the other way, and the position just disappeared. It was gone. He didn’t like the price action, so he got out. He doesn’t let his structural views on how he believes the market will play out get in the way of his trading. That is what strikes me about really good money managers—they don’t get attached to their ideas. The danger in the narrative I have been giving you is that it may lead to the false impression that what you need to do to make lots of money is be really smart in economics and understand fundamentally what is going on. I don’t really believe that is true. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=708))

- How did you lose money when your forecast was exactly correct? It’s pretty straightforward. The implementation didn’t match the hypothesis. The hypothesis was clearly a one-to-three-month horizon. So, I should have traded a one-to-three-month horizon. What did I do? I was constantly getting in and out because I was scared of losing money. The rational trade hypothesis was beautiful. The implementation was entirely emotional and stupid. I realized that you have to embrace uncertainty and risk. Over a three-month period, it is the trend that is important.

- What are some other mistakes you have learned from? I don’t have any great example of a mistake that cost me a material amount of money because I have very tight risk discipline on the downside. Stopping yourself from losing money is quite easy. I’ve never really had that problem. I’d say that most of my big errors have been opportunity errors. I sometimes believe in something so strongly that it acts as a constraint on doing trades that could be very profitable. For example, in late 2010, my underlying belief that the European sovereign debt crisis was a really big problem made it hard for me to participate in a sentiment and liquidity driven bull market. I failed to take part in the biggest macro theme of the year. From September on, equities were up a lot, and commodities were up a lot. It was a massive opportunity that I should have been in, and I wasn’t. I missed the key point that no one else cared, and as long as no one cares, there is no crisis. It’s the same reason I didn’t make any money in the Nasdaq bubble. I thought, “I can’t buy Pets.com.” ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=790))

- That’s a political example. But what would be a tradable example? Gold is special, magical, and great. It’s not. But if people believe it, they buy it. And if they buy it, it goes up. That’s why there’s a bull market. You can’t go to a meeting without someone saying, “What do you think about gold?” What does that tell you? It tells you that you should be long gold.

- Right now as we talk, gold is somewhere just north of $1,500 and not far from its all-time high. So what you are saying is that the gold top could be now; it could be at $2,000; it could be at $2,500; it could be any number. And that’s okay. The thing about gold is that if you told me gold has a price of $100, that’s fine. If you told me it’s $10,000, that’s fine as well. It can be any price. Gold is worth exactly what people think it’s worth. I am sure you know why that is true for gold. What do you think? This is one of those questions that can be answered unambiguously. Gold is the only commodity where the amount of supply is literally about 100 times as much ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=842))

- as the amount physically used in any year. That is not true of any other commodity, such as wheat or copper, where total supply and annual consumption are much closer in balance, and true shortages can develop. There is never any shortage of gold. So gold’s value is entirely dependent on psychology or those fundamentals that drive psychology. Many years ago, when I was a commodity research director, I would totally ignore gold production and consumption in analyzing the market. I would base any price expectation entirely on such factors as inflation and the value of the dollar because those are the factors that drive psychology. I always found it ridiculous when other analysts would write lengthy reports on gold analyzing such things as annual production prospects and jewelry usage. Annual production and consumption of gold are always a tiny fraction of supply, maybe around 1 percent, so who cares how much they change. It has nothing to with the price. Yes, that’s exactly right.

- you consider Nasdaq as an example, it was quite an easy trade from the long side for a long time. It went from 1,500 in late 1998 to over 5,000 in early 2000 with hardly any meaningful corrections. From the short side, it was a really tough trade. After breaking down in very whippy fashion to under 3,100 in June 2000, the market then rallied back to near 4,300 in the next two months. This was a 40 percent rebound in a market that was clearly dead. Postbubble dead cat bounces can be vicious. Sounds more like a dead tiger bounce. I don’t think you will find many people that have made the majority of their money shorting bubbles. Does that imply that you didn’t trade the Nasdaq from the short side even after you were sure the bull market was dead? No, I didn’t because the repercussions of the top were a lot easier to play than being short the Nasdaq itself. You had a broad bubble in assets. The U.S. economy had been built up by a massive mispricing of assets. Once the Nasdaq burst and everything unraveled, it was clear the economy would slow down. The economic downturn led to a big move in fixed income that provided a much calmer way to play that idea than a direct trade in equities. So rather than consider the short side of the Nasdaq, you traded the long side of the bonds. That’s right. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=873))

- It seems that an inherent characteristic of most of your trades is that they have an asymmetric quality—the maximum loss is limited, but the profit potential is open-ended. Yes, having a positive skew is very important. It is not about being right all the time. Most good macro traders will be right only about half the time or even less.

- Value at Risk (VAR) can be defined as the loss threshold that will not be exceeded within a specified time interval at some high confidence level (typically, 95 percent or 99 percent). The VAR can be stated in either dollar or percentage terms. For example, a 3.2 percent daily VAR at the 99 percent confidence level would imply that the daily loss is expected to exceed 3.2 percent on only 1 out of 100 days. To convert a VAR from daily to monthly, we multiply it by the square root of 22 (the approximate number of trading days in a month). Therefore the 3.2 percent daily VAR would also imply that the monthly loss is expected to exceed 15.0 percent (3.2 percent × 4.69) only once out of every 100 months. The convenient thing about VAR is that it provides a worst-case loss estimate for a portfolio of mixed investments and adapts to the specific holdings as the portfolio composition changes. There are several ways of calculating VAR, but they all depend on the volatility and correlations of the portfolio holdings during a past look-back period—and therein lies the rub. The VAR provides a worst-case loss estimate assuming future volatility and correlation levels look like the past. The main reason the VAR gets a bad name is because people don’t understand it. VAR does exactly what it says on the tin. Which is? It tells you how volatile your current portfolio was in the past. That is all. VAR is entirely backward looking. You have to recognize that the future will be different. If I think the world in the future will be highly volatile, then I will run a current VAR that is relatively low because I think the future will be more volatile than the past. VAR gets a bad name because people manage risk by it, and the shortcoming is that volatilities and correlations can change very radically on an existing portfolio vis-à-vis what they were in the past. But that is patently obvious. If it is so obvious, how come so many people manage risk that way? VAR doesn’t blow up portfolios; people do.

- Do you ever have a problem getting out of a losing trade? I start by deciding where the market would have to go for me to be wrong. That’s where I place my stop. That means that it’s not difficult for me to get out of a position if the market goes there. The most common money management error I see is people setting stop losses that are really pain thresholds. When the market reaches their stop, they don’t really want to get out because they still think they are right. They will get out because their stop is hit, and they are disciplined. But very soon afterwards, they will want to get back in because they don’t think they were wrong. That’s how day traders in Nasdaq in 2000 and 2001 lost a ton of money. They were disciplined, so they would close out their positions by the end of the day. But they kept on repeating the same trading mistake. They failed to recognize that they were completely wrong because we were in a bear market. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=960))

- The popular perception of the successful global macro manager is a trader who has an ability to forecast major trends in world markets (FX, interest rates, equities, commodities) through skillful analysis and insight. O’Shea emphasizes that his edge is not forecasting what will happen, but rather recognizing what has happened. O’Shea believes that it is very difficult to pick a major turning point, such as where a market bubble will top, and that trying to do so is a losing strategy. Instead, he waits until events occur that confirm a trading hypothesis. For example, he thought that excessive risk-taking during 2005 to 2007 had inflated various markets beyond reasonable levels and left the financial markets vulnerable to a major selloff. Nevertheless, insofar as he sees his role as trading in response to the prevailing market facts, rather than forecasting turning points, he actually had bullish positions on during this time. He did not switch to a bearish posture until an event occurred that he saw as a confirmation that the markets were in the process of rolling over—the drying up of liquidity in the money markets in August 2007. He didn’t need to forecast anything, but he did need to recognize the significance of an event that many ignored. Indeed, the S&P 500 went on to make new highs in the next two months.

- O’Shea believes that how a trade is implemented is more important than the trade idea itself. He seeks to implement a trade in the way that provides the best return-to-risk and limits losses in the event the trade is wrong. For example, after liquidity dried up in the money markets in August 2007, O’Shea expected rates to be cut. Instead of expressing this trade idea only through long short-term interest rate instrument positions, O’Shea also implemented the trade as a yield curve spread: long short-term rate instruments/short long-term rate instruments. His reasoning was that the yield curve at the time was relatively flat, implying that a rate decline would most likely be concentrated on the short-term end of the yield curve. If, however, rates went up, the flat yield curve implied that long-term rates should go up at least as much as short-term rates and probably more. The yield curve spread provided most of the profit potential with only a fraction of the risk. In essence, it provided a much better return-to-risk ratio than a straight long position in short-term rates alone. The Nasdaq peak provided another example of how O’Shea seeks the best return-to-risk strategy to implement a trade idea. After the break from the March 2000 peak, O’Shea felt fairly certain that the bubble had burst. Yet he did not consider short positions in Nasdaq, even though he believed the market had formed a major bubble top, because he recognized—correctly, as it turned out—that trading the short side was treacherous. Even though the market ultimately went sharply lower, in the summer of 2000, the index witnessed an approximate 40 percent rebound. A move of this magnitude would very likely have resulted in a short position being stopped out. O’Shea reasoned that a Nasdaq top implied that most assets would recede from inflated levels, which would lead to an economic slowdown and lower interest rates. A long bond position provided a much easier and more comfortable way to trade the same idea. Bonds subsequently witnessed a fairly smooth uptrend, in contrast to the highly erratic downtrend in Nasdaq. Flexibility is an essential quality to successful trading.

- Risk management dominates Benedict’s approach. To say he is cautious is an understatement. If his losses in any month approach 2.5 percent, Benedict will liquidate the entire portfolio and start with a clean slate the next day, trading at a reduced position size. Typically, after a 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent decline, he will cut his unit size to one-half or less the normal level. Benedict will continue to trade at a smaller size until he starts making money again. The rapidity with which Benedict cuts his exposure explains why he has never had ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=1654))

David Horowitz, a former trader, and the chief operating officer for Banyan, describes Benedict as follows: “Larry is essentially a risk manager. It’s not about making a lot of money. Of course, it’s important to have return, but for Larry it’s more important not to lose money. He knows that if he can manage the risk, he will make money.

Trading is very hard, but it is also easy if you maintain discipline. People blow up because they lose their discipline. I originally met with Benedict in late 2010. I called him in July 2011 for a midyear update. I’ve had a very bad year. We’re down almost 3 percent, and I’m trading smaller. Well, that’s consistent with your risk discipline. I guess it’s probably a good thing that you are trading smaller or else you would have been down more.

After rereading the chapter, I felt that a key question had still not been satisfactorily answered. I called Benedict again in October 2011 with some follow-up questions. One key question I still have is: What changed when you went from being a losing trader to a consistently winning one? Where was your edge coming from? I learned to pay attention to how markets moved relative to each other. I became a correlation trader—the same thing I still do today. Can you provide some examples to illustrate how you trade markets against each other? My problem is that I could never teach my kids or friends what I do because it is so innate. I am constantly trading. It’s not like there is one type of trade or even a few specific trades. I trade off of correlations, but I don’t constantly trade the same way. I am sensitive to when the correlations are working and when they are not working. So a trade might work in one time frame, but not in another, and I am constantly adapting.

It might be selling another index, or selling a deep-in-the-money call, or selling an out-of-the-money call, or buying bonds (when it is inversely correlated), or taking an inversely correlated position in the euro.

- The essence of Benedict’s approach is that he looks at markets in context of the price action in other markets, rather than in isolation. Markets are correlated, but these correlations come and go and can change radically over time. There are times when the S&P and T-bonds will move in the same direction, and times when they will move in opposite directions. There are times when the S&P 500 will follow crude oil prices, and times when the stock market ignores crude oil prices.

- Benedict is intently watching these intermarket relationships, not merely day by day, but minute by minute. At any given time, the price action in a market may be highly influenced (directly or inversely) by the price action of another market or several other markets. Knowing the prevailing correlations is only the start. There is no rulebook as to what trades to do when a correlated market has a price move. Sometimes, the trade will be to anticipate a lagged response; sometimes the failure for a market to respond as expected may signal inherent market strength or weakness. Frequently, the implied trade may be to trade one correlated market versus another. For example, if two markets are positively correlated, Benedict may short the market that seems overextended, using a long in the correlated market as a hedge. The timing of such paired long and short positions will not necessarily be simultaneous, either on entry or exit, and will depend on the prevailing price levels of each market relative to its expected range. In short, to say that Benedict uses market correlations as a key input is only the beginning. The selection and implementation of actual trades will be highly variable, depending on multiple considerations and past experience. The process is entirely discretionary, rather than formulaic. The relevant lesson for traders is that the price action of other markets can contain useful information—Benedict’s track record stands as a testament to this proposition. How this information can be used, however, must be discovered and developed by each individual trader based on personal observation and trading style. The message for traders is to be cognizant of how markets move relative to each other and to determine whether this source of observation can lead to useful trading ideas. Benedict serves as a model for extreme risk management. There are two key aspects of Benedict’s risk management approach. First, he limits portfolio risk to a small fixed amount (2.0 to 2.5 percent) before he responds with actions to mitigate further losses. Second, when this small drawdown threshold is approached, he reduces his position size and continues to trade smaller until he begins to be profitable again. A 2.5 percent portfolio risk level may be overly restrictive for many traders, but the key concept of setting a predefined loss point at which risk exposure is significantly reduced has widespread applicability. Also, reducing exposure when trading is not going well—an inherent ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=2073))

- component in Benedict’s risk management approach—is generally a wise action for discretionary traders. (For systematic traders, however, reducing exposure after losses may lead to poor timing of position sizing.) The type of rigorous risk control practiced by Benedict may be as difficult for most traders to follow as the Ornish diet is for those trying to lose weight, but it can certainly be highly effective in avoiding significant losses. Mark Rossano, who was given a small portfolio to manage while he was an intern at Banyan Capital, recalls Benedict’s obsession with risk management, saying, “The biggest principle Larry pushes is that you are not a trader; you are a risk manager.” He recounts Benedict’s advice on risk control: “Never stay in a losing trade because you think it will come back. Minimize the loss. Accept the loss and walk away from it. The worst thing any trader can do is freeze. You need to know how you will respond in any situation.

- It tells me that it is risk on for now. Otherwise, all these markets wouldn’t be making new highs a few days after a crisis. They might rebound, but they wouldn’t go to new highs. Think of taking a volleyball and pushing it underwater—that is your crisis event. Then you let go—the event dissipates—and the ball goes popping out of the water. That is exactly what we just experienced in the markets. Today, we had a terrible unemployment report, and yet the equity markets closed higher. The equity market’s repeated resilience in the face of negative news items tells me that it wants to go higher. Chaos creates opportunity. We learn so much about the markets when we have crisis events. We learn from how the markets respond? Yes. There are simple things you can do. You can calculate in percentage terms how much each market responds to a crisis event. You can then rank the markets from strongest to weakest. Is that what you do? Absolutely. Just a simple exercise of measuring which markets were the strongest during a crisis can tell you which markets are likely to be the leaders when the pressure is off—the markets that will be the ball popping out of the water. For example, crude made a low early in the month, and on the crisis in Ireland, it didn’t even retest that low. Then, as soon as the pressure was off, crude was $5 higher. Conversely, the markets that were weakest should be the markets that rally the least and the first ones to roll over on a general continued decline. Is that how you pick your longs and shorts? I always want to buy the strongest and sell the weakest. Always. ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=2360))

Yes, I want to be long only the market that is acting the best. The market that gets dragged up by a related market may even be a good short. Sometimes I will place a sell stop in a market that gets dragged up so that if it rolls over and starts going down, it will trigger a short position. Frequently, that market will continue to go down and go back to where it should be, while the leading market hardly corrects. How long have the markets been in this highly correlated state? We have been in an extremely correlated state since the 2008 financial crisis. I believe that the dog is stocks and the tail is everything else. In general, or just recently? Stocks rule, especially in the last few years. You better know which direction equities are going and watch how that influences other markets. Let’s say in one week, equities go up and commodities go up. That makes sense and is what you would expect. But then assume that in the following week, equities continue to rise, but commodities stall. Then, all else being equal, you better be very suspect of your long commodity positions.

- An important lesson Ramsey provides is that even technically oriented traders—as Ramsey himself was in the early years of his career—can benefit greatly by incorporating a fundamental perspective. It is not a matter of performing any complex fundamental analysis to derive price projections, but rather a question of trying to understand the key fundamental drivers that are likely to determine the direction of the market. For example, by understanding that fundamentals were as negative as they could be for bonds at the start of ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=2554))

- 2000, Ramsey correctly assumed that bonds had very limited scope on the downside and that any weakening in the strong economy or the prevailing speculative fervor could set in motion a major bull market. As another example, Ramsey expected the end of QE2 to lead to a reversal from dollar weakness to dollar strength. Once he has established a firm fundamental opinion, Ramsey utilizes technical analysis to confirm his anticipated scenario. Combining his technical methodology for entering and exiting trades with a strong fundamental directional bias provides Ramsey with a more effective trading approach than would be possible using technical analysis alone. The idea is to identify the big picture fundamental factors that are likely to drive the market in one direction and then to use technical analysis to trade in that direction. Fundamentals can also be useful as a contrarian indicator. Ramsey will look for situations where there appears to be a predominant market perception that is being contradicted by the market action. Ramsey cites the example of a bond market where there was a lot of concern about government borrowing crowding out private borrowing, but interest rates failed to rise. In this context, a bearish fundamental factor had bullish price ([Location 2558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=2558))

- implications because of its failure to impact prices. Ramsey will always buy the strongest market in a sector for long positions and sell the weakest market in a sector for short positions. Many novice traders make the error of doing the exact opposite. They will buy the laggards in a sector on the typically mistaken assumption that those markets haven’t yet made their move and therefore provide more potential and less risk. When Ramsey is looking for a reversal in a sector, he will focus on establishing a position in the market that lagged most on the prior price move. For example, when Ramsey anticipated the dollar would reverse to the upside at the end of QE2, he sought to sell currencies, such as the Turkish lira, that had been weak despite the prior dollar weakness. Ramsey pays a lot of attention to price movements in related markets. The failure of a market to respond as expected to a price move in a correlated market can reveal inherent strength or weakness. For example, after years of moving… ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=2567))

- and commodity currencies (e.g., Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian dollars) plunged. Perhaps the hallmark of Ramsey’s trading approach is his rigorous control of risk. Ramsey will typically risk a mere 0.1 percent on each trade from point of entry. Once he is ahead on a trade, he will allow for more risk latitude. This approach all but assures that losses on new trades are likely to be quite moderate. The only time Ramsey is vulnerable to a significant monthly loss is when there are large open profits from winning trades. Although the use of a 0.1 percent stop point from entry is probably too extreme (or perhaps even inadvisable) for most traders to adopt, the general concept of using a relatively close stop on new trades and allowing a wider stop after a profit margin has been created is an effective risk management approach that could work well for many traders. Success in trading requires dedication. Ramsey continues to trade and monitor his positions even when he is on vacation.

(Although, as an important caveat, most people trying to do so will misuse the approach and end up finding patterns that worked very well in the past, but fail in actual trading.) 3. Old price data (e.g., data 30 years old) can be nearly as meaningful as recent data. 4.

When did you start managing money? It sort of happened on its own while I was at UCI. Both Kassouf and I were managing our own accounts. Word got out on campus, and people started asking us to manage their money. People who invested were making over 20 percent per year, and they told their friends. Before long, I had a dozen accounts, and a lot of happy people on campus. What was the strategy you were using at that time? The theme in Beat the Market was that warrants with less than two years to run typically traded at premiums that were too high. The typical trade we did was to short the warrant and hedge it by buying the stock. Delta hedging? We started out with a static hedge and then decided that dynamic delta hedging was better.9 Did you and Kassouf manage money together?

Kassouf thought he could tell something about the direction of stock prices and would sometimes take a fundamental view on a stock, whereas I was afraid to do that because I didn’t believe I had any forecasting power. I thought we should always hedge to be delta neutral.10 So we went our separate ways. He and his brothers started a managed money business, while I managed my individual accounts for a while. When did you develop your own option-pricing model? In 1967, I took some of the ideas about how to price warrants in the Random Character of Stock Prices by Paul Cootner and thought I could derive a formula if I made the simplifying assumption that all investments grew at the risk-free rate. Since the purchase or sale of warrants combined with delta neutral hedging led to a portfolio with very little risk, it seemed very plausible to me that the risk-free assumption would lead to the correct formula. The result was an equation that was equivalent to the future Black-Scholes formula. I started using this formula in 1967.

Originally, the embedded optionality in convertible bonds tended to be underpriced, and convertible arbitrage funds could earn substantial profits by buying underpriced convertible bonds and hedging the market risk with short stock positions.

- How important was determining the optimal bet size in your trading success? How and why did you decide to use the Kelly criterion as the method for determining bet size? The Kelly criterion is the fraction of capital to wager to maximize compounded growth of capital. Even when there is an edge, beyond some threshold, larger bets will result in lower compounded return because of the adverse impact of volatility. The Kelly criterion defines this threshold. The Kelly criterion indicates that the fraction that should be wagered to maximize compounded return over the long run equals: where F = Kelly criterion fraction of capital to bet W = Dollars won per dollar wagered (i.e., win size divided by loss size) PW = Probability of winning PL = Probability of losing When win size and loss size are equal, the formula reduces to: For example, if a trader loses $1,000 on losing trades and gains $1,000 on winning trades, and 60 percent of all trades are winning trades, the Kelly criterion indicates an optimal trade size equal to 20 percent (0.60 − 0.40 = 0.20). As another example, if a trader wins $2,000 on winning trades and loses $1,000 on losing trades, and the probability of winning and losing are both equal to 50 percent, the Kelly criterion indicates an optimal trade size equal to 25 percent of capital: 0.50 − (0.50/2) = 0.25). Proportional overbetting is more harmful than underbetting. For example, betting half the Kelly criterion will reduce compounded return by 25 percent, while betting double the Kelly criterion will eliminate 100 percent of the gain. Betting more than double the Kelly criterion will result in an expected negative compounded return, regardless of the edge on any individual bet. The Kelly criterion implicitly assumes that there is no minimum bet size. This assumption prevents the possibility of total loss. If there is a minimum trade size, as is the case in most practical investment and trading situations, then ruin is possible if the amount falls below the minimum possible bet size. I learned about the Kelly criterion from Claude Shannon back at MIT. Shannon had worked with Kelly at Bell Labs. I guess Shannon was the leading light at Bell Labs and Kelly was perhaps the second most significant scientist there. When Kelly wrote his paper in 1956, Shannon refereed it.

- he told me to look at Kelly’s paper in deciding how much to bet because in favorable situations, you will want to bet more than in unfavorable situations. I read the Kelly paper, and it made a lot of sense to me. The Kelly criterion of what fraction of your capital to bet seemed like the best strategy over the long run. When I say long run, a week playing blackjack in Vegas might not sound very long. But long run refers to the number of bets that are placed, and I would be placing thousands of bets in a week. I would get to the long run pretty fast in a casino. In the stock market, it’s not the same thing. A year of placing trades in the stock market will not be a long run. But there are situations in the stock market where you get to the long run pretty fast—for example, statistical arbitrage. In statistical arbitrage, you would place tens or hundreds of thousands of trades in a year. The Kelly criterion is the bet size that will produce the greatest expected growth rate in the long term. If you can calculate the probability of winning on each bet or trade and the ratio of the average win to average loss, then the Kelly criterion will give you the optimal fraction to bet so that your long-term growth rate is maximized.

- The Kelly criterion will give you a long-term growth trend. The percentage deviations around that trend will decline as the number of bets increases. It’s like the law of large numbers. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, the deviation from the expected value of five will by definition be small—it can’t be more than five—but in percentage terms, the deviations can be huge. If you flip a coin 1 million times, the deviation in absolute terms will be much larger, but in percentage terms, it will be very small. The same thing happens with the Kelly criterion: in percentage terms, the results tend to converge on the long-term growth trend. If you use any other criterion to determine bet size, the long-term growth rate will be smaller than for the Kelly criterion. For betting in casinos, I chose the Kelly criterion because I wanted the highest long-term growth rate. There are, however, safer paths that have smaller drawdowns and a lower probability of ruin. I understand that if you know your edge and it is precisely defined—which of course is not true in the markets—then the Kelly criterion is the amount you should bet to maximize the compounded return and that betting either a smaller or larger fraction will give you a smaller return. But what I don’t understand is that the Kelly criterion seems to give all the weight to the return side. The only way the Kelly criterion reflects volatility is through its impact on return. Besides the fact that people are uncomfortable with high volatility, there is the very practical consideration that your down-and-out point is not zero as the Kelly criterion implicitly assumes, but rather your maximum tolerable drawdown. It seems to me that the criterion should be what maximizes growth subject to the constraint of minimizing the risk of reaching your cutout point. Suppose you have a bankroll of $1 million and… ([Location 3898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=3898))

- When I managed the fund, I wasn’t forced to make a Kelly criterion decision. If you use hedges to theoretically neutralize your risk, then the Kelly criterion might well imply using leverage. In Princeton Newport Partners where all positions were hedged, I found that I couldn’t leverage up my portfolio as much as the Kelly criterion said I should. Because? Because the brokerage firms wouldn’t give me that much borrowing power. Does that imply that you would have traded the Kelly criterion if it was feasible in a practical sense? I probably wouldn’t have because if you bet half the Kelly amount, you get about three-quarters of the return with half the volatility. So it is much more comfortable to trade. I believe that betting half Kelly is psychologically much better. I think there is a more core reason why betting less than the Kelly amount would always be the rational decision… ([Location 3919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=3919))

- is always an estimate—and often a very rough one. Moreover, the amount of extra gain forgone by betting less than the Kelly criterion is much smaller than the amount that would be lost by betting more than the Kelly criterion by the same percentage. Given the uncertainty of the probability of winning in trading combined with the inherent asymmetry in returns around the Kelly fraction, it would seem that the rational choice is to always bet less than the Kelly criterion, even if you can handle the volatility. In addition, there is the argument that for virtually any investor, the marginal utility of an extra gain is smaller than the marginal utility of an equal percentage loss. That’s true. Say I am playing casino blackjack, and I know what the odds are. Do I bet full Kelly? Probably not quite. Why? Because sometimes the dealer will cheat me. So the probabilities are a little different from what I calculated because there may be something else going on in the game that is… ([Location 3931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=3931))

Therefore, something like half Kelly is probably a prudent starting point. Then you might increase from there if you are more certain about the probabilities and decrease if you are less sure about the probabilities. In practice, did you end up gravitating to half Kelly? I was never forced to make that decision because there were so many trade opportunities that I usually couldn’t put on more than a moderate fraction of Kelly on any single trade. Once in a while, there would be an exceptional situation, and I would hit it pretty hard. One good example was ATT and the Baby Bells.

I co-invested with Bruce on one of his ideas. Bruce bought an oil tanker and allowed a number of people he knew to invest alongside with him. I think I owned 20 feet of this tanker. It was called the Empress Des Mers, and at the time, it was the largest oil tanker in the world. The tanker could be bought for a little above scrap value because there was a surplus of tankers at that time, and the older tankers were in mothballs. I think this tanker had a scrap value of about $4 million, and Bruce bought it for $6 million. We just sat on it. It was sort of like an option on the oil market. When activity picked up in the oil market, there was a huge demand for tankers, so our tanker got used over and over and made a lot of money. It was in service until only a few years ago when it became so obsolescent that it was sold off for scrap. How did you meet Warren Buffett?

He happened to be an investor with Buffett Partners Limited, which was being closed down because Buffett felt that stocks were at crazy heights in 1968, and he didn’t feel there was much more he could do. Gerard needed to find an alternative investment to place the money that he was getting back from Buffett. He introduced me to Buffet, and we all played bridge at Gerard’s house a few times. I knew Buffet was a really smart person when I met him in 1968. I remember telling my wife that given his ability to analyze companies, his rate of compounding, and the scalability of the approach, I thought he would be the richest person in the U.S. someday. He was for a period a few decades later, and from time to time thereafter. I lost track of Buffett, and then one day in 1982, I learned that Berkshire Hathaway, the company whose stock he had been distributing in 1968, had been turned into his own private mutual fund. I immediately realized what that meant. So I went out and bought Berkshire Hathaway shares. They had been selling for $12 a share in 1964, and here I was buying them at $985 a share.

- What other risk-reducing strategies did you incorporate into the system? We also had a risk management process that worked a bit like the old portfolio insurance strategy. If we lost 5 percent, we would shrink our positions. If we lost another few percent, we would shrink our positions more. The program would therefore gradually shut itself down, as we got deeper in the hole, and then it had to earn its way out. We would wait for a threshold point between a 5 percent and 10 percent drawdown before beginning to reduce our positions, and then we would incrementally reduce our position with each additional 1 percent drawdown. At what drawdown point would your position be reduced to zero? Twenty percent. How far down did you get? Our maximum drawdown was about 14 percent to 15 percent, by which point we were trading only about one-third of our normal base position size.

It all depends on how confident you are about your edge. If you have a really strong conviction about your edge, then the best thing to do is sit there and take your lumps. If, however, you believe there is a reasonable chance that you might not have an edge, then you better have a safety mechanism that constrains your losses on drawdowns. My view on trend following was that I could never be sure that I had an edge, so I wanted a safety mechanism. Whereas for a strategy like convertible arbitrage, I had a high degree of confidence as to the payoff probabilities, so reducing exposure on drawdowns was unnecessary.

- I understand that you looked at Madoff at an early point in his career. Can you tell me about that experience? Back in 1991, one of the major institutional investors in the Princeton Newport fund asked me to review their allocation process for their pension fund. I spent several days at their offices reviewing their hedge fund managers. One of these managers was remarkable in that he printed positive returns of about 1 percent to 2 percent virtually every month. They had been invested with this manager for a few years. I asked them to show me the statements. I looked at the statements and very quickly determined that the manager was a fraud. How did you reach that conclusion? The first step was to look at what the manager said he did. His purported strategy was to buy a stock, buy a put a little below the stock price, and sell a call a little bit above the stock price. The premium he received for the call approximately balanced the premium he paid for the put. Buying the put protected him from losing much in any given month, but it certainly didn’t mean that he would ([Location 4268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4268))

- win every month. Suppose you have a month with a strong upmarket. He will do well because he will make the difference between the strike price of the call and the price at which he bought the stock. On the other hand, suppose you have a significant down month. Then he will lose because the puts he bought will get exercised at lower prices than where he bought the stock. Since he was doing the same strategy in all the stocks, he shouldn’t be getting much diversification in months where most stocks were up or down. So he should have some very good months, but he should also have some very bad months. But those results were not showing up. His returns were not consistent with the market, given the strategy he claimed to employ. So the immediate question I had was: Why not? When I looked at the record, I noticed that miraculous trades would be put on periodically that would get rid of the potential losing months and make them winners and get rid of the big winning months and make them moderate winners. And those miraculous trades were long or short S&P futures positions that just happened to come in the right month and the right amount to smooth everything out.

- hold, split, or double down) was to vary the bet size. By betting more on high-probability hands than on low-probability hands, Thorp was able to transform a losing game—even one played with perfect decisions (other than bet size)—into a game with a significant positive edge. There is an important analogy here that applies to traders: Varying the position size can be as important as the entry methodology. Trading smaller, or not at all, for lower probability trades and larger for higher probability trades can transform a losing strategy into a winning one. (Thorp had to bet something on even low-probability blackjack hands, but the trader can forgo lower probability trades altogether.) Although, in trading, probabilities cannot be accurately assessed, as they can in blackjack, traders can often still differentiate between higher and lower probability opportunities. For the quantitative trader, such an assessment might be based on a statistical analysis of past results for different strategies. As for discretionary traders, many of them have strong differences in confidence level for different trades. If a trader does better on high-confidence trades, then the degree of confidence can serve as proxy for probability of winning. The implication then becomes to trade larger on high-confidence trades and ([Location 4353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4353))

A lesson that Thorp learned in gambling was: “Don’t bet more than you are comfortable with.

- What is the optimal size for any trade? Theoretically, this question has a precise answer: the Kelly criterion, which it can be mathematically demonstrated will yield a higher cumulative return over the long run than any other strategy for determining trading size. There is a rub, however. The Kelly criterion assumes that the probability of winning and the ratio of the amount won to the amount lost per wager are precisely known. Although this assumption is typically true for games of chance, in trading, the probability of winning is unknown and, at best, can only be estimated—often with a wide degree of error. If the Kelly criterion is used to determine the trade size, there is a steep penalty for overestimating the probability of winning (or the ratio of the average win to average loss). In fact, the negative impact of overestimating the correct trade size is twice as large as the negative impact of underestimating the correct trade size by the same amount. Therefore, if the precise probabilities of winning ([Location 4385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4385))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- are not known—as is usually the case for trading applications—then the bet size should be significantly smaller than the full Kelly amount. Also, even assuming the correct Kelly trade size was precisely known, the resulting equity stream would be far too volatile for most people’s comfort level. The high volatility implicit in the Kelly criterion is not merely an aesthetic issue, but has important practical implications as well. The greater the volatility of the equity stream, the greater the chance a trader will abandon the approach on one of the drawdowns. Thorp recommends that using half Kelly is a better alternative (than full Kelly) for most people, even if the probability of winning (and the average win/average loss ratio) can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate for the probability of winning is subject to wide error, then only a very small fraction of Kelly should be risked on any trade. When Thorp was faced with such a situation (that is, when he traded a trend-following system), he estimates that his trade size was probably less than one-tenth of Kelly—such a small fraction of Kelly that he didn’t even use the Kelly criterion to size trades. Where does this all leave us in regard to using the Kelly criterion for trade sizing? It depends. If you believe you can roughly estimate your probability of winning and the average win/average loss ratio, then the Kelly criterion can be very useful in defining the appropriate trade size. Even in this instance, however, half Kelly will be a better choice than full Kelly for most people. If, however, the probability of winning is subject to wide error, then even half Kelly is probably much too large, and the Kelly criterion would be of limited use.

- Cornwall is the poster child for the inadequacy of the Sharpe ratio if applied to managers with non-normal return distributions. The crux of the problem is that the Sharpe ratio uses volatility as the proxy for risk. Because of the asymmetric design of its trades, Cornwall’s volatility consists mostly of upside volatility. In other words, Cornwall’s volatility is high because they have many instances of very large gains. However, I have yet to meet an investor who finds large gains to be a problem. The risk measure of the Sharpe ratio, the standard deviation, will penalize exceptionally large gains. Using a return/risk measure such as the Gain to Pain ratio (see Appendix A for description), which employs a loss-based rather than volatility-based risk measure, the superior quality of Cornwall’s performance is readily evident. Cornwall’s Gain to Pain ratio is exceptionally high at 4.2 (5.2 based on gross returns). ([Location 4488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4488))

It’s easy to frame the questions in special situations because the market has already identified the problem and applied the discount. We love classic bull versus bear battlegrounds, as they are dynamic, often complex, and involve events that can be probabilistically estimated.

- All the trades we have discussed seem to share two common denominators: a mispricing that arises because standard market pricing assumptions are inappropriate for a given situation and an asymmetric return/risk profile—that is, open-ended return and curtailed risk. Are there any other common denominators in your trades? For any trade idea we come up with, we always go in hoping that our work will lead us to table-pounding confidence about a directional view. When we find it, nothing is better. Unfortunately those situations happen only very rarely. Almost invariably, at some point along the way, we end up disproving one of the predicates to our hypothesis, or decide that the risk we are evaluating really is inscrutable, or that we overlooked some important factor, and the situation was never interesting to begin with. The reality is that we have a business model in which we dig 50 dry wells for every idea we explore that leads to a trade in which we find conviction.

- about the outcome we were seeking to make money on. Instead, we had conviction that the odds were substantially mispriced, providing us positive expected value, even though we might not have had a strong view about the direction of the underlying market.6 Whereas the classic value investor achieves capital preservation by taking risks only when he is confident that he won’t lose a meaningful amount of money, we think about risk more probabilistically. We are just as fanatical about capital preservation, but instead of achieving a margin of safety by knowing that a company has assets or cash flow that are not valued properly by the market, we achieve our margin of safety by having a high expected value. We are comfortable losing 100 percent of our premium four times in a row, as long as we believe that a 25-times payout is likely to occur if we make the same bet 10 times consecutively. High conviction on an event path priced like a low-probability event is our Holy Grail. The subprime credit default swap (CDS) trade was the poster child for a high-conviction trade priced as an improbable event. We got to the trade late, which is typical for us because we like situations where there is a compelling reason why a trade should be working, and the only counterargument is that everyone says it should work, but it hasn’t. Over the course of a couple of months, we went from having a probabilistic view that the markets were too confident that home price appreciation would continue indefinitely to having a very high level of conviction that a liquidity bubble existed that would inevitably provide the catalyst for its own demise.

- Some background explanation is required to understand the following portion of this interview, which deals with Mai’s trade in shorting mortgage-backed securitizations. A subprime mortgage bond is a type of asset-backed security (ABS) that combines multiple individual subprime mortgages into a security that pays investors interest income based on the proceeds from mortgage payments. These bonds typically employ a structure in which multiple tranches (or classes) are created from the same pool of mortgages. The highest rated class, AAA, gets paid off in full,… ([Location 4834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4834))

- The “equity tranche,” which is not rated, absorbs the first few percentage points of losses (typically 3 to 5 percent), and is wiped out if this loss level is reached. Next, the lowest rated debt tranche (often called the “mezzanine” tranche) absorbs additional losses, a greater credit risk for which investors are paid a higher rate of interest. For example, if the equity tranche was 3 percent of the issue and the mezzanine tranche 4 percent, the mezzanine tranche would begin to be impaired if losses due to defaulted repayments exceeded 3 percent, and investors would lose all their money if losses reached 7 percent. Each higher tranche would be protected in full until losses surpassed the upper threshold of the next lower tranche. During the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, the risks associated with the low-rated BBB tranches of subprime bonds, which were high to start, increased dramatically. There was a significant deterioration in the quality of loans, as loan originators were able to pass on the risk by selling their mortgages for… ([Location 4839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4839))

Adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) structures in which low teaser rates adjusted to much higher levels after a year or two. There was no historical precedent for such low-quality mortgages. It is easy to see how the BBB tranche of a bond formed from these low-quality mortgages would be extremely vulnerable to a complete loss. The story, however, does not end there.

- Although the CDO tranche structure was similar to that employed by subprime mortgage bonds consisting of individual mortgages, there was an important difference. In a pool of mortgages, there was at least some reason to assume there would be limited correlation between individual mortgages. Different individuals would not necessarily come under financial stress at the same time, and different geographic areas could witness divergent economic conditions. In contrast, all the individual elements of the CDOs were clones—they all represented the lowest tier of a pool of subprime mortgages. If economic conditions were sufficiently unfavorable for the BBB tranche of one mortgage bond pool to be wiped out, the odds were very high that BBB tranches in other pools would also be wiped out, or at least severely impaired.8 The AAA tranche needed approximately a 20 to 25 percent loss to begin being impaired, which sounds like a safe number, until one considers that all the holdings are highly… ([Location 4860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4860))

- class sounds more like a tissue paper layer. How could bonds consisting of only BBB tranches be rated AAA? There are three interconnected explanations. 1. Pricing models used historical data on mortgage defaults. Historical mortgages in which the lender actually cared whether repayments were made and required down payments and verification bore no resemblance to the more recently minted no-down-payment, no-verification loans. Therefore, historical mortgage default data would grossly understate the risk of more recent mortgages defaulting. 2. The correlation assumptions were unrealistically low. They failed to adequately account for the sharply increased probability of BBB tranches failing if other BBB tranches failed. 3. The credit rating agencies had a clear conflict of interest: They were paid by the CDO manufacturers. If they were too “harsh” (read: realistic) in their ratings, they would lose the… ([Location 4869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4869))

- for tranches of individual mortgages could be defended to some extent, it is difficult to make the same claim for the AAA ratings of CDO tranches consisting of only the BBB tranches of mortgage bonds. In regard to the CDO ratings, the credit rating agencies were either conflicted or incompetent. Cornwall Capital’s primary strategy for shorting the housing bubble was buying credit default swaps (CDS) on the AA tranches of CDOs. The buyer of CDS makes ongoing premium payments (… ([Location 4879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=4879))

- 2. Select trades in which the probabilities appear to be significantly skewed to a positive outcome. As a general rule of thumb, Cornwall requires that the estimated gain if the trade succeeds multiplied by the probability of a positive outcome must be at least twice as large as the estimated loss if the trade fails multiplied by the probability of a negative outcome. Of course, these gain-and-loss amounts and their respective probabilities must be based on subjective estimates. Nonetheless, the key point is that the probability-weighted gain must be lopsided relative to the probability-weighted loss. The rigorous standard for qualifying trades will lead to a concentrated portfolio. Typically, Mai will have only 15 to 20 independent risks (consisting of one or more separate trades) at any one time. This concentrated portfolio approach should not be confused with the proverbial “put all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket very closely.” The important distinction is that although Mai’s portfolio is very concentrated, the asymmetric construction of his trades assures that the downside is always severely constrained if he is wrong.

- 3. Implement trades asymmetrically. Mai structures trades so that the downside is severely limited, while the upside is open-ended. One common way of achieving this type of return/risk profile is by being a buyer of options (of course, only at those times when a mispricing is identified). 4. Wait for high-conviction trades. Mai is perfectly content to stay on the sidelines and do absolutely nothing until there is a trade opportunity that meets his guidelines. Having the patience to wait for high expected value trades greatly enhances the return/risk of individual trades. 5. Use cash to target portfolio risk.

- a market given the specific prevailing fundamentals. The acceptance of these assumptions as being universally applicable when, in reality, they are not, leads to trading opportunities. Mai identified five generally accepted assumptions that sometimes are invalid. 1. Prices are normally distributed—Options are priced based on the assumption of a normal distribution, which effectively implies that future prices near the current level are most probable and that probabilities drop steeply for prices further removed from current levels. In some instances, however, large price moves are much more likely than implied by the normal distribution. Consider, for example, Mai’s comments regarding Capital One: “The odds that the stock would still be near $30 in two years seemed vanishingly small. Either the company would be vindicated or it would go under.” In such circumstances, options priced in line with option-pricing models will be severely mispriced; specifically,… ([Location 5075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5075))

- significant probability of gain, while being priced consistent with long-shot probabilities. Another implication of the normal distribution assumption is that it is always equally likely for prices to go up X percent as down X percent. Although this assumption may often be a reasonable approximation, there are times when it is far more likely for a market to go up by a given percentage than down by the same amount or vice versa. A good example of such an asymmetric price outlook was the Korean stock market when Mai implemented his long position. At the time, the market was not only severely undervalued relative to other Asian markets, but prices were so low that many companies had market capitalizations that were less than their net cash balances—that is, the companies were effectively being valued at less than zero. In such circumstances, the odds of a large price advance are significantly greater than the odds… ([Location 5084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5084))

- wrong, and these situations provide major trade opportunities. 2. The forward price is a perfect predictor of the future mean—This assumption implies that options will be priced with probabilities centered at the corresponding forward price. Sometimes, however, when the forward price is well removed from the current price, it may not be reasonable to assume that a price change equal to the difference between the forward and spot price is the most likely market outcome. Frequently, there may be good reason to assume that some price between the forward and spot price is more likely than the forward price. If this is true, out-of-the-money options (puts if the forward price is higher and calls if it is lower) may be underpriced. The Brazilian interest rate trade Mai described provided a good example of such an opportunity. 3. Volatility scales with the square root of time—This assumption, which is embedded in option pricing, may be reasonable for shorter time intervals. For longer time periods, however, this volatility assumption may understate potential volatility, particularly if current volatility is low, for two reasons. First, the longer the time period, the more likely volatility will revert to the mean from current low levels. Second, longer periods allow for more opportunity for trends to result in larger price moves than implied by the volatility assumption. 4. The trend can be ignored in the volatility calculation—Option pricing models gauge the probability of price moves of a given magnitude based on volatility and time. Trend is not part of the calculation. The implicit assumption is that the direction of daily price changes is random. Consequently, a trending market can result in price moves that would be deemed improbable by the pricing model. If there is a reason to expect a trend, then out-of-the-money options are likely to be underpriced. Mai’s Canadian dollar option trade was based on this premise. 5.… ([Location 5093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5093))

- assumption may often be invalid for markets that have variable correlation patterns. One of the great misconceptions of the investing public is equating risk with volatility, which is wrongheaded on multiple grounds. First, frequently, the most important risks don’t show up in the track record and hence are not reflected by volatility. For example, a portfolio of illiquid positions held during a risk-on period may have low volatility, but large risk if market sentiment shifts to risk-off. The other side of the coin is that sometimes volatility can be high because of abrupt, large gains, but the theoretical risk of the investment is limited. Mai’s strategy provides a good example of an investment approach that has high volatility and constrained risk. Mai’s track record shows a lot of volatility because of a predilection to large gains—not a characteristic most investors would associate with risk or consider undesirable. Although the volatility is very high, the risk is tightly controlled… ([Location 5112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5112))

One of the only things I could say with certainty was that markets trend because I can observe trends in any financial market, in any time era. You could go back 150 years in cotton futures, and there are trends everywhere. The same is true for equities, bonds, short-term rates, everything. It seems illogical that markets trend. Markets should discount all information and then be static waiting for the next piece of information before changing price level. But that is not what they do. And the reason they trend is because our minds just don’t work properly. We make an estimation of the future based on all the knowledge we have of the past at the current moment. We remember the past in bullet point form. We’ll never remember this conversation verbatim; we’ll remember bullet points.

- currently, we have a high level of detail on because they are instantaneous and all around us. It turns out that when you recall the past, you have lots of gaps because you only retain an edited summary of it. You fill in those gaps the same way you fill in a wall with plaster. The material with which you fill in the gaps in your past recollections is called today. So how you feel today, whatever you are thinking today, whatever is going on today is what you’re going to use to fill in the gaps in the past. It is well known that people misremember the past. There is a famous experiment in which about 200 people watch a slide sequence of a car going to the end of a street, turning right, and then hitting a pedestrian. Half the group see slides with a stop sign at the end of the street, and the other half see a similar set of slides with a yield sign. The subjects are then asked some questions about what they saw. Within each group, half the subjects are asked one question that refers to a stop sign, while the other half are asked the same question with a reference to a yield sign. All the participants are then shown two nearly identical slides and asked to pick the slide they saw. The only difference between the two slides is that one has a stop sign and the other a yield sign. A large majority of the people who were asked a question that contradicted what they saw (a reference to a stop sign when they saw a yield sign or vice versa) misidentified the slide they actually saw. The point is that once they are presented with contradictory information, the majority of people misremember something that they watched only a few moments ago because they use the more recent information to fill in what they can’t remember exactly, or at least are not 100 percent sure of. They are filling in the gaps in their bullet point memory of the past with information from the current moment. If the market is going up today, your forecast is going to be that it will continue going up because it is how you feel at the moment that is the most important thing. Today becomes how you felt in the past because you misremember. So everything is about today. If it is going up today, it will go up tomorrow. In this sense, financial markets become self-referential. I would have a different explanation of why markets trend.

It’s the fact that it messes up your psychology. You lose the bullets in your gun. What happens is you put on a stupid trade, lose $20 million in 10 minutes, and take the trade off. You feel like an idiot, and you’re not in the mood to put on anything else. Then the elephant walks past you while your gun’s not loaded. It’s amazing how annoyingly often that happens. In this game, you want to be there when the great trade comes along. It’s the 80/20 rule of life. In trading, 80 percent of your profits come from 20 percent of your ideas. How do you avoid or minimize losses? I don’t trade unless I have done all the work and really have a view. If I enter a trade, and the minute I put it on, I feel uncomfortable, I will just turn around and get right out. Also, I look at each trade in my book every day and ask myself the question, “Would I enter this trade today at this price?” If the answer is “no,” then the trade is gone.

Bull markets ignore any bad news, and any good news is a reason for a further rally.

In 2009, I was long 2-year notes/short 10-year notes one-year forward, looking for the yield curve to widen, and a lot of news came out that I thought would hurt me. One news item after another, I saw the screen and thought, I am going to get screwed in this position. But I didn’t.

- How do you get the consensus? It is not easy to get. If you ask people their position, they’re not exactly going to tell you, are they? My favorite question to ask people is, “What is your opinion?” The minute you ask people for their opinion, they feel important. If I ask a hedge fund manager for his opinion on where the 30-year bond will be trading in three months’ time, and he starts talking about factors that will push interest rates up, I know that he is short bonds because the correlation between his three-month forecast and his current position is going to be 100 percent. There is no doubt about that. If he was long, he would have picked some plausible story about why rates should go down. It’s amazing how much information you can get about people’s positions by simply asking them about their opinions. Have there been any situations where the market abruptly reversed direction and you were positioned the wrong way in meaningful size? If so, how did you handle it? I once went on a trip with ARK, which is a charity I sponsor, to help design a feeding program for children, which has turned out to be a great success, reaching 60,000 children. At the time, I had a massive long position in European interest rate futures. While I was on the flight to South Africa, the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked rates very unexpectedly. It was a massive hit. It was probably the only time I got an ECB call wrong. As soon as I landed, I got a phone call from an assistant telling me the ECB had just hiked rates and asking me what I wanted to do. “How much are we down?” I asked. “About $70 million to $80 million,” he answered. I said, “If they started hiking, they won’t stop at 25 basis points. I can see this trade turning into a $250 million loss by week’s end. Dump everything aggressively. Take the price to a place where it trades.” When I am wrong, the only… ([Location 5582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5582))

According to Platt, it is “the most important thing.” And Platt is a master of risk control. “I hate losing money more than anything,” he says, and that aversion strongly colors his trading approach. The principle of minimizing losses permeates Platt’s trading habits. Risk management begins with trade implementation. Platt will express a trading theme, say an expectation that interest rates will decrease, by implementing the trade in a way that minimizes risk relative to the same return potential. Thus Platt will rarely implement directional trade ideas as outright long or short positions. He will be much more likely to use long options or complex spread… ([Location 5610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5610))

- not stop there. If he feels uncomfortable in a trade after he enters it, he will get right out. Most of the trades that Platt stops himself out of never get to their stop-loss points. If a trade does not work within a reasonable amount of time, Platt will just liquidate rather than give it room to his original stop point. Platt also reevaluates each of his positions daily and asks himself whether he would still place the same trade today. If not, he will liquidate it. Perhaps the most potent risk control Platt employs in BlueCrest’s discretionary strategy is maintaining an extremely tight rein on what a trader can lose before capital is withdrawn. A mere 3 percent loss is enough to trigger a 50 percent reduction in a trader’s allocation, and the same small additional percentage loss is all it takes to remove a trader’s entire allocation. These rigid rules seek to prevent any trader from losing more than 5 percent of his initial stake. (The combination of two successive 3 percent losses is less than a 5 percent loss because the second 3… ([Location 5617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5617))

- very difficult for individual traders, and in turn the strategy, to make much money. It seems that with only 3 percent leeway before their capital allocation is slashed that traders would be risking too little on their trades to make much of a return. How then has the discretionary strategy managed to average nearly a 14 percent per year net return? The key is that the 3 percent/3 percent risk rule applies to a trader’s starting stake. So certainly, the rule encourages traders to be very cautious at the onset, being highly selective in their trades and tightly limiting the loss on any trade. But as traders get ahead, their cushion widens, as trading gains augment the small initial 3 percent loss allowance. Once they are comfortably in the black, traders can take much more risk, thereby creating the potential to achieve large returns, despite the highly restrictive initial loss limitation. Essentially, the trader allocation risk control strategy assures capital preservation, while at the same time keeping upside potential open-ended by allowing greater risk-taking with profits. It is, effectively, an asymmetric risk management strategy. Risk control is important for many obvious reasons, which include avoiding account-incapacitating losses, minimizing emotional pain, and constraining the adverse impact of compounding—large percentage losses require increasingly greater percentage gains to get back to even. Platt, however, points out a far less obvious reason for avoiding losses: Losing trades mentally impede the trader and often result in missed winning trade opportunities. As Platt colorfully describes the trader’s mindset after incurring a foolish loss, “You feel like an idiot, and you’re not in the mood to put anything else on. Then the elephant walks past you while your gun’s not loaded.” Platt says that trading follows the 80/20 rule—80 percent of a trader’s profits come from 20 percent of the trades. If the psychological fallout from a trading loss causes a trader to miss a trade in the 20 percent, it can be a big deal. Platt pays a lot of attention to how the market responds to news. He cites the interesting observation of a trade in which there was a continuing stream of news items adverse to his position, and yet the market did not move against him. Platt read the inability of the market to respond to the news as confirmation of his trade idea… ([Location 5627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=5627))

Eventually, I called him and asked him what was going on with the stock he had recommended. He said he had been selling the stock all day. He just stitched me. That was a bad experience. What do you mean he stitched you? He recommended buying the stock, which I did. The next day he smashed the stock. When you say “stitched you,” you mean he set you up. Yes.

There was a total disconnect between my feelings and reality. In my head, if I was down 10 percent, my business would be over. No one ever would give me money to manage. I had no perspective. I had no older person to put his hand on my shoulder and say, “Calm down. Just do the things that work and stop doing the things that don’t.” I can remember sitting at the kitchen table, my head in my hands, staring into an abyss. I put so much pressure on myself to make money every day. I must make money. I must make money. I must make money. And I was having a very hard time making money in the market.

You are only as good as your last trade, and that is it. You build nothing; you just trade. The day you stop trading, it’s gone. So what you have spent doing for X hours every working day of your life has ended, and there is nothing left to show for it, except for money. You have to keep trading because you don’t want to stop and look back. Because what have you done? You have built nothing. You have achieved nothing. You get to the end of it and look back and wonder, What have I accomplished? I have a very nihilistic view of it, but that is the way I feel. I am still back at that point where I am a 17-year-old trying to decide what I want to do. But somewhere along the line you went from having joy in this business to feeling unsatisfied.

It probably was. The joy ended. Being a trader was fun, and you could walk away. But when you have a business, you can’t walk away. So it becomes a prison in some ways, whereas being a trader was very free. Ironically, you’ve taken on more business responsibility by becoming a managing member of First New York Securities.

- six or lower, you shouldn’t be buying at all at eight, or if you do, it should be 25 percent of the size. You have to train yourself to trade at a smaller size so that you trade within your emotional capacity. If you are really, really excited about a trade and swing the bat in a big way, and 10 minutes later the market moves against you, but you are the type of person who doesn’t handle that type of volatility well, you will end up cutting your position and losing money, even if the trade was ultimately a big winner. We see this behavior in traders all the time. It is the size of the position you put on rather than the price at which you put it on that determines your ability to keep the position. Your message then is that although traders focus almost entirely on where to enter a trade, in reality, the entry size is more important than the entry price because if the size is right, you are much more likely to stay with a winning trade. One of the first lessons my first boss taught me was that price is irrelevant; it is all about controlling the size of your position. On a related point, liquidity is also very important. That is why when a merger deal breaks, we cut it straight away because you get a pocket of liquidity. ([Location 6156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6156))

One well-known macro trader wrote to his investors in 2008 that he had made them money, but it was all the other managers in the fund, trading an assortment of strategies, who lost all the money. Well, you hired them. You gave them all the money. We have seen that again and again in hedge funds. Managers diversify away from their expertise because they have made a lot of money and think they can do anything. What is it about some traders that drives them away from what they do well to do things they may not do well? I think deep down inside they know they are one-trick ponies, and that one thing could end. But successful traders who are one-trick ponies, when that trick stops, they learn another trick. That is exactly what happens, but some traders will change while their one trick is still working and destroy it. You need to be a bit obsessive to do the same thing 10 hours a day.

I thought the only way that would happen would be if there was some more major market distress. To hedge against this possibility, I bought out-of-the-money puts on the S&P and sold out-of-the-money calls to pay for the puts. If the market went sideways or up, we would do very well because of our core portfolio. If the market went down suddenly, we still felt our core portfolio would hold up, and the puts would provide protection against a change in margin requirements. In 2008, the world had changed. Volatility quadrupled. I decided we should trade a fraction of what we used to trade. Most people didn’t do that and got blown up. Was there anything that triggered your cutting exposure? We had a good month, then another very good month, and started the next month very strong. Then two days later, we were down for the month. And nothing had happened.

- that it may seem almost unnecessary to state. But what is surprising is how many traders fail to adhere to this seemingly obvious principle. Examples abound. Some traders may be good at taking well-thought-out longer-term positions, but then also take short-term trades based on whims in which they have no edge. Other traders have effective systems, but get bored following a computerized approach and override their own system with discretionary decisions that degrade overall performance. There is no shortage of examples of traders deviating from what they do best, whether due to boredom, or a sense that if they are good in one type of trade, they should be good at other types of trades as well. Clark’s message to traders is that they need to figure out exactly what they are best in and then focus on doing those trades. Many traders may not even be fully aware of where they are making and losing money. One useful exercise traders can do is to analyze their past trades by segmenting winners and losers.… ([Location 6358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6358))

- advises: Do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. As a related point, Clark cautions traders against diversifying away from their expertise. Some traders succeed because they are good at doing one type of trade. This success can often encourage traders to expand into other areas in which they may not have any expertise or particular edge. Traders focus almost entirely on where to enter a trade. In reality, the entry size is often more important than the entry price because if the size is too large, a trader will be more likely to exit a good trade on a meaningless adverse price move. The larger the position, the greater the danger that trading decisions will be driven by fear rather than by judgment and experience. According to Clark, one way of knowing your position is too large is if you wake up thinking about it. You also need to be sure that your methodology is consistent with your risk tolerance. For example, if your trade implementation strategy allows for… ([Location 6368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6368))

- become the prevailing instinct guiding your judgment. As Clark says, you have to “trade within your emotional capacity.” Position size is important not only in avoiding trading too large, but also in trading larger when warranted. If everything lines up in a trade—a compelling reason why the trade should work, large potential relative to risk, high confidence in the position, and so on—then the trade should be put on in larger-than-normal size. Clark cites buying the Fiat rights below intrinsic value as an example of such a trade. Traders also need to adjust position size in response to the changing market environment. If the market volatility increases dramatically, traders need to reduce their normal exposure levels correspondingly, or else their risk will dramatically increase. In 2008, Clark reduced his exposure levels by 75 percent in response to sharply increased volatility. Flexibility is an essential quality to successful trading. It is important not to get attached to an idea and to always be willing to get out of a trade. Clark says that really good traders are capable of changing their mind in an instant if the price action is inconsistent with their trade hypothesis. They can be absolutely convinced the market is going higher one moment, and then be just as sure the market is going down in the next. Virtually all traders experience periods when they are out of sync with the markets. When you are in a losing streak, you can’t turn the situation around by trying harder. When trading is going badly, Clark’s advice is to get out of everything and take a holiday. Liquidating positions will allow you to regain objectivity. You can’t be objective if you are in the market. Taking a physical break will interrupt the negative downward spiral that can develop in a losing streak, as each loss further diminishes confidence. When you restart trading, trade smaller until you have regained confidence. Beware of trades borne of euphoria.

- Buying low-beta stocks is a common mistake investors make. Why would you ever want to own boring stocks? If the market goes down 40 percent for macro reasons, they’ll go down 20 percent. Wouldn’t you just rather own cash? And if the market goes up 50 percent, the boring stocks will go up only 10 percent. You have negatively asymmetric returns. It is what I call a pigeon-and-elephant trade—you eat like a pigeon and shit like an elephant. If you have a portfolio of boring stocks and want to make it produce equity-like returns, you have to leverage it up. If the portfolio then goes wrong, the loss is going to be massively asymmetric because of the leverage. I also think emerging market bonds are inherently unattractive. If all goes well, you get your coupon payment, but if the country defaults, you could lose all your money. So why would you ever bother?

- There are multiple reasons for it. First, management fees in emerging markets are relatively high—typically, 100 to 200 basis points. Second, the high volatility of emerging markets leads to a bias of managers making poor investment decisions, such as panicking out of positions near the bottom and jumping into positions near the top because they are afraid of missing the move. Third, the composition of the emerging market index changes frequently, which leads to a negative bias when managers sell a stock that has been dropped from the index and is under widespread selling pressure. Fourth, and perhaps most important, emerging markets tend to behave more irrationally than any other market because a large percentage of participants in these markets are local retail investors.

When you are dealing with that kind of mind-set, you can get very badly burned investing just on fundamentals. I thought that foreign investors were dominant in emerging markets. The thundering herd of foreign investors that can shift huge amounts of money in and out of emerging markets are dominant around cycle turning points, but over longer periods, the key price moves are influenced by local investors and the rumor of the day. You can have a situation where you go short because there is terrible fundamental news on a company, and then the stock keeps on going up because of some wild, unfounded rumor that the son of the president is going to buy the company out. Why then don’t people invest directly into the index if such a large percentage of managers underperform the index?

Look at the Templeton emerging markets funds, for example, managed by Mark Mobius. Contrary to his media image as an emerging markets investment guru, he has in fact massively underperformed the index over the past 20 years. This fact hasn’t stopped them raising tens of billions of dollars because he is always in the papers visiting and opining on emerging market companies and governments. The world of investment advisers is heavily influenced by media image so they suck their clients into this stuff. Why do so many people continue to invest with him if the relative performance has been so bad? Because they’re not looking at relative performance. Emerging markets have gone up a lot over time.

- My biggest position is Apple. The reason I like Apple is that it is a company that is almost solely analyzed by U.S. analysts who think that Apple has limited growth potential because of the large market share it already has in the U.S. They fail to appreciate that only 300 million people live in the U.S., and there are 6.7 billion people in the rest of the world. The market in which Apple has the highest approval rating is China, which is a market with 900 million mobile phone subscribers. And currently, how many iPhones have been sold in China? Three million. Their unique operating system and excellent hardware give Apple a barriers-to-entry advantage relative to their competitors. I believe over the next four years, Apple will inevitably repeat the success it has had in the U.S. on a global scale. We forecast the earnings of every company we follow for three or four years out. I like to invest in companies that are cheap relative to their sector, but where we are forecasting earnings above consensus for the next few years. The catalyst I monitor for a stock to realize value is earnings surprise. In the case of Apple, we are forecasting earnings 50 or 60 percent above the street for the next three or four years. Although Apple ([Location 6903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6903))

- is currently trading at 16 times forward prospective earnings for 2011, based on our forecasted level of earnings for 2014, it is only trading at 4.8 times earnings. Apple is one of the fastest-growing companies in the world, with one of the best management teams, trading at less than five times earnings based on our future earnings projections, and with $150 billion net cash by 2014, which is nearly half of its market cap. We currently have 20 percent of our portfolio in Apple. Given all those bullish fundamentals, why hasn’t Apple performed better? One reason it is not performing at the moment is because it has gone up a lot, so investors think they can’t buy it. But the main reason is that all that the analysts in the U.S. seem to be focused on is that the next iPhone may be delayed for a few months. They think that is bad. It is not bad at all. The reason Apple is so brilliant is because their execution is outstanding. Would they prefer if Apple came out with their next iPhone version early and did what RIMM [Research in Motion Ltd.] has done with the PlayBook, the new tablet they have for the BlackBerry, which is one of the most suicidal pieces of rubbish ([Location 6912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6912))

That is like producing a car with no engine or wheels. It is literally as bad as that. It shouldn’t have come out for at least another year. The reason they rushed it to market, even though it is not ready, is that the Apple iPad 2 is such a big advance that it has helped Apple break into the corporate market. Now businesspeople are saying, I don’t want my BlackBerry phone anymore; I want an iPhone.

- So what do you do to manage risk instead? It is common sense. There are multiple requirements for a trade to take place. Do we like the company? Is it cheap? Does it generate cash flow? Do we trust the management? Do I have confidence in my projections? Is the macro outlook favorable? If a company meets all the criteria, then the next step is determining the appropriate position size. Given the degree of company and country risk, what do I think is the appropriate size position? If it is something very risky, a large position for me might be 1 percent to 5 percent of the portfolio. If it is a lower risk position in which I have very high confidence, the position could be as large as 20 percent of the portfolio, as is currently the case for Apple. I accept that if anything were to happen to Steve Jobs, the stock could go down 10 percent. That would be a 2 percent hit on my portfolio. I could live with that because I think the stock will triple over the next four years. If I have that big of a position in Apple, can I have another significant position in the same industry sector? No, ([Location 6970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6970))

- I can’t because a negative shock event or development might be one that impacts the entire sector rather than being Apple specific. In controlling risk, it is also very important to have people in your team whose opinions you respect, who can push back at your ideas in a way that will make you stop, listen, and test your own views. My partner, Nick Barnes, is crucial to me in this regard. Steve Jobs died about a half year after this interview. Although Apple stock moved lower in the weeks preceding his death, ironically, the stock moved higher after the event. Is there any common denominator as to why your projections for a stock will differ from the market’s perception? Normally, it is because there is some kind of trend that I think is common sense but that the market does not appreciate because it is extrapolating history instead of looking forward. For example, Apple has never had any consequential sales in India or China, so the street assumption is that they never will, which is imbecilic. As another example, during the fourth quarter of last year, Apple sold 7.3 million iPads. The average street forecast for iPad sales this year is 29.5 million units. All they have ([Location 6979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6979))

- done is take fourth-quarter sales of last year and annualize them. What they are failing to take into account is that Apple has revolutionized an existing product that was already way ahead of any competitor. Not only is it a much better product, but Steve Jobs decided to price it competitively instead of at a premium. Given Apple’s economies of scale, no one else can even possibly compete. So we think they will sell 40 million iPads this year and 60 million next year. The street’s forecast for next year is 40 million. It is not rocket science; it is just common sense. Everything we have talked about has involved fundamental analysis. Does that imply that you don’t use technical analysis at all? Oh, no. Charts are very important. Once I have done the fundamental work and decided to buy a stock, I will first look at the chart before putting on a position. If the stock is very overbought, it won’t stop me from buying, but I will start with a small… ([Location 6991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=6991))

- If the stock is extremely overbought, then I might start with only a 1 percent position. If the stock just keeps on going up, then I am happy that I bought at least some. I will also be more willing to buy more because I bought part of the position at a lower price. Whereas, if I didn’t initially buy anything because the stock was overbought, I would then never buy any of it, which would be a dreadful mistake. Equally important, if I decide to buy a stock based on fundamentals and then look at the chart and see that it has massively underperformed relative to the market, I will check who has been selling the stock. Such price weakness might indicate that all our fundamental research is worthless because management has lied to us. I also use charts as an aid to adding to positions. If I am bullish on a stock but don’t have a full position, and then the stock breaks out on the chart, I will then go to a full position because the breakout confirms that the market is now seeing the same thing I am seeing. So you’re basically using charts as a supplemental tool. Yes, the core is always fundamental. There is, however, one exception where a trade might be initiated because of charts. If a stock is extremely oversold—say, the RSI is at a three-year low—it will get me to take a closer look at it.8 Normally, if a stock is that brutalized, it means that whatever is killing it is probably already in the price. RSI doesn’t work as an overbought indicator because stocks can remain overbought for a very long time.

If you don’t understand why you are in a trade, you won’t understand when it is the right time to sell, which means you will only sell when the price action scares you. Most of the time when price action scares you, it is a buying opportunity, not a sell indicator. ([Location 7030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=7030))

- portfolio. First, Taylor will concentrate longs in countries with the most positive fundamentals. Second, the global macro outlook can influence the total portfolio net exposure. For example, in late 2008 to early 2009, the very negative global macro fundamentals kept net exposure significantly lower than it would have been based solely on the individual company fundamentals. 2. Supportive secular trend—Taylor looks for situations in which there is a strong fundamentally based secular trend that supports the trade. For example, the strong trend in increasing Russian mobile phone usage in the early 2000s was a key consideration that prompted Taylor to place a large and very profitable position in companies in this sector. As another example, Taylor’s expectation that Apple’s global market share of its products will trend steadily higher in coming years was the dominant reason why Apple was his largest holding at the time of this interview (April 2011). 3. Good company—Taylor looks for companies with attractive growth prospects priced at reasonable values relative to future expected earnings. He avoids what he calls “boring” companies (typically low-beta stocks) regardless of whether they are good values.

- Investors often miss the best stocks because they can’t bring themselves to buy a stock that has already gone up a lot. What matters is not how much a stock has gone up, but rather how well a stock is priced relative to its future prospects. Taylor’s largest holding at the time of our interview, Apple, had already experienced a very large price advance—and indeed, it was the magnitude of this prior rise that kept many investors from buying the stock, despite its excellent fundamentals. As Taylor viewed it, however, the amount of the prior price gain was irrelevant because based on his earnings projections for Apple, the stock was actually very cheap, notwithstanding its seemingly lofty price. It is important that your net exposure match your comfort level. For example, if you are uncomfortable being completely out of the market, then a flat position may actually be riskier than a modest long position because you will be much more likely to chase false rallies and get whipsawed. Taylor believes that having… ([Location 7071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=7071))

- one or more of the period’s false rallies, potentially losing more than he did with his modest net long exposure. The moral is that you have to know your net exposure comfort zone. For Taylor, the low end of this comfort zone is 20 percent net long. As another example of the benefits of trading within a net exposure comfort zone, a smaller net exposure may yield better returns, even if the market moves higher. For example, although the market eventually rose to higher levels, by sharply reducing his net long exposure in early January 2008, Taylor was in a position to increase his long exposure following the price plunge later in that month. If he had stayed heavily net long, he might well have been forced to sell into the market weakness to reduce risk. The difference between being a buyer on market weakness instead of a potential seller more than offset the reduced returns implied by a lower net exposure for the period as a whole. Although trying to tightly constrain monthly losses may seem like a prudent approach—and indeed is for many traders—for investors with a long-term perspective, a constraint of keeping monthly losses below some moderate threshold could be detrimental. Taylor believes that an obsession with monthly returns can adversely influence long-term investment decisions. If he is strongly convinced that a stock will move much higher over the long term, then in his view, cutting exposure on interim weakness to limit the depth of a monthly loss would be a mistake. Freeing himself from what he calls the “tyranny” of a monthly return focus was one of the main motivations behind Taylor’s decision to return investor assets and restructure as a much smaller fund. In my experience, it is usually a mistake for a manager to alter his investment decisions or investment process to better fit investor demands. Taylor acknowledges this same perspective when he states, “I am trying to stop caring about what my clients think.” Taylor believes the best opportunities are those where you… ([Location 7080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=7080))

Stock picking. When the market sells off really hard, as happened in late 2008 to early 2009, it is usually a matter of liquidity. There’s no place to hide in a liquidity sell-off; people sell everything because they have to, not because they want to. The reverse rarely happens on the upside. People don’t run out and buy everything. There are always some stocks that are going down. The interesting thing is that shorts are actually easier to find than longs. It is easier to spot a broken company than a good company. It is easier to identify bad management than good management.

When stock prices are near the low end of the long-term price band, Claugus will hold a maximum long position. Conversely, when prices are near the upper end of the band, he will hold a maximum short position. Varying the net exposure based on the prevailing opportunity provides for substantial improvement over an investment approach that maintains net exposure within a narrow range. One of Claugus’s major themes in selecting individual stocks is looking for companies that will benefit from a future development that is not being priced into the current market. The source of the improvement can take many forms including anticipated new sources of production, new technology, an expected increase in asset values, and so on.

- for free. Fundamental screens will fail to identify these stocks because the source of the bullish potential is not at all reflected in current statistics. A common error that traders make is to judge whether a trading decision was right—or wrong—based on the outcome. If I offer you 2:1 odds on a fair coin toss, and you take the bet and lose, it may be a losing bet, but it is still a correct bet because, on balance, making the same decision repeatedly will be very profitable. Similarly, a losing trade can still reflect a correct trading decision. Claugus lost money in shorting what he terms “Evel Knievel” stocks in late 1999. But these trades were not mistakes because Claugus has found that shorting these companies is a winning strategy. There is no way of knowing a priori which individual trade is likely to be a winner. Traders need to accept that a certain percentage of good trades will lose money. As long as a profitable strategy is implemented according to plan, a trade loss does not imply a trading mistake.

Traders often confuse the concepts of winning and losing traders with good and bad trades. A good trade can lose money, and a bad trade can make money.

Pricey stocks are always 30 percent pricier than they should be because people are willing to own them at 30 percent above what they should own them at. A good growth stock is always overvalued, and a lousy company is always undervalued. That is the danger of buying value stocks. Until you get the turn where the market recognizes an improvement in the business model, they are always going to be undervalued. If you are going to short a growth stock because it is 30 percent overvalued, it is going to grow for the next five years always being 30 percent overvalued—until it finally breaks, and by that time, you are probably not going to be there.

I understood banks in terms of their basic business, but I didn’t understand anything that was said about CDOs or anything else to do with mortgage-backed securitizations. But the key thing I realized from the call was that not a single analyst understood it, either.

- What is the right way to manage risk? The right way to manage risk is to monitor your positions and to have a mental point at which you reevaluate the position. The amount of room you would allow till that point would be different for different stocks. Every stock has its own risk profile. Some stocks could go down 50 percent, and it wouldn’t necessarily mean anything. But for a stock like Coca-Cola, you should be reevaluating if it moves 5 percent against you. Don’t ever consider yourself right. The hardest thing is to sell on the way down. It’s emotionally difficult because you believe you’re right or that you will eventually be right. The best way I have found to do it is to begin by selling 20 percent of the position. That doesn’t hurt, and if the stock comes back, I can still say I was right. If the stock goes lower, I can also say I was right because at least I sold 20 percent of the stock higher. Is that what you typically do—scale out of a position? Yes, I scale out, and I also scale in. The idea is don’t try to be 100 percent right. ([Location 7830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=7830))

It is all about keeping the portfolio from weighing you down. Sometimes, though, it is best to just liquidate the entire position. It’s a good idea to harvest your losses because it forces you to revisit the trade. If you are in the trade, you are always defending it. Liquidating forces you to reevaluate the trade relative to other opportunities. You sold the position. Do you really want to buy it back? Or would you rather put the money in this other idea, which looks a lot better right now? ([Location 7842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=7842))

- It is really important to manage your emotional attachment to losses and gains. You want to limit your size in any position so that fear does not become the prevailing instinct guiding your judgment. Everyone will have a different level. It also depends on what kind of stock it is. A 10 percent position might be perfectly okay for a large-cap stock, while a 3 percent position in a highflying mid-cap stock, which has frequent 30 percent swings, might be far too risky. Why do most people fail at trading? To be successful in the markets, you have to be willing to change your opinion. Most people are not willing to change their opinion. You have to be humble about your ideas. What other mistakes do people make in trading? Most people are more afraid of making money than losing money. What do you mean by that? There is no real reason to sell a stock just because it’s up 20 percent. I would argue that when people sell a stock when it’s up 20 percent, it’s not because they are afraid of making money, but because they are afraid of losing what they made. Maybe you are right.

Investor sentiment, however, is usually wrong, at least over the longer term. How do you judge investor sentiment? One way is by listening to my own investors. When I start hearing the same comments from a number of my investors, it is a good reflection of what everyone is thinking. For example? When the retail stocks were getting hammered last year, my investors were all asking, “Why would you want to own any retail stocks?” Of course, that was exactly the right time to own them.

- But you also still believe in your position and are worried about throwing in the towel just before the market turns. You are frozen in indecision. Vidich offers a perspective that provides a solution. “Don’t try to be 100 percent right,” he says. Instead of making an all-or-nothing decision, when Vidich is faced with a losing position, he will often begin by liquidating part of the position. Taking a partial loss is much easier than liquidating the entire position. It allows the trader to act rather than procrastinate. If the position continues to move against Vidich, he will liquidate some more. In this way, a losing position is gradually reduced (and eventually entirely liquidated if it doesn’t turn around), mitigating the damage. The next time you are undecided between liquidating a losing position and gritting your teeth and riding it out, remember that there is a third alternative: partial liquidation. A common mistake made by traders is that they let their greed influence position sizing beyond their comfort level. Why put on a 5 percent position when you can put on a 10 percent position and double the profits? The problem is that the larger the position, the greater the danger that trading decisions will be driven by fear rather than by judgment and experience.

Vidich is a long-term bull in the energy markets, but he doesn’t let this view interfere with making the right trading decision. In 2008, when prices moved excessively on the upside, Vidich gradually transitioned from net long to net short. In the subsequent collapse in crude oil, Vidich repositioned himself back on the long side of energy equities once crude had fallen to about $90. But he soon realized that the changing fundamentals and market sentiment implied lower prices and reversed back to the short side. Crude oil prices and energy equities subsequently collapsed.

- It is probably more accurate to think of Daly as a private investor than a hedge fund manager. The hedge fund is essentially the private account he would be running if he were on his own, with a structure that allows other investors to co-invest. Daly accounted for about one-third of the invested assets when the fund launched, and still accounts for about the same percentage today. He runs the fund as a solo operation from his home office. Daly is quite happy with this simple structure, and he is downright reluctant to put any effort into raising assets for his fund, as it might necessitate expanding beyond a one-man business. He is loath to complicate what he considers the perfect current arrangement. Daly is a man whose work and hobby are the same. If Daly were retired, I believe his life would be totally unchanged. He would, no doubt, still be spending his day managing his stock account, which would be indistinguishable from the current fund.

Price to free cash flow—FCF is the money a company has left over after it has paid all expenses and made capital investments. It can be used to pay dividends, repurchase shares, or make acquisitions. The aim is to find businesses selling at low multiples of FCF. P/E ratio—The current price per share divided by the forecasted earnings. The lower the ratio the better. EV/EBIT (cap rate)—This ratio is a twist on the EV/EBITDA metric. However, instead of EBITDA we used EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes but after deducting depreciation and amortization. At my old firm, Hoefer & Arnett, we used to call EV/EBIT a “cap rate,” similar to a cap rate used to value real estate. We used to argue, why buy a piece of commercial real estate with a 6 percent cap rate or a bond with a 7 percent yield if you could buy a business like Macy’s with a 20 percent cap rate? For financial companies and banks, I use some of the following: Price/tangible book value—The tangible book value (TBV) is equal ([Location 8154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=8154))

Assuming the loans on a bank’s balance sheet have been appropriately accounted for—a big assumption considering the events in the financial industry over the past several years—a bank trading around its TBV would represent the value at which one could theoretically liquidate the bank. The TBV per share, therefore, might provide somewhat of a floor for a bank’s value. P/E ratio Tangible common equity/total assets—This ratio provides a measure of a bank’s capital adequacy. The more tangible common equity, the less leverage is employed and the “safer” the bank is. ([Location 8164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=8164))

- Claude Debussy said, “Music is the space between the notes.” Analogously, the space between investments—the times one is out of the market—can be critical to successful investing. Despite being primarily a net long equity investor, Daly achieved cumulative gross returns in excess of 800 percent during a 12-year period when the broad equity market indexes were essentially flat. How did he do it? Well, of course, superior stock selection was an important component, but it is not the entire answer. Not being invested (that is, being primarily in cash) during negative environments is the other part of the answer. By not participating in the market at the wrong times, Daly sidestepped most of the large drawdowns in equities during two major bear markets—a crucial factor that underlies the large growth in his equity. Sometimes, being out of the market may be nearly as important to success as the investments made. Whether you are a value investor, as Daly is, or use some totally different investment or trading approach, the critical lesson is that it is important not to be involved in the market when the opportunities are not there.

Think of the patience it required for Daly to remain largely in cash for well over two years in the prolonged 2000 to 2002 bear market. Daly’s stock investing methodology and philosophy can be summarized as follows: Stick to businesses you understand.

Daly fully understands the advantage of managing smaller assets, which is one reason why he has made virtually no effort to raise additional assets. Individual investors may feel they are at a major disadvantage to large hedge fund managers, but they actually have an important advantage: Their small trading size allows them to move in and out of positions, even less liquid equities, with virtually no market impact. The larger the assets, the more difficult it is for a manager to enter and liquidate positions without incurring significant slippage costs. Also, as the assets managed grow, the universe of possible opportunities shrinks. For large hedge fund managers, many markets and securities cannot be traded, simply because the size at which they could trade these markets and still have adequate… ([Location 8336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=8336))

If the market then goes up again, I am reselling the same 20 percent of my short at prices that are maybe 3 percent higher than where I covered. So the average share price on my shorts goes up. But it is a lot of work. Going along with whatever the market is doing doesn’t make sense to me, and I have to honor that. I have made money every year in my career.

There are days when the market is up 5 or 10 handles and Jimmy may be $10 million short, and he will still finish up for the day. And I can see that if he had not done any executions, he would be down $150,000 for the day. But instead he’ll end up being up $30,000 for the day just by constantly trading in and out. We did 520 orders today. So when Jimmy is short and the market is up, he is not necessarily losing. [Jimmy speaking again.] That’s the point.

Whereas before I would dig in my heels, I’m not willing to go there anymore. Now, when a trade feels painful, I start reducing my exposure.

- The trading approach you have described—a strategy of selling stocks when they are up and buying stocks when they are down—hardly sounds like a recipe for success. In fact, it is easy to imagine how the approach could be disastrous. So obviously there is more to what you are doing. Can you put some color on it? How do you do what you do? Can you provide some specific examples of how you pick and time your trades? I divide stocks into those that I’m looking to buy and those that I’m looking to sell. Then I recognize when those buys or sells show up in a way that suggests there is a possibility for an accelerated move in a short period of time. How do you recognize that point? Something changes. The chart could change. Something could happen within the group. There is something always changing, where clues are given to me along the way, that shows me it’s time. For example, Goodyear was one of the stocks on my buy list. The other auto parts stocks had broken out a while ago, but Goodyear was lagging. We had been watching it for a long time.

- Of all the traders I have ever interviewed for any of the Market Wizard books, none has provided a more difficult role model from which to draw lessons applicable to most traders. There are, however, three lessons that can be drawn from Balodimas’s story that do have more general applicability without potential lethal side effects: The need to adapt—While the commonality of human nature provides elements of consistency in market behavior across time, markets also change, and successful traders adapt to that change. In the case of Balodimas, he noticed that the much greater level of market participation by hedge funds was resulting in smoother price moves for individual stocks and far fewer pullbacks, particularly intraday. This structural change in the market made it more difficult for Balodimas to offset losses from being too early in a position with profits from trading around the position. It became more important not to be too early on trades. Balodimas responded by keeping positions smaller until there was a market change that gave him a high degree of confidence that a turning point was imminent. Even though ([Location 8828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=8828))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- very few readers will be able to relate to Balodimas’s trading strategy, the idea that trading methods need to be adapted to changing market conditions is an important concept that can be applied to each trader’s specific approach. Trading around a position—A key element in Balodimas’s trading success is adjusting position size counter to market fluctuations. For example, if he is short, he will reduce his position on price breaks and rebuild the position on rallies. Balodimas is so skillful at trading around positions that he’s often able to generate net profits even when the net price movement of a stock over time is counter to his position. Although Balodimas’s timing for this type of trading is an innate skill that cannot be translated and one that few traders will be able to match, many traders may nevertheless find that trading around a position improves performance and makes it easier to hold onto winning trades. As a simple example, assume you are long a stock at 50, looking for a long-term objective of 76, and expecting near-term resistance in the vicinity of 62. Given these assumptions, you might choose to reduce long exposure on an advance to the 61 to 63 zone, looking to reinstate the full ([Location 8837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=8837))

- position on a pullback. The potential drawback is that a retracement to the reentry level may fail to occur, in which case profits will be realized on a smaller position. On the positive side, if the liquidated portion of the position is reentered at a better price, total profits will be enhanced, and perhaps even more importantly, the ability to hold the position will be improved. Whether trading around positions is net beneficial or detrimental will be highly contingent on the individual trader. It will not necessarily be a good fit for all traders, but some traders may find it a highly useful approach. Avoid euphoria—Even though it has worked well for Balodimas for a long time, the last thing I would advise traders to do would be to sell into panic rallies. Very few traders will possess the innate timing skill and emotional stamina to pull this off successfully, and the cost of being wrong can be extreme.

- How did you define cheap? There are a lot of ways of measuring cheapness. We used the earnings yield, which we defined as the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to enterprise value. In his book The Little Book That Beats the Market, Greenblatt provided the following explanation of earnings yield: Earnings yield was measured by calculating the ratio of pre-tax operating earnings (EBIT) to enterprise ([Location 9090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9090))
- value (market value of equity + net interest-bearing debt). This ratio was used rather than the more commonly used P/E ratio (price/earnings ratio) or E/P ratio (earnings/price ratio) for several reasons. The basic idea behind the concept of earnings yield is simply to figure out how much a business earns relative to the purchase price of the business. Enterprise value was used instead of merely the price of equity (i.e., total market capitalization, share price multiplied by shares outstanding) because enterprise value takes into account both the price paid for an equity stake in a business as well as the debt financing used by a company to help generate operating earnings. By using EBIT (which looks at actual operating earnings before interest expenses and taxes) and comparing it to enterprise value, we can calculate the pre-tax earnings yield on the full purchase price of the business (i.e., pre-tax operating earnings relative to the price of equity plus any debt assumed). This allows us to put companies with different levels of debt and different tax rates on equal footing when comparing earnings yields. For example, in the case of an office building purchased for $1 ([Location 9096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9096))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- million with an $800,000 mortgage and $200,000 in equity, the price of equity is $200,000 but the enterprise value is $1 million. If the building generates EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $100,000, then EBIT/EV or the pre-tax earnings yield would be 10 percent ($100,000/$1,000,000). However, the use of debt can greatly skew the apparent returns from the purchase of these same assets when only the price of equity is considered. Assuming an interest rate of 6 percent on an $800,000 mortgage and a 40 percent corporate tax rate, the pre-tax earnings yield on our equity purchase price of $200,000 would appear to be 26 percent. As debt levels change, this pre-tax earnings yield on equity would keep changing, yet the $1 million cost of the building and the $100,000 EBIT generated by that building would remain unchanged. In other words, P/E and E/P are greatly influenced by changes in debt levels and tax rates, while EBIT/EV is not.3 We… ([Location 9106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9106))

The twist that Warren Buffett put on Graham’s method was that it is nice to buy cheap businesses, but if you can buy a good business cheap, that is even better. One of the metrics Buffett used to decide whether a company was a good business was return on tangible capital. In the book, I used an example of Jason’s Gum Shop, which costs $400,000 to set up each store including inventory, displays, and other costs, and every year that store throws off $200,000 in profits, which is a 50 percent return on capital. Then I compared it to another business called Just Broccoli, which also cost $400,000 to open a new store, but every year that store throws off only $10,000 in profit, or a 2.5 percent return on capital. Clearly a business that can return 50 percent on capital is better than a business that can return only 2.5 percent on capital.

- In his book The Little Book That Beats the Market, Greenblatt provided the following definition and explanation of return on capital: Return on capital was measured by calculating the ratio of pretax operating earnings (EBIT) to tangible capital employed (net working capital + net fixed assets). This ratio was used rather than the more commonly used ratios of return on equity (ROE, earnings/equity) or return on assets (ROA, earnings/assets) for several reasons. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was used in place of reported earnings because companies operate with different levels of debt and different tax rates. Using operating earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, allowed us to view and compare the operating earnings of different companies without the distortions arising from differences in tax rates and debt levels. For each company, it was then possible to compare actual earnings from… ([Location 9126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9126))
- or equity (used in an ROE calculation). The idea here was to figure out how much capital is actually needed to conduct the company’s business. Net working capital was used because the company has to fund its receivables and inventory (excess cash not needed to conduct the business was excluded from this calculation) but does not have to lay out money for its payables, as these are effectively an interest-free loan (short-term interest-bearing debt was excluded from current liabilities for this calculation). In addition to working capital requirements, a company must also fund the purchase of fixed assets necessary to conduct its business, such as real estate, plant, and equipment. The depreciated net cost of these fixed assets was then added to the net working capital requirements already calculated to arrive at an estimate for tangible capital employed.4 We took the same 2,500 companies and ranked them on their return on capital. We then combined the two… ([Location 9137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9137))

- on earnings yield and 250 based on return on capital, its combined rank value would be 251. We weren’t looking for the cheapest companies, and we weren’t looking for the best companies. We were looking for the best combination of cheap and good companies. In the book, I called this combined ranking the Magic Formula. During the 23 years of our backtest, using the Magic Formula to choose a portfolio of the top 30 names from the 1,000 largest capitalization stocks would have approximately doubled the return of the S&P 500 (19.7 percent versus 9.5 percent). (Selecting portfolios from the 2,500 largest companies would have had an even larger outperformance, but would have required holding less liquid smaller cap stocks.) The decade of the 2000s was particularly interesting. During 2000 to 2009, the formula still managed to deliver an average annualized return of 13.5 percent, even though the S&P 500 was down nearly 1 percent per year during the same period. The power of value investing flies in the face of anything taught in academics. Value is the way stocks are eventually priced. It requires the perspective of patience because the market will eventually gravitate toward value. We also divided the formula rankings into deciles with 250 stocks in each decile. Then we held those stocks for a year and looked at how each of the deciles did. We repeated this process each month, stepping through time. Each month, we had a new set of rankings, and we assumed we held those portfolios (one for each decile) for one year. We did that for every month in the last 23 years,… ([Location 9147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9147))

- If I wrote a book about a strategy that worked every month, or even every year, everyone would start using it, and it would stop working. Value investing doesn’t always work. The market doesn’t always agree with you. Over time, value is roughly the way the market prices stocks, but over the short term, which sometimes can be as long as two or three years, there are periods when it doesn’t work. And that is a very good thing. The fact that our value approach doesn’t work over periods of time is precisely the reason why it continues to work over the long term. Our formula forces you to buy out-of-favor companies, stocks that no one who reads a newspaper would think of buying, and hold a portfolio consisting of these stocks that, at times, may underperform the market for ([Location 9171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9171))

- as long as two or three years. Most people can’t stick with a strategy like that. After one or two years of underperformance, and usually less, they will abandon the strategy, probably switching to a strategy that has done well in recent years. It is very difficult to follow a value approach unless you have sufficient confidence in it. In my books and in my classes, I spend a lot of time trying to get people to understand that in aggregate we are buying above-average companies at below-average prices. If that approach makes sense to you, then you will have the confidence to stick with the strategy over the long term, even when it’s not working. You will give it a chance to work. But the only way you will stick with something that is not working is by understanding what you are doing. ([Location 9177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9177))

- How are your long-only equity indexes different from existing indexes? Most investors have bad choices. Seventy percent of mutual fund managers underperform the market over time, as measured by the S&P 500, primarily because of their fees that reduce the total return. You might think you could do better by trying to find managers among the 30 percent that outperform the market. The problem, however, is that there is no correlation between those who did well in the past 3, 5, or 10 years and those who continue to do well in the future.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Since investors can’t predict which 30 percent of the managers will do better than the market, the obvious conclusion is to simply go with an index fund, which has lower cost and is tax efficient. And that makes some sense. But it turns out that most popular indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Russell indexes, are very inefficient because they are market capitalization weighted. In a market capitalization weighted index, the higher the price of a stock, the larger the percentage of the index it will represent. Therefore, by definition, a market capitalization weighted index will automatically own too much of the overpriced stocks and too few of the bargain-priced ones. Of course, equally weighted indexes will also include plenty of valuation errors, but since all stocks are weighted equally, these errors will be random in contrast to the systematic errors inherent in market capitalization weighting. The way you can tell how much capitalization weighting costs investors is to compare these indexes to equal weighted indexes of the same stocks. Based on the returns during the past 40 years, equal weighting has beat market capitalization weighting by about 2 percent per year. One problem with equal weighting ([Location 9231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9231))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is that stock number 500 is much smaller than stock number 1, and if too many people try to do equal weighting, the amount of buying in the smaller stocks would distort their prices. Additionally, because prices are always changing, there are more transaction costs in maintaining an equal weighted index. Because of these problems, Rob Arnott came up with a fundamentally based index (the RAFI FTSE index), which weights companies based on the size of their sales, book value, cash flow, and dividends rather than their market capitalization. Because the weighting factors used in the index are correlated to company market capitalization, larger market capitalization companies will account for a larger percentage of the total index. And since price is not involved, errors are also random, similar to an equal weighted index, and the index performs about 2 percent better than capitalization weighted indexes. So the fundamentally based index does about… ([Location 9240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9240))

For example, the Russell 1000 value index will take a subset of the Russell 1000 companies (usually 650 stocks) that have the lowest price-to-book ratios and whatever other value factors they look at, but then they weight those stocks by market capitalization. In contrast, we are placing more weight on the cheaper companies, which is quite a different thing. We have found that by constructing an index this way, we could create an index that, over the past 20 years, would have beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 7 percent per year with the same beta and volatility. In addition to indexes, we have put together more select funds with around 100 of the cheapest stocks, also weighted by cheapness. What is interesting is that in the first six months of this year, our Value Select fund, which invests in U.S. equities, was number one in its category out of about 1,300 funds, and our Select… ([Location 9250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9250))

- What are the three biggest mistakes investors make? First, succumbing to emotions. They tend to make investment decisions based on an emotional response to price action or what they read in the papers or hear on the news. Second, investing without knowledge. If you can’t value a company, you have no basis on which to invest. Valuing a company is pretty hard, and probably no more than 1 percent or 2 percent of investors have the ability to properly value companies. You can’t buy companies for a lot less than they are worth unless you can figure out what they are worth in the first place. Third, placing too much weight on the recent past performance of managers.

- What do you teach your students? Buffett said if he were to teach a business class, he would teach two things: how to value a business and how to think about stock prices. That’s what I do. In the first lecture of the course, I point out that, although they are all very smart, and there are many other good business schools in the country whose students are also very smart, most MBAs who get involved in the markets will fail. I explain that therefore it can’t be intelligence that is the defining reason why someone is successful in the markets. I think the difference between those who succeed and those that fail is how they think about the market. Everyone is bombarded every day with price movements, explanations for those price movements, macro events, and lots of other information. You need a methodology to cut through all that information and see things as they are. It all comes back to the way Graham looked at the market. Over the short term, prices fluctuate due to emotion, but over the long term, they come back to ([Location 9366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9366))

- value. Value investing is figuring out what a business is worth and paying a lot less. I promise my students that if they do good valuation work, the market will agree with them; I just don’t tell them when. It could be a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years. But generally, if you have done good valuation work, 98 percent of the time, two or three years is enough time for the market to agree with you. That is a very powerful concept. It gives you patience. Of course, if you do poor valuation work, you can get into trouble. But if you stick to things you understand well, do good valuation work, give yourself a wide margin of safety, and have confidence in your work, eventually, you will end up doing quite well. For many businesses, though, it may be very hard to predict what their future growth rate and normalized earnings will be. My students sometimes ask, “What do you do for a company that is in a competitive industry, or technology is causing major changes, or new products are coming out, or some other circumstance makes it very difficult to estimate what future earnings might be?” I tell them to just skip that company and find a company that ([Location 9374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9374))

- they can analyze. It is very important to know what you don’t know. As Warren Buffett says, “There are no called strikes on Wall Street.” You can watch as many pitches as you want, and only swing when everything sets up your way. Another important point I try to teach my students is that you have to consider not only what your opportunity set is right now, but also what opportunities you may be forgoing later by investing now. If your opportunity set is not that great right now, maybe you should wait another 6 to 12 months before becoming fully invested. Otherwise, if you invest all your capital now based on the current opportunity set, you may not have that money available for a better opportunity in the future, or you might have to sell what you buy now at a lower price to free up the money. That is why I always assume that my minimum bogie is at least a 6 percent return, even if interest rates are near zero, as they are now. Moreover, I have to beat 6 percent by a… ([Location 9384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9384))

- What are the implications of that? Since time horizons have shortened, the advantage of taking a longer-term investment horizon has increased. You would think that with the increased availability of databases, the explosion of computing power, the availability of the Internet, and a lot of really smart math guys getting involved in the financial markets, any factors that have done well over the last 20 years would tend to degrade over time. In fact, the valuation metrics that we use, which are longer term and require a willingness to wait for them to work, have actually gotten stronger. And the reason for that is that the institutionalization of the market has shortened time horizons—it has reduced the window of time managers have to outperform. Most managers can’t wait for two years for an investment to work. They have to perform now. Their institutional and individual clients appear to demand it through their money flows. That is why companies that are not expected to do as well in the next year or two as they did in the recent past, or companies that are subject to near-term uncertainty, are systematically underpriced. Even if a manager knows that he should be looking longer term, his investors pressure him for performance over the near term.

- All the statistics say that money chases the guy who did well last year and leaves the guy who didn’t do well last year. And the subsequent performance is actually worse for the guy who did well last year. If you look at the past 3-, 5-, and 10-year returns of managers, there is no correlation between those who did well in those prior periods and those who do well in the subsequent 3, 5, and 10 years. Returns, however, are what allocators normally rely on to make decisions. If you are an allocator, you typically don’t know the thought process that went into each investment decision. All you get to see are the results. The problem is that the ([Location 9419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9419))

- past results are very misleading in terms of who is going to do better in the future. One reason for the lack of correlation between past and future performance is that if investors chase good performers, the managers with better recent performance will attract more capital, and it is harder to run more money. As Warren Buffett said, “A fat wallet is the enemy of good investment returns.” It is very difficult to have a lot of great ideas. If investors keep piling in money, then those managers have to do something with the money, and they may be forced to do some things differently than when they had less money. There is one recent study that looked at the returns of managers during the 2000 to 2009 period. The study showed that 97 percent of the top quartile managers for the decade spent at least three years in the bottom half of managers. More surprisingly, 79 percent of the top quartile managers for the decade… ([Location 9423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9423))

- Yet those were the managers that ended up with the best record for the entire period. Here is another interesting statistic. The single best-performing mutual fund for the entire decade was up 18 percent a year, on average, during a period when the market was flat, yet the average investor in that fund lost 8 percent. That is because every time the fund did well, people piled in, and every time it underperformed, people redeemed. The timing of the money flows was so bad that investors, on average, turned a fund that was making 18 percent a year into a losing investment. I think that says it all. Institutions make the same mistakes as smaller investors. Capital allocators should be looking at the process—how does the manager go about picking stocks and managing the portfolio—not returns, which have no predictive value. Only if you really believe in the process do you have some chance of picking a manager who will outperform in the future. It is probably just as difficult to pick a good manager as it is to pick a good stock. Do you believe that in the long-only world, periodic underperformance is almost a natural characteristic of better-performing managers over the long run? That’s an interesting question. What I would say is that to beat the market, you… ([Location 9433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9433))

They hated the product; they hated the service; they hated everything about it. He then asked them if their top competitor offered their software and services for free, would they switch?

- can be long enough (a few years) and severe enough to discourage investors from sticking with the approach. Although many managers may realize the merit of value investing, they too will have trouble using such an approach because of the shortening of investor time horizons in tolerating subpar performance. The fact that institutions have become increasingly likely to redeem investments from managers who turn in below-average performance for periods as short as one year, let alone two years, means that managers who stick to a value approach risk losing substantial assets at some point. The inability of so many investors and managers to invest with a long-term horizon creates the opportunity for time arbitrage—an edge in an investing approach that requires the commitment to long-term holding periods.

Greenblatt invokes Benjamin Graham’s famous metaphor of Mr. Market, a hypothetical business partner, subject to erratic moods, who is willing to sell shares to you or buy shares from you. As Greenblatt describes it in The Little Book That Beats the Market: Sometimes Mr. Market is in such a good mood that he names a price that is much higher than the true worth of the business. On such days, it probably would make sense for you to sell Mr. Market your share of the business. On other days, he is in such a poor mood that he names a very low price for the business. On those days, you may want to take advantage of Mr. Market’s crazy offer to sell you shares at such a low price and to buy Mr. Market’s share of the business. You don’t have to trade.

- Greenblatt believes that one of the biggest mistakes investors make is using past performance as the guide for selecting managers. Greenblatt cites empirical evidence demonstrating that there is no meaningful correlation between past and future manager performance rankings. He recommends selecting managers based on their investment process rather than their returns. Since past performance is not predictive, Greenblatt believes that, on average, stock indexes are a better investment choice than mutual funds because of their lower fees and more tax-efficient structure. Despite these advantages, Greenblatt views most popular stock indexes as being structurally flawed. The most popular indexes, such as the SP500 and Russell indexes, are capitalization weighted, which means that the more overvalued a stock becomes, the greater the allocation, and the more undervalued, the lower the allocation—the exact reverse of what would be desirable. Equal-weighted indexes avoid this problem and add about 2 percent per… ([Location 9574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=9574))

The commonality of the traders was traced to hard work and determination, and their desire to unlock the puzzle of the market.

Even those traders who use a purely systematic approach to tackling the markets are still engaged in creative thinking. None of the traders he discussed stepped into an already working formula; nobody was handed a blueprint. Their success was built on the backbone of their ability to discover what others overlooked. 3. There is no single right way to make money. Those who succeed do so because they find what works for them. Trying to replicate someone else’s method almost always results in failure. All successful traders have their own methodology, an approach that makes sense to them and that they are comfortable with.

- The option premium consists of two components: intrinsic value plus time value. The intrinsic value of a call option is the amount by which the current market price is above the strike price. (The intrinsic value of a put option is the amount by which the current market price is below the strike price.) In effect, the intrinsic value is that part of the premium that could be realized if the option were exercised at the current market price. The intrinsic value serves as a floor price for an option. Why? Because if the premium were less than the intrinsic value, a trader could buy and exercise the option and immediately offset the resulting market position, ([Location 10051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=10051))

- thereby realizing a net gain (assuming that the trader covers at least transaction costs). Options that have intrinsic value (i.e., calls with strike prices below the market price and puts with strike prices above the market price) are said to be in-the-money. Options that have no intrinsic value are called out-of-the-money options. Options with a strike price closest to the market price are called at-the-money options. An out-of-the-money option, which by definition has an intrinsic value equal to zero, will still have some value because of the possibility that the market price will move beyond the strike price prior to the expiration date. An in-the-money option will have a value greater than the intrinsic value because a position in the option will be preferred to a position in the underlying market. Why? Because both the option and the market position will gain equally in the event of a… ([Location 10055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007YGGOVM&location=10055))

- 1. Relationship between the strike and market price—Deeply out-of-the-money options will have little time value since it is unlikely that the market price will move to the strike price—or beyond—prior to expiration. Deeply in-the-money options have little time value, because these options offer positions very similar to the underlying market—both will gain and lose equivalent amounts for all but an extremely adverse price move. In other words, for a deeply in-the-money option, the fact that risk is limited is not worth very much, because the strike price is so far from the prevailing market price. 2. Time remaining until expiration—The more time remaining until expiration, the greater the value of the option. This is true because a longer life span increases the probability of the intrinsic value increasing by any specified amount prior to expiration. 3.
