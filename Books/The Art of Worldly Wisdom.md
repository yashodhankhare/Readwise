## Metadata
- Author: [[Baltasar Gracián]]
- Full Title: The Art of Worldly Wisdom
- Category: #books

## Highlights
- - In provides advice not only for modern 'image makers' and 'spin doctors' but also for the candid: `for those who insist that substance, not image, is what really matters.` "Do, but also seem," Gracián's pithy advice (aphorism 130). It assumes that good people are those most easily duped - sheep in the midst of wolves - and it teaches us to temper the innocence of the dove with the wisdom of the serpent, `governing ourselves according to the way people are, rather than the way they would like to be or to appear.`
