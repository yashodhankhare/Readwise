## Highlights
- Why? Because the man and the balloon have emotional context. There’s a story attached to them. And now it’s attached to you, too. If you haven’t already figured it out, this is the opening scene to the movie Up, by Pixar Entertainment. And the two lovebirds were Carl and Ellie hoping to get to their dream destination, Paradise Falls. It’s one of my all-time favorite movies. Every hero has an Origin Story. It’s the story of how they became who they are today, how their Superpowers were bestowed upon them, and what drives them internally to defeat their Enemies—the ones in the external world and the ones inside them. And the mission they’re on to realize their Extraordinary World. As heart-wrenching as the opening of the movie Up is, learning Carl’s backstory also sets the stage for the rest of the movie. Now we know why he rigs up his house with thousands of helium balloons to sail away in search of Paradise Falls, finishing the adventure he promised his wife they’d go on together. Learning Carl’s story, we now understand what’s motivating our curmudgeonly hero, and it draws us in emotionally to his story. We’re hooked. We feel for Carl. Why? Because on some level, we see ourselves in him. We know what it feels like to have the responsibilities of life suck us further away from our dreams. We know what it’s like to plan and save for tomorrow, only to find that the tomorrow we dreamed of has disappeared. We know what it’s like ([Location 2482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2482))

- We cheer for our hero because his story strikes a chord in us. Let’s be frank. In our daily lives there’s just crap we have to deal with. There are frustrations, annoyances, and unforeseen circumstances we get hit with. The Enemy feeds off this because it’s a perfect opportunity to pull you into the Ordinary World, distract you, or make you doubt yourself or hide from your real desires. Your Enemy pushes and pulls and will try to steal away the glory found on your Field of Play. However, your Alter Ego can be there to pull you back and lay down a potent defense to the Enemy. And your Alter Ego’s Origin Story is one of the tools we use. So, my question for you is, what is the driving force for your Alter Ego? What propels your Alter Ego to stand up to the Enemy and to defeat it at every turn? The driving force you seek is usually found in your Alter Ego’s Origin Story. Just as you’ve been living out a story, we’re going to connect with a new, more dominant story that your Alter Ego will live out.

- Aligning with an existing story is one of the easiest paths and the one I usually recommend clients start with. Take your Alter Ego and find their Origin Story. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2584))

- Your Alter Ego’s Origin Story doesn’t have to be a novel or epic poem. A few short sentences will do, or if words are clumsy for you, that’s okay.

- care about. It’s the same idea we discussed earlier; there are many ways to apply the Alter Ego Effect. So, whether you build the Alter Ego to play with a new idea, you build it to tap into a new creative self, or you build it to help get out of your own way and conquer the Hidden Forces that have stopped you in the past, the Origin Story is just another way we help your Alter Ego come to life. Now that you’ve built an Alter Ego, named it, and connected to it with the mission and Origin Story, it’s time to Activate it.

- In 1940, while the world was being pulled into the second great war in a generation, the British bulldog Winston Churchill was about to be named prime minister of Great Britain. Ever since I was a young kid on our family farm in Canada, I was fascinated with him. There was this incredible mythology about him and a legend that’s lived on for decades because of how he led the British people and Europe through a perilous time. I remember reading in a biography how he would use his hats to evoke a different personality. When he received the telegram that he would be the new prime minister, he was filled with a grave concern he couldn’t lead the country during such a difficult time. But as he was getting ready to travel to London to see the king and accept the role, he stood in front of his wall of hats and proclaimed, “Which Self should I be today?”1 In the 2017 movie Darkest Hour, they actually show the moment he grabs his top hat, utters the phrase, and walks out the door.

- Churchill isn’t the only one to use what I call a Totem to be more intentional about his performance. Martin Luther King had perfect vision, but he still wore glasses. If you’re familiar with this great leader of the civil rights movement, you might be a bit surprised. In some of King’s most famous photographs, you can see him wearing eyeglasses, except he wasn’t wearing them to see better. He was wearing them because, in his words, “I felt they made me look more distinguished.” You can actually find Martin Luther King’s glasses on display at Atlanta Hartsfield Airport. Here you have two large figures from history, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King, and they both overcame the challenges they faced by leveraging elements of the Alter Ego Effect. They used the power of the human imagination, and both used the power of a Totem to help Activate it, something you’ll do in this final stage of making the transformation complete.

- We live in a world filled with symbols, and the human mind has this fantastic capacity to create a sense of meaning from virtually anything. Any object can hold some meaning, whether it’s cultural or intensely personal. Your imagination can create vivid stories around seemingly random items. And you can associate emotions, ideas, stories, and the actions of what that item represents. Because you and I come from different backgrounds, each of these items will mean something different to both of us: A tractor. A baseball. A bald eagle. A police officer’s badge. An apron. Your country’s flag. A book. A pair of glasses. A cape. I could go on. Just take something simple like the pair of glasses. MLK attributed being more distinguished to them. I used glasses to be more “confident, articulate, and decisive.” A famous NBA client uses glasses to be more “mild-mannered like Clark Kent off the court” and as a “shield from the public to protect his personal life.” One object, many meanings, for many purposes.

- Have you ever been around someone when they lost something, and they freaked out? To you it seemed like nothing, but to them it meant something. It “symbolized” something. Heck, if you take the average person today and they lose their smartphone, it’s like they’ve been amputated from the rest of the world. We’ve all seen people become frantic over a lost phone, right? Well, it’s because it represents our relationships, our contacts, our work, and our memories with photos and ([Location 2722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2722))

- stored conversations. It represents our security, because what if someone finds it and hacks their way in? It seems there are very few items that carry more meaning than a smartphone today. When I give speeches on the topics of “Peak Performance” or the “Mental Game of Winning,” I talk about the power of symbols. One of my most popular talks featured four mannequins with blankets draped over them. One by one, I would reveal each mannequin to the audience. The first would be wearing a police officer’s uniform. I’d turn to the audience and ask, “What does seeing a police officer’s uniform mean to you?” Then, one by one, I revealed each mannequin. One would be dressed in an army uniform, one as a doctor, and the last one as Superman or Wonder Woman. After each reveal, I’d turn to the audience and ask them what each uniform meant. “Shout out your answers in one or two words,” I’d instruct. I was met with a hodgepodge of… ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2725))

- I would then bring someone onstage and ask them to put on one of the uniforms and embody the identity of what the uniform represented. Then I’d ask them how they felt, and how they might approach some of the challenges they’re currently dealing with. People always responded with something positive, and they felt they could deal with their sales calls, negotiations, husbands, children, or whatever else was going on in their worlds with more confidence. As a fun exercise, I’d get them to show me how they would walk, how they would hold their head, how they’d stand, the looks on their faces. Basically, how would they behave? The audience got a laugh out of it, but the point was to show people how quickly we morph from role to role in our lives. Some powerful shifts would happen onstage. In one instance, a young girl who had been bullied for years walked up to a group of girls she imagined on the right side of the stage while wearing the Wonder Woman outfit and called them out. She even said afterward, “If I went and did that at school, they’d probably hit me. But I wouldn’t care, because Wonder… ([Location 2734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2734))

I forget parts of it because I’m so emotional. Now I know what I’m capable of.” It’s incredible how quickly we can change our concepts of what’s possible when we adopt a new identity, just as you’ve already read with previous research, examples, and studies I’… ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2745))

- The Alter Ego is designed to transform your performance. That includes everything from how you physically act and behave to your thoughts to your emotions, your beliefs to your values, your posture to the tone of your voice. And all the way through the “layers” of the Alter Ego Effect Model. Right now, the Alter Ego that will bring forth all these Superpowers and tap into your Heroic Self is lying dormant and ready to be Activated—it’s in the realm of your imagination on the mental and emotional planes. You need something that will call it forth into the physical world and into physical form. That’s what the Totem does. It gives your Alter Ego a form and a shape. It’s not just an idea floating in your head or an emotion you feel. It’s not just some vivid daydream that you distract yourself with in a meeting. Your Alter Ego is real, and it needs to be grounded in a physical presence. A Totem engages more of your senses. You can feel, smell, taste, touch, and see the object, which sparks a visceral feeling. Try this: Imagine walking to the fridge. Open the door, pull out a lemon, and place it on a cutting board. Now pull out a knife and cut a wedge or slice. Bring the lemon slice to your nose. Take a big whiff; what does it smell like? Cut another slice from the lemon. How does the juice feel on your fingers? Now bring ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=2800))

- a slice to your mouth and take a big bite of it. Did your mouth water a little? Did you pucker your lips? Now try this. If you have a lemon in the fridge, go and actually grab it, and do everything I just had you imagine. See, feel, taste, and smell it. Do you see the difference? Your imagination is undoubtedly powerful, but nothing compares to being able to experience it in the physical world. Your Alter Ego’s Totem or Artifact is the bridge from your imagination to the physical world. It’s the anchor. Having this Totem to anchor your Alter Ego, too, not only enables the transformation, but it also helps leverage one of the core foundations of habit change. Cary Grant, the famed actor, who was born Archie Leach, said, “I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be, and I finally became that person. Or he became me. Or we met at some point.” This is what the Alter Ego is designed to help you reach, this place where your Heroic Self naturally comes forth without having to think about it when you need it.

- In the 1970s, Noel Burch created what remains a simplified model to explain the four stages of learning a new skill. It’s called the Four Stages of Learning Competency, and it starts with someone being “unconsciously unskilled”; then you move to “consciously unskilled”; next, you become “consciously skilled”; and, finally, you are “unconsciously skilled.” I like to explain it in a slightly different way that shows the four stages of change we all go through. Stage 1: Ignorance: You “don’t know what you don’t know.” This is what is referred to as “unconscious incompetence.” This is the classic stage of lack of awareness. Stage 2: Awareness: You begin to realize that you “know you don’t know” certain things. This is what’s known as “conscious incompetence.” You’re aware you don’t know how to do something.

You can slip it on or off, which, as you’ll learn later, is crucial if you start to slide out of acting like your Alter Ego. This category includes just about everything and anything you can think of. Here are just a few ideas for where you can draw inspiration for your Alter Ego’s Totem or Artifact.

- Something you carry with you Tony, a baseball player, grew up on a farm in Iowa. His family is significant to him. His Alter Ego is motivated to make his family proud and to bring honor to his family’s name. He carries a small pebble from his farm in his pocket, and every time he needs just a bit more juice from his Alter Ego, he slips his hand into his pocket and rolls the pebble around his fingertips. John is another example. He has a souped-up Artifact. His Alter Ego is his grandfather, and the Artifact is his grandfather’s pocket watch. Some people will hold or carry a specific item, like a pen, when they’re making sales calls or in an important meeting.

- The Alter Ego and the Field of Play it’s operating on create a dividing line with the Enemy. And now you can talk to the Enemy when it shows up to pull you into the sidelines of life, where you become a spectator. Make no mistake, the Enemy is a part of us, and it’s never going to vanish from existence. However, now you have this potent force to combat it, the Alter Ego. So how do you deliver your “Ground Punch”? How do you put the Enemy in its place? You use one of these two methods proven to be effective over an extended period.

- GROUND PUNCH 1: THE CURB KICK The Curb Kick is the equivalent of kicking the Enemy to the curb or sidelines. It’s precisely what I used with Rachel, the tennis player. Her Enemy’s name was Suzie. That was the name of a character from a book she read once and whom she disliked. During our call I told her that every time she caught herself slipping into old behaviors and feeling like she was about to let an opponent come from behind, her Alter Ego would have a quick conversation with Suzie, saying: ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=3086))

- “Hey, Suzie, this is my fucking court. Get the hell to the sidelines. That’s where you live. This right here? This court. This is my home. I fucking live here. Now get outta here!” Yes, it’s intense. But it was incredibly useful, not only for Rachel but for the hundreds of other people who have used it. One comment from a friend of mine I shared this with: “I finally feel like I own the space between my ears.” Rachel sent a strong message about who was supposed to be showing up at that moment and what she’s there to do.

- If you hear a little voice telling you, “You’re being fake,” or “This is silly,” or “There’s no use, you can’t change,” or “Who do you think you are? You don’t have any talent or skill, and you’re not going to make it,” understand this: that’s the Enemy trying to pull you back into the shadows where mediocrity lives. It doesn’t matter how many wins you tuck under your belt; your Enemy is always going to try to stop your Heroic Self from coming forward. Whether I’m talking on the phone to an alpine skier while they’re lying in their tiny dorm room in the Olympic village the night before their event, or speaking with an MLB baseball pitcher twenty-nine minutes before he heads onto the mound in front of forty-eight thousand fans for a key playoff game, high-performing, successful, talented people still get tripped up by their Enemy asking them, “Who do you think you are?” There will still be times while you’re on your Field of Play that the Enemy will get the upper hand. This is when we lay down an earth-shattering Ground Punch to the internal question, “Who do you think you are?” ([Location 3105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=3105))

- A Response Proclamation is the weapon your Alter Ego needs. Here’s what a Response Proclamation sounds like for my Olympic alpine skier. “Who am I? Who am I, you ask? “I’m the one that’s woken up at 4:18 a.m. every day for 1,123 straight days to be the first one on the ski hill to get my reps in for this moment. “Who am I? “I’m the one who spends forty-five minutes every day, lying on my back relaxed and confidently seeing and experiencing myself race down this hill and execute the tight turns with strong legs and great form so I give myself the best chance to put up a time that may just win me a medal. “Who am I? “I’m the one that some little kid, sitting at home, cross-legged, mesmerized and staring at his TV set, is going to point at and look over his shoulder to Mom and say, ‘I’m gonna be like them someday, Mom.’ “I’m the one powered by a force far greater than anything you can throw my way.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Sit in a comfortable position. It could be in a chair or on the floor. Place an object like a ball or a blank piece of paper two feet in front of you. Set a timer for three minutes. During the three minutes, you’ll start by visualizing the number 1, on the object. The moment you notice your mind has drifted off of the number 1, visualize the number 2 on the object. Once again, when you’ve noticed your mind has drifted, visualize the number 3. Continue this pattern until the timer goes off. Whatever number you’re left with when the timer goes off is the number you’ll want to record somewhere, like a notepad or in a note on your phone. If you ended with the number 34, then that’s your score for this round. You want a lower number next round. Now do the exercise again, except this time activate your Alter Ego with your Totem and go through the same process as your Alter Ego. If it’s Einstein, be Einstein. If it’s an elephant, be an elephant. If it’s your strong and resilient grandmother, be her. Then record the number you’re left with at the end. How did it go? Were you better? Was it harder? The two most common experiences of people trying this for the first time are: 1) they were able to beat their previous score by a fair margin; 2) they found themselves looping back and forth between remembering to be their Alter Ego and focusing on the number. Either one is a great outcome because, with even more practice, things improve. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WPWMSK&location=3229))

Guess which group found greater success? If you said the growth mindset crowd, you win. Believing you can change how you show up on your Field of Play is crucial to successfully using the Alter Ego. You first have to think that change is possible. You have to believe that you can reshape those Moments of Impact and achieve an entirely new result.

- The famous professor, researcher, and mythologist Joseph Campbell popularized the concept of “the Hero’s Journey.” In his book Hero with a Thousand Faces, he explains: “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered, and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.”6 George Lucas famously rewrote Star Wars after he discovered Campbell and his explanation of the Hero’s Journey. He was even featured in the 1988 PBS documentary series Power of Myth, hosted by Bill Moyers.

- teachings took an unusable five-hundred-page script and revealed in a simple model how the entire story needed to be laid out, because it followed a story arc repeated thousands of times throughout history’s most celebrated stories, fables, and myths. “It’s possible that if I had not run across him, I would still be writing Star Wars today,” Lucas said.8 There’s a point in the Hero’s Journey where the Hero has to “Cross the Threshold.” It’s the moment they leave their Ordinary World and set out on a new adventure. In Star Wars, it’s when Luke Skywalker goes with Obi-Wan Kenobi to Mos Eisley and leaves his family farm. In The Lord of the Rings, it’s when Frodo leaves the Shire and embarks on his quest to destroy the ring. In the 2017 Wonder Woman, it’s when Diana leaves the hidden island of Themyscira to help save humanity. In each case, there’s an adventure, quest, or mission to be undertaken. Sometimes it’s made by choice, and sometimes it’s been chosen for them, whether by circumstance or a deep desire to fulfill some destiny.
