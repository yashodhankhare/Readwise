## Highlights
- Imitation is natural to man from childhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature in the world. —Aristotle We want what other people want because other people want it, and it’s penciled-in eyebrows all the way down, down to the depths of the nth circle of hell where we all die immediately of a Brazilian butt lift, over and over again. —Dayna Tortorici ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=43))

- This is a book about why people want what they want. Why you want what you want. Each of us spends every moment of our life, from the moment we’re born to the moment we die, wanting something. We even want in our sleep. Yet few people ever take the time to understand how they come to want things in the first place. Wanting well, like thinking clearly, is not an ability we’re born with. It’s a freedom we have to earn. Due to one powerful yet little-known feature of human desire, that freedom is hard-won.

- The source of those ideas was a fairly obscure but influential academic. Before he died on November 4, 2015, at ninety-one, René Girard was named an immortal of the Académie Française and called “the new Darwin of the social sciences.” As a professor at Stanford in the 1980s through the mid-1990s, he inspired a small group of followers. Some of them believed that his ideas would be the key to understanding the twenty-first century—and that ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=67))

- René Girard’s mind drew other people to him from every direction. To begin with, he had an uncanny ability to notice things that explained mysterious human behavior. He was a Sherlock Holmes of history and literature, putting his finger on overlooked clues while everyone else was busy following the usual suspects. He was playing a different game than other academics. He was like the only person at a poker table who has identified the tell of the dominant player. While other players are calculating the mathematical odds of having the winning hand, he’s staring into faces. He’s watching his rival to see how many times he blinks and whether he picks the cuticle of his left index finger. Girard identified a fundamental truth about desire that connected the seemingly unconnected: linking biblical stories with volatility in the stock market, the collapse of ancient civilizations… ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=73))

- Girard discovered that most of what we desire is mimetic (mi-met-ik) or imitative, not intrinsic. Humans learn—through imitation—to want the same things other people want, just as they learn how to speak the same language and play by the same cultural rules. Imitation plays a far more pervasive role in our society than anyone had ever openly acknowledged. Our power of imitation dwarfs that of any other animal. It allows us to build sophisticated culture and technology. At the same time, it has a dark side. Imitation leads people to pursue things that seem desirable at first but ultimately leave them unfulfilled. It locks them into cycles of desire and rivalry that are difficult, practically… ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=81))

- My introduction to Girard took me from Oh, shit to Holy shit. Mimetic theory would help me recognize patterns in the behavior of people and in current events. That was the easy part.

Mimetic theory would eventually help… ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=89))

- I’m now convinced that understanding mimetic desire is the key to understanding, at a deeply human level, business, politics, economics, sports, art, even love. It can help you make money, if that is your primary driver. Or it may help you avoid waiting until middle age or later to learn that money or prestige or a comfortable life is not primarily what you want. Mimetic theory sheds light on what motivates economic and political and personal tensions, and also shows the way out of them. For those with a creative spirit, it can guide their creativity to projects that create real human and economic value and not just wealth transfers. I don’t claim that overcoming mimetic desire is possible, or even desirable. This book is primarily about growing more aware of its presence so that we can navigate it better. Mimetic desire is like gravity—it just is. Gravity is always at work. It causes some people to live in constant pain when they don’t develop the muscles in their core and around their spine to be able to stand up straight and face the world, to resist the downward pull. Others experience that… ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=92))

- Suffice it to say that people who associate mimetic theory only with Girard’s former student, Peter Thiel, and link it with libertarianism or Thiel’s politics have an incomplete picture. I wrote this book in part to break up the monopoly that he has in some people’s minds as the interpreter of Girard’s thought. He would be the first to tell you that’s a good thing. Ideological monopolies are the worst monopolies. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=108))

- There are certain insights that, once you see them, begin to seep into your experience of daily living. An understanding of mimetic desire is one of them. Once you know how it works, you will start to see how it explains much of the world around you. And that will include not just the family member whose weird lifestyle you would never choose, or the politics in your workplace, or the friend who cares about social media too much, or the colleague who brags about their kid who got into Harvard. It will include you. You will see it in yourself. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=126))

I had heterodox views about the Zappos culture, out of step with the media’s portrayal—but I buried them. It’s easy to be an armchair contrarian.

- The most troubling thing to me was that the desire that led me to start and build my company was gone. Where did it go? Where had it come from in the first place? My desires felt like rom-com love—things I fell into rather than things I chose. (By the way, did you know that in almost every language in the world, people fall in love? Nobody rises up into it.3) ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=187))

- The day after my celebration drinks with Tony on the Vegas Strip, I took a friend on a tour of the Zappos headquarters, excited to show him my future home. As we walked by Monkey Row (Zappos jargon for the place where the executives sit), I noticed that the execs’ faces looked like they’d seen a ghost. We had an awkward exchange. It was the bad feeling before a breakup. My friend and I went out for dinner later that night. In the middle of our pastas I received a call from Alfred Lin, who between 2005 and 2010 was the CFO, COO, and chairman of Zappos. Alfred sounded somber. Then he told me why. After the official board meeting, the Zappos board of directors had had a second meeting on the plane back to San Francisco and decided to put any immediate plans on hold. There would be no acquisition. “They changed their minds,” he said. “They changed their minds?” I asked. “Yeah. I don’t know what more to say,” Alfred said. “I’m sorry.” “They changed their minds?” I kept asking the same question, and Alfred kept telling me the same thing. I kept mouthing the words after I hung up the phone, but this time as a statement, not a question. “They changed … their minds.” I repeated it as I walked back to the table, sat down, and stared into my bowl of bad spaghetti, prodding and twirling it endlessly, making perfect bites only to unravel them and start all over again. There would be no life-changing exit, no windfall, no second home in Sicily. Worse, my company was on the rocks. Without the Zappos deal, I’d be bankrupt within ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=195))

- A Dangerous Mind René Girard, a Frenchman who was a professor of literature and history in the United States, had his first insight about the nature of desire in the late 1950s. It would change his life. Three decades later, when Peter Thiel was an undergraduate philosophy major at Stanford, the professor would alter his life, too. The discovery that changed Girard’s life in the 1950s and Thiel’s in the 1980s (and mine in the 2000s) is mimetic desire. It’s what’s brought me to Thiel’s home. I was drawn to mimetic theory, quite simply, because I’m mimetic. We all are. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=233))

- Mimetic theory isn’t like learning some impersonal law of physics, which you can study from a distance. It means learning something new about your own past that explains how your identity has been shaped and why certain people and things have exerted more influence over you than others. It means coming to grips with a force that permeates human relationships—relationships which you are, at ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=238))

- this moment, involved in. You can never be a neutral observer of mimetic desire. Thiel and I have both experienced the disconcerting moment when we discovered that force at work in our lives. It’s so personal that I hesitated to write a book about it. To write about mimetic desire is to reveal a bit of your own. I ask him why he didn’t explicitly mention Girard in his popular business book Zero to One, even though it was packed with insights from his mentor.1 “There’s something dangerous about Girard’s ideas,” Thiel says. “I think people have self-defense mechanisms against some of this stuff.” He wanted people to see that Girard’s insights contain important truths and that they explain what is going on in the world around them, but he didn’t want to take his readers all the way through the looking-glass. An idea that challenges commonly held assumptions can feel threatening—and that’s all the more reason to look more closely at it: to understand why. An unbelieved truth is often more dangerous than a lie. The lie in this case is the idea that I want things entirely on my own, uninfluenced by others, that I’m the sovereign king of deciding what is wantable and what is not. The truth is that my desires are derivative, mediated by others, and that… ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=241))

- Girard’s discovery was like the Newtonian revolution in physics, in which the forces governing the movement of objects can only be understood in a relational context. Desire, like gravity, does not reside autonomously in any one thing or person. It lives in the space between them.2 The novels Girard taught are not primarily plot-driven or character-driven. They are desire-driven. A character’s actions are a reflection of their desires, which are shaped in relationship to the desires of others. The plots unfold according to who is in a mimetic relationship with whom and how their desires interact and play out. The two characters don’t even have to meet for this relationship to happen. Don Quixote, alone in his room, reads about the adventures of the famous knight Amadís de Gaula. He is inflamed with a desire to emulate him and become a knight-errant, wandering the countryside in search of opportunities to prove the virtues of chivalry. In all of the books Girard taught, desire always involved an imitator and a model. Other readers had not noticed it, or they had overlooked it by discounting the possibility of such a pervasive… ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=265))

- Desire, as Girard used the word, does not mean the drive for food or sex or shelter or security. Those things are better called needs—they’re hardwired into our bodies. Biological needs don’t rely on imitation. If I’m dying of thirst in the desert, I don’t need anyone to show me that water is desirable. But after meeting our basic needs as creatures, we enter into the human universe of desire. And knowing what to want is much harder than knowing what to need. Girard was interested in how we come to want things when there is no clear instinctual basis for it.3 Out of the billions of potential objects of desire in the world, from friends to careers to lifestyles, how do people come to desire some more than others? And why do the objects and intensity of our desire seem to fluctuate constantly, lacking any real stability? In the universe of desire, there is no clear hierarchy. People don’t choose objects of desire the way they choose to wear a coat in the winter. Instead of internal biological signals, we have a different kind of external signal that motivates these choices: models. Models are people or things that show us what is worth wanting. It is models—not our “objective” analysis or central nervous system—that shape our ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=285))

- desires. With these models, people engage in a secret and sophisticated form of imitation that Girard termed mimesis (mi-mee-sis), from the Greek word mimesthai (meaning “to imitate”). Models are the gravitational centers around which our social lives turn. It’s more important to understand this now than at any other time in history.

- It’s deceivingly difficult to figure out why you bought certain things; it’s extraordinarily hard to understand why you strive toward certain achievements. So hard that few people dare to ask. Mimetic desire draws people toward things.4 “This draw,” writes Girard scholar James Alison, “this movement … [is] mimesis. It is to psychology what gravity is to physics.”5 ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=307))

- In Girard’s view, the root of most violence is mimetic desire. In a French television show from the 1970s, Girard explains mimetic theory to a panel of interviewers, casually ashing his cigarette as he talks. “What has fascinated me for a very long time is sacrifice,” he tells the panelists, “the fact that men, for religious reasons, kill animal and often human victims in almost all human societies.”10 He burned to understand the problem of violence and the religious fascination with sacrifice that extends to nearly every part of human culture. (Indeed, one of his more controversial claims is that the domestication of cats and dogs could not have come about intentionally. People did not originally intend to live with cats and dogs the way we do today, integrating them peacefully into our families for as long as they live. That process would have taken generations of coordinated effort. The reason we domesticated animals was far more practical, he argued: communities integrated the animals into their lives in order to sacrifice them. Sacrifices are more effective when they come from within a community—when the victim has something in common with the sacrificers. We’ll discuss why in Chapter 4.11) ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=348))

- A company in which people are evaluated based on clear performance objectives—not their performance relative to one another—minimizes mimetic rivalries. When there was risk of an all-out war with Elon Musk’s rival company, X.com, Thiel merged with him to form PayPal. He knew from Girard that when two people (or two companies) take each other as mimetic models, they enter into a rivalry for which there is no end but destruction—unless they are somehow able to see beyond the rivalry.12 Thiel took mimesis into account when evaluating investment decisions, too. Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, had introduced him to Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel saw clearly that Facebook was not merely another MySpace or SocialNet (Hoffman’s first start-up). Facebook was built around identity—that is to say, desires. It helps people see what other people have and want. It is a platform for finding, following, and differentiating oneself from models. Models of desire are what make Facebook such a potent drug. Before Facebook, a person’s models came from a small set of people: friends, family, work, magazines, and maybe TV. After Facebook, everyone in the world is a potential model. Facebook isn’t filled with just any kind of model—most people we follow aren’t movie stars, pro athletes, or celebrities. Facebook is full of models who are inside our world, ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=382))

- What’s at Stake Mimetic desire, because it is social, spreads from person to person and through a culture. It results in two different movements—two cycles—of desire. The first cycle leads to tension, conflict, and volatility, breaking down relationships and causing instability and confusion as competing desires interact in volatile ways. This is the default cycle that has been most prevalent in human history. It is accelerating today. It’s possible to transcend that default cycle, though. It’s possible to initiate a different cycle that channels energy into creative and productive pursuits that serve the common good. This book will explore these two cycles.… ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=397))

- Movements of desire are what define our world. Economists measure them, politicians poll them, businesses feed them. History is the story of human desire. Yet the origin and evolution of desire are mysterious. Girard titled his 1978 magnum opus Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World. It was a nod to the lengths that humans have gone to hide the true nature of their desires and their consequences. This book is about those hidden things and how they play out in the world today. We can’t afford to ignore them because: Mimesis can hijack our noblest ambitions. We live at a time of hyper-imitation. Fascination with what is trending and going viral is symptomatic of our predicament. So is political polarization. It stems in part from mimetic behavior that destroys nuance and poisons even our most honorable goals: to develop friendships, to fight for important causes, to build healthy communities. When mimesis takes over, we become obsessed with vanquishing some Other, and we measure ourselves according to them. When a person’s identity becomes completely tied to a mimetic model, they can never truly escape that model because… ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=404))

- forced to be the same—the more pressure they feel to think and feel and want the same things—the more intensely they fight to differentiate themselves. And this is dangerous. Many cultures have had a myth in which twins commit violence against each other. There are at least five separate stories of sibling rivalry in the book of Genesis alone: Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, Leah and Rachel, Joseph and his brothers. Stories of sibling rivalry are universal because they’re true—the more people are alike, the more likely they are to feel threatened. While technology is bringing the world closer together (Facebook’s stated mission), it is bringing our desires closer together and amplifying conflict. We are free to resist, but the mimetic forces are accelerating so quickly that we are close to becoming shackled. Sustainability depends on desirability. Decades of consumer culture have forged unsustainable desires. Many people know intellectually that they could do a better job taking care of the planet, for instance. But until eating a more sustainable diet or driving more fuel-efficient cars is far more attractive to the average consumer than the alternatives, the more sustainable options will not be widely adopted. It’s not enough to know what is good and true.… ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=416))

- games. “Who asks about the souls of these men?” wondered Girard in his last book, Battling to the End.14 The Manichean division of the world into “evil” and “not evil” people never satisfied him. He saw the dynamics of mimetic rivalry at work in the rise of terrorism and class conflict. People don’t fight because they want different things; they fight because mimetic desire causes them to want the same things. The terrorists would not have been driven to destroy symbols of the West’s wealth and culture if, at some deep level, they had not secretly desired some of the same things. That’s why the Florida bars and video game–playing are an important piece of the puzzle. The mysterium iniquitatis (the mystery of evil) remains just that: mysterious. But mimetic theory reveals something important about it. The more people fight, the more they come to resemble each other. We should choose our enemies wisely, because we become like them. But even more is at stake. Each one of us has a responsibility to shape the desires of others, just as they shape ours. Each encounter we have with another person enables them, and us, to want more, to want less, or to… ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=428))

Throughout this book I’ll highlight fifteen tactics that I’ve developed to deal positively with mimetic desire. My goal in sharing them is to help you think practically about these ideas and ultimately to develop your own tactics, which may be very different from mine. Mimetic desire is part of the human condition. It can lurk under the surface of our lives, acting as our unrecognized leader. But there are ways to recognize it, confront it, and make more intentional choices that lead to a more satisfying life—far more satisfying than one in which we’re totally consumed by mimetic desire without knowing it. By the end of this book, you’ll have a simple framework for understanding how desire works in your life and in our culture. You’ll have a better idea of what you’re imitating and how you’re imitating it. Knowing whether you respond more or less mimetically in a given situation and in specific relationships is an important step toward self-mastery.

Public health has been challenged because even the best policies have to contend with groups of people who want different things. The poverty that endures alongside mega-wealth is a scandal. All of these things have a basis in the fundamental system of desire that I’m attempting to describe. This system of desire is to the world’s organs what the circulatory system is to the body. When the cardiovascular system isn’t working properly, organs suffer and eventually shut down. The same is true of desire.

If we understand the mimetic nature of desire, though, we can play our part in building a better world. The greatest developments in history are the result of someone wanting something that did not yet exist—and helping others to want more than they thought was wantable. Your new or deepened awareness of mimetic desire will make you see the world differently. If you’re like me, it will haunt you to the point that you start seeing it everywhere—maybe even in your own life. What you choose to do about it is up to you.

The line has been quoted thousands of times by people taking Caesar at his word: that he saw the place and decided to conquer it. Magician James Warren suggests that we reframe Caesar’s words in the language of desire so we see what he’s truly claiming: I came, I saw, I desired.

But we do it all the time: we choose brands, schools, and dishes at a restaurant by them. There are always models of desire. If you don’t know yours, they are probably wreaking havoc in your life. You may be wondering, then: if desire is generated and shaped by models, then where do models get their desires? The answer: from other models.

- The Bible contains a story about the Romantic Lie at the dawn of humanity. Eve originally had no desire to eat the fruit from the forbidden tree—until the serpent modeled it. The serpent suggested a desire. That’s what models do. Suddenly, a fruit that had not aroused any particular desire became the most desirable fruit in the universe. Instantaneously. The fruit appeared irresistible because—and only after—it was modeled as a forbidden good.2 We are tantalized by models who suggest a desire for things that we don’t currently have, especially things that appear just out of reach. The greater the obstacle, the greater the attraction. Isn’t that curious? We don’t want things that are too easily possessed or that are readily within reach. Desire leads us beyond where we currently are. Models are like people standing a hundred yards up the road who can see something around the corner that we can’t yet see. So the way that a model describes something or suggests something to us makes all the difference. We never see the things we want directly; we see them indirectly, like refracted light. We are attracted to things when they are modeled to us in an attractive way, by the right model. Our universe of desire is as big or as small as our models.

- Meltzoff’s work suggests that we don’t learn how to imitate; we are born imitators. Being an imitator is part of what it means to be human. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=559))

- We do the same thing. Meltzoff explains: “A mother looks at something. A baby takes that as a signal that the mother desires the object, or is at least paying attention to it because it must be important. The baby looks at the mother’s face, then at the object. She tries to understand the relationship between her mother and the object.” It’s not long before a baby can follow not just her mother’s eyes but even the intentions behind her actions. To test that idea, Meltzoff staged an act in front of eighteen-month-old babies. In the experiment, an adult acted as if he was trying to pull apart a dumbbell-shaped toy made from a central tube with a wooden cube on each side. As the adult strained to pull the toy apart, he let his hand slip off one end. He tried again, but this time let his hand slip off ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=588))

- the other end. The adult’s intention was clear: he wanted to pull the toy apart. But apparently he failed. After the adult’s performance, the researcher presented the object to the infants and observed what they did. The babies would pick up the dumbbell and immediately pull it apart—forty out of the fifty times the experiment was conducted. They didn’t mimic what the adults did; they imitated what they thought the adults wanted to do. They read beneath the surface behavior.9 The babies in the experiment were pre-linguistic. They were tracking the desires of others before they understood or had words to describe them. They didn’t know or care about why other people wanted something; they simply noticed what they wanted. Desire is our primordial concern. Long before people can articulate why they want something, they start wanting it. The motivational speaker Simon Sinek advises organizations and people to “start with why” (the title of one of his books), finding and communicating one’s purpose before anything else. But that is usually a post hoc rationalization of whatever it is we already wanted. Desire is the better place to start.

I’ll buy a classic Ford Mustang and start narrowing my eyes at the Tesla drivers I see on the road (that sheeplike herd…)—completely unaware that my behavior is driven by my model.

- Bernays returned to the United States with a new awareness: “If you could use propaganda for war, you could certainly use it for peace.”16 In the following four decades, Bernays pulled off dozens of public relations coups. When he was hired by a company that sold pork, he made bacon and eggs the all-American breakfast by getting his friend, a doctor, to write a letter to five thousand other doctors, urging them all to sign on to the recommendation that eating a heavier breakfast (“bacon and eggs”) would be healthier for Americans. He convinced kids to like taking baths by organizing soap-carving contests in public schools. That’s because Procter & Gamble, his client, made a brand of soap (Ivory) that floated in water.

- In the late 1940s he persuaded the U.S. government to build Route 66 as part of his work for Mack Trucks. More highway, more trucks. Bernays seemed to understand that models influence desire. Doctors were the “expert” models who recommended bacon and eggs. Teachers modeled soap carving. And when Mack Trucks hired Bernays to defend the company against attacks from railroads, Bernays rallied legions of enthusiastic motorists, from the members of men’s and women’s driving clubs to milk delivery drivers and tire workers, to support the building of more highways. But none of these things quite matched the magnitude of the coup that Bernays had pulled off decades earlier when he created one of the most powerful models of the century.

- Sales of the company’s signature brand, Lucky Strike, were already exploding. During the war, soldiers’ rations had included cigarettes. In the years after the war, smoking increased dramatically, as a generation of young men who first lit up as a comfort while facing the terrors of war were now hooked. Women weren’t part of the trend. There were societal taboos against them smoking in public, and men denigrated women who smoked even in private. The following quote from a male hotel manager in a 1919 New York Times article was typical: I hate to see women smoking. Apart from the moral reason, they really don’t know how to smoke. One woman smoking one cigarette at a dinner table will stir up more smoke than a whole tableful of men smoking cigars. They don’t seem to know what to do with the smoke. Neither do they know how to hold their cigarettes properly. They make a mess of the whole performance. George Hill knew this taboo was hurting his profits. “If I can crack that market, I’ll get more than my share of it,” he told Bernays. “It will be like… ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=709))

- Women’s emancipation was in full swing in the 1920s. The Nineteenth Amendment, ratified in August 1920, had given women the right to vote; women were earning higher wages than ever before by taking jobs that had opened up during the war; and flappers were celebrating their newfound freedoms drinking French 75 cocktails and listening to Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club. The time was ripe for anything that appealed to freedom.18 Bernays concocted his plan. In March 1929, he identified the Easter Day parade in New York City as the perfect opportunity to transform cigarettes into “torches of freedom.” The parade was a spectacle of high fashion, a media frenzy, an opportunity for well-to-do New Yorkers to strut down Fifth Avenue to see and be seen. An Easter procession down Fifth Avenue had emerged as early as the 1870s. Back then, Easter was as important to retail sales as Christmas is today. As the event became ritualized and turned into a parade, women wore their best hats and colorful Easter dresses. As they exited the churches up and down Fifth Avenue, they fell into step with other high-society women using the street as their runway. They visited the flower-filled churches on the parade route while being admired by the lower classes lined up along the sides of the street to watch. Bernays’s plan was to convince a carefully selected group of these women to light up Lucky Strike cigarettes defiantly during the parade, the world’s largest stage. It would be equivalent to a modern influencer campaign of epic proportions: imagine if Beyoncé stopped her Super Bowl halftime performance midsong, pulled out a Juul, and puffed away, with the cameras zooming in on the brand and flavor. According to Larry Tye’s account, Bernays tapped a friend at Vogue who helped him gather a list of thirty influential New York… ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=725))

At the appointed time, following Bernays’s instructions, the models whipped out their Lucky Strikes and smoked them in their flapper hats and fur-trimmed coats as they walked flouncily down the street. Bernays left nothing to chance. He made sure professional photographers and journalists were there to capture the moment. He even instructed them to use the phrase that he had selected, “torches of freedom,” when describing it. He knew that the event would stir up debate, but how could anyone in this postwar world not be on the side of freedom? As Tye tells it, pictures of women smoking their “torches of freedom” appeared on the front pages of major U.S. newspapers the next day: from the New York Times to the daily paper of Albuquerque, New Mexico.

He pursued her once again, but she rebuffed him. The more she denied herself to him, the more he wanted her. “She influenced my desire by denying it,” Girard said.21 It was as if her lack of desire for him affected the strength of his desire for her. What’s more, the interest that other men showed in her affected him. They were modeling her desirability to him. Through her withdrawal from him, she was modeling it, too. “I suddenly realized that she was both object and mediator for me—some kind of model,” Girard remembered.

- Fyodor Dostoevsky’s book The Eternal Husband shows the comedy and tragedy of mimetic romance. A widowed man seeks out the former lover of his deceased wife—the man with whom she had an affair—because he subconsciously views this man as his romantic and sexual superior. The widowed man has found a new woman he would like to marry, but he can’t do so without the assurance that his rival, his wife’s former lover, also desires his new bride-to-be. He masochistically subjects himself to more humiliation at the hands of this other man, the Eternal Lover, while he remains the Eternal Husband. As long as he doesn’t realize who is pulling the strings of his love life, he will continue to torture himself at the feet of his rival. He can’t stop measuring himself against him. The Eternal Husband is an extreme example of how mimesis can hijack relationships. It’s usually not so obvious. Consider an insecure guy who feels sparks on his first few dates with someone.

Her renewed desirability has nothing to do with how she looks in her Instagram photo; it’s a product of her being wanted by another man—and not just any man, but one who possesses all of the characteristics that her ex-boyfriend would like to have.

- Models That Move Markets On February 3 and 4, 2020, shares of stock in the electric automaker Tesla had a parabolic rise of more than 50 percent. This capped a four-month period in which the stock had already doubled in price. By the end of the day on February 4, it had nearly quadrupled over this four-month period. Tesla had been a publicly traded company for nearly a decade. It was not a newly listed IPO, where that kind of price action and volatility would be less of an anomaly. What news was moving the stock? Nothing extraordinary. The company beat third- and fourth-quarter earnings estimates. There was some good news about its China factory. But it was hard to see what was driving the wild movements. Before October 2019, Tesla had seemed like it might be on the brink of disaster. CEO Elon Musk had roiled markets with his erratic behavior, and investors were wondering how the company could stay afloat while burning through almost $3.5 billion in cash in twelve months. Tesla reported losses of over $1 billion in the first half of 2019. And then came this out-of-this-world explosion in the company’s stock price.

- Professional analysts were baffled. “I talked to people at Goldman Sachs, who are usually the world’s greatest experts on explaining stock prices, and they’re now asking me whether I have any idea what the heck is going on with Tesla stock,” said Bob Lutz, a former auto industry executive, on a BBC Business Daily podcast. No one believed the stock’s movement corresponded to “reality.”24 But it did—just not the reality that most analysts accept. To paraphrase Shakespeare: there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in their investment philosophies. One version of the Romantic Lie in finance is the “efficient market” hypothesis (closely related to “rational expectations,” another hypothesis). Efficient market theory is the belief that asset prices are functions of all available information. Company news, investor expectations, current events, political news, and everything else that might affect a company’s valuation are all assumed to be perfectly reflected in the stock price. The price changes as a function of time, as new information becomes available. But there is more to understanding markets, and people, than information.25 A couple of pieces of data should have alerted investors in Tesla stock that more than information was driving the stock price.

On the same day, people who started searching Google with the words “Should I” received an auto-suggested completion of their question: “Should I buy Tesla stock?” Millions of people were searching Google to find out whether they should buy Tesla based on whether other people wanted to buy Tesla. This, in my view, is not merely information. It’s mimetic desire. Desire is not a function of data. It’s a function of other people’s desires. What stock market analysts referred to as “mass psychosis” was not so psychotic after all. It was the phenomenon of mimetic desire that Girard had discovered more than fifty years earlier. In both bubbles and crashes, models are multiplied. Desire spreads at a speed so great we can’t wrap out rational brains around it.

- Steve Jobs had arranged to sell his old IBM Selectric typewriter to a fellow student named Robert Friedland. Like Jobs, Friedland was an undergraduate—but he was four years older than Jobs. He had been kicked out of Bowdoin College in Maine and sentenced to two years in prison for possessing $125,000 worth of LSD. After he made parole, he enrolled at Reed and made plans to run for student body president and travel to India to meet a Hindu guru. But first he needed a typewriter. Steve Jobs didn’t know anything about his buyer. He arrived at Friedland’s room to deliver the goods and collect his cash, but nobody responded to his knocks on the door. He tried the handle. It was unlocked. To save the trip, he considered leaving the typewriter inside and collecting the money later. So he opened the door. When he walked in, he was mortified by what he saw: Friedland was on the bed having sex with his girlfriend. Jobs tried to leave, but the stranger invited him to sit down until he was done. This is kind of far-out, Jobs thought.2 Who was this creature who appeared to lack any sense of taboo, any sense that his behavior would make normal people cringe? Who seemed to do exactly what he wanted and make no apologies? Fellow student Daniel Kottke—who went on to become one of the first employees at Apple—would later remark on the influence Friedland had on Jobs. Friedland “was mercurial, sure of himself, a little dictatorial,” he remembered, according to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs. “Steve admired that, and he became more like that after spending time with Robert.” By the time he started Apple, Jobs had become known for his own quirky behavior. He walked around the office barefoot, rarely took showers, and enjoyed soaking his feet in the toilet. “When I first met Steve he was shy and self-effacing, a very private guy,” says Kottke. “I think Robert taught him a lot about selling, about coming out of his shell, of opening up and taking charge of a situation.” Jobs had not realized it, but at the moment he walked into that room in college, Friedland had become a model to him. Jobs would later come to see through Friedland, but Friedland’s… ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=923))

- There’s something strange about our relationship to imitation. Aristotle recognized nearly 2,500 years ago that humans possess advanced capabilities of imitation that allow us to create new things. Our ability to imitate in complex ways is why we have language, recipes, and music.4 Isn’t it odd, then, that people generally frown upon imitation? One of our greatest human strengths is seen as a source of embarrassment, a sign of weakness, even something that can get you into trouble. Nobody wants to be known as an imitator—except in very specific cases. We encourage children to imitate role models, and most artists generally recognize the value of imitating the masters. But imitation is totally taboo in other circumstances. Imagine if two friends started showing up at every social gathering wearing matching clothes; if a person who received a gift always reciprocated by giving the other person the same gift they were given; if someone… ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=958))

- To make matters even more confusing, why is it that in most organizations imitation seems to be simultaneously encouraged and discouraged? Dress like someone in a position that you’d like to be in, but not too closely; imitate the cultural norms, but make sure you stand out; emulate key leaders in the organization, but don’t seem like you’re brown-nosing. Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO of the now-defunct biotech company Theranos, openly imitated Steve Jobs. She wore black turtlenecks and hired every Apple designer she could find. But imagine if a junior employee at Theranos started mimicking Holmes, walking around in black turtlenecks, sporting blue contact lenses, mimicking Holmes’s intense stare, even speaking in Holmes’s low pitch and dry style. What do you think would happen? They’d lose their job. It’s as if everyone is saying, “Imitate me—but not too much,” because while everyone’s flattered by… ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=968))

- If individuals are naturally inclined to desire what their neighbors possess, or to desire what their neighbors even simply desire, this means that rivalry exists at the very heart of human social relations.

- As Peter Thiel points out in Zero to One, Karl Marx and William Shakespeare had very different views about why people fight. Marx thought conflict happens because people are different. People fight because they have different goals, desires, and ideas due to differences in the material goods they possess. In this framework, we would expect people who have the same material goods to fight less. Shakespeare’s view seems to be exactly the opposite: people fight when they are similar, like the Capulets and Montagues in Romeo and Juliet. The more that people in a group are alike, the more vulnerable they are to a single tension affecting the whole.

- We’ll see in this chapter that mimetic conflict is contagious. It can lead to a social environment in which everyone is reacting mimetically to everyone else. This dynamic keeps people locked in cycles of endless conflict, bound to one another through mimesis, unable to go anywhere. Desire doesn’t spread like information; it spreads like energy. It passes from person to person like the energy between people at a concert or political rally. This energy can lead to a cycle of positive desire, in which healthy desires gain momentum and lead to other healthy desires, uniting people in positive ways; or it can become a cycle of negative desire, in which mimetic rivalries lead to conflict and discord.

- Tactic 4 USE IMITATION TO DRIVE INNOVATION There’s a false dichotomy between imitation and innovation. They’re part of the same process of discovery. Some of history’s most creative geniuses started off by simply imitating the right model. I sat down with Naresh Ramchandani, a partner at Pentagram, consistently ranked as one of the most innovative design firms in the world. They’re the creative force behind projects such as the Harley-Davidson Museum, the set and on-screen graphics of The Daily Show, and the One Laptop per Child initiative. “You can do innovation at any stage,” Naresh tells me. “We sometimes start by ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1429))

- saying, ‘What’s out there? What can we copy?’” The innovation comes at a later stage of the creative process. If someone’s primary objective is innovation for the sake of innovation, they usually end up in a mimetic rivalry with everyone in their field to compete primarily on the basis of originality. By devaluing all forms of imitation, they play a game of differentiation to get noticed. Being different for the sake of being different is the ethos behind shock-value art and academics whose salient feature is making outlandish claims to stand out from the pack. As the fastest way to humility is not thinking more about humility but thinking less frequently of oneself, the safest route to innovation is also an indirect one. “There’s great stuff out there,” Ramchandani says.

- Memes and Mimetic Theory How did tipping 20 percent become the norm in the United States but not in Europe? Why do Japanese businesspeople greet one another with bows instead of handshakes? Why do some organizations have well-developed lingo encoded in their handbooks and others don’t? (And why is there so much lingo in the business world, period?) In all of these cases, imitation seems to play a large role. In 1976, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the word “meme” in his book The Selfish Gene. He was attempting to explain the spread across time and space of nonmaterial things such as ideas, behaviors, and phrases. He called these things memes: cultural units of information that spread from person to person through a process of imitation.12 Dawkins’s theory of memes and Girard’s theory of mimetic desire both view imitation as foundational to human behavior. However,… ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1502))

- might mutate every once in a while. But in general, memes are discrete, static, and fixed. According to meme theory, the spread of memes through imitation leads to the development and sustainability of culture. According to Girard’s mimetic theory, culture is formed primarily through the imitation of desires, not things. And desires are not discrete, static, and fixed; they are open-ended, dynamic, and volatile. We’re all familiar with memes. They can be musical tunes (“Happy Birthday”), catchphrases (studmuffin), fashion (ties and high heels), even ideas (“What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas”). Social media platforms like Twitter seem built to propagate them: words and ideas are spread through perfect imitation every time someone shares or retweets them. Memes don’t spread through human intentionality or creativity. As in Darwinian evolution, they undergo a series of random mutations and selections. (Internet memes, then, are not what Dawkins meant by the term meme—because an internet meme… ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1512))

- In Girard’s mimetic theory, the opposite is true. People are not insignificant carriers of information; they are highly significant models of desire. We don’t care about what is being modeled as much as we care about who is modeling it. We imitate not for the sake of imitation itself but for the sake of differentiating ourselves—to try to forge an identity relative to other people. The drive to differentiate oneself is what we saw in the case of mirrored imitation, when someone does the opposite of what another person does (Seinfeld to Newman, hipsters to popular culture). Why do some people wear MAGA hats while others would not wear a MAGA hat if their lives depended on it? The revulsion that many people feel about wearing a hat that says MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN (usually) has little to do with the color red, the style of the hat, or a political critique of the idea of national greatness. It has to do with the person modeling the hat: Trump.13 Most importantly, meme theory ignores all forms of negative imitation. In meme theory, imitation is, at worst, something neutral. From the standpoint of the memes themselves, it’s something positive. In mimetic theory, imitation often has negative consequences. Because the imitation of desire causes people to compete for the same things, it easily leads to conflict. In the rest of this chapter, we’ll look at the flywheel effect of mimesis—the movement of creative and destructive cycles of desire, which are responsible for the rise and fall of cultures. They can’t be captured in a meme. The Flywheel Effect Mimetic desire tends to move in one of two cycles. Cycle 1 is the negative cycle, in which mimetic desire leads to rivalry and conflict. This cycle runs on the false belief that other people have something that we don’t have and that there isn’t room for fulfillment of both their desires and ours. It comes from a mindset of scarcity, of fear, of anger. Cycle 2 is the positive cycle in which mimetic desire unites people in a shared desire for some common good. It comes from a mindset of abundance and mutual giving. This type of cycle… ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1523))

- Aristotle invented the word “entelechy” to refer to a thing that has its own principle of development within it, a vital force that propels it forward to become fully what it is. A human embryo, while dependent on others (especially the mother), already has within it a road map to develop into a fully formed human and the self-organization to get there, provided the embryo receives what it needs to support its growth. A standard computer doesn’t possess entelechy: it has to be assembled and programmed. It can’t assemble its own component parts and grow into a fully developed version of itself the way a sapling becomes a sequoia. Understanding that some things have a vital principle of development and others don’t is one way to understand the concept of a positive flywheel of desire: it contains the principle within it to help it achieve its purpose. Once you construct a flywheel and get it moving, it takes on a life of its own and begins to self-organize around an objective.17 Everyone has to construct their own flywheels.

- completely different than mine. The most effective personal flywheels come from people who know themselves well. You probably already have a tacit knowledge of what things increase and decrease the likelihood that you’re going to want to do something in the future. The key is to make the cycle explicit, and then to put it in motion. Negative flywheels are far more common than positive ones. This is especially the case in Freshmanistan, where people have more in common and they are in close proximity. Like the warm ocean water over which hurricanes form, mimetic contagion is able to gather steam faster in Freshmanistan because everyone is in a reflexive environment, picking up on mimetic cues.

The Destructive Cycle Tony Hsieh wanted everyone to be happy. “Are you happy?” he asked me one day as we were getting to know each other. Zappos was the hottest story in business media at the time. Everyone was fascinated with the company culture. It was portrayed as something like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, with Tony as Wonka—the zany, mega-wealthy founder who gave tours of his operation to people curious about how he’d built a utopia of happiness. Serena Williams had come by the Zappos HQ for a tour and conversed with Tony. I once wondered if the company had a world-class publicist; it turns out that they simply delivered excellent customer service year after year, and the effort eventually paid off. The right people noticed. When the company first started out, its operational flywheel looked something like the illustration below. Nick Swinmurn, who founded Zappos in 1999, simply wanted to make shoe buying easier. He saw an opportunity to make a painful process easy with the birth of e-commerce.18 In order for the business model to work, the company needed to boost its sales and customer base—especially its customer retention (the percentage of customers who come back and buy more stuff), which was the key to becoming profitable.19 Tony Hsieh started off as an investor in the company and… ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1650))

He was passionate about the work that Zappos did, he was willing to take huge risks to get the company off the ground, and he made Zappos a place where people genuinely wanted to work. But when I look back, I don’t believe anybody knew about or took into account the negative effects of mimesis, which effectively hijacked a positive flywheel of desire that had made Zappos a profitable company and a fun place to work. The change came subtly and imperceptibly. Nobody felt there was a problem—like frogs sitting in a pot of gradually warming water who never feel the urge to jump out before they become frog soup.

Did I know, Tony wondered, that the one thing that all people seek, everywhere and at all times, is happiness? Tony’s logic went like this: businesses must exist to make customers happy; therefore, the more we can learn about the science of happiness, the more effectively we can build a successful business. At least that was the idea. A year later, Tony sold Zappos to Amazon for around $1.2 billion.21 Shortly after the sale, he wrote a book called Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose. He also announced the launch of the Downtown Project, a roughly $350 million investment in downtown Las Vegas. Tony planned to take the culture of happiness that he’d helped build at Zappos and use it to help a city.

- Between 2010 and 2013, Tony Hsieh and his partners spent about $93 million to buy up twenty-eight acres of land and buildings, from vacant hotels to high-rise condos and struggling bars. Their long-term goal was to invest in the space and spread the Zappos culture to its inhabitants, lure talented entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley, and ultimately create an entrepreneur-driven ecosystem. It was a social experiment—“the city as a start-up,” Tony called it. A happy city. After the sale to Amazon, Tony stayed and remained the leader of Zappos. It was allowed to operate as a largely autonomous company. At the same time, Tony launched the Downtown Project. Its culture blended into the Zappos culture, and vice versa. Zappos and the Downtown Project were part of the same ecosystem. There were warning signs from the beginning. Zappos employees told me that morale was low.

You can be as liberated as you want, but there’s a web of connectivity, and they forget.” Desire is part of the web of connectivity. When people deny that they are affected by what other people around them want, they are most susceptible to getting drawn into an unhealthy cycle of desire that they don’t even know to resist. Mimetic desire breeds rivalries, which breed collisions and conflict.

But the best things happen when people are running into each other and sharing ideas.”23 He wanted to make downtown Las Vegas more like college. A Freshmanistan. But not all collisions are alike. Some lead to good things: friendships, marriages, and ideas for new companies. Others lead to chaos and confusion. RETURN ON COLLISIONS One of Tony’s strategies for encouraging collisions was the optimal use of space. He wanted to maximize the occurrence of random encounters. He and his colleagues would stage concerts and meet-ups, hackathons, happy hours, open-mic nights, and an open-door feel at the Ogden, a high-rise in downtown Vegas where many Zappos executives lived. The atmosphere was something like a college dormitory, where closed doors are frowned upon and anyone can pop into anyone else’s room at any time. I attended a collision-focused meet-up one night for the Downtown Project in Tony’s penthouse. We were in a large room with hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows that looked down onto the Fremont Street Experience. The only furniture in the room was a couple of dozen rolling desks with attached seats, the kind you might find in a third-grade classroom where the teacher is asking the kids to move around a lot and form groups. These were adult-sized desks, but the idea was the same. There was one desk for each person. Tony walked into the room and, hands in pockets, told everyone to take a seat. He explained that we should try to meet as many people as possible in the next hour—like speed-dating for start-ups. We were to roll around the room and “collide” with one another, then strike up a conversation. He took a seat at one of the desks himself and rolled around with the rest of us.

But Tony wanted to take things a step further. In 2013, Zappos implemented a new management philosophy called “holacracy.” Brian J. Robertson, the founder of Ternary Software, helped develop holacracy as a “social technology” and an “operating system” for organizations because he was looking for a… ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1753))

- others. Soon large companies such as Zappos and online publishing platform Medium adopted holacracy as well. In his book Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World, Robertson describes how Tony approached him after hearing him speak at a conference. “Zappos is growing,” Tony told him. “We’ve reached fifteen hundred employees, and we need to scale without losing our entrepreneurial culture or getting bogged down in bureaucracy. So I’m trying to find a way to run Zappos more like a city.”24 Holacracy was a codified system to help him do it. Holacracy replaces traditional management hierarchies with self-organizing teams of people working on a specific project. The idea is that traditional titles such as CEO or COO are eliminated in favor of a number of roles that serve the same organizational purpose, and different people can fill these roles at different times; they are elected to fill those roles through a governance process, according to a constitution. Part of the reason for doing this, Robertson told me when we spoke, is to differentiate a person from a role for the sake of making the best… ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1758))

- of Zappos disappeared almost overnight. The Downtown Project made a similar move to holacracy. What happened, as we’ll see, was a mimetic crisis—not necessarily a failed management system, as the popular business press has painted it, but a system that opened the door for hidden mimetic desire to boil over.25 A human-centered approach to business involves grappling with the messiness of human interactions—with human nature. To introduce something foreign to human nature, which doesn’t complement it—like an organizational “operating system” that doesn’t account for mimetic desire—is to open up a Pandora’s box. Zappos had eliminated the management hierarchy, but they couldn’t eliminate the network of desire and the need that people have to be in relationship to models. There is always a hierarchy of desire from the perspective of an individual: some models are worth following more than others, and some things are worth wanting more than others. We are hierarchical creatures. This is why we like listicles and ratings so much.

However, you still had a few people who had infinite power because they had a strong relationship with Tony.” There was a hidden web of desire that nobody could decipher. Unwittingly, the gates of mimetic rivalry had been flung wide open. By 2010, when Tony published his book Delivering Happiness, the company’s flywheel seemed to have a new starting point. In the original one, “delivering happiness” was the last stage in the process. In the new version, happiness seeking became the first and primary step in the process. It’s presumptuous for anyone to think that they can “deliver happiness” to anyone else—even their own spouse. It’s not our job. It’s certainly not the job of a company.

People always pursue happiness by looking for models of happiness—whether that is someone who has lived the American dream, a Silicon Valley CEO, or your next-door neighbor.

- Most companies have a mission statement. Many of them have core values or some equivalent. Few make explicit—either to themselves or to the outside world—their hierarchy of values. This makes it hard for them to determine what to do when two of their values come into apparent conflict, like the value of protecting the health and safety of all employees versus keeping the business running during the COVID-19 pandemic. A hierarchy of values is especially critical when choices have to be made between good things. If values are all equally important, or if there isn’t a clear understanding of how they relate to one another, mimesis becomes the primary driver of decision-making.

- “My friends and my faith are both super important to me,” one of my college buddies says. Good. But what will he do if one of his best friends schedules his bachelor party in Miami’s South Beach on a high holy day? Saying that two different things are “super important” won’t help. Without a clear hierarchy, he’s more likely to choose according to the influences around him. His decision will be mimetically driven, not values driven. Companies face situations where competing claims are made on their values every day. Two of a company’s core values might be “inclusiveness and diversity” and “relationships built on trust.” If the company is in an industry where sales happen within an old-boys’ club, where trust has already been established between its members, how can they hire a young woman for a sales role and give her a chance to build up trust in a different way if there is not a clear priority on inclusiveness and diversity in the hiring process? In the absence of a hierarchy of values, the hiring managers won’t know what to do when 95 percent of the applications they receive are from highly experienced men. Mimetic forces will continue to dominate their sales force. In a company’s capital structure, there is always a hierarchy of claims on the company’s money. A start-up’s cap table (a hierarchical list of who owns what and who gets paid what and when) might contain the following groups of people with their claims listed in order of priority: secured creditor, unsecured creditor, preferred stockholders, ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1861))

- Tactic 6 ESTABLISH AND COMMUNICATE A CLEAR HIERARCHY OF VALUES A hierarchy of values is an antidote to mimetic conformity. If all values are treated as equal, then the one that wins out—especially at a time of crisis—is the one that is most mimetic. (During the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, there was panic-buying of toilet paper. There was no issue with supply; there was an issue with mimesis. Cultural values are often subject to the same irrationality—people tend to panic-buy whatever is most important to them at the moment rather than what is best for the common good.) It’s not enough to name values. They need to be ranked. When all values are the same, nothing is being valued at all. It’s like highlighting every single word in a book. It’s better to construct a mental model of your hierarchy of values (or your shared values, if you are in a relationship). Map it out on paper. Encourage your company to do the same. That hierarchy can change as time goes on. But by… ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1876))

A lack of clear, prioritized values in many companies allows mimesis to hijack the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and turn it into a flaccid marketing gimmick. It’s not that the values espoused by CSR programs aren’t important. But one gets the feeling that even “social responsibility” has become a mimetic, virtue-signaling game—more “social” than responsible.29 Avoid that by establishing and communicating both your values and their relative importance.

- People don’t think about the costs of a car crash until after they’ve been in one. Practically nobody thinks about collisions of desire before they happen. For Lamborghini, they were the same thing: colliding desires meant colliding cars. Tony Hsieh wanted to maximize positive collisions, but he didn’t take into account the hidden collisions of desire that happen in the mimetic space between people, in the hidden recesses of the human heart. On August 24, 2020, the Las Vegas Review-Journal confirmed that Tony Hsieh was stepping away from Zappos after more than twenty years at the helm.32 I learned on November 27, 2020, a few short months before this book went to print, that Tony had died the day after Thanksgiving—almost twelve years exactly since Tony and I shared a memorable Thanksgiving dinner together at his home.

- admonition made hurried souls stop and ponder its meaning. Her plea to be protected from what she wants is something that everyone can relate to. Each of us has desires that, if followed to the end, are dangerous to ourselves and to others. The same is true at the societal level: out-of-control mimesis makes desires spread and collide violently. René Girard saw that for thousands of years humans have had a specific way of protecting themselves in a mimetic crisis: they converge, mimetically, on one person or group, whom they expel or eliminate. This has the effect of uniting them while providing an outlet for their violence. They protect themselves from what they want—from their mimetic desires, which have brought them into conflict with one another—by directing their desire to vanquish their rivals to a single fixed point: someone that has become a proxy for all of their enemies. Someone who is unable to fight back. A scapegoat. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=1955))

- when the invisible enemy infiltrates a person’s defenses. In the case of mimesis, nobody suspects that their desires are being infected. We can’t predict when the wisdom of the crowd becomes the violence of the mob. We don’t see the violent interactions that took place on the other side of the park or the room. We’re only a small part of a large system, and nobody on the inside can grasp the dynamics of the whole. What happens in a mob happens in a fog. Ta-Nehisi Coates describes the fog in a November 2019 opinion piece in the New York Times: The new cancel culture is the product of a generation born into a world without obscuring myth, where the great abuses, once only hinted at, suspected or uttered on street corners, are now tweeted out in full color. Nothing is sacred anymore, and more important, nothing is legitimate—least of all those institutions charged with dispensing justice. And so, justice is seized by the crowd. This is suboptimal. The choice now would seem to be between building egalitarian institutions capable of withstanding public scrutiny, or further retreat into a dissembling fog.13 ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=2068))

- A mob is a hyper-mimetic organism in which individual members can easily lose personal agency. Mimetic contagion destroys the distinctions between people—especially the differences in their desires. You can show up to a rally wanting one thing and leave wanting something else entirely. Crowd psychology is different than individual psychology.17 Think of people dancing at a rave, moving hypnotically under the sway of the DJ or the band. Author Elias Canetti, who fled Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, wrote about this phenomenon in his masterpiece, Crowds and Power, first published in 1960. “As soon as a man has surrendered himself to the crowd,” Canetti writes, “he ceases to fear its touch.

- What happened? Why was throwing the first stone so hard? Because the first stone is the only stone without a mimetic model. The thrower of the first stone, often acting in a violent rage, gives the crowd a dangerous model to follow. As we saw earlier in the story of Apollonius and the Ephesians, once the first stone is thrown, the second stone becomes easier to throw. It is always easier to desire something—even, and maybe even especially, violence—when it has been desired by someone else first.

- “Examine ancient sources, inquire everywhere, dig up corners of the planet, and you will not find anything anywhere that even remotely resembles our modern concern for victims,” wrote René Girard.38 Think about how peculiar it is. At the present time we have such a heightened sensitivity to innocent victims that we find new injustices to accuse ourselves of daily. We are made highly uncomfortable by the thought that someone being treated harshly might be innocent. Where did this passionate spirit of defending victims come from? Did it come merely from the Enlightenment—the conceit that we are now smarter, rational people who can judge ([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=2468))

- the past rightly from our heightened, enlightened perch? Or did it come from something else entirely? According to Girard, our cultural awareness comes from the biblical stories. The awareness couldn’t have come about by thinking about it hard enough. We had a blind spot because we were part of the crime. The events recounted in the Bible showed us something that no amount of reasoning had arrived or could arrive at: the innocence of victims. We were like a person with a nail stuck in their head, raking our brains wondering what is causing our headache—until someone simply holds a mirror to our face. The effects hold for everyone who grew up in a culture that has been touched by these stories in some way, even if you are not familiar with them yourself, because they have had thousands of years to seep deeply into the fabric of our lives. Western culture has developed strongly around the defense of victims. Over the past two thousand years, there have been dramatic advances in public and private law, economic policies, and penal legislation to protect the vulnerable. Civilian (not military) hospitals sprang up in the fourth century.39 Monasteries in the Middle Ages protected the aging and dying, travelers and orphans. They served as what today we might call a social safety net. They protected ([Location 2474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=2474))

- victims. Today, both the pro-life and pro-choice movements speak the language of victims in their own way. No language is more powerful. One of the great ironies of the modern world is that Western democracies like the United States, in which there is a separation between church and state, have made the defense of victims an absolute moral imperative even as they have largely expunged religion from public life. It’s as if they said, “We’ll take your defense of innocent victims, Jews and Christians, and we’ll raise you—we will do even better than you have at defending victims.” And in many cases they do. In response, many religious people have taken secular culture as a mimetic rival. The culture wars are a giant mimetic rivalry with many faces, a hydra with a thousand heads—a rivalry from which each side would be wise to extract itself. The development of human rights as we know it was born partly from the indirect acknowledgment that anyone can become a scapegoat under the right circumstances. After approximately 75 million people were killed in World War II, the United Nations issued the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which protected fundamental human rights applicable to all people; it was translated into more than five hundred languages and dialects. The creation of the declaration stemmed, in large part, from the appalling number of innocent victims made during the course of the war. These developments have dramatically shifted the balance of power. Previously, most victims were totally powerless to defend themselves. Today, nobody has more cultural influence than someone who has been recognized as a victim. It’s as if the poles of the earth’s magnetic fields changed places, the way they do every few hundred thousand years. The scapegoat mechanism has been so thoroughly subverted that there is some semblance of a reverse scapegoating mechanism, whereby an innocent victim is recognized as having been treated brutally and then a wave of support swells up around that person. The original scapegoat mechanism brought order out of chaos—but the order depended on violence. The reverse process brings chaos out of order. The chaos is meant to shake up the “orderly” system, predicated on violence, until something serious is done to change it. The death of George Floyd in the United States in May 2020 is one salient example. Obviously, the defense of victims is a good thing. At the same time, it brings new dangers. In the same way that scapegoating rituals in archaic religions were entirely practical—that is, they were used to achieve practical ends—so too can the defense of victims be used for practical purposes.

- We can now go out into the world and find all of the scapegoats, point out every rivalry, and maybe even have a laugh at the expense of those still caught up in the quixotic throes of mimetic desire. But be careful. The scapegoat mechanism works by diversion; the more we see it in others, the less we can see it in ourselves. Sure, we can “use” mimetic desire, just as we can use other people’s trust or hearts or bodies. It might help us recognize the next Facebook. Or become better pickup artists. Or make a lot of money in a volatile stock market. But it will be a Faustian bargain. It will ensnare us in rivalries and keep us from doing the hard work of finding and pursuing those desires that ultimately lead to fulfillment. David Foster Wallace once mused that to live in a world in which the internet encompasses more and more of our lives, with increasingly sophisticated porn (like a virtual reality version), “We’re gonna have to develop some real machinery, inside our guts, to help us deal with this.”1 Machinery that might also help us respond in a better way to the images we see on the twenty-four-hour news cycle, to the polarized political environment, and to other mimetic accelerants such as frictionless technology that remove every barrier to restraint. We’re going to have to develop some machinery in our guts to help us resist dangerous mimesis. That will require being somewhat anti-mimetic, which we’ll explore in Part II. What does this mean? It’s not that we should be (or can be) free of mimetic desire. Being anti-mimetic is not like Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s “antifragile”—it’s not merely the opposite of mimetic. Being anti-mimetic is having the ability, the freedom, to ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FZ8QTP4&location=2552))

An anti-mimetic action—or person—is a sign of contradiction to a culture that likes to float downstream. The second half of this book is about developing the stuff inside our guts. It’s about developing the ability to resist knee-jerk social reflexes, to separate from the deafening crowd, to renounce the allure of easy desires, to want differently, and to want more.
