## Highlights
- I personally owed the banks several million dollars, with Firestone stock as collateral, for whenever I could buy any stock I bought it. I had put everything I earned into this stock, for I believe that a man is not truly in his business unless he has his all in it.

- Much of the thinking in business has to be along the lines of comparing values. If we make a change in manufacturing or in selling methods, will the added return pay the cost? This appraising operation in business is continuous. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=168))

- the company is his salary. As his production increases, so should you increase his salary. Keeping this in mind avoids the danger of underpayment or overpayment. One can apply the same rule to personal affairs; what you get out of your automobile in pleasure or in service is the value of the machine to you. If you can get a return of value for the upkeep and inevitable depreciation and that return is above the cost, then you can make money on the car. Otherwise, it will be a loss for you to own it.

- Many of the values are intangible and cannot be put down on paper in terms of dollars and cents, but this is the point: if you can make a picture of a situation in your own mind, then you can make comparisons and relate values, even if you cannot express them. Some people call this vision, and we hear a deal about the necessity for vision. But vision, as I see it, is not a dreaming forward. It is a thinking through with the values ever in mind. For instance, I should not be exercising vision if I looked forward to a day when I should supply all the tires in the world. That would be just idle, profitless dreaming. In quite another class is thinking out ways and means to get a certain percentage of all the tires used and then relating prices and manufacturing schedules and so on to that end. It is perfectly possible to make an exact mental picture of what would be required to do a decided percentage of business—and if that picture be kept in mind, the decisions to carry it out can come quickly. Quick decisions that have not behind them a long train of thought are exceedingly dangerous. Personally, I do not ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=179))

- My father, Benjamin Firestone, was, by and large, the best business man I have ever known. The test of a business man is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years, or can make money through the luck of getting into the field first, but whether in a highly competitive field, without having any initial advantage over his competitors, he can outdistance them in a perfect honourable way and keep the respect of himself and of his community.

- And I think this was due to the fact that he always had some money on the side and was therefore able to use his best judgment under the circumstances, instead of being forced into a decision by financial pressure. Having a surplus is the greatest aid to business judgment that I know—and I bitterly know what I am talking about, for I went through years of upbuilding without being able to accumulate a surplus. Then, when I gained one, I saw it completely wiped out and turned into a deficit overnight. A man with a surplus can control circumstances, but a man without a surplus is controlled by them and often he has no opportunity to exercise judgement.

- A new business starting without capital or with very little capital cannot, in the very nature of things, at once have a surplus—it must be a fire without a back log to steady its burning. But the first task it ought to set for itself is gaining a surplus. If the business is to be successful, this surplus will have to be accumulated, not out of the moneys which should go for improvement and extension, but out of the profits. A new business which, excepting under the most unusual circumstances, attempts to pay a dividend within the first five years of its existence is courting danger.

- My father had the rare foresight to know that a fine crop one year was more or less a fortunate accident and did not set a figure to be followed during future years. Consequently, he always had plenty of money to lend on mortgage to those around him who, although they had all his farming advantages, did not have his foresight.

- I notice that when all a man’s information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be.

- Akron many times larger than I have the least use for; I have another house at Miami Beach which is also much larger than I need. I suppose that before I die I shall buy or build other houses which also will be larger than I need. I do not know why I do it—the houses are only a burden. But I have done it, and all my friends who have acquired wealth have big houses. Even so unostentatious a man as Henry Ford has a much bigger house at Dearborn than he really cares about. I wonder why it is. Perhaps it is some foolish survival of the ancient feudal idea when a big house meant a strong house in which one might keep a small army for protection. In a few cases, a big house is built just as an advertisement that one is rich; sometimes a big house is built so that great entertainments may be given. But in most cases, and especially with men who have earned their own money, the house is just built, and when it is done, no one quite knows why it was ever started. No end of men build their houses so large that they might as well live in a hotel, and then many of them do live in a public hotel rather than go to the bother of running a private hotel. Anyhow, the spirit was strong in Grandfather Peter, who, otherwise a sensible man, set his people to making bricks and out of them constructed a house much larger than he or any of his descendants have been able to use. And I have not the least doubt that, if anyone asked him why he built it, he would not have known! ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=296))

- From that time onward, I have never found it worthwhile to bother with thoroughly little fellows for, realizing their weakness, they are always on the defensive, while a larger man will listen to what you have to say and be quick to grasp any money-making opportunities you may have to offer. By a “big man” I do not mean the man who has a big business—he may be just on his way to having a big business. But unless a man on the first approach shows signs of wanting to make money, it is a waste of time to try to convince him that he ought to buy. You may, if you persist, eventually sell to the suspicious man, but I have not found that it pays to make the effort—the returns are not commensurate with the work involved. Thereafter, when I entered a town, I always tried the largest and not the smallest store first. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=384))

- In the meantime, the crack salesmen would not bother with the small sales of flavouring extracts, they went out after the big money of the patent medicine and they did not sell. Patent medicines do not sell on merit, for there is precious little merit in most of them. Patent medicines sell only on their reputation for curing diseases, and that reputation has to be built up by advertising—people have to be made to believe that the medicines do good. That is where Jackson fell down. He had not built up any belief in his medicines through advertising. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=390))

- My little sales of flavouring extracts were the largest income the company had. The extracts did not need to be advertised, because people did not have to be educated into the belief that vanilla extract will give a vanilla flavour, whereas they do have to be educated or fooled into the belief that a spring tonic will cure spring ills. Within six months all the star salesmen had quit, and Jackson was broke—and I was out on the road. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=394))

- Thereby, quite unconsciously, I turned up the first principle of salesmanship—which is that you must thoroughly believe in what you have to sell. Then selling becomes merely a matter of showing how your product will help a prospect. I have always been more of a salesman than a manufacturer—it has been hard for me to learn factory methods. But selling has always come easy to me, simply because, since those patent medicines, I have never attempted to sell anything which I did not thoroughly believe in. Therefore, I have never really had to sell at all—only to explain the favour I expected to do the prospect. The principle holds true, whether one is selling a tangible thing, like a rubber tire, or whether one is selling something intangible, like the future of the company, either in the shape of capital stock or in the shape of credit at a bank. Persuading a man to buy is not, to my notion, salesmanship. It is just persuading him to buy and nothing more. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=408))

- Salesmanship has to establish a continuing relation in which the seller helps the buyer. Going to great lengths to sell a man something he does not want is a clumsy way of trying to get money—it is much simpler and just as honest to knock the fellow on the head and take the money away from him.

- Near our little plant was the more modern plant of the Imperial Rubber Company, and one day its proprietor offered to sell out to me lock, stock, and barrel for $15,000. He had not been able to make money against the competition of the big rubber companies. We did not have that much money, but the plant seemed to be a good buy, and I set out to raise the money; and for the first time I entered a bank with the intention of borrowing money. I shall not mention the name of the bank, for we never afterward did business with it. I talked with the president for a few moments, and then he turned me over to the credit man. I had with me a statement from our books, which I had prepared myself, because, as a bookkeeper, I was used to making up statements and I kept the books of the concern. The credit man read the statement carefully; I have forgotten what sort of a statement it was, but since it was a true statement, it probably showed our liquid assets as small—less than our current liabilities. For almost everything we had was tied up in plant, equipment, and raw materials. I did not at the time know that bank loans were made on the basis of quick assets and that banks do not commonly care to go into the investment business. If we had assets and prospects, it did not bother me at all what form they were in. The credit man led me on to explain the statement and I thought that I was selling our future. I told the story of the business we were doing, and how much we needed money to expand and take over the new plant, and what we expected to do with the money. He seemed to grow more interested as I proceeded, and I thought to myself that, when I had finished, he would recommend giving me the bank. But he was just giving me the opportunity to show how little I knew about finance. He was not frank about it—I left that bank thinking I was going to get a loan. And, while I was never refused the loan, I never got it. However, I did learn something. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=510))

- What I learned was that a bank statement ought never to be in such shape that it has to be explained. Everything ought to be on the statement, and if for some reason an explanation of an item is asked for, then one should be able to present facts and not prospects. A statement of condition can be a prospectus—in fact, it is the best possible kind of prospectus—but it ought not to be prepared in enthusiasm. It ought to be absolutely frank and entirely conservative; then an explanation will show that actual conditions are a little better and not a little worse than represented. A young fellow gets anxious, and he will, with perfect sincerity, paint far too rosy a picture. I do not blame that bank man for turning me down, but I do blame him for leading me on. Thinking the incident over, I saw that I had rushed in instead of going in cautiously and with a full knowledge of facts.

- But this bank officer did not bring up opening an account; he showed me where I had made mistakes in financial management. He told me something about how I should try to keep a ratio between quick assets and liabilities, and in an hour, not only found out all about what we were doing, but also gave me a course in practical banking. Then he lent me $10,000 on the company note. The young man’s name was Frank O. Wetmore, and today he is the president of the bank and one of the best friends our company has. He gave me my first lessons in banking, and while we did business in Chicago, I never made a move without first talking it over with him. Today I never go to Chicago without going in to see him, for he is as much of an advisor now as he was then. And I may say that, very shortly, we opened an account with the First National and have been doing business with it ever since. If you want help, it pays to go where the brains are. I had no idea that bank money cannot safely be used for capital investments. It is entirely true that it ought not to be, but the man who can build a business on small capital and preserve fine distinctions as to the use of the money he borrows is yet to be born. And every banker of experience knows it! ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=538))

- A man of affairs does not want to be bothered in the evening. A great many salesmen make the mistake of thinking that pestering a man is the same as selling him, and they get their prospects into such a state of exasperation that they would not buy a gold dollar from them at 50 percent off. Just getting to a man is not enough—it is when and how you get to him. There are more wrong times to sell to a man that there are right times, and if I ever should write a book on salesmanship I should give about one third of the book to the topic “Common Sense.” I have been buttonholed thousands of times by salesmen who, if they had just exercised a grain of common sense, would have known that, while the ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=710))

I cannot too greatly emphasize or repeat too many times that bank borrowing for any capital purpose is asking for more luck than falls to the ordinary enterprise. Buildings and tools and machinery cannot be expected to pay for themselves in three months, or six months, or a year. Short-term, capital borrowing has to be repaid either out of profits or out of the sale of capital assets—which means liquidation.

The real test was of product. Cutting the quality was urged on me, but it did not impress me as being an alternative. If we lowered our quality and frankly turned out poor tires, then we should eventually have to fail, because no one making and selling what he knows to be a poor thing can hope to continue to succeed.

I believe in keeping prices low, for, regardless of service, there is no real profit in high prices, because high prices automatically cut down volume.

- A company must have one head and only one, and he must be the real executive head. The board of directors can advise on policies, but it cannot run the business, and, anyway, policies never make a business successful. There is some thought that if a number of men waste a few days draughting a policy, it is the same as doing the work; a fine lot of policies are harmless enough if you can find the time to draw them up. But they are policies and nothing more. I have great respect for the written word, but no amount of writing will take the place of action. A policy is a policy, and that is all it is. And there is always the danger that a policy in effect for a long time will get into the hallowed class, and the organization will take it as inspired. A bad policy is worse than no policy at all, and policies have a way of going bad. The world changes, and policies must also change. I know of only one first-class policy. It runs: “Use what common sense you can under the circumstances.” I said that I did not believe in delegation. Let me explain.

For instance, it was a tradition that rubber had to age in the warehouse a long time before it could be used. Rubber is expensive and aging cost a lot of money—for we had to keep a deal of money in idle rubber. Everyone told me that this aging was absolutely necessary, but no one could tell me why it was necessary. I suggested that we try going ahead without aging and see what happened. We did go ahead—and nothing happened. The tires stood up just as well as they ever had, and we saved millions. Someone back in the past must have laid down the rule that rubber had to age, and everyone else had followed without question.

There are times when extra sales pressure is useful—say, to clear out big inventories—but I should never think of putting on a sales campaign just to stimulate the salesmen. If the salesmen are not doing their work, then that is the fault either of their managers or of the product—or of both. The fundamental faults of management and manufacturing are only made the worse by giving artificial sales aid to the distributors or by shifting the blame for bad conditions to them.

- what it will do, and no amount of enthusiasm in the sales force will make up for bad manufacturing. So the way to advertise and sell tires is, to my way of thinking, the way to sell any commodity—that is, on service to the buyer. The job of the salesman is to find out the exact requirements of the prospect and sell to him the tire that will best fulfil those requirements; and the way to make the sale is to know tires so thoroughly that you can explain to the prospect just why you can give him a brimming dollar’s worth of service.

The real work of the convention is done in groups of ten or twenty men who are given what amounts to class instruction by an executive. We get our personal contact more effectively by having the branch managers and many of the dealers come to Akron from time to time and treating them as guests. They can see what the plant is really like. They can see what we are really like, and thus get on a solid, permanent basis. That is what we are always after—a permanent relationship. And that is why we do not care for sales contests or high-pressure selling. We have tried most of the approved devices for stimulating sales. For several years we set up quotas. If the end of the month were near and a salesman were below his quota, it was natural for him to go to a dealer that he knew well and say: “Help me out with an order to make my quota.” That is not selling—that is asking for alms. A dealer with a charitable bent of mind will order to help the agent, which is no reason at all for ordering. We have had sales contests with prizes and bonuses, and these, too, were successful, in that they produced results, but the results were not permanent. When a sales contest closed, the salesmen took things easy for a week or two, and we would have a sharp drop in sales.

- Selling is not a matter of systems but of men, and we have found that a salesman cannot get the right knowledge to sell tires without going through a tire course at Akron. To this course I have given a great deal of attention, as also I have to the other course for college men which is elsewhere described—for both are in the line of men building. Tire salesmen have to be made because they must know tires. A first-class salesman who can make a record number of sales has possibilities of being a liability to us unless he knows the construction of tires and the proper uses of the different types so that he may instruct the dealers, who, in turn may impart this knowledge to the consumer.

Both Mr. Edison and Mr. Ford, while giving attention to things near at hand, paint their big thoughts on a far-flung canvas. They have long since passed the point where they give much heed to their personal fortunes. Neither man has the slightest regard for money except for what it will do for humanity, and both have the view that the way to help humanity is to help it to help itself. They are both practical visionaries—they make their dreams come true. They are both concerned with masses of men—with those who are often, though snobbishly, called “the common people.” Just as though we were not all of us plain, common people! They do not talk much about business in the usual fashion. They have nothing to say about details, not because they do not know details, but because their interests are in larger affairs. It is hard to set down what I got from these men in a business way.

An expansion on borrowed money is very dangerous. We have never made a move of real importance that has not been opposed by some stockholders. When we went into the making of pneumatic tires, we had protests, and to avoid difficulties I arranged to buy out the protesting interests.

The best results are obtained when a majority of the stockholders are directly involved in the management of the company. Mr. Ford, ever since his business became successful, has always carried a large cash balance. That course he has always urged upon me, and I agree with him that it is the right course, but whether or not it is wise to borrow at times cannot be decided off-hand without regard to the nature of the business. An automobile has in it only a small amount of material and a great deal of workmanship. A tire has in it a great deal of material—rubber, compounds, and cotton—and a small amount of workmanship. The rubber under present conditions has to come from far overseas—it is three months from Singapore. Once I control my sources of rubber—and that is only a few years away—I shall be able to regulate our supplies of rubber according to our business and pay little or no attention to the rubber market; the market fluctuations will be of no consequence to me. But as it is now, we have to buy according to… ([Location 2629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2629))

- One night, on this trip, I started to talk to Mr. Edison about rubber and its properties, and I was astounded at the knowledge of rubber that he had at hand. I had been working with rubber for many years, but he told me more than I knew and more than I think our chemists knew—although, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Edison had never given any great attention to rubber, excepting in connection with his talking machines. But it is that way with any subject one brings up with Mr. Edison. ([Location 2666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2666))

- “No, thank you,” answered Mr. Edison. “I don’t smoke, I chew.” Mr. Edison does smoke a great deal, but he had the idea—I suppose—that he was not going to take a cigar just because the President offered him one. Mr. Edison does not take to everyone at once and does not pretend to. He does not set up as a hail fellow. “I think I can accommodate you,” answered the President, and with that he pulled a big plug of chewing tobacco out of his hip pocket. Mr. Edison grinned and took a big chew. Later he announced: “Harding is all right. Any man who chews tobacco is all right.” ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2705))

- Our life in camp with the President was very simple. The Bishop held a service in the morning, we rode horseback, and Sunday afternoon the President had to return to Washington. He had talked freely about a number of things in addition to the Arms Conference. He had spoken about the trials of being President and the vast amount of unnecessary detail imposed upon the office—which interested Mr. Ford a great deal, because Mr. Ford has worked out a way of not directly looking after anything. He also spoke of the nuisance of a President being forced to seek a second term, and thought that a single term of six years would be far better and leave the President with more ([Location 2720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2720))

- But the wood working and the wood saving are of themselves technical matters. The big point is that all this work was being done to save transportation of useless material, to quicken the turnover, and to earn from waste—which are three of the cardinal points in Mr. Ford’s theory of manufacture. The lesson which I learned was that a manufacturing operation should be carried through without a stop from the raw material to the finished product, and that no man can be said to control his business unless also he can control his sources. The larger the business, the greater are the possible economies. ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2751))

- We talked of nothing in particular—with the motion picture cameras and the reporters we, indeed, had little time for talk, even if we had had anything to talk about. This is not to say that the President was reticent. He is supposed to be a silent man, and he is—when he has nothing to talk about. And it is a gift to keep silent when one has nothing to say!

- And out of all the trips, out of all the association with these great men, one precept stands out above all others. It has been the rule of the lives of both Mr. Edison and Mr. Ford. It is the reason why they are great. It is this: Go it alone. Do not fail to try because someone has already tried and failed.

- “We are in the business of making and selling tires. The factory here is piled to the roof with unsold tires. All the branches are full of tires. And so are all your dealers. The public has not stopped using tires, but they are not going to buy at present prices. Our tires have to be turned into cash. There is only one way to do that, and that is, to make such a big cut in prices that those tires will just have to sell. “Therefore, we are reducing all our prices 25 percent It is up to you men to show the dealers that it is better business to move their stocks than to hang on to them. “We have plenty of tires to sell them, and they will make more money by getting rid of their stocks at a loss and restocking at the new price than they will by holding on to the tires they have in the hope of getting clear on them.” Many, I might almost say most, of the men ([Location 2938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2938))

- could not understand such a price cut. They saw in it only a lot of trouble with the dealers, for with this one move we were cutting a quarter off the inventory of every dealer, and of course that meant trouble. All of the other tire companies were maintaining prices. After I had made my announcement, the argument started. Some of the men thought that a 10 percent cut would be enough; others thought that we might go as high as 15 percent, but only a few could envision the effects of 25 percent. I did not tell them that I had been considering 33 1/3 percent. But I did tell them that a small reduction would not give the smash we had to have—the big dramatic play. For not otherwise could we attract the buying public. These managers had to be convinced, for they had to carry the message out to the country—they had to have the enthusiasm I had for better business. Some would not be convinced and had to be let out. It was no time for half-hearted work. We went to the country with a bang. For that was the way the thing had to go if it were to go at all. We had dealers’ meetings all over the country. I went out on the road myself and addressed meetings. Any man who not willing to give up day and night to putting the sale over just had to get out. We spent money regardless in full-page advertisements in the newspapers. We hung big red banners on our dealers’ shops, we hung them everywhere, and they had on them our slogan in red: ([Location 2946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2946))

And yet these two great industries depend absolutely upon the will of foreign countries for their lives. They depend on rubber, and no rubber is grown in the United States.

- The passenger car and the truck have changed the foundations of every sort of business in this country. Take away from us the motor vehicle, and I do not know what would happen. The damage would be more serious and lasting than if our land were laid waste by an invader. We could recover from the blowing up of New York City and all the big cities on the Atlantic seaboard more quickly than we could recover from the loss of our rubber. That is how important rubber is to us. ([Location 2988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2988))

- It is not so important to any other nation, for the life of no other nation is so dependent on the automobile as is ours. We have 85 percent of the world’s automobiles. We use three quarters of the rubber production of the world, and of what we use, about 80 percent goes into automobile tires. And we grow only a very small fraction of 1 percent under our own flag! During the war we could not get a pound of rubber except upon the written consent of the British Government. I was then President of the Rubber Association of America and charged with the allotting of the rubber we were permitted to import. I have no complaint to make of the manner in which the British allowed us rubber, but the point is that we had to be allowed to bring in rubber. We were not then and are not now the masters of the rubber we use. ([Location 2992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=2992))

- There is a notion that if a man has established a business and accumulated a certain competence and then keeps on working, it is only because he is greedy and wants more and more money and that eventually he becomes just a slave—a slave to money. Nothing could be further from the facts. It is true that for twenty-five years I have been building a business. I have given it all of my time and thought. I am still giving it all of my time and thought and intend to keep on doing so. I do not know whether I am the slave or the master of that business. But the big thing is that I do not care which, for the job is worth doing as either master or servant. The job is not only worth doing well, but there is a great joy in doing it. All other considerations aside, the very worries and insistent demands on one’s mentality and physique are a joy—for they are tests, challenges. Business is not a game. Business is not a science—there are too many unknown and unknowable factors ever to permit it to be a ([Location 3166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=3166))

- science. If business were a science, then one could learn the principles and let the thing run itself. But no business will run itself. Perhaps business is a profession—of that I am not sure. But rather I think that business comprehends everything, and that is one of the reasons why I like to be in it. The money side is not unimportant. It is very important. Naturally, one needs quite a lot of money in order to live, but the bulk of what I earn goes back into the company. I am willing to stand or fall by the business. That business must earn money, and therefore it has to be watched day and night. It must earn money, else it will fail, and failure means that one has played the game and lost. Deliberately causing a business to operate without profits through some foggy concept of benevolence is only another way of destroying the service of that business. For unless a business earns, it must stop. The game has to be played or not played. There is no point in between. And so I stay in business and I take on additional burdens, and I intend to keep on taking on additional burdens for these reasons: Our life is made up of experiences. Business leads one into every profession and every walk of life. It is the school of experience. The greatest pleasure is in doing something to help others to help themselves. There is some small satisfaction in just giving away money, but the great satisfaction is in giving others the chance to be independent. For instance, the opening of Liberia or the Philippines would be worth more than a life’s work. I like people,… ([Location 3174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXBFGQ2M&location=3174))
