## Highlights
- Let’s face it: the stigma that specialist referred to is still alive and well today. Those who haven’t walked the walk—as we have—hold all kinds of misconceptions. After my book was released, my husband and I were invited to many speaking engagements and book club events. One book club president, however, said, “Our club is reading your book and finding it amazing, but a few of the members vetoed my suggestion that we invite you and Andy along to a discussion about it. That’s because they’ve heard that BPD is caused by parental abuse.” Another parent told me, “Frankly, I’m astonished a well-respected teacher like you could have had a child who turned out to be as bad as Colleen.” Wow! That’s like saying, “I’m astonished your daughter has brown eyes when you don’t.” Unfair though it is, parents are often the first ones to be blamed when something goes wrong with their child. And even when others don’t blame us, we blame ourselves and feel guilty. We feel guilty without knowing exactly why, and when we learn about BPD, we feel guilty that we didn’t know about it earlier so we could have taken advantage of the specialized parenting tools you’re going to learn about in this book. We, the parents of troubled children, can’t change everyone’s thinking. But, as the authors of this book indicate, we can try our best to help both ourselves and our children by learning how to interact with them in ways that are not invalidating or demeaning—and how, sometimes, to not interact with them at all. In those cases, it’s best to give them, as well as ourselves, some space until everybody has had a chance to calm down.

- As I searched for solutions for a myriad of issues, it quickly became evident that the parents’ natural instincts to help their children by any and all means possible wasn’t helping the parents at all—it was causing them to take actions that were making problems much worse—not just for their children, but for themselves.

- You ask yourself, Is this my fault? Your child tells you you’re a bad parent, or that they hate you, and it breaks your heart and makes you feel bad. Is it true? Every mental health professional you take your child to gives you a different diagnosis. Perhaps they said it’s bipolar, ADHD, or oppositional defiant disorder. Perhaps your child also has an eating disorder, is depressed, or has some other disorder. But clearly something else is wrong.

- Let’s start with some basics—like what borderline personality disorder is. Each person who has BPD has their own unique personality, but—just as people who suffer from bipolar, eating disorders, and schizophrenia have traits of those disorders—people with BPD have common traits too. BPD is a mental disorder characterized by dysregulated (unmanaged or uncontrolled) and extreme thoughts, feelings, and actions. While people generally base their feelings on the facts in front of them, people with BPD base the facts on their feelings. For example, your child may be furious at you for making them go to school, even though it’s mandatory and you’re not capable of homeschooling them. Or they may be nearly suicidal about the loss of a relationship that was over before it even started. Logic will not help them in these instances. They think in black and white. Others are either all good or all bad, to be put on a pedestal or angrily tossed off of it. And their strong feelings cause them to exhibit extreme “pain-management behaviors”—actions taken to decrease pain that can be harmful to themselves or others. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=205))

- These traits lead to unstable relationships, leading to a tragic self-fulfilling prophecy: people with BPD desperately need people, but the ways in which they act to maintain these relationships turn people away from them. A person doesn’t need to exhibit every trait to have BPD, and some problems will be worse than others. Let’s look at these traits in more detail.

- Or perhaps your child gets angry and attacks. Their thinking is, You’re not going to reject me, I’m going to reject you first! This happens frequently in adult BPD relationships as well. Relationships that are going well can make the person with BPD feel tense and uncertain because they anticipate their friends will find out how unworthy they are and will inevitably leave them. So, they break up the friendship. They would rather reject than be rejected. The important thing to know is that, no matter what you do—including giving your child unconditional love and everything they ask for—you cannot make this trait go away. That black hole of emptiness ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=290))

- cannot be filled by you or anyone else; only treatment works. One father said that trying to meet his kid’s needs as they related to perceived abandonment was like trying to fill the Grand Canyon using a water pistol, except the Grand Canyon has a bottom. People with BPD try to fill this hole with all the behaviors in the BPD definition. They sour on relationships because they think this new person will fill the hole, and when they don’t, they get disappointed, bitter, upset, suicidal, or angry, which leads to another BPD trait: unstable relationships. Here are preteen and adolescent examples of this trait in action. Zendaya spends as much time as she can with her mother in the morning before school. She anticipates her mother leaving to go to work and dreads the moment. As it gets closer to the time when her mother leaves, her anxiety increases and she asks her mother to stay home with her. When her mother says no, she starts to get a stomachache. Sometimes she throws up or has diarrhea, and other times she goes to school very sad. Andy is used to seeing his boyfriend, Francois, every day in school. When Francois tells Andy that he is going to Europe with his family for two weeks, Andy panics. Andy tells him that he cannot live without him and threatens to kill himself if he goes. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=295))

- Raising a child with BPD can be so frustrating because you may feel like all the love you pour into your child washes away like rain off a sidewalk. Some parents say that their child ignores all the signs of love they give and picks up on the one critical thing they said above all else. They are highly sensitive to any “clues” that confirm how “bad” they are, and positive feedback can roll off their back because they don’t feel worthy enough to accept it.

- Rage and extreme anger, common traits for kids with BPD, are tough for most parents to cope with. When your child is screaming the f-bomb at you, telling you that you should die and that you are a “f@#$%&* monster,” or making other terrible comments out of proportion to whatever you said or did, it’s very hard to be calm. Or maybe a friend has insulted your child (or they believe they’ve been insulted). Trying to convince a raging child that they’re wrong about whatever they’re mad about won’t work because it comes off as invalidating. In chapter 7, we’ll teach you how to validate your child, which should be your first ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=334))

- response to intense emotions. Here are two examples of out-of-proportion rage in a preteen and adolescent. Ginger wanted a green jacket like her friend Emily had. Her father took her to the store to buy one, but they didn’t have green in her size, only purple and brown. Ginger was so upset that she collapsed on the floor in the store, sobbing uncontrollably. Alice’s phone was dead, but she couldn’t find the charger. She looked all over her room several times, getting more and more frantic with each unsuccessful search. She then asked her little brother if he had taken it, and he said no. She accused him of taking it and insisted that he give it back. When he repeated that he didn’t know what she was talking about, she began screaming at him at the top of her lungs.

- It is too early for research studies to compare the different outcomes for people with BPD who get treatment early versus those who wait, but the researchers and authors who back this up include the following: “Two things are absolutely clear. First, adults with BPD almost always recognize that their ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=404))

- symptoms and suffering started in childhood or adolescence. Second, some adolescents have symptoms that are so consistent with BPD that it would be unethical not to make this diagnosis and treat them accordingly.” Blaise Aguirre in Borderline Disorder in Adolescents: What to Do When Your Teen Has BPD (2014, 21). “BPD has been a controversial diagnosis in adolescents, but this is no longer justified. Recent evidence demonstrates that BPD is as reliable and valid among adolescents as it is in adults and that adolescents with BPD can benefit from early intervention…BPD diagnosis and treatment should be considered part of routine practice in adolescent mental health to improve these individuals’ well-being and long-term prognosis.” Kaess, Brunner, and Chanen in Pediatrics (2014, 1).

- The bottom line is this: adolescents and even younger children with symptoms of borderline personality disorder need to be diagnosed and treated as soon as symptoms present themselves. As Fran Porter said in the foreword, would you wait to treat a broken leg? Many adolescents self-harm and are suicidal, and if you only treat the behaviors but not the underlying disorder, you’re only treating the symptoms, not the ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=413))

- cause. The difference could literally be life and death. Why take the risk for a negative outcome? And there are BPD treatments proven to be effective, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and others.

- If your son has BPD, you may need to advocate for him even more than you would if he were your daughter, because many clinicians are not familiar with recent research showing that BPD is as common in males as it is in females. You may also need to help your son with BPD understand the shades of his emotions. If his father or another trusted male role model can tell him it’s okay to have all sorts of feelings (other than anger) and name them, it would do a world of good. Right now, his emotions are probably a mystery to him. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=444))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There is no one cause of BPD, but rather a constellation of risk factors that involve both nature and nurture (Aguirre 2014). The more risk factors a person has, nature or nurture, the more likely it is they’ll develop BPD. Regardless of the biological risk, we believe that you can reduce the chance that your child will develop BPD by following the strategies and techniques described in this book.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- be unreliable, and why simple events and innocuous statements can trigger extreme rage. The amygdala, a part of our brain that plays an important role in regulating emotions like fear, aggression, and anxiety, seems to have unusually high levels of activity when someone with BPD is under stress, overwhelming the prefrontal cortex, which allows us to temper those feelings with logic.

- If you’ve done any research about BPD, you’ve probably read that child abuse, neglect, or trauma are among its primary causes. Parents are often confused by this information. Many misconstrue a correlation between a history of abuse and BPD for cause and effect. (A correlation is a mutual relationship or a connection between two or more things.) However, not everyone with BPD was abused or otherwise traumatized in childhood, and even if they were, no one should assume a parent was responsible. Even if you were an almost perfect parent and received a national award for parenting, you’d still be going through your memories trying to spot where you went “wrong,” because you must have done something wrong for your child to be this way, right? Ironically, feelings of guilt will urge you to do all the wrong things for your child with BPD, as we’ll show you in chapter 8. Rather than trying to find where you’re to blame, channel that guilt you might feel into following the recommended strategies in this book.

- When your child is suffering from BPD, and you are suffering as well, it might help to know that of the ten diagnosable personality disorders, BPD is widely considered the most treatable (Dingfelder 2004). It’s easy to find people with BPD who have recovered. The difference between a person who’s in recovery and one who’s not is the person’s willingness to acknowledge their unhappiness with life and to take responsibility for making changes that will make their life worth living. Treatment and emotional support are musts, of course. But many people with BPD who have recovered describe an epiphany of sorts (sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom) when they realized that only they could put themselves on the road to recovery. And the more effort they put into it, the more they will recover. As a parent, you can’t change them directly, but you can change your behavior to make it more likely that you let this epiphany occur naturally. In this book, we’ll show you how.

- from this chapter: BPD is a story of dysregulated (unmanaged or uncontrolled) thoughts, emotions, and actions. Kids with BPD base their facts on their feelings, not vice versa. When your child thinks or behaves in a way that is illogical and beyond your understanding, your mantra should be, “For my child, feelings equal facts.” Write it down and tape it up somewhere they can’t see it. People with BPD cannot generate self-esteem internally. They rely on others to give it to them by trying to control their environment and the people in it. Understanding that your child’s behaviors that feel manipulative are really survival strategies to help them get through a world of pain is the first step to understanding your child and knowing how to respond. Minors can have BPD, and anyone who tells you otherwise is behind the times. It’s… ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=504))

- Judgments: People with BPD believe that others are judging them all the time. For example, Carol, a preteen, says she’s not going to grandpa’s anymore because she thinks he prefers her older brother: “He loves Jimmy better. He only pays attention to him.” ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=607))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Feelings Feelings equal facts: We talked about this in chapter 1, but it bears repeating. Whereas most people base their feelings on the facts in front of them (most of the time), people with BPD base the facts on their feelings. To an extent, we all use our emotions to determine what we believe. Advertisers and politicians know this and exploit it. But kids with BPD take this much further. The validation section in chapter 7 will show you how to elicit some of the “facts” on their mind so you can respond more effectively. Weak empathy: Because kids with BPD are consumed with survival strategies and their nonstop pain, they have a difficult time putting themselves in other people’s shoes. To family members, this comes across as having weak or even no empathy. For example, Jason, a preteen, rushed while clearing the table and broke his mother’s favorite coffee mug. When his mother got upset, Jason said, “It’s just an effing mug!” This weak empathy, which is especially striking when the person with BPD is upset, leads to family members feeling underappreciated and overworked. Don’t be afraid to point out when you need a please ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=627))

- and thank you, or when you’re sick or need help. Without shaming your child, don’t be afraid to explain how you feel and how you wish to be treated. Just because they don’t think of helping you doesn’t mean they won’t. Sensitivity to criticism: Kids with BPD are very sensitive to criticism because they already think the worst of themselves. For this reason, be positive when you can be. Catch them being good and notice it. For example, when it’s their turn to unload the dishwasher and they do it, thank them. Watch out for the good they do instead of the bad. Celebrate the cessation of unhealthy behaviors—for example, showing restraint while frustrated. Rewards can include smiles, praise, positive body language, attention, and points that can be traded in for privileges or treats. You can say, “You acted in a very smart [helpful, sensitive, intuitive] way” when it is authentic to say so. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=638))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Emotional sensitivity: It’s not easy for kids with BPD to maintain relationships because of their emotional reactivity, or their over-the-top intensity that’s out of proportion to whatever triggered it. This sensitivity is related to how their brains function differently. Their emotions are not only more intense, but they also stick around longer. It’s helpful to remind yourself that this is not an attempt to “manipulate” you; rather, it’s a way for them to cope. Conan: Our son is supersensitive (Understatement!) to every word, nuance, tone, smell, and sound he sees as rejecting, and he believes he even knows when we are thinking something negative about him. He wants us to do everything for him even if we don’t have time, are ill, or it’s an entirely unreasonable request. He’s failing school despite his high IQ, which we didn’t know because he had been lying to us about his grades and time spent studying (he said he was going to the library when he was really doing something else). He has been to multiple therapists and convinced them that we, ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=650))

- his parents, are insane and abusive. This feels hopeless. Lower level of emotional development: An average two-year-old has tantrums when they’re frustrated, objecting to changes in routine, and feeling jealous because they’re not the center of attention. They have frequent mood swings, are egocentric, and have a low awareness of other people’s needs. People with BPD are still struggling with some of these tasks, which may make you frustrated. Keep in mind they are still learning to overcome some of these two-year-old challenges. Neediness: Most children enjoy growing older, becoming more independent, and learning to do things for themselves. Children with BPD are the opposite. Parents doing things for them equals love. They view their parents’ gentle push into independence as threatening and abandoning, and they may resist forcefully, causing major upsets. When parents try to “help” by preventing them from experiencing the natural consequences of their behavior, or do so because they want to avoid temper tantrums, their children learn that tantrums work and use them repeatedly. As you will see later in this book, this is called “feeding the monster” (BPD). It makes BPD ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=658))

- Low frustration tolerance: This extremely common characteristic can cause a lot of grief. Sticking at something despite its difficulty allows people to think before they act, something people with BPD, with their impulsivity, don’t often do. When they want something, it will always be a crisis. When you rush to satisfy those immediate wants, you signal that enduring the frustration is impossible. If you’ve ever had a cat, you know that if you give in and feed it before dinnertime, it will want dinner even earlier tomorrow. The same behavioral principles work with your child. Their crisis shouldn’t be your crisis. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=675))

- Testing others: You may feel as if your child controls the household, but they think you do, because you have the power to reject or abandon them, blame or criticize them, or otherwise do something that makes them feel terrible. This causes incredible tension. In adult relationships, many people with BPD deal with that by breaking up with a partner before their partner breaks up with them. Your child does something similar: since they can’t break up with you, they’ll challenge your directives or act in extreme ways to see if you’ll still stick by what you said you would do.

- I hate the way I am as much as you do. For all the pain that I cause you, I am suffering ten times as much. I struggle daily with the fear that those I love are going to leave me, often desperately attempting to avoid the inevitable abandonment. I know you think my fear is irrational—and maybe it is—but it feels so real to me. Every day I wake up never knowing what sort of day I will have. Just like you, I wish I could live a happy life, free from the chaos that seems to follow me wherever I go. The chaos I feel is best described as like having a beast that lives inside me. Sometimes the beast is sleeping and it is easy to forget he is there. Even I can begin to fool myself into thinking that maybe the beast has disappeared. I never know when my beast is going to awaken, ready to wreak havoc on myself and everyone I hold dear to me—all I know is that he will awaken. Just like you, I feel as if I am walking on eggshells most ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=705))

I may self-harm, jump into a relationship, fight, drink, or use any of the other coping mechanisms I have taught myself over the years. You see, to you, my behaviors are simply destructive, but to me, they are survival skills that I use when I don’t know how to cope anymore. To the outside world, I behave in a way that is completely unacceptable. I understand why people have this view—except that nobody knows what is going through my head or how I feel, yet these are the driving forces behind my behavior. Yes, I am highly emotional, and no, I do not consider the consequences of my actions, but I know no other way to be right now. This is who I am. This is me. There is help out there for people like myself with BPD. There is no cure but it can be managed. I need recovery as much as you need me to recover, but it will be much easier for me if I know I have your love and support. I must also tell you that recovery takes time, and there will be times when you feel as if I am going backward—I am not; it is just part of the journey.

- Having borderline personality disorder alone is challenging enough, but many, if not most, people with BPD have one or more psychiatric problems at the same time. It could be that one of the conditions or disorders started before the other, or perhaps both conditions developed at the same time. Sometimes one condition or disorder may end, but the other ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=754))

- continues or worsens. An additional psychiatric problem adds more symptoms to the mix, making your child’s behavior more confusing (and painful), and requires additional treatment. This chapter covers the most common psychiatric problems that co-occur in people with borderline personality disorder. We’ll discuss them from the most to least common based on research studies of large groups of individuals (Grant et al. 2008; Friedel, Cox, and Friedel 2018; Weiner, Perroud, and Weibel 2019; Zanarini et al. 2010): Clinical depression (occurs at some point in over 80 percent of people with BPD) Anxiety disorders and panic attacks (60 to 90 percent) Eating disorders, including anorexia and bulimia (20 to 55 percent) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (30 to 50 percent) Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) (30 to 50 percent) Bipolar disorder type I (30 percent) Substance abuse disorders, including alcohol abuse (65 to 80 percent) ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=756))

- Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) It is also possible to have two personality disorders at the same time—in fact, it’s well known that BPD and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) can occur at the same time (Grant et al. 2008). This is especially true among people with BPD who use people, excessively criticize others, do not think they have problems, will not seek treatment, and blame others for all their problems. It is much less common in those who seek treatment, self-harm, and blame themselves for things they didn’t do. NPD is also more common in adult children than minors. While people with BPD look to others to manage their moods, people with NPD rely on others to prop up their low self-esteem and shore them up so they can deny their deep feelings of shame.

- people with NPD can’t generate self-worth for themselves, they require an unlimited “narcissistic supply” from others in the form of admiration, praise, attention, being envied, special treatment, being feared, approval, affirmation, respect, applause, celebrity status, and any other means of being viewed as special (Mayo Clinic 2017). As they clutch their narcissistic supply, like a nonswimmer clinging to a capsized boat, people with NPD create a bubble for themselves, which maintains their narrative that they’ve always been strong, powerful, smart, well liked, and a winner. Intolerable feelings are buried so deep that they can’t be accessed on a typical day. Only a “narcissistic injury” (for example, an insult on a social media site, a perceived slight, a spouse asking for a divorce, or losing an election) can threaten this little ecosystem. It punctures the narcissist’s bubble and triggers feelings of deep vulnerability, shame, and inadequacy. They may respond by attacking the person who “injured” them or trying to get even.

- People with bipolar II also have depressive episodes, but not the full-blown mania typical of bipolar I. Instead, they have “hypomanias” (small manic episodes), a reduced duration or less extreme case of the mania described above. A person can rapidly cycle between depressive and hypomanic states. Hypomania can also show up as significant insomnia, irritability, agitation, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. In between depressive and hypomanic episodes, people with bipolar II can also have normative emotional states (NIMH 2018). BPD and bipolar disorders share common traits: Mood changes Impulsivity Extreme behaviors Suicidal thinking Possible alcohol and drug abuse A history of troubled, unstable relationships But there are also striking differences, namely the three detailed in the following table (NIMH 2018; NIMH n.d.).

- The good news is that there is a great deal of data on the treatment of bipolar disorder. The illness can be managed successfully with therapy and medication, and relationships with friends and family can be greatly improved (Fast and Preston 2006). However, like BPD, bipolar disorder is usually a lifelong illness and often involves a combination of medications and psychotherapy. At times, hospitalization may be necessary.

- In our experience, children with BPD are mistakenly diagnosed with bipolar disorder more than any other illness, and children with bipolar disorder are mistakenly diagnosed with BPD. Mood swings are common with both disorders, so clinicians mistake the two. Sometimes parents aren’t comfortable with the bipolar diagnosis because it explains some of their child’s symptoms and behaviors, but not all. A proper diagnosis is vital because the treatments are not the same. Why might a therapist erroneously give a bipolar diagnosis? First, some therapists believe a BPD diagnosis will “label” children with a disorder that lacks meaningful treatment options. (They are incorrect in believing there is no treatment for these children.) Second, some therapists don’t realize that children can be diagnosed with BPD, and they don’t know that there are effective treatment options. As a parent, you’ve been studying your child’s behavior for their entire life in thousands of circumstances. If a diagnosis doesn’t feel right to you, get a second or third opinion from qualified clinicians. If they dismiss you or insist children can’t be treated for BPD, get another opinion.

- Here are some key takeaways of this chapter to keep in mind as you read on: Co-occurring illnesses are extremely common in people with BPD, with depression being almost universal. You need to determine if your child’s current treatment provider can handle the co-occurring illness, or if you need another specialist. If your child is abusing drugs or has an eating disorder, you will almost certainly need outside help. If your child is abusing drugs, that illness needs to be managed before or at the same time as BPD treatment (Aguirre 2014). People who abuse drugs and alcohol often do it to numb themselves (make their internal pain go away), and the process of therapy involves examining that pain—and there is evidence that addiction impairs BPD treatment and recovery far more than in many other disorders (Aguirre 2014). Bipolar disorder is a very common misdiagnosis for children with BPD (Friedel, Cox, and Friedel 2018). Once you are familiar ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1042))

- with both disorders, we suggest you follow your gut. If you feel like your child has been misdiagnosed, get second and third opinions. If your child has BPD and has also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, find someone who specializes in bipolar disorder and get your child the right treatment. Not to diminish the skills and knowledge of professionals, but keep in mind that you know your child best. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1051))

- The good news is that treatment works! The bad news is that it generally takes six to twelve months to take effect. But when the person with BPD truly commits to recovery, the right treatment can help reduce the frequency and intensity of their symptoms, and perhaps eliminate some traits altogether. The more effort your child puts in, the more they will get out of treatment, and the fuller their recovery will be. BPD is like a chronic physical illness for which a person might need to deal with persistent symptoms. For example, for a person in recovery from BPD, the tendency to fear abandonment is still there, but it doesn’t necessarily lead to impulsive, reckless behavior. Through treatment, they learn to differentiate the fear of being abandoned—say triggered by a partner coming home late because they are enjoying time alone with their friends—from real abandonment, such as their partner breaking up with them.

- Unfortunately, this all takes time. Some medications take many weeks to work. It is vital that you only try one new medication of any type at a time, so you and your doctor know which drug is having which effect and possibly a side effect/s. If your child is taking any other drugs for a medical concern or for a co-occurring disorder, make sure all doctors are informed. Your child’s primary physician should have a complete list.

- Standardized Psychotherapies We’re going to talk about the first and most prevalent standardized therapy designed for BPD: dialectical behavior therapy. (We’ll also discuss cognitive behavioral therapy in a different context.) There are others, but they are more difficult to access. A “standardized” therapy is one that was developed specifically for a particular disorder, in this case BPD. Like fast food, a standardized therapy is the same program wherever it is offered. Dialectical Behavior Therapy Marsha Linehan, the psychologist who recovered from BPD herself partly through her personal involvement in Buddhism, developed dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Fundamental DBT concepts include: Patients must be motivated and willing to change. If your child doesn’t meet this criterion, it may be best to hold off on DBT because it is a lot of work, with therapy twice a week and homework in between. If your child is ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1135))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- unwilling to do the work, no therapy can overcome that. DBT is not inexpensive either, depending on your insurance, so you may want to make sure your child wants to change before committing major resources to their treatment. Radical acceptance, letting go of something you can’t control and accepting a situation for what it is instead of constantly wishing things were different, is essential to recovery. We’ll talk more about this in chapter 5. DBT clients attend individual therapy at least twice a week: a session with a personal therapist and a group skills-training session. Besides the skills acquired in the latter type of session, many people find the group sessions supportive and validating. DBT has four key skills modules: core mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal relationships (Linehan 2015). Core mindfulness: Mindfulness is being present in the now, paying attention to what’s going on around you (including your thoughts and feelings) without daydreaming or looking forward or backward. Mindfulness is beneficial for every family member, so we’ll talk about it more in the next chapter. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1144))

- Distress tolerance: Being able to sit with painful feelings without making things worse through the pain management behaviors we discussed in chapter 1. Emotional regulation: Managing negative and overwhelming emotions while increasing positive ones. This module has three components: understanding your emotions, reducing emotional vulnerability, and changing emotional responses. Interpersonal relationships: Getting along better with people. The goal here is to decrease interpersonal chaos, reduce the fear of abandonment, and encourage a positive outlook. This module also contains a lot of information about being assertive. You can find a DBT therapist in your state or region at https://www.behavioraltech.com. If you can’t find a DBT provider, look for a therapist who uses DBT principles and skills as part of their practice.

An American Psychological Association task force found that the relationship between a client and a therapist can be just as important as the treatment method in determining the client’s success (Norcross and Wampold 2011). However, this is not to say that the therapist should be a “friend” to your child. It is critical that the therapist make your child feel respected, validated, and understood while consistently practicing the types of boundaries that we want the child (or adult) to learn.

What are your views on the use of medications? How often will you see my child, and are you available after hours? How will you work with me as a parent? (This question is relevant if your child is a minor.) This is just a sampling of possible questions you can ask. Be sure to spend some time thinking about your child’s needs before making a call, so you’re well prepared on your quest to find a therapist or doctor who’s a good fit.

- Whether or not you tell your child, we don’t recommend making it commonly known among friends, acquaintances, and extended family because there is so much misunderstanding and stigma surrounding the disorder. Fictional characters in books and on TV and film who are portrayed as having BPD are not very realistic. However, you do need support! If you have a very close relative or friend who will not judge you, will be supportive, and is willing to listen to you talk about the intricacies of the disorder, feel free to make them part of your support team. Look for online support too (see appendix C). If you decide not to tell your child their diagnosis, you can explain how BPD affects them without using the term (see chapter 5). Pros of Disclosure It can be a relief to the person with BPD: One of the best reasons for letting a child know about their diagnosis is to avoid them finding out on their own.

Also, knowing about their diagnosis can reassure the person that what they have is a known entity, that other people have it, that they can get support from these people, and, most of all, that there is treatment. Sometimes not knowing what is wrong makes things worse—is that flutter in my chest indigestion or a heart attack? It can lead to companionship and learning: A great number of websites, self-help books, memoirs, blogs, documentaries, and YouTube videos exist about BPD—many from the point of view of the person with BPD. If your child is unaware of their diagnosis, they won’t be able to access these helpful resources. You won’t lie by omission: At some point, perhaps in adulthood, your child may learn they have BPD.

- BPD, because your child certainly will. There is a lot of depressing and stigmatizing information out there. That’s mostly because, in our experience, the majority of people with BPD don’t think anything’s wrong with them. They think their problems are someone else’s fault, and they project all their pain and self-loathing onto other people. Family members who are the target of this blame are traumatized, and some of them make no bones about it online because they’re angry about being the target of abuse, and they want to tell their stories. Psychiatric diagnoses are not fixed: Diagnostic resources like the ICD-11 and DSM-5 are routinely revised, and what we know about psychiatric disorders and their clusters of symptoms changes regularly. Thus a psychiatric diagnosis is not as stable as some medical diagnoses.

- Treatment works! But your child must be willing to work at therapy and be dedicated to making life worth living—including taking some accountability for their own misery. These attitudes are probably more important than the type of therapy you choose, because if a therapist doesn’t work out, your child will be motivated to try another. Sadly, you can’t control your child’s attitude, but you can influence it by not reinforcing unwanted behavior—a topic we’ll cover later. Although treatment works, it is not a cure. There is some debate about whether people can be cured of BPD. People’s symptoms can decrease to the point that they can live a normal life, work, and have happy relationships. And people can improve to the point that they no longer formally qualify for the BPD diagnosis. But as people with heart disease will always have to live a healthy lifestyle, people with BPD will need to be cautious about their triggers, have skills to use when things get dicey, have a support system in place, and most likely see a therapist. It’s vital to ask lots of questions about medications: what they do, what the side effects are, ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1399))

- and if they interact with other medications. Keep them locked up, and keep track of how your child is doing while taking them. When selecting any kind of treatment, trust your gut. If you don’t like the therapist you chose, choose another. If you have an inkling that you may need a hospital or residential treatment center, start your research now. Don’t wait until there’s a crisis. If your child needs an RTC or hospitalization, that doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent. It means your child’s BPD is more severe. You are even allowed to be relieved at getting a break from your child. Remember, once your child turns eighteen you no longer have any control over whether they seek therapy or what happens if they do seek treatment. You can only make therapy and treatment a requirement if they want something from you, such as housing, but if they’re not working at it, you may be wasting time and money.

- the techniques you’ll find in all the other chapters. While some who are parenting kids with BPD can hold it together (the more educated on BPD they are, the better off they are), far too many are treading water or drowning in the deep end of the pool. Some find themselves suicidal at some point, whereas others have given so much to their child that they literally have nothing left to give and no longer desire to be in contact with their adult child. If you’ve ever flown on an airplane, then you know that in the case of an emergency, you’re directed to put your oxygen mask on before helping others. Have you ever wondered why? Because if you help others first, you’re likely to run out of oxygen—and find yourself unable to help anyone, let alone yourself. Parenting a child with BPD is a lot like that. In this case, administering oxygen to yourself means taking some me time so you can replenish yourself before you’ve given everything you’ve got and passed out.

- Stress Stress is your constant companion when you have a child with BPD, either because something just happened, something is happening now, or you know something—God knows what—will happen in the future. When you experience acute stress—that is, you see a prowler or a bear—chemicals flood your body to prepare you for fight or flight (the “stress response”).

- The stress response is supposed to be temporary. Once you’ve fought off or run away from the bear or prowler, it’s supposed to dissipate. But when your child has BPD, every day is a “God knows what crisis will happen today” kind of day. You’re hyperalert and feel like you’re walking on eggshells. You’re living in a perpetual stress-response state. When stress-response chemicals like cortisol are constantly in your bloodstream, they can cause or exacerbate stress-related illnesses like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, immune system suppression, headaches, back and neck pain, sleep problems, and more. As with trauma, the signs of stress come in two varieties: physical and mental. You’re probably familiar with these (American Institute of Stress 2019).

- What is radical acceptance? It’s accepting something so deeply that you feel it in your little toes. Marsha Linehan, the researcher who created dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), looked closely at how people react to misfortune and categorized their responses into four general types (1993): Trying to change the circumstances. For example, let’s say your child has tickets to a great concert but has to work that night. The first thing they would try to do is switch shifts with someone else or get the night off—that is, change the circumstances. Trying to change emotions about the circumstances. If they can’t switch shifts or get the night off, they can think about all the money they’ll make that night working. Your child decides there’s no use fretting about something they can’t change and downloads a bunch of new music instead. Continuing to be miserable. Your child complains about the situation to anyone who will listen for two weeks after the concert. They remember this incident as one of the worst things that happened in their life ever. Accepting the circumstances without judging them. Your child can’t go. They wish they ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1602))

- could, but there’s really no way to tell what might have changed in their life if they had gone. For all they know, they could have gotten wasted, driven home in a drunk friend’s car, and crashed. There will be other bands and other concerts. This isn’t going to ruin their life. You’ve probably heard that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, radical acceptance comes when you stop banging your head against the wall because your hopes and reality refuse to intersect.

A “catfish” is a person who creates fake profiles on social media sites with the intention of luring unsuspecting “hopefuls” into falling in love with them. In each episode the show’s hosts investigate—at the behest of a hopeful—the catfish to determine whether or not the person is real. In almost all of the episodes, the hopeful ends up crushed by the truth and cries when they find out that the photos—and the phantom internet person—they’ve told “I love you” to is a fake who has been deliberately fooling them.

At first, they’re angry at the catfish. But eventually they come out of their trance and wonder why they fell for the lies.

- Radical acceptance comes when you can look at the situation, not through the hopeful’s eyes, but through those of an unbiased onlooker who can assess it, including the history that led up to it, and see it for what it is. Once you can radically accept the truth, you can take the proper action. The truth: Your daughter has BPD, at least for now. Don’t expect her to always act in ways that seem logical to you, any more than you would expect your two-year-old to put together a bookcase. The upshot: You’re going to have to quit denying reality and learn how to parent a child with BPD. Without radical acceptance, you wouldn’t educate yourself about the disorder.

- The truth: Your son says he will move out, but he hasn’t in a year. It may have something to do with his free room and board, not to mention the cleaning and laundry service. The truth is, your son is not going to move out because he gets free room and board plus all his freedom, and if he moved out he would have to pick up after himself. The upshot: It’s your house, so you make the rules. Charge for room and board, and don’t provide free laundry and cleaning services. If you hadn’t radically accepted the truth, your son would live in your home until it came time to bury you. Fighting and railing against a painful reality actually causes more suffering than just accepting the undesirable reality. In other words, suffering is an emotion that we, ourselves, layer on top of our pain. If we accept an unwanted reality, no matter how unwanted it is, we can avoid suffering. That’s radical acceptance. Pain is unavoidable. Suffering is optional. When we resist radical acceptance, we stay miserable.

Radically accepting that that’s the way she deals with conflict has freed me from being constantly disappointed that she doesn’t act differently. When I practice radical acceptance, I am saying, “I am not going to suffer because of what has occurred.” It helps you stop feeling like a victim. You might wonder, How can I radically accept my truth? How do I radically accept a daughter who repeatedly self-harms and threatens suicide? The same way that we learn to accept everything else.

Destiny: I learned that learning how to practice radical acceptance was like learning anxiety-busting techniques. It was relatively easy to learn the nuts and bolts of how to do it, but it was far more difficult to master it. It took a lot of practice to really get the hang of it, but once I got there, I knew I never wanted to go back to my old way of being. It definitely felt strange and foreign at first. I just had to remember that it was all about acknowledging my current reality. Today I see radical acceptance as going hand in hand with mindfulness, being in the moment and being present where I am. You can’t radically accept everything all at once. You have to start with the small things. Picture radical acceptance as a highway with lots of exits. You try to stay on the highway, but then you feel nonacceptance and you take an exit and feel grief, anger, or some other emotion.

- Additional Coping Techniques Besides the three main measures we just covered, there are many other techniques you can practice to cope with stress, grief, and trauma. We only have room to explain two: mindfulness meditation and self-compassion. We chose the former because it is backed up by a lot of research, and parents regularly mention it as being a useful coping tool. We chose the latter because you can’t have compassion for your imperfect child if you don’t have compassion for yourself as an imperfect being. Mindfulness Meditation Mindfulness is awareness without judgment. It involves becoming aware of your emotions, your physical sensations, and what you are currently doing in the present, while at the same time, withholding all judgment. The opposite of mindfulness is often called… ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1693))

- Let’s try a loving-kindness meditation, which is a timeless way to practice mindfulness. This script is based on a meditation by Buddhist monk and mindfulness teacher Jack Kornfield (2008). Sit in your chair in a quiet, private place and belly breathe. Take deep breaths from your diaphragm in and out. Focus on the present moment and let everything else fall away: your burdens, problems, and so forth. Imagine sunshine flowing down like honey through the top of your head, continuing down through your facial muscles and neck, relaxing each part of your body down to your toes. Close your eyes. Call up the face of someone alive or dead whom you love or loved. Call up that love and compassion and let it flow through you. Imagine that person right beside you, sending their love. Repeat in your head, May you be filled with loving-kindness. ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1735))

- May you be well in body, heart, and mind. May you be at ease and happy. (You get the idea. You can write your own script if you prefer.) Now call up a picture of yourself, the competent and confident adult who can handle what’s thrown at you. Repeat the phrases: May I be filled with loving-kindness. May I be well in body, heart, and mind. May I be at ease and happy. (Some parents find it hard to wish themselves compassion. If you have a hard time, start small. Wish yourself a good day at first and go a little further each day.) Think of your child and repeat the phrases using their name. Think of someone else, repeating the phrases with their name. If you feel bold, try this step while thinking of someone you don’t like. Wish them well. You may very well feel better afterward. Open your eyes and come back down to earth. Do this meditation once a day and keep track of your moods in a journal to see if it’s helping. You might be surprised. I heartily recommend that you practice some form of meditation daily for at least five minutes. Meditation can improve your outlook tremendously.

- Research has shown that mindfulness meditation reduces rumination (obsessively thinking about something), boosts working memory, improves focus, makes us less emotionally sensitive, allows us to think more flexibly, and helps our relationships be more satisfying (Davis and Hayes 2012). It is also commonly reported to reduce stress, insomnia, anxiety, pain, depression, and high blood pressure. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1754))

- When you think you’ve made a mistake, do you have an inner critic who bullies you? Most people have an inner critic who lives in the back of their mind and says things like, See, you can’t do it, or You’re stupid, or You’ll never get what you want. Would you believe that ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1763))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- your inner critic can do the same amount of harm to you as someone else saying it to you? It’s true. The essence of self-compassion is treating yourself like you would treat a good friend who is experiencing a problematic situation (Neff 2011). Self-compassion turns that inner critic on its head. When we practice self-compassion, we tell ourselves that no one is perfect, to be gentle with ourselves, and that not everyone gets what they want—but it’s not their fault. A self-compassionate person understands that there are times everyone feels like they’re not good enough, and that’s part of the human experience. If you can’t accept your own imperfections, how can you accept the imperfections of those around you—especially your child? Not only that, but the inner critic also does not motivate us to perform better. It tears us down in the same way it would if someone else said those unfair, accusing things to us (Neff 2011). Even if it’s difficult at first, cultivate self-compassion. Because you’re raising a kid with BPD, you likely already have more compassion than most people. All you have to do is turn it toward yourself. ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1765))

- Top Takeaways from This Chapter We covered some crucial topics for self-care in this chapter. Parents who are raising a child with BPD often overlook how important it is for them to take care of themselves. If they don’t, their journey will be a lot more difficult than it has to be. Here are some key points to take forward with you: You need to help yourself before you can help your child. Sometimes you are the priority. Otherwise, you’re no good for your child. When you accept what can’t be changed, and that things are as they are, you’re freed up to start changing the situation or yourself in relation to it. This frees up much time and energy for you to start taking care of yourself. Trauma, grief, and stress are likely three large issues you’ll need to deal with as the parent of ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1781))

- a child with BPD. Seeing a therapist, practicing radical acceptance, and grieving your losses will help you deal with them. Over time the loving-kindness meditation (and mindfulness meditation in general) will become your new best friend that will be with you on your journey. Be as compassionate with yourself as you would be with a close friend going through a similar problem. Treat yourself with the same kindness you treat others with.

- Like alcoholism, a personality disorder is a family disease. With an alcoholic, everything revolves around them and their drinking. When someone in the family has BPD, everything revolves around their moods, desires, behaviors, and so forth. When our daughter moved out, suddenly there was more room in the house. It was strange to be in the living room just to relax or watch TV. When she was here, all our energy had been spent trying not to set her off—who sat where at the table, who showered in what order, and even road trips all revolved around her idiosyncrasies. Studies have found that family members (mostly parents) of people with BPD experience the following problems (Kay et al. 2018): ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1796))

- The burdens for family members are very real. For example, clinical psychologist Kristalyn Salters-Pedneault points out that clinicians rely heavily on family members to help manage the person with BPD (2020a). Family members organize the treatment schedule (with its many clinicians and different levels of care), keep track of how the disorder is affecting their loved one from day to day, and help the child with BPD take medications and get to therapist appointments on time. This takes its toll on the entire family, not just one caregiver, causing a great deal of stress and even trauma. Watching a family member in pain, having suicidal feelings or actually making a suicide attempt, threatening to harm themselves or actually harming themselves, and destroying objects or the house itself is another source of stress and trauma. Salters-Pedneault reports that watching high-risk activities such as these can cause very severe psychological trauma (2020a). We concur; many parents we’ve worked with and encountered believe they… ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1817))

Even if you think it’s not important or you’re too busy, pick a self-care technique we went over or find another one and put it in your daily schedule.

- It may sound like heresy to suggest that you should try to be happy when your child with BPD is not happy, but you should. Jumping on the roller coaster with your child will not make you a better parent. It will make you a worse parent. Their upset is catching, so you have to make an extra effort to not let their emotions affect you. Just because they’re angry or sad or elated doesn’t mean you have to be as well. Your job is to model balanced emotions—and to be happy, to be there for your other children, and to work on your marriage (and we mean doing something other than talking about your child with BPD). You still need to have a fulfilling life, regardless of the BPD that’s in it.

- As one might expect, growing up with a sibling with BPD is not easy. Your other children are experiencing the same behavior as you are, but without any perspective or adult coping skills.

- They may feel survivor’s guilt. Your child with BPD may have negative reactions to the success or celebration of their siblings, which can cause non-disordered siblings to feel guilty. It’s important for you to stress that they have nothing to feel guilty about, and that their BPD sibling’s feelings are not their responsibility. Make sure you celebrate your other children’s successes; don’t inadvertently deprive them of their need to be recognized for their own achievements in an effort to keep the peace. This may take some creativity. Beware of “splitting.” Children with BPD sometimes try to “split” their siblings. One sibling is all good and becomes the trauma-bonded secret keeper, whereas another sibling is all bad and becomes the sabotaged target of their angst. Sometimes the child with BPD will split the same sibling and vacillate between the two projections.

- Don’t get involved in adult sibling arguments. It is important to transition to a neutral position in the family once your children are adults. When they were children, you were the referee and the peacemaker. If you play these roles with them as adults, you’ll be seen as taking sides. If they come to you with complaints or problems about one another, maintain a neutral, empathetic, and appropriately validating position with all of them. Instead of rescuing or mediating, redirect them to other resources (therapists, DBT skills, books on BPD and boundaries, support groups, and so forth) that can help them deal with the issue on their own. They will learn valuable ([Location 1949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=1949))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- and much-needed skills, and you will remain a safe person for all of them. Also stay neutral on the outcome of any argument. Don’t pressure your adult children to maintain a relationship. If you’re unable to have a healthy relationship with your child with BPD, it’s likely your other children won’t be able to either. They need the freedom to take care of themselves, and any pressure from you (explicit or implied) will teach them that they should maintain relationships with people who might be abusive. You may have a lot of reasons to keep your family together, but it’s not your other children’s responsibility to make that happen at a cost to their own well-being. Don’t vent your frustrations or fears on your children—at any age. Only talk to your adult children about their BPD sibling if they bring them up, and keep the conversation validating but neutral. Don’t deny or cover things up, but don’t volunteer things that will only cause them more worry or create problems between them and their sibling. Regardless of the quality of their relationship with their BPD sibling, your other children are likely losing sleep over them also.

- Talking about BPD with your child poses challenges. For starters, using the phrase “borderline personality disorder” may make them feel labeled, which can complicate how they view themselves and their potential for recovery. However, there is merit in discussing behavioral aspects of your child’s BPD and pairing them with consequences. For example, “When you yell at people, they back away from you, and then you end up feeling abandoned. If you don’t want to feel abandoned, you might stop yelling at people.” Here’s a script to consider that explains BPD symptoms without using the actual diagnosis terminology. You can also use it to explain your child’s behavior to siblings. Everyone’s brain is wired a little differently. Some people are more intense than others. Your [your sibling’s] feelings are more intense than most people’s. Everyone has a different way of looking at things. It’s like some people have an Apple operating system and some a PC.

For example, your child will probably see themselves as the victim most of the time and you as the persecutor, whereas you may see it the other way around. The persecutor is the supposed villain. They are perceived as being angry, critical, controlling, and rigid. They have the attitude of “It’s all your fault.” Their role is to blame and criticize the victim.

- example, your child may see you as the persecutor when you don’t give them what they want. The victim usually imbibes the stance of “Poor me.” Most of the time, they see themselves as hopelessly and helplessly lost and powerless. They convince themselves there is nothing they can do. Because they don’t take actions to respond to life’s daily challenges, they don’t believe they bear any responsibility or accountability. The rescuer offers help to the victim, trying to make them happy by not letting them experience the consequences of their actions. This is a form of enabling. For example, a parent in this role may give money to a child who spent all they had on beer but needs to make a car payment. Usually the rescuer has only the best intentions. They don’t want to see the victim suffer. However, the rescuer keeps the victim dependent while giving them an excuse to fail. Not every conflict will result in a drama triangle, but it’s good to understand how the dynamic plays out. Let’s look at a highly simplified example.

Not only all the things I mentioned in this chapter, but also finances, taking the child to appointments, finding doctors, filling prescriptions, managing medications, keeping track of limits and observing them, using new communication techniques (chapter 7), learning more about BPD in general, and making decisions. If you are a mother who wants your husband to be more involved, show him appendix A. Realize you are a person under much stress, and take care of yourself. Treat yourself as you would treat a friend going through the same thing. If your child broke their leg, family and friends would show much concern. They might even send cards and flowers.

Remember that it’s not your fault your child has BPD, and it isn’t your child’s fault either. Reach out and ask for help. You will be a better parent if you don’t match your emotions with your child’s, letting them go up and down. Your role is to stay calm, steady, and good-natured for the sake of the rest of the family, especially siblings. I’m not saying you should repress your feelings, which you should know from the last chapter. I’m saying it’s okay to be happy. Self-care will be a vital part of you accomplishing this balanced nature. Speaking of siblings, they are just as affected by your child with BPD as you are, only as children, they don’t have a mature brain or the experience that can help them handle it. Remember to make time for them and to be attentive to their needs. ([Location 2105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2105))

- Learning new ways of communicating with your child is key to your relationship with them. Communication is the biggest arena in which relating “happens,” and when it goes wrong, explosions can happen and the relationship goes south. When communication goes well, the relationship improves. With most communication, you just say what you want without too much thought. You can’t do that with people who have BPD. When you speak, you need to think through how you want to initiate a conversation or respond to your child. In this chapter, we’re going to discuss these helpful communication tools, and one “tool” you shouldn’t use: Validation: How to make your child feel heard and understood.

- 1. Be aware of your voice inflection, facial expressions, and body language. When body language and verbal communication don’t match, nonverbal communication takes precedence in the mind of the listener—and this is all the more true for people with BPD. For example, if your voice sounds happy but you’re frowning and your arms are crossed, the listener is going to think you’re upset—regardless of what you’re saying. A simple phrase like “Could you clean your room today?” could have a multitude of connotations depending upon how it is said. Don’t cross your arms. Don’t stand if the other person is sitting. Have a relaxed posture and a neutral or leaning-toward-positive facial expression. 2. Stay focused on your message. While you’re talking, your child may try to change the subject. That’s a sign that the issues you two are experiencing are not related to what you’re fighting about, but about the fact that you’re fighting. Your child is probably hurting for some reason and taking it out on you, probably because you’re a safe place… ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2142))

- emotions is like trying to do a math problem while waiting for news about a cancer biopsy. Keep sentences short, simple, clear, and direct. Leave no room for misinterpretation. 4. Have a mutual “take a break” signal. When one or both of you are feeling overloaded, or it appears that the conversation may escalate out of control, stop the cycle of conflict by signaling that you want to take a break. In our experience, once your child reaches an emotional high of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, they can no longer reason. Either person can signal that a break is a good idea. You can agree on a verbal or nonverbal signal. My husband and I have a code word: “banana.” Chen: My child turned on me the instant I said no to something. I suggested a time out: “Let’s speak when I have time to think about things.” “Why do you need to think about things?” she responded. “Because I like to pause a bit these days,” I explained.… ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2153))

- light of day, they are able to better understand themselves. 5. Stay away from black-and-white thinking and the word “but.” Minimize your use of words like “always” and “never.” Avoid “but” altogether. Use “both” or “and” instead. For example, if you say, “I appreciate that you got all Bs, but you failed English,” the “but” extinguishes the compliment. Try, “I appreciate that you got all Bs. That’s really great. I’m so proud of you! I see you also got an F in English. What happened there?” 6. Make “I” Statements. When responding, describe what happened, then, using the word “I” instead of “you,” tell the person how what they did made you feel. These are called “I statements.” So rather than saying, “You are a selfish person for eating all the peanuts,” say, “When I went looking for the peanuts, they weren’t there. I was really disappointed to find they were all gone. I had really been looking forward to eating them.” This… ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2164))

Belly Breathing When you’re going to have a difficult conversation with your child, the first thing you’ll want to do is soothe yourself and your own emotions. Before you say anything, belly breathe a few times. “Belly breathing,” or diaphragmatic breathing, is an all-purpose tool, like a multitool pocketknife. You can belly breathe when you’re anxious, stressed, needing to sleep, meditating, in the car, or in need of a break from a stressful day. Find a comfortable position, either lying on your back or sitting. Place one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. Imagine your stomach is a balloon, and sip in air so that your belly button rises toward the ceiling or the wall you’re facing. Then let the air out. Take a few breaths as you normally would. Your belly should rise and fall with every breath in (inhale) and every breath out (exhale). Then repeat the process. Do this for as long as… ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2176))

When you’re having a disagreement with your spouse, belly breathe. Then you’ll be prepared during a BPD crisis. Validation Validation involves listening to your child’s emotions while being fully present, reflecting the emotions back in your own words, and asking questions to make sure you fully understand their internal experiences. When you validate your child’s emotions (feelings, not thoughts or actions), you not only radically accept the emotions, but also your child. You are saying, I understand you have this very powerful feeling. This must be very difficult for you. And perhaps, if true, if I were in your position, I would feel that way too.

- depths of their pain or the degree of worthlessness they feel. Invalidating remarks make your child feel invisible, misunderstood, unappreciated, and unloved. Validation When You Don’t Agree You don’t have to agree with a person’s thoughts or actions in order to validate them. To validate someone’s experience of an incident doesn’t mean you’d feel the same way if the same thing happened to you. Validation means listening to your child’s emotions (both those displayed and discussed) while being fully present with them, reflecting the emotions back in your own words, recognizing that their emotions are real to them, and saying that it’s okay for them to feel the way they do. You may not agree that your child should feel the way they do, especially when it’s about you, but they do, and feelings don’t have IQs. Reach across your reality and grasp their hand in comfort, because they have a disorder and can’t come to your reality without treatment.

- “I care about your feelings, and I want to talk with you about your concerns. However, I don’t feel comfortable doing that until things are calmer.” Notice I didn’t say, “When you stop shouting.” Your child will take finger pointing as a challenge, and your goal is to end the conversation and let things cool down. You might also try saying, “Let’s touch back with each other in an hour. I can hear about your concerns and feelings then.” The Three Steps of Validation To simplify things, try these three steps for practicing validation with your child (Manning 2011). Step 1. Be present and listen with your whole body. Give your child your full attention and be mindful of your body language. Sit if they’re sitting; stand if they’re standing. Be aware of the expression on your face; it should show care and concern. As you listen, it is critical that you withhold any judgments.

Consider whether you might feel the same way. If you would, say so. If you wouldn’t, but you know this event or situation would upset your child, you can say, “I can see this is just the kind of thing that would really upset you.” (This is always true.) The key is to find a way to say that your child’s behavior makes sense without pathologizing them or making them sound defective.

- Common Validation Mistakes As you try out validation techniques from this chapter, watch out for the following common mistakes. Leaping into problem solving. It is almost irresistible for parents to start solving their child’s problem. Unless they say so, that’s not what they need from you. First, you’re not validating, and second, it implies that your child can’t solve their own problems. If you have a tendency to do this, pay less attention to the situation they’re talking about (for validation purposes, it doesn’t matter) and listen closely for their emotions, expressed or unexpressed. Not talking about their child’s emotions. Many parents miss the point of validation entirely and skip right to responding. When validating, forget about the exact situation. Imagine yourself as a detective searching for just the right emotions your child is having. Search online using the search phrase “list of feelings and emotions.” ([Location 2325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2325))

- That will help you rephrase what your child says so you’re not using the same words all the time. Thinking they have to “validate” things they don’t agree with. Again, validation has nothing to do with thoughts, opinions, and behaviors. Validation is about your child’s inner reality, not the empirical truth. Getting emotionally triggered and adding that emotion to the conversation. Sometimes your child is going to be angry or upset with you. It takes practice to respond to your child’s emotions instead of explaining, defending yourself, or correcting their assumptions. If your child is off base and says something like, “You don’t love me,” or “You’re never there for me,” try saying, “If I thought that were true, I would be very [emotion] too.” You will have time to correct their impressions later, such as saying, “I do love you.” When you contradict your child, it comes off as invalidating. It is as if you are saying that they have no right to their feelings. For an easy rule, just remember to use the phrase “If that were true…” Not using the right tone of voice. Be careful not to sound too mechanical, even though validation can be hard at times. You want to sound concerned and caring, even when your child upsets you. Sometimes that will be difficult. Practice. ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2334))

- Your child communicates with you using both form and content. “Content” comprises the words they’re speaking (for example, “Can I go out with my friends?”). “Form” is how politely and respectfully they speak to you (for example, not shouting, swearing, or name calling). When a child is talking to you with unacceptable form, ignore the content and say, “When you’re ready to discuss this in a calm tone of voice, we’ll talk.” If your child continues to act abusively, go to another room, go outside, drive away, or, if this happens all the time and your child is an adult who is very toxic, you could get a restraining order. These same guidelines apply to conversations over the phone. If you employ these methods continually without backing down, your child will be forced to vary their tone when they want or need something. (We’re going to talk about limits in chapter 9.) Keep in mind that when it comes to communicating with your child, form always trumps content (2018). ([Location 2630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2630))

- We covered several helpful techniques in this chapter that can help you better communicate with your child with BPD. Remember, communication is where the relationship “happens.” Study these communication methods until you have them down pat. You can’t look at a book in the middle of a conversation, so practice in advance with someone you trust. With your child, start with a mild situation before moving on to a more complex one. When in doubt, or when things get heated, validate. You really can’t do this too much. If validation were a word, it would be nearly as common as the word “the.” When you need to make a point, use SET-UP. That should be your next most common tool. When you really need to make an important point (and probably need some action taken or not taken), use BIFF. Finally, don’t JADE. Here are some other key takeaways from this chapter to keep in mind as you continue on: Practice good communication skills. Don’t invalidate your child. It’s worse than doing nothing.

- Stay focused on your message. Repeat yourself if necessary. Use the “broken record” technique—repeating yourself over and over again. It’s always “form before content.” Tell them you will listen to them when they can discuss the matter in a calm way. If your child gets away with yelling at you, they may increase the frequency and intensity of these behaviors.

- This story illustrates a key concept one must understand before they can become BPD-savvy parents. We call it “feeding the monster.” Pat and Joe have become experts at “feeding the monster,” which is the exact wrong way to parent a child with BPD. It’s important to be clear that the “monster” is BPD itself, not the child. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2670))

- Children with BPD often tell their parents that they are bad parents. This is because the child holds the parent responsible for their happiness. Associated feelings of guilt often cause the parents to give in to their child against their better judgment. Or sometimes the parents give in because they are worn down by extensive conflict and mistreatment. Capitulating to the unreasonable demands of a child’s BPD—or feeding the monster—only causes the disorder to grow (2018). How can you tell if you’ve been feeding the monster? Parents who feed the monster tend to have kids who exhibit the following characteristics: Short tempers: This trait develops because parents don’t let their child experience frustration by waiting for something. When they demand an answer right away or want something now, make them wait until it is convenient for you. This teaches them frustration tolerance. Unusually aggressive: This characteristic develops because temper tantrums or rages in the past have gotten your child what they want. Remember the “form before content” rule. An aggressive approach (anger, tantrums) should never result in your child getting their way. ([Location 2675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2675))

- Little empathy: This characteristic develops because your child has never had to consider anyone else’s feelings. For example, in the opening story, Amy doesn’t consider her brother’s feelings and the fact that it’s his turn to choose an activity. It’s up to you to stick to your limits and explain what it’s like to be in another person’s shoes. Self-absorbed: This characteristic develops because your child has been allowed to always be the center of attention. Don’t let your child hijack other people’s celebrations (birthdays, weddings) and don’t overreact to their bids for attention when they’ve done so in a negative way. For example, don’t make a really big deal out of your child wearing inappropriate clothing to school. Discuss what is proper, but don’t make what they’ve done a crisis because they’re likely doing it to provoke you. Pay more attention to your child when they are acting in a neutral or positive way, which reinforces those behaviors. Vulnerable: Your child is more fragile and more vulnerable to self-loathing and self-harm. This characteristic develops because they haven’t had the opportunity to develop coping mechanisms… ([Location 2688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2688))

- because they are so skilled at getting other people to do things for them that they can’t do it on their own. When the child with BPD sees that abusive or toxic behavior is successful in getting what they want, they will use the method more often. This is the basic behavioral principle of positive reinforcement. In other words, the parents positively reinforce the behavior by giving in, which increases the frequency of the behaviors (tantrums, whining, pleading, rages). When you give in to your child’s hurtful behavior, you greatly increase the chances that your child will use this behavior in the future as a primary tool to get their way. But that’s not the whole problem. The behavior will become more hurtful over time, while the parents’ will to resist feeding the monster (BPD) will diminish. This downward spiral leaves parents feeling more and more helpless and hopeless, and ever closer to the breaking point when they no longer wish to spend time with their child, because everything associated with them is extremely painful. There are four main techniques you can use to avoid feeding… ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2702))

- die. That may sound dramatic, but it’s true. Most children like feeling more and more independent as they grow older. But when you suggest to a child with BPD that they do something for themselves, they feel as if they’re being pushed out of the nest only to fall thirty feet onto a flatbed truck full of manure. So they may complain, act like a victim, rage, tell you that you’re a “bad parent,” or otherwise mistreat you. All they know is that your request makes them feel bad, hence you must have caused it. Of course, that isn’t true: you’ve triggered their fear of abandonment and rejection. The disorder caused this fear; you were merely the trigger and designated target of your child’s emotions. So don’t take it personally. If your child reacts negatively to you suggesting that they do something themselves, you’re doing the right thing. Parents should be able to guide their children in such a way that they’re increasingly able to figure out how to be responsible for their life, and then gradually give them greater freedom as they prove they can handle greater responsibility (while still being able to ask for help). For example, if a teen is able to stick to the amount of screen time they’re allotted, the parent can be more flexible when they need an extra thirty minutes for whatever reason.

- A prime characteristic of a BPD-savvy parent is that they don’t depend on their child with BPD for their feelings of self-worth—as either people or parents. Children with BPD have unstable perceptions of themselves (identity problems). When other people (particularly their parents) meet their needs, they see themselves as lovable. When other people don’t meet their needs, they feel self-loathing. If you let your child’s binary feelings about you affect how you feel about yourself, you will say yes to everything—even if it’s bad for your child. You’ll become an enabler and thus feed the monster. The same is true for emotional blackmail. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2745))

- Emotional blackmail is a powerful form of manipulation in which people close to us threaten, either directly or indirectly, to punish us if we don’t do what they want. Many people with expertise in BPD would say that people with the disorder never manipulate; rather, they’re only doing their best to survive. It is tough to separate your child from the disorder when they apply emotional blackmail. Whatever the circumstances in your child’s life, often they are experienced as a life-or-death struggle. So your child will pull out the big guns, a combination that Susan Forward terms FOG: fear, obligation, and guilt (1997). These are the tools of the emotional blackmailer, just as paint and brushes are the tools of the painter. The FOG can drift in, making everything cloudy, confusing you, and leading you to feed the monster. Your child may emotionally blackmail you purposely or unconsciously.

When you run out of feed, they greedily sniff your pockets and lick your hand until the next person with food comes along. The animals have been positively reinforced to run up to people, something the animal probably wouldn’t do in its natural environment. That very principle of positive reinforcement is at work when you feed the monster. Your child wants more, and they run to the person who has something to offer. Over and over again they will perform the behavior that got them what they wanted in the past.

If you’re a BPD-savvy parent, you’ll positively reinforce desired behavior, such as getting good grades and setting the table, and not having a meltdown or punching a hole in the wall. Both you and your child will come out winners. Here are some other key takeaways from this chapter to keep in mind: You need to learn to forgive yourself. Carrying guilt about things that you can’t control or that happened in the past is inhibiting your good parenting, not helping it. You and your child are on opposite sides of the autonomy and independence issues: you want them to develop those two attributes, whereas they see your efforts to instill these qualities as you abandoning or rejecting them. This dynamic makes it harder to not feed the monster with enabling or emotional blackmail. Reassure them in other ways, such as through validation and by spending time together, among others. Even though your child was scared of going to first grade, and you weren’t happy about being apart from them, you still made them go because you had their long-term well-being at stake. You knew that this was a crucial first step in your child gaining independence. Toeing ([Location 2960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=2960))

With this one act, you destroy the whole program. So set rules you can and will enforce Talk with your child about your limits and the rewards and consequences for adhering to them. Make a written plan together. Catch your child doing something positive and praise them. Everybody does something right once in a while. When you praise good behavior, you’ll get more of it. Expect your child of any age to test your limits, such as not complying with your rules or acting especially annoying, often to see what you will do in response.

- No amount of validation is too much. Remember, you’re validating their feelings, not their thoughts or actions. Combine validation with limits. If you believe your preteen has BPD traits, or if they’ve been diagnosed, fight for your child to get the right treatment and the right schooling. Do it now while the pathways in their brain are still developing. No one else will do it. If you act now, you’ll save yourself and your child a lot of trouble as they mature and become an adult. Remember that your preteen has no idea that they think, emote, and (to a certain extent) behave differently than people who don’t have BPD. They can’t differentiate between themselves and the disorder. They have never experienced any other life, and how they act and feel comes naturally to them because of their disorder. People with BPD have a difficult time empathizing with others because BPD is all they know, and it’s all consuming. If your preteen doesn’t understand how to get along with people, help them put themselves in the other person’s shoes. Ask them how they would feel if something similar happened to them.

- At this age, humor and distraction are good tools for when things go wonky. Also, you are the primary role model for your preteen. Take it seriously, because they’re always listening, watching, and learning. Consider encouraging your child to join a sports team. Group activities can offer many opportunities for preteens to learn how to interact with others, how to lose, and how to deal with frustration. Some people, even those close to you, will offer unsolicited advice. If your child acts badly, it must be the parent’s fault, right? Wrong. If the advice giver is a stranger, forget about them. If they’re someone you care about, show them this book. In short, simple terms, learn how to explain to others how BPD affects your child. You will need to explain it to teachers, doctors, and many others. You may choose to avoid using the words “borderline personality disorder.” Perhaps, “My daughter is going through a difficult period right now in which her emotions overwhelm her ability to think logically. Those heightened feelings make her act in extreme ways. We are looking for treatment to help her.” ([Location 3619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=3619))

- Top Takeaways from This Chapter In this chapter we discussed some of the unique challenges that come with parenting a teen with BPD, including those surrounding sexual promiscuity and social media usage.

- their mind. Always remember that, for your child, feelings equal facts. Parenting a teen is hard. Parenting a teen with BPD takes a village. Fortunately, it only lasts for a maximum of seven years. That may seem like a long time. If you’ve been able to do the groundwork laid out in this book, you’ll have an easier time. If your child is already a teen, it’s never too late to engage the protocols described in this book. Teens with BPD have the same problems other teens do—but their problems are on steroids. Whatever you do, don’t take their behavior personally. Remember when you were a teen? It’s usually uncomfortable to have “the talk” about sex, but sex is a common way for teens to deal with pain, emptiness, feelings of worthlessness, and so on. And they can start having sex very early. Pain makes people do things they wouldn’t ordinarily do. If you can, monitor your child’s social media accounts. If they have abused them, make this a requirement. If their feed looks too mild, they may be using an alias and another account with their friends. There are parental controls you can use, and you can also require them to keep their computer in a public place. Abuse of this policy, as always, should result in natural consequences, such as losing access to their accounts for a certain period of time or something similar. Notice your kids being good and let them know that you noticed. Rewards can be as simple as a smile and a touch to show appreciation.

- recommendation is to read one of my other books: Stop Walking on Eggshells, The Essential Family Guide to Borderline Personality Disorder, or The Stop Walking on Eggshells Workbook. The number-one problem most parents of adult children with BPD tell me is that they are frustrated that their adult child wants to stay at home and take advantage of free food, board, and maid service. If this sounds like your adult child, that is a sign that either they are simply low functioning, or that their disorder has been fed time and time again, and now they don’t know how to cope on their own. Your child may not be appreciative of this privilege, and if you let them, they’ll make messes, take the car, have unruly friends over, disobey rules, and otherwise make themselves hard to live with. Whether they live with you or not, parents tell us that their adult children with BPD behave aggressively, rely on drugs and alcohol to anesthetize their ups and downs, don’t take adequate care of their children, quit job after job (or get fired), and pressure their parents to perform basic parenting jobs, such as cleaning up after grandchildren and supporting them financially. Their kids refuse to further their education, get a job, go to treatment, or grow up. ([Location 3931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=3931))

- If you are ever to have peace, your own life, and freedom—and yes, you deserve them—you need to develop the skills and fortitude to radically accept what you can’t change (chapter 5); overcome fear, obligation, and guilt (chapter 8); set limits and observe them (chapter 9); reset your expectations; cherish but disengage (later in this chapter); and, sometimes, have no contact with your child (the main topic of this chapter). The good news is it’s never too late to teach these lessons of accountability and independence, and you can teach an adult child a little faster than you can a preteen or adolescent.

- It sounds negative to say that you should lower your expectations of your adult child, but it’s something that millions of parents need to do when they have a child with a severe mental or physical disability. At first doing so will be disappointing. But giving up the ghost of what could have been and living with your child in the here and now helps enormously. You’ll just be celebrating new goals, and your adult child may make you just as proud. We’re not saying you should have no expectations, but rather to consider realistically what your child may be able to achieve. For example, perhaps you wanted your child to have a career, but instead you need to focus on the far more realistic goal of your child having a job, which is still a good goal. Maybe you assumed your child would go to college, whereas graduating from high school or getting a high school equivalency diploma is a positive goal that your child can actually achieve. When they do achieve these changed objectives, you will be just as happy. The following table provides some other examples of changed expectations.

- It’s not easy giving up on your imagined child, because it may seem like everyone else’s children are successful doctors or high-powered attorneys, whereas your child barely made it through high school and struggles to hold a job—if they have a job. When others brag about their children, what do you say? What can you do? For starters, keep in mind that you don’t really know what’s going on in all those “perfect” families. Your friend’s kid, the successful doctor, could have a drug problem, and the attorney your daughter went to school with might be on her third husband. For this reason and many others, it’s best to not compare your children to others. ([Location 4018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4018))

- Your child’s behavior is terrible, and you want to evict them. Tell your child if their behavior doesn’t change immediately, they must find another place to live within a specific time period. If the behavior does not change, talk to a lawyer and evaluate your options. Alternatively, just tell your child to leave. Make your child follow the rules you’ve set for your home—they must choose to comply with them. (However, you can provide consequences for noncompliance, such as that they must leave your home.)

- If your child lives with you, don’t make things too comfortable for them. You may let them live with you because you want them to have a stable home base, but you also want them to be motivated to be out on their own. The key is to remember that they’re no longer a kid but a grown adult who still needs your help. Unless you want them at home forever, the idea in letting them remain in your home is to provide them with a bridge to living on their own. You want to see progress, no matter how slow. Here are some ideas for building that bridge. Set a reasonable target move-out date.

- happen. Be supportive, but firm; these steps need to be accomplished by a mutually agreed-upon date. Charge them something every month for room and board. This reinforces the reality that becoming an adult means adult responsibilities. If they don’t pay some kind of rent, getting an apartment will be a very rude awakening. Even if it’s only a symbolic amount, insist that it be paid on the same day every month. Don’t do their chores. Impress upon them that clothes don’t magically appear in their dresser, their room doesn’t get cleaned by house elves, and their trash doesn’t disappear with the wave of a wand. They should be responsible for all of these chores. Remember, they are an adult renting a room in your house. Don’t pick up after them, get them up in the morning, continually remind them of important things, or treat them as if they have a disability that completely prevents them from doing things for themselves. Things may be harder for them to do, but that’s not an excuse. If they can do something for themselves, and yet you still do it for them, that’s enabling; if they can’t do something for themselves, and you do it, that’s supporting. If they get fired because they don’t get up in the morning, they have learned something important. You’re teaching them accountability. Expect them to participate in household tasks. Besides the minimum expectations of showering and dressing each day, expect them to pick up groceries, cook a meal, clean the living room, unload the dishwasher, and do other things adults do. Being productive and giving back to the family will make them feel good (eventually), and they will develop important skills. Set limits. Naturally, you’re going to wonder, What if they refuse to do any of this? This is where limit setting comes in (chapter 9). Come up with consequences that protect your values, needs, and wants, or ask them to find another place to live with a clear deadline. There’s a difference between being unable to do something and refusing to do something, and by now you should have a pretty good idea of which is which. Limits might include no drug… ([Location 4088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4088))

- Write it down. Put rules and limits in a written lease, which you and your child should sign and date. Keep a copy for yourself and give one to your child. They can’t protest that they didn’t know the house rules if they’re in writing. Demonstrate anything they might not grasp, such as how you like a room cleaned or what “making dinner” means (for example, it doesn’t mean picking up a pizza with your money). If they tell you that you’re being mean, you are on the right track to making them accountable for their decisions and actions, which is only a fraction of what they’ll need to know to be out on their own. Let’s say your adult son lives at home and is apparently happy to live in squalor in his bedroom. You are not.

- Going “No Contact” Once a child with BPD becomes an adult, it is not unheard of for the child and parents to go “no contact” for a certain period of time. “No contact” means what it says: no visits, phone calls, messages, and so forth. Some parents very reluctantly initiate this because of substance abuse, parental abuse, or chaotic behavior that’s making their lives so miserable that they don’t see any other option. Sometimes the adult child initiates no contact for reasons that are vitally important to them, leaving parents baffled because they don’t really understand what they did “wrong.” This can be extremely painful for them, especially for grandparents. Sometimes the cause is something as petty as an argument about what to buy in a grocery store, but even in such cases the argument must have triggered deeper issues. The no-contact decision can also be mutual. Here are some stories from parents who decided to go no contact. Miriam: I had to go no contact with my son. I will never contact him, but he knows my number. It’s better this way, until his medication helps him regulate. I love him, but I’m scared of him. Arm’s length is best in my situation. He lives with his bipolar ex-girlfriend. Toxicity is strong. Gabriela: My daughter went no contact with me. My therapist advised me to let my daughter make contact with me when she’s ready. This is devastating. When I ask her why she doesn’t want contact, she says, “You ([Location 4206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4206))

I miss my grandchildren so much. I send them birthday cards. I don’t know if they receive them. I still think and pray for my daughter every day, but I had to make a choice to focus on myself and move forward with my life. Cho: I’m at the point where I’m not going to reach out to my daughter anymore. We went through twenty-plus years of extreme chaos. Last message from her was, “You are the worst blanking mother in the world and I hope you have another heart attack and die.” The door has been open all these years. But now there will be no more contact or gifts from me anymore. Stephanie: My son is twenty-three and I initiated the no contact. He suffers from drug addiction, and I won’t be in his life when he is using. Even when there have been waves of normalcy, it is still toxic and abusive. I used to feel terrible about this, but I have done everything to fix it and nothing works. I hope my son seeks rehab/treatment, but I will not have anything to do with him while he is addicted. He is homeless and that is his choice. ([Location 4219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4219))

It is difficult because she is still living in my house, but I am moving in two months, and she needs to find a place to go in the meantime.

It does keep popping into my mind, how to find ways to help her, but I know now that unless she is willing, there is no point in my energy being used up that way. I keep up the mantra “I have done all that I can.” Disengaging is not cruel and nor is it nice. It is simply a means that allows you to separate yourself from the adverse effects that another person’s disorder has upon your life. Disengaging helps you look at your situation realistically and objectively, thereby making intelligent decisions possible. Memorize the Three Cs and the Three Gs I didn’t cause it.

- Physical Violence BPD children commit two kinds of violence: violence against a person (slapping, hitting), and symbolic violence (throwing things, destroying property, putting a fist through the wall). Both are frightening, and both are unacceptable. If your child threatens you or family members with physical violence, don’t assume it’s an idle threat any more than you would consider talk of suicide as just talk. Just like verbal violence, your first priority is keeping you and your family safe, whatever it takes. You don’t want your child with BPD to live with the fact that they hurt you or another family member, nor should you accept abuse from your child. Would you accept it from a stranger? Now is not the time to worry about the fallout from taking action to protect yourself and others. If your child is threatening violence: Don’t argue with or confront your child. Either you need to get to safety, or your child needs to be taken to a place where they can’t hurt you. Try validation, speaking in a soft voice, telling your child you love them, and anything else that might calm things down. If all else fails, call the police. Calling the police should always be considered a last resort. However, the most important thing to do is to keep the whole family safe, and hard as it may be, that may mean calling the police if all other options fail. It’s not easy for a parent to call the police on their child, but sometimes it’s necessary. And when… ([Location 4597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4597))

- her stepmother into a screaming fight; then things escalated, and my daughter said she was going to bash in the entire house and steal our documents and passports. Then she falsely accused her stepmother of slapping her and pushing her down the stairs. We told her to leave immediately. I am devastated, but we need to protect our two younger children, and I won’t let my wife be put in the middle like this. Although I feel destroyed, I am going to find out what our legal rights are regarding the false accusations and getting a restraining order. Although it’s hard to imagine your own child ever physically attacking you, it happens, usually in the heat of the moment when the child is completely out of control. If your child is threatening physical violence, do not assume it’s an idle threat, and do not argue or confront your child of any age. This is not a time for self-help or to worry about what… ([Location 4615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4615))

- it. Move slowly and calmly toward an exit. If you must climb out of a ground-floor window, do it. Don’t look directly into your child’s eyes. Instead, look and speak past them. If possible, stand next to them, as if it is you and them against the world. After one warning—“If you don’t sit down, I am calling 911”—follow through immediately if they do not heed it. Worry about whether this was the right action later. If you feel unsafe now, it is the right action. Here are some signs that your child may become physically violent with you or other family members (McVicker 2015; American Psychological Association 2013): Punching walls and throwing things Verbal threats of violence Expressions of… ([Location 4625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4625))

- If violence is a continuing problem in your home, contact a family violence organization, an elder or parental abuse hotline, or a general domestic abuse hotline. If your child is an adult and you need to protect your other children or grandchildren, call child protective services. Document the behavior and keep copies of any police reports—especially if you’re a grandparent. You may need this documentation to prove to a caseworker or family court judge that your adult child has acted in a dangerous manner toward you or others in your home. Here are some coping strategies for dealing with anger and aggression, as well as behavior to avoid when confronted with them. The problem: Your child threatens you verbally and you are a little scared. Try this: Limit setting: “That is not okay. I will not allow you to treat me that way.” (Impose consequences that allow you to take care of… ([Location 4639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4639))

- Try this: Walk away, cool down, and let your child calm down, then try limit setting. Later on, say, “That was not okay. I will not allow you to treat me that way.” (Impose consequences that allow you to take care of yourself according to your values, wants, and needs.) Instead of this: You shove them back harder and say something mean and angry to them. The problem: Your child is so angry that they damage their bedroom door. Try this: Take away the bedroom door and deprive them of privacy for two weeks. They can change in the bathroom. This is a great example of linking the consequence to the behavior. Some parents remove the door of children who self-harm in private. Instead of this: Yelling at them to “Cut it out!” The problem: Your child calls you a bunch of vile names.

- Top Takeaways from This Chapter Parenting a child who exhibits extreme behaviors presents challenges, but as with all the other challenges we explored in this book, there are proven methods for caring for yourself, your child with BPD, and other family members. Here are the key takeaways from this chapter: Yelling, calling people names, and illegal behaviors are acting-out behaviors. They are parallels to the acting-in behaviors related to suicide, self-harm, and depression, in that they all spring from the same pain and emptiness caused by BPD. This does not excuse the behavior, nor your child for hurting themselves, you, and others. ([Location 4833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4833))

- Soothe your own emotions (see chapters 5 and 8) before tackling the problem at hand. You don’t want to add your own anxiety, stress, and so forth to the mix. Give your child a chance to calm down and become less impulsive. Using validation is one good way. When the family is unsafe, your duty is to get them to safety, even if that means calling the police. As needed, call on advocates, such as child protective services, family violence centers, lawyers, and so forth, to aid your child. Do not enable your child or “love them to death.” Strike a balance between holding them accountable on one hand while offering support and help on the other hand.

- cost her a night in jail, a week in a psychiatric facility, two wrecked cars, a string of countless broken friendships, and her peace of mind. We were forced to have her move out and live with her grandmother at seventeen. She suffers emotional pain every day, and sometimes talks of ending her life. But like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones. For all her problems, my daughter has graduated high school and attends college, has had steady boyfriends, holds a job, and now lives on her own. She’s trying hard to be an adult, and, most of the time, is succeeding. Part of that, I hope/think/believe, is because of how we—meaning my wife and I—learned to handle her BPD. If you’re like me (and I have to assume you are, since you’re taking the time to read this), you want to help your kid more than anything else in the world. But sometimes, even when reaching out to other BPD parents for help, you feel alone. As a dad, you’re outnumbered, and often stereotyped.

- So, to help you out, I’m going to offer you some advice. Not because I’m an expert, or even because I always practice what I preach (I don’t—I screw up like everyone else). I’m just passing on the advice I wish someone had told me years ago, because it might have made things just a little bit easier. Anyway, without further ado, and not necessarily in order of importance, here are what I consider the “Top Ten Tips for Dads.” 1. Read Chapter 7 on Communication Techniques I know, I know—it’s kind of cheating to imply I’m going to offer you precious pearls of wisdom and then start off by saying, “Go read a chapter of a book,” but in fairness, at least it’s this book and you’ve already paid for it. You’re welcome. You, your wife, your BPD child, and their siblings—you’re all living under the same roof, and the math of that suggests that you’re going to have to communicate… ([Location 4934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4934))

- years, tools that will help bridge that gap between you and your child. Ideally, those tools can minimize arguments and improve your relationship with your child by avoiding common mistakes. Is it easy? Not always. But if your child lost their hearing, you wouldn’t hesitate to learn sign language to communicate with them. Think of this as the BPD equivalent of that effort. The chapter even teaches a technique that (finally!) addresses the infuriating lack of respect your kid often shows to you and their mom. “Form before content” teaches you how the child must comply with basic rules of respect and courtesy before any conversation can take place. That’s worth the cost of the book right there. 2. Respect Your Wife’s Knowledge No, your wife didn’t force me to write that. I know you’ve been there in the trenches every day, and that’s invaluable, but I’m assuming your wife has been the one to take the lead on studying BPD and the ways it impacts your child. She’s the one who probably picked out this book and handed it to you, right? If that’s the case, don’t ignore what she’s learned. If she makes a decision regarding how to handle your BPD child, roll with it. That doesn’t mean you can’t question the decision—the last time I checked, no healthy marriage is a dictatorship—but don’t do it openly, in front of the child; always present a united front. My real-life tip: use your technology and conduct the conversation silently via text. 3. Work as a Team with Your Wife Think of this more like tip number 2.5, because it’s a natural outgrowth of what I suggested above. Parenting is exhausting in the best of times; throw BPD into the mix and all bets are off. The easiest way to get through it—and brother, I said “easiest,” not “easy”—is to do it together. Your child should see a united parenting team at all times, even if behind the scenes that “solid” wall needs some tuck-pointing. Doing that will not only minimize arguments within the marriage, but it’ll also minimize any attempts at manipulation by your kid. Compromise and work together, and even when you stumble on that, never fail to have each other’s back. 4. Be Consistent This point, to me, is “Parenting 101,” BPD or not. Whatever course of action you decide, stay with it and don’t go wobbly. Let’s take a simple example. Your BPD child wants something, and for good and legitimate reasons, you say no. BPD… ([Location 4945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4945))

- Why you shouldn’t cave: When you say yes to avoid a fight, even though you know you should say no, you’re “feeding the monster” (BPD) because it only makes the disorder worse. It rewards negative actions and encourages them to be repeated. These chapters explain what you should do instead. Why it’s important to not give in to emotional blackmail: We all act with a degree of fear, obligation, and guilt when it comes to our kids, and saying no stirs all of that up in our gut. Stop listening to it, and learn to do what’s necessary, not what’s easiest in the short term. How to set realistic limits: And in the process, how to discard the harmful myths that screw up our plans.

- 5. Validate, Don’t Invalidate Note: If you aren’t sure what this concept fully means, don’t be discouraged. Turn to chapter 7 again for a brief overview. (Again, you bought the book. Might as well get your money’s worth.) Children with BPD often seem to have a history that only they experience. Their perception of conversations, actions, and even large-scale events, often differs from what you or your wife may remember or know to be true. But whatever your BPD child is feeling, it is what they are feeling and how they perceive the world at that point in time. Invalidating that—saying, “It’s not that bad” or “That’s not what happened”—not only reminds them of how differently they see the world; it also reinforces the… ([Location 4997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=4997))

- and it has a direct impact on minimizing their suffering. Don’t let that opportunity go to waste. 6. Be a Role Model Since we’re more than halfway through the list, let’s get to one that I admit I failed at too often. I grew up in a very loving family, but one in which shouting was as commonplace as “please” and “thank you” in other homes. I curbed the vast majority of that as a parent—honestly, it was night and day in my childhood home—but I admit that that wasn’t good enough. The actions you model for your kids are more powerful than a dictionary’s worth of words. If you show them that screaming is okay, then screamers they will become. If you show them that tantrums are okay, then (Spoiler alert!) your kid is going to throw tantrums. Guaranteed. You must manage your… ([Location 5007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=5007))

- stress of parenting can be backbreaking; the stress of parenting a BPD child, heartbreaking. Combined, that’s too much for a person to shoulder alone. Find someone to confide in, someone with no axe to grind and no agenda, someone who is there just for you. For my wife, close friends fit the bill. I like to keep my cards close to my vest in my personal life, and so I found a professional counselor to be a much better option for me. Whatever option you choose, I hope you find some much-needed solace. 8. Keep Fun in Your Marriage I know, I know—quite the jarring segue there, but number 7 was kind of a bummer, and I thought the room needed some livening up. As I mentioned earlier, a solid marriage is an invaluable tool when raising a child with BPD. Keeping that relationship healthy is vital to your success as a parent. And, if that mercenary outlook isn’t enough, I suppose you… ([Location 5019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=5019))

Help Around the House I admit, your wife did ask me to include this one. Your wife takes a big amount of parenting your BPD child on her shoulders. Maybe she works outside the home too. That’s a whole lot of responsibility, a whole lot of stress, and a whole lot of time devoted to everyone not named Mom. If that woman cracks, no one wins, least of all your wife (or you). So, show your wife you care. Step up and help around the house. Cook. Clean. Help get the… ([Location 5031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=5031))

- of all, because it involves the health and success of your other children. Your non-BPD children are tremendously affected by the drama surrounding their sibling. It is not unusual for a non-BPD sibling to require therapy of their own to deal with the trauma of events. In addition, given that the BPD child is inadvertently consuming more time, focus, and effort on the part of you and your wife, your other children run the risk of getting the short end of the parenting stick. For the sake of their own mental and emotional health, make a conscious effort to recognize them. Validate their feelings, spend time with them alone, and make an effort to participate fully in their lives. They are worth every bit as much as your BPD child, and they deserve the best you have to offer them. I’d like to finish by asking you to think of the day your BPD child was born, of that fresh newborn in your arms, and of all that you wished for their future. Those were dreams, and this is reality. You have to play a balancing game. You have to… ([Location 5043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08WHZW2H1&location=5043))

- Other sources suggest that clinicians should diagnose BPD earlier than previously thought: Two things are absolutely clear. First, adults with BPD almost always recognize that their symptoms and suffering started in childhood or adolescence. Second, some adolescents have symptoms that are so consistent with BPD that it would be unethical not to make this diagnosis and treat them accordingly. (Aguirre 2014, 26) Recent data indicate that an estimated 18 million Americans will develop borderline personality disorder in their lifetimes, with symptoms commonly emerging during early adolescence and adulthood.
