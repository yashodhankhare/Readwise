## Highlights
- This book cuts through the fog that pervades many discussions of competition and strategy. Our goal is to clarify readers’ understanding of strategy and to reframe their approach to it. We want executives to know how their markets work, where their competitive opportunities lie, and how to develop and protect them. To this end, we include both broad discussions of general principles and detailed case studies of actual competitive interactions. Taken together, we think they present a useful guide for people who ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=37))

- At its core, strategic thinking is about creating, protecting, and exploiting competitive advantages. On a level playing field, in a market open to all competitors on equal terms, competition will erode the returns of all players to a uniform minimum. Therefore, to earn profits ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=46))

- above this minimum, a company must be able to do something that its competitors cannot. It must, in other words, benefit from competitive advantages. The appropriate starting point of any strategic analysis is a careful assessment of those economically advantageous aspects of a firm’s market situation that cannot be replicated by its competitors or, at most, can be reproduced by only a handful of them. The existence or absence of competitive advantages forms a kind of continental divide when it comes to strategy. On one side are the markets in which no firms benefit from significant competitive advantages. In these markets, strategy is not much of an issue. Lots of competitors have essentially equal access to customers, to technologies, and to other cost advantages. Each firm is in more or less the same competitive position. Anything that one does to improve its position can and will be immediately copied. Without any firm enjoying a competitive advantage, this process of innovation and immitation repeats itself continually. In these markets, the sensible course is not to try to outmaneuver the ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=48))

- competitors, but rather to simply outrun them by operating as efficiently as possible. Constant pursuit of operational efficiency is essential for companies in markets without competitive advantages. However, operational efficiency is a tactical matter, not a strategic one. It focuses internally on a company’s systems, structures, people, and practices. Strategy, by definition, looks outward to the marketplace and to the actions of competitors. On the other side of the divide are the markets where strategy is critically important. In these markets, incumbents have competitive advantages, and the race for profitability is shaped by how well companies manage the competition among their peers and how effectively they are able to fend off potential entrants. A focus on outsiders lies at the heart of business strategy. This book is a handbook on how to identify, understand, anticipate, and influence those important outsiders.

- In our view, strategic decisions are those whose results depend on the actions and reactions of other economic entities. Tactical decisions are ones that can be made in isolation and hinge largely on effective implementation. Understanding this distinction is key to developing effective strategy.

- Strategic choices, in contrast to tactical ones, are outward looking. They involve two issues that every company must face. The first issue is selecting the arena of competition, the market in which to engage. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=158))

- The second strategic issue involves the management of those external agents. In order to devise and implement effective strategy, a firm has to anticipate and, if possible, control the responses of these external agents.

- Thanks to Michael Porter’s groundbreaking work, Competitive Strategy, published in 1980, strategic thinking in recent years increasingly has come to recognize the importance of interactions among economic actors. By concentrating on external agents and how they behave, Porter clearly moved strategic planning in the right direction. But, for many people, identifying the many factors in Porter’s complex model and figuring out how they will play off one another has proven to be frustratingly difficult. What we are proposing here is a radically simpler approach. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=170))

- We agree with Porter’s view that five forces—Substitutes, Suppliers, ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=174))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Potential Entrants, Buyers, and Competitors within the Industry—can affect the competitive environment. But, unlike Porter and many of his followers, we do not think that those forces are of equal importance. One of them is clearly much more important than the others. It is so dominant that leaders seeking to develop and pursue winning strategies should begin by ignoring the others and focus only on it. That force is barriers to entry—the force that underlies Porter’s “Potential Entrants.” If there are barriers, then it is difficult for new firms to enter the market or for existing companies to expand, which is basically the same thing. Essentially there are only two possibilities. Either the existing firms within the market are protected by barriers to entry (or to expansion), or they are not. No other feature of the competitive landscape has as much influence on a company’s success as where it stands in regard to these barriers. If there are no barriers to entry, then many strategic concerns can be ignored. The company does not have to worry about interacting with identifiable competitors or about anticipating and influencing their behavior. There are simply too many of them to deal with.

- Life in an unprotected market is a game played on a level field in which anyone can join. In these markets, often but mistakenly identified as “commodity” markets,* only the very best players will survive and prosper, and even they have to be continually on their toes. Without the protection of barriers to entry, the only option a company has is to run itself as efficiently and effectively as possible. Operational effectiveness might be thought of as a strategy, indeed, as the only strategy appropriate in markets without barriers to entry. However, operational effectiveness, identified ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=187))

- by Michael Porter as doing what rivals do but doing it better, is an internal matter. According to our definition of strategy, it is tactical rather than strategic. That does not make it insignificant. Operational effectiveness can be the single most important factor in the success, or indeed in the survival, of any business. In the last chapter of this book, we describe the extent to which a determined focus on operational effectiveness may carry one firm far ahead of its competitors, even though there is nothing that distinguishes its fundamental economic position from that of its less successful rivals. Still, the pursuit of operational effectiveness does not require consideration of all the external interactions that are the essence of real strategy.

- BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES The existence of barriers to entry means that incumbent firms are able to do what potential rivals cannot. Being able to do what rivals cannot is the definition of a competitive advantage. Thus, barriers to entry and incumbent competitive advantages are simply two ways of describing the same thing. Entrant competitive advantages, on the other hand, have no value. By definition, a successful entrant becomes the incumbent. It then is vulnerable to the next entrant, who benefits from newer technology, less expensive labor, or some other temporary competitive edge. And because there are no barriers to entry, the cycle doesn’t stop. So it is only in the presence of incumbent competitive advantages that strategy, in our sense of the term, comes to the fore.

- In an increasingly global environment, with lower trade barriers, cheaper transportation, faster flow of information, and relentless competition from both established rivals and newly liberalized economies, it might appear that competitive advantages and barriers to entry will diminish.

- But this macro view misses one essential feature of competitive advantages—that ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=208))

- competitive advantages are almost always grounded in what are essentially “local” circumstances. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=209))

- Competitive advantages that lead to market dominance, either by a single company or by a small number of essentially equivalent firms, are much more likely to be found when the arena is local—bounded either geographically or in product space—than when it is large and scattered. That ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=232))

- is because the sources of competitive advantage, as we will see, tend to be local and specific, not general or diffuse. Paradoxically, in an increasingly global world, the key strategic imperative in market selection is to think locally. Dominance at the local level may be easier to accomplish than one might initially think. If the global economy follows the path of the more developed national economies, service industries will become increasingly important and manufacturing less significant. The distinguishing feature of most services is that they are produced and consumed locally. As a consequence, opportunities for sustained competitive advantages, properly understood, are likely to increase, not diminish. The chances of becoming the next Wal-Mart or Microsoft are infinitesimal, but the focused company that understands its markets and its particular strengths can still flourish.

- Strategic analysis should begin with two key questions: In the market in which the firm currently competes or plans to enter, do any competitive advantages actually exist? And if they do, what kind of advantages are they? The analysis is made easier because there are only three kinds of genuine competitive advantage: ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=241))

- Most companies that manage to grow and still achieve a high level of profitability do it in one of three ways. They replicate their local advantages in multiple markets, like Coca-Cola. They continue to focus within their product space as that space itself becomes larger, like Intel. Or, like Wal-Mart and Microsoft, they gradually expand their activities outward from the edges of their dominant market positions.

- It is for companies in these markets, those that enjoy the benefits of competitive advantages but with potent competitors of similar capabilities, that strategy formulation is most intense and demanding. They face the big challenge of figuring out how to manage their competitors. To develop an effective strategy, a company not only needs to know what its competitors are doing, but to also be able to anticipate these competitors’ reactions to any move the company makes. This is the true essence of strategic planning. It embraces all of the things a company does in which a competitor’s direct reactions are critical to its performance—pricing policies, new product lines, geographical expansions, capacity additions.

- The salient features of a competitive situation are: The players—a restricted number of identifiable actors, generally competitors; if the list is not short and manageable, there are probably no genuine barriers to entry The actions each player can pursue—the choices that are available to them The motives that drive them—profitability is the most common in business, but other goals, like winning against ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000QUEHKS&location=314))

- In addition to classic games and simulations, another approach to analyzing competition among the elephants is to assume that instead of battling, companies can learn how to cooperate for mutual gain and to fairly share the benefits of their jointly held competitive advantage. This type of interaction among competitors—which could also be called “bargaining”—makes all the players better off, but it requires an outlook and a disposition rarely found in this environment.
