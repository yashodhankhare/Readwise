- The common worldview, shared by most humans, is that there is one objective reality, and we humans can understand that reality through a rigorous application of facts and reason. This view of the world imagines that some people have already achieved a fact-based type of enlightenment that is compatible with science and logic, and they are trying to help the rest of us see the world the “right” way. As far as I can tell, most people share that interpretation of the world. The only wrinkle with that worldview is that we all think we are the enlightened ones. And we assume the people who disagree with us just need better facts, and perhaps better brains, in order to agree with us. That filter on life makes most of us happy—because we see ourselves as the smart ones—and it does a good job of predicting the future, but only because confirmation bias (our tendency to interpret data as supporting our views) will make the future look any way we want it to look, within reason.

Master Persuaders (includes several presidents, Steve Jobs, Peggy Noonan, Tony Robbins, Madonna, etc.) Cognitive scientists Commercial-grade persuaders (people such as me) ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=190))

- When candidate Trump answered questions about policies, it was clear he didn’t have a detailed understanding of the more complicated issues. Most observers saw this as a fatal flaw that would keep him out of the White House. I didn’t see it that way. I saw it as Trump recognizing that people don’t use facts and reason to make decisions. A skilled persuader can blatantly ignore facts and policy details so long as the persuasion is skillful. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=217))

- I was far from being a true believer about Trump’s policies. But unlike most of the world, I recognized his campaign promises as more persuasion than policy. I never took his policy positions too seriously except in a directional sense. And directionally, Trump wanted the same things the public wanted: strong national security, prosperity, affordable health care, personal freedom, and that sort of thing. Although Trump never said it directly, he branded himself as a flexible leader who would work out the details after election. And sure enough, we observed President Trump working out the details after election on immigration policy, health care, taxes, fighting ISIS, and more.

- I had a lot of advantages in understanding Trump’s communication style and his powers of persuasion. But when it came to communicating what I knew, I had one enormous advantage that almost no one else covering the election had: I wasn’t doing it for the money. I’m already rich. No one owns me. The common business term for that situation is having F-you money. And I have it. That gave me the freedom to say whatever I thought was both useful and true. And thanks to my popular blog at Dilbert.com, I had a direct channel to the public. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=266))

- If you watched the entire election cycle and concluded that Trump was nothing but a lucky clown, you missed one of the most important perceptual shifts in the history of humankind. I’ll fix that for you in this book. I knew from my own experience as a hypnotist that Trump’s extraordinary skill at persuasion would trigger massive cognitive dissonance and plenty of confirmation bias. If you’re not familiar with those terms, I include quick definitions below. I’ll go into more detail later. If you seek enlightenment, these are two of the most important concepts you will ever learn. Cognitive Dissonance This is a mental condition in which people rationalize why their actions are inconsistent with their thoughts and beliefs. For example, if you think you are smart, but you notice yourself doing something that is clearly dumb, you might spontaneously hallucinate that there was actually a good reason for it. Or perhaps you believe you are an honest person, but you observe yourself doing something dishonest. Your brain will instantly generate a delusion to rationalize the discrepancy. This is a common phenomenon in all normal humans, but we generally believe it applies only to other people. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=294))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Confirmation Bias This is the human tendency to see all evidence as supporting your beliefs, even if the evidence is nothing more than coincidence. This is another common phenomenon that we believe happens only to other people. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=304))

- You might be wondering how confident I was about my prediction that Trump would win. Well, no one is psychic. I can’t know with total certainty what the future holds. For example, I couldn’t predict what types of scandals would pop up along the way. But I do know persuasion. I know its power in a way that few people do. And I recognized that with Trump’s level of persuasion skill, he was bringing a flamethrower to a stick fight. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=310))

- You should never take financial advice from cartoonists, but let me tell you one thing that feels safe to share: If the CEO of a publicly traded company is routinely described as having a “reality distortion field”—as was the case with Steve Jobs—keep an eye on that company. That’s a sign of a Master Persuader. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=324))

- You saw Trump use the intentional wrongness persuasion play over and over, and almost always to good effect. The method goes like this: Make a claim that is directionally accurate but has a big exaggeration or factual error in it. Wait for people to notice the exaggeration or error and spend endless hours talking about how wrong it is. When you dedicate focus and energy to an idea, you remember it. And the things that have the most mental… ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=358))

- If I had boringly predicted that Trump would win the election, without any odds attached to it, the public would have easily shrugged it off as another minor celebrity’s irrelevant opinion. But if I make you pause to argue with me in your mind about the accuracy of the 98 percent estimate, it deepens my persuasion on the main point—that Trump has a surprisingly high likelihood of winning. I picked 98 percent as my Trump prediction because Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com was saying 2 percent. I did that for branding and persuasion purposes. It is easier to remember my prediction… ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=363))

- attract attention, and it did. It was also designed to pair my name with Nate Silver’s name to raise my profile by association. That worked too. Social media folks mentioned me in the same sentence with Silver countless times during the election, exactly as I had hoped. And every mention raised my importance as a political observer because I was being compared with someone already important in that field. Keep in mind that at this point in our story I was playing the wrong sport. I was a cartoonist writing about politics and persuasion. I needed whatever credibility I could get to build an audience for my Trump blogging. Using a little bit of wrongness (my precise 98 percent prediction), I managed to attract more attention than I would have otherwise. And that conferred on me some credibility by association. As long as I was literally in the same sentence with Nate Silver, I would gain some credibility by proximity alone. Trump used the intentional wrongness persuasion play often, and it seemed to work every time, at least in terms of attracting attention where he wanted it. It even works when you know he’s doing it. If you’re talking about whatever topic he wants you to focus on, he has your mind right where he wants it, even if you are criticizing him for his errors while you are there.

- had wanted to be accurate, he would have mentioned all of those solutions every time he talked about border security. He did make some casual admissions that the border would be secured in different ways in different places. But most of the time he ignored those details, and wisely so. By continuing to call it a “wall” without details, he caused the public and the media to view that as an error. So they argued about it. They fact-checked it. They put together cost estimates. They criticized Trump for not understanding that it couldn’t be a “wall” the entire way. How stupid can he be????? PERSUASION TIP 4 The things that you think about the most will irrationally rise in importance in your mind. And when they were done criticizing Trump for the “error” of saying he would build one big solid “wall,” the critics had convinced themselves that border security was a higher priority than they had thought coming into the conversation. The ideas that you think about the most are the ones that automatically and irrationally rise in your mental list of priorities. And Trump made us think about the wall a lot. He did that because he knew… ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=380))

- PERSUASION TIP 5 An intentional “error” in the details of your message will attract criticism. The attention will make your message rise in importance—at least in people’s minds—simply because everyone is talking about it.

- Some mistakes are just ordinary mistakes. But when you see a consistent stream of “mistakes” from a Master Persuader, be open to the possibility that some of those mistakes are about controlling your focus and energy. When you first saw the title of this book, did you think to yourself that Trump doesn’t say “bigly,” he says “big league”? If you noticed my title “error,” it probably helped you remember the book. And now whenever you hear the words “bigly” or “big league” in some other context, it will make you think of this book. The things you think about the most, and remember best, seem more important to you than other things. That’s the persuasion I engineered into the title. During the presidential campaign, it seemed that candidate Trump was making one factual error after another. Social media and the mainstream media were in a feeding frenzy. They called him a liar, a con man, and just plain stupid. Some went so far as to question his sanity. Even more puzzling, Trump often stuck to his claims after the media thoroughly debunked them in front of the world. He still didn’t budge. It was mind-boggling. No one was quite sure if the problem was his honesty, his lack of homework, or some sort of brain problem. But one thing we all knew for sure was that it was hard to ignore.

- If you have ever tried to talk someone out of their political beliefs by providing facts, you know it doesn’t work. That’s because people think they have their own facts. Better facts. And if they know they don’t have better facts, they change the subject. People are not easily switched from one political opinion to another. And facts are weak persuasion.

- PERSUASION TIP 6 If you are not a Master Persuader running for president, find the sweet spot between apologizing too much, which signals a lack of confidence, and never apologizing for anything, which makes you look like a sociopath.

- If Trump had apologized for any of his factual “errors,” I would remember whatever alleged wrongness triggered the apology. That would stick in my mind. I assume that’s at least partly why he doesn’t do apologies. Apologizing would be a sign of weakness and invite continual demands for more apologies. In Trump’s specific case, apologies wouldn’t have helped his campaign because there would have been too many demands for them. But in the case of normal people who are not Master Persuaders and only occasionally make public mistakes, apologies are still usually the right way to go. If I haven’t yet persuaded you that “mistakes” can be useful in persuasion, consider a small 2012 study by researcher Daniel Oppenheimer that found students had better recall when a font was harder to read.3 Oppenheimer explains the unexpected result by noting that people slow down and concentrate harder to compensate for the hard-to-read font. That extra concentration is what makes lasting memories form. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=433))

- For more science on the topic of how intentional “mistakes” can aid in memory retention, I recommend the book Impossible to Ignore, by Dr. Carmen Simon. The gist of it is that you need to surprise the brain or make it work a little extra to form memories. Our brains automatically delete our routine memories fairly quickly. Most of us don’t know what we were doing on this day a year ago. But we easily remember things that violate our expectations. A good general rule is that people are more influenced by visual persuasion, emotion, repetition, and simplicity than they are by details and facts.

- Warning: Intentionally ignoring facts and logic in public is a dangerous strategy unless you are a Master Persuader with thick skin and an appetite for risk. Most of us don’t have the persuasion skills, risk profile, and moral flexibility to pull it off. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=452))

- Anchor An anchor is a thought that influences people toward a persuader’s preferred outcome. For example, a big opening demand in a negotiation will form a mental anchor that will bias negotiations toward that high offer. Cognitive Dissonance Cognitive dissonance is a condition of mind in which evidence conflicts with a person’s worldview to such a degree that the person spontaneously generates a hallucination to rationalize the incongruity.

- Confirmation Bias Confirmation bias is the human tendency to irrationally believe new information supports your existing worldview even when it doesn’t. Filter I use the word “filter” to describe the way people frame their observations of reality. The key idea behind a filter is that it does not necessarily give its user an accurate view of reality. The human brain is not capable of comprehending truth at a deep level. Godzilla “Godzilla” was my nickname for one of the most powerful persuaders in the world. You’ll find out more about Godzilla later. The High-Ground Maneuver The High-Ground Maneuver is a persuasion method that involves elevating a debate from the details on which people disagree to a higher concept on which everyone agrees. Linguistic Kill Shot A linguistic kill shot is a nickname or short set of words so persuasive that it can end an argument or create a specific outcome.

Moist Robot Moist robot is my framing of human beings as programmable entities. If you provide the right inputs, you get the right outputs. Mole (the Mole) In the context of this book, the Mole is an imagined traitorous helper for the Clinton campaign who intentionally made all the wrong choices in terms of persuasion.

- The second dimension describes the most common view of reality—the one in which we believe facts and logic are important to our decisions. This view says humans are reasonable 90 percent of the time, but every now and then we get a bit crazy. Setting the Table Setting the table refers to managing an opponent’s first impressions before negotiations begin. Tells I borrowed this term from poker. In a poker context, it means that a player is giving off a signal—a tell—about how good his cards are. In the context of persuasion, a tell is a signal that someone has been persuaded. But I also use the word generically to indicate any kind of signal.

- Students of philosophy remember that Plato talked about the subjective nature of our personal realities in “The Allegory of the Cave” (Republic, 514a–520a). Plato asked us to imagine a group of people who lived their lives chained to a wall of a cave that faces another wall. On the wall they face, they see shadows of other people walking around in front of a fire elsewhere in the cave, but there is no way for the prisoners to see the other people directly. To this group of cave prisoners, the shadows themselves appear to be real creatures living independent lives. The prisoners would have no reason to think otherwise because the shadows would act and move like living creatures. If you released the cave prisoners, they would soon learn about the properties of fire and shadows, and they would have to reinterpret their entire reality to fit the new data. The point of Plato’s allegory is that—figuratively speaking—we humans might be chained to a cave created by our own faulty brains and senses, experiencing a shadow world ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=501))

- that is entirely different from objective reality. Other famous philosophers, notably David Hume (born 1711), have questioned the nature of reality in terms of the existence of free will. If, as some philosophers claim, humans have no free will, and we are nothing but victims of cause and effect, that means our common view of reality is absurd. In this model of the world, we are little more than meat robots who wrongly believe we control our own decisions and actions. Famous German philosopher Immanuel Kant (born 1724) held that the human mind creates the structure of human experience. He explained that our brains don’t have direct access to base reality—we have to settle for interpreting the input from our faulty senses. Kant uses a lot of words to say reality isn’t necessarily anything like the way we perceive it. For the purpose of this book, you don’t need to accept any of these philosophical interpretations of reality. I only mention them to show that smart people throughout history have made arguments about the subjective nature of reality that are compatible with what you will read in these pages. In more recent times, cognitive psychologists and physicists have discovered a lot of eye-opening stuff about the limits of human rationality. For example, Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, has written and lectured extensively on the topic of how humans believe they are using facts and reason to make decisions but in reality are easily swayed by bias from lots of different sources. Ariely wrote Predictably Irrational (2008). ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=508))

I encourage you to remain skeptical about any details in this book, but it might help you to know I’m in good company—philosophically speaking—on the big picture: Humans think they are rational, and they think they understand their reality. But they are wrong on both counts. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=537))

- Want to see something freaky? Set this book aside and do an Internet search for “the McGurk effect.” Click on the first video you see. It is short. And it will blow your mind when you see how powerful persuasion can be. Near the start of the clip, you see a close-up of a man’s mouth while he repeats, “Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.” You recognize his lips as forming the B in “bah,” and it all makes sense. Then things get weird. The soundtrack stays the same, but the man moves his lips as if he is forming the sound “fa, fa, fa” instead of “bah, bah, bah.” And while you watch, as if by magic, your brain turns the sound “bah” into “fa.” You know this is an illusion, and you know how they are doing it. And yet it still works. You can go back and forth between the lips that seem to be saying “fa” and the ones that seem to be saying “bah.” In reality, the sound is “bah” all the way from start to finish, but your brain will instantly translate the “bah” into “fa” when the lips on the video are moving as if they are creating an F sound. This is a great example of how visual persuasion is more powerful than auditory persuasion. Our visual sense changes what we are hearing in real time, even when we know the illusion. If you don’t have time to watch the video right now, make a point of doing it before you finish the book. You won’t fully appreciate the power of persuasion until you do. The main theme of this book is that humans are not rational. We bounce from one illusion to another, all the while thinking we are seeing something we call reality. The truth is that facts and reason don’t have much influence on our decisions, except for trivial things, such as putting gas in your car when you are running low. On all the important stuff, we are emotional creatures who make decisions first and rationalize them after the fact. If you are normal, or anything like normal, you probably think I am exaggerating about how irrational we human beings are. Perhaps you don’t feel irrational. But consider the U.S. election of 2016, in which Donald J. Trump unexpectedly beat Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College to win the election. I think it is obvious that roughly half of the people in the United States made a deeply irrational decision in that election. But which half? As a general rule, irrational people don’t know they are irrational. After the election results came in, both halves of the country accused the other half of being irrational. As a trained hypnotist, I can tell you with confidence that both halves were right. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=542))

- The common view of reality is that the way you see the world is not only accurate but universally shared. For all I know, that might be true. But it might also be the case that reality is something quite different from what you perceive. That possibility might feel unlikely to you. Watch me change your mind. I’ll do it by explaining my personal journey through what I call the filters. The key concept of a filter is that it is not intended to give you an accurate view of reality. All it is supposed to do is give you better results than other filters. And I propose that the best way to objectively determine the usefulness of a filter is by asking if it makes you happy and also does a good job of predicting the future. The Persuasion Filter (the main topic of this book) does a great job of making people happy, or so I observe. And it did a great job predicting a number of unlikely events in the presidential election of 2016. That’s what I call a good filter. What I don’t claim is that the Persuasion Filter is an accurate view of reality. I have no reason to believe humans evolved with the capability to understand their reality.

- THE SANTA CLAUS FILTER When I was a child, it was customary for adults to indoctrinate kids with an entertaining belief in magic of all kinds. For several years of my youth, I thought Santa Claus was real. I also believed in the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Superman. My filter on life allowed all sorts of magical creatures to exist. The interesting part—and the lesson here—is that this total misconception about reality did an excellent job of keeping me happy and predicting the future. There was no penalty for being totally wrong about reality. I liked toys, and I liked knowing Santa was efficient, punctual, immortal, and suspiciously generous. I liked knowing that the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny would deliver the goods too. It was a great filter on reality until I was old enough to realize there were simply too many chimneys and too little time for Santa to get the job done. And his sled was totally undersized. The numbers didn’t add up. The other magical creatures that inhabited my filter also faded in the light of what I assumed was my higher level of knowledge and reason. But I was wrong. All I did was move to another filter with new characters. THE CHURCH FILTER From the ages of about six to eleven, I attended Sunday school at the Methodist church that was a short walk from my house. I believed everything the church told me because I didn’t see any reason they would put so much energy into a centuries-long, elaborate lie. And I assumed all those people couldn’t be wrong. As a child, I understood that other religions existed. But the Methodist Church explained away that discrepancy in my filter by saying all the other religions were wrong. That seemed reasonable to me. And it seemed that 100 percent of the people in my small town of Windham, New York, were Christians of one flavor or another. In hindsight, I assume the atheists were just staying off the radar. My church filter worked great most of the time. I was happy that I would go to heaven. But the filter didn’t seem to do a great job of predicting anything while I was still alive. Prayers didn’t seem to influence my outcomes in any reliable way. And no one could predict the next miracle, or the birth of the next saint. I was starting to have my doubts about the church filter. One day in Sunday school we learned a Bible story about Jonah and the giant fish. The quick version of the… ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=575))

- at all times. I accepted this as true (enough) for several years of my childhood. The alien experiment filter did a good job of explaining why I was so different from the people in my town, but it didn’t make me happy, and it wasn’t any good for predicting what would happen next. It wasn’t a useful filter. Eventually I dropped that filter in favor of . . . THE ATHEIST FILTER The atheist filter imagines that there is no supreme being. It also imagines that humans are rational creatures and they can understand their environment through observation, science, and reason. This filter was a perfect fit for a rebellious young man. It gave me something juicy to argue about, and I did, whenever anyone would listen. I enjoyed the debates, but I can’t say that my atheist filter ever made me happy. Nor did it do a great job of predicting the future, except that I could predict that my prayers would not be answered, and no miracles would happen while I was watching. But those are special cases. As a general rule, I couldn’t predict anything using the atheist… ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=605))

- THE WEED FILTER I smoked a lot of marijuana in college. One of the most puzzling aspects of being high was that the people around me who were not high seemed nicer than usual. For years I assumed I was only imagining that people were being extra nice to me when I was high. The simplest explanation for my subjective experience was that the drug was altering my perception of the world. I started to feel as if I had one reality when I was normal and an entirely different reality when I was high. The interesting thing is that both of those realities worked fine. When I was high, I could still navigate the world and do all the things that people do. There were a few activities, such as studying for tests, that I didn’t do as well when high. And driving was a bad idea. But for most daily activities there was no important difference in how I performed. That’s when I started to realize that people could be living in different realities while inhabiting the same room. I knew from my own experience that I could experience two realities in the same room just by going from normal to high. In later years I came to understand why everyone seemed so much nicer to me when I was high. It turns out that people were actually nicer to me. And there is a perfectly good reason: My cheery and relaxed attitude while high was rubbing off on the people around me. My other reality—the one in which I was not high—brought out my more intense, ambitious, and introspective personality. People respond to that personality with less friendliness because I look like I’m all business, and it rubs off on them. I wasn’t perceiving reality to be different when I was high—I was causing it to be different. Here again we can see that the true nature of reality—if such a thing exists—was somewhat irrelevant to my day-to-day life. My reality made perfect sense when I believed I was only imagining that people were acting nicer to me when I was high. And reality still made sense when I realized (or believed) I was causing that niceness by my own demeanor. The choice of filter didn’t make much difference to my life. The weed filter was a big improvement over my past filters because it made me happy (obviously), but it also had some predictive power. When I was high, I knew people would respond to me in a certain way, on average, and they did. Or so it seemed. And that’s all that mattered. But the weed… ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=615))

- how most people see the world. I did too until I trained to become a hypnotist. Hypnotists see the world differently. From our perspective, people are irrational 90 percent of the time but don’t know it. We can be rational in trivial situations—such as deciding what time to leave the house to drive to work. But we are almost never rational when it comes to matters of love, family, pets, politics, ego, entertainment, and almost anything else that matters to us emotionally. When our feelings turn on, our sense of reason shuts off. The freaky part is that we don’t recognize when it is happening to us. We think we are reasonable and rational most of the time. But what hypnotists have long known, and scientists have in recent years confirmed, is that our decisions are often made without appeal to the rational parts of our brains. We literally make our decisions first and then create elaborate rationalizations for them after the fact. Freaky, right? The grand illusion of life is that our minds have the capacity to understand reality. But human minds didn’t evolve to understand reality. We didn’t need that capability.… ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=661))

- That interpretation is literally the opposite of what I heard and saw. This odd difference in observation is not unusual. Both my friend and I follow politics. We’re both smart. (He’s smarter.) Neither of us lied about our reaction to Trump’s speech. But we saw entirely different movies playing on the same screen at the same time. If you think this different-movies situation is rare, you’re living in what I call the second dimension. In the third dimension, where persuasion rules, it is entirely normal and routine for different movies to play on the same screen at the same time. But if each of us is living in our own little movie, which one is best? I submit that the best filter on politics is the one that makes you happy and is the most accurate at predicting what will happen next. I used the Persuasion Filter to predict Trump’s presidency when others thought it was madness. And I predicted a lot of steps along the way that I’ll describe in this book. All of my predictions were public. You can check them for yourself. But even if I were to convince you that the Persuasion Filter is the best way to predict the future, you will still wonder how humans could be so delusional and not realize it. And to understand that you must understand two concepts: cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias. These two concepts explain almost everything that puzzles you about why people act the way they do. And they explain the 2016 election in a way nothing else can.

- Wikipedia gives us a useful definition of cognitive dissonance: In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time; performs an action that is contradictory to their beliefs, ideas, or values; or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.1 The science around cognitive dissonance is deep, but you don’t need any of that depth to be a good persuader. All you need to understand is the basic idea of cognitive dissonance and—this is important—how often it happens in your daily experience. I told you the normal view of the world is that we are rational 90 percent of the time and we get a little crazy 10 percent of the time. The Persuasion Filter’s view of the world is that we’re irrational 90 percent of the time. And one of the biggest sources of this irrationality is cognitive dissonance. The most common trigger for cognitive dissonance is when a person’s self-image ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=699))

- image doesn’t fit their observations. For example, if you believe you are a smart and well-informed person, and then you do something that is clearly dumb, it sends you into a state of cognitive dissonance. And once you are in that uncomfortable state of mind, your brain automatically generates an illusion to solve the discomfort. In this situation, your brain would tell you the new information was inaccurate. The alternative is to believe that you are dumb, and that violates your self-image. You don’t like to change your self-image unless it is in the direction of improvement. Our egos prevent us from imagining we are irrational 90 percent of the time. When we recognize ourselves acting irrationally, the simplest course of action for the brain is to generate an illusion that explains it all away. And so it does. Automatically. The fun part is that we are not aware when it is happening. Others might be able to see it happening in you as clear as day. But by its nature, cognitive dissonance is invisible to the person experiencing it.

- The first “tell” for cognitive dissonance is the absurdity of the rationalization. For example, you might be friends with a cigarette smoker who claims smoking won’t hurt him because he knows someone who smoked a pack a day and lived to be a hundred years old. The person who makes that sort of argument is simply addicted to smoking but doesn’t like to think of himself as being unwise or unable to quit. That would violate the person’s self-image. To keep his self-image intact, the smoker… ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=721))

- The best way to know you are seeing cognitive dissonance and not routine irrationality is to look for the trigger. The trigger is whatever made the person realize that their own actions were in conflict with their self-image. In the smoking example, some people admit they are addicted and say they enjoy smoking, and so they put up with the high risks. Those people are probably not experiencing cognitive dissonance because they understand the risks and causation correctly. But a smoker who refuses to admit that addiction is central to the habit—perhaps because the person has too much confidence in his own self-control—has to invent a hallucination for why a smart person with self-control would do such a damaging thing as smoking. That incongruity is the trigger. The person’s self-image doesn’t match his own actions. The presidential election of 2016 provided the biggest trigger for cognitive dissonance you might ever see in your lifetime. It had all the elements for generating mass hallucinations. From the moment that Trump announced his candidacy, the professional political class started mocking his intelligence, his commitment, his talent, and—most important—his chances of winning. The pundits believe they are smart, and they believe they can see the world for what it is. And in the case of Trump, it seemed to them the easiest prediction in the world, at least for people so well informed and rational. What mattered the most here, in terms of the trigger, is not that these folks were so wrong. People are wrong all the time, and it doesn’t always cause hallucinations. The key variable in this case was their certainty. And it was public certainty, repeated loudly and often. Their opinions of Trump became part of their self-image. They saw themselves as the smart ones, in stark contrast to what they imagined were the Trump supporters with their mullets and pickup trucks. And then Trump won. By a comfortable margin, at least in the Electoral College, which is the only place it matters. Trump lost the popular vote, but that was a case of losing a game he wasn’t playing. Trump’s win was the trigger. The pundits and the voters who believed they were the smart ones suddenly learned they were not. And they learned it in the clearest possible way. They were wrong about the voters in swing states. They were wrong to trust the polls. They were wrong to underestimate… ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=730))

- THE AFTER-ELECTION DANGER After the election results came in, people expected me to gloat. You could say I earned it. I had just pulled off the upset prediction of the century while enduring more than a year of nonstop abuse from pro-Clinton and Republican establishment types. If anyone ever had a good reason to gloat, I did. But I couldn’t. I knew how dangerous the situation was. I knew people would experience a form of temporary insanity. Cognitive dissonance by itself isn’t always dangerous. But if you combine that with the illusion that some sort of Hitler had just become leader of the country—and that’s what the anti-Trumpers believed—we had a risk of riots, violence, and a breakdown of our entire system. I wanted to gloat, but I’m a patriot first, and the country needed some calm voices. I took to my blog, Twitter, and Periscope to persuade Trump supporters to back away from the gloating that they too had earned. By this point in the election saga, Trump supporters recognized me as a credible voice about politics. My reputation was reinforced by Trump’s win. Suddenly I had influence like never before. I had the ears and eyes of the media. I had a huge audience. And I had a very big problem to help solve. I don’t normally turn up my persuasion powers to weapons grade. But I can. This time, with the republic in the balance, I felt I needed to. And so I picked one of the strongest persuasion tools: the High-Ground Maneuver (described more fully in its own chapter later in the book). I used my social media platform to remind Trump supporters that they are patriots first, and their country needed them for the healing. I asked them to take punches from Clinton supporters and not fight back. I asked them to avoid gloating in public. I asked them to be the better people. I asked them to earn the leader they believed they elected. In other words, I took them to the high ground. Did my persuasion make any difference? There is no way to tell. But I was impressed at how well Trump supporters handled their win. For the most part, they didn’t confront protesters. They didn’t gloat nearly as much as I would have expected. They found the high ground, perhaps on their own, and simply enjoyed the show as the mainstream media tried to do brain surgery on itself to find out where the problem was. By election day I had over 100,000 social media followers, and they tweeted and retweeted anything interesting I said. For a year I had been one of them, gaining their trust. When I was ready to lead, they were primed to follow. All the elements were in place for my persuasion to make a huge dent in the national consciousness, both directly and through my influence on other writers. Good ideas travel from person to person, and often they lose their connection to the source over time. It is nearly impossible to measure one person’s persuasion in this sort of situation. All I know for sure is that I did my best. That’s what my patriotism required. I’m glad it worked… ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=802))

- The world can be a confusing place if you don’t know what confirmation bias is and how often it occurs in our daily lives. Confirmation bias is the human reflex to interpret any new information as being supportive of the opinions we already hold. And it doesn’t matter how poorly the new information fits our existing views. We will twist our minds into pretzels to make the new information feel as if it is consistent with what we “know” to be true. For example, as I write this chapter, news services are reporting a variety of stories about alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign staff, but we have seen no actual evidence of it. On top of the collusion allegations are stories about alleged Russian “influence” on the election that doesn’t involve any collusion; those stories appear to have more substance. But the interesting thing is that the anti-Trumpers and the Trump supporters are seeing different realities based on the same set of reported facts. Trump’s enemies say there is so much smoke (Russia-related allegations) that there must be a fire (collusion). Trump’s supporters say no evidence has been presented for collusion (true at this writing) and so he has been “proven” innocent of collusion by lack of evidence. Both positions are nonsense. The “smoke” that Trump’s critics are seeing is largely of their own making. If there are enough Russia-related election stories, and you hear enough people speculate about what might have happened, it starts to feel like a mountain of “evidence.” Yet no evidence of collusion has been made public (at this writing). Trump’s supporters are just as delusional. They see a lack of evidence as proof of innocence. But you can’t prove something doesn’t exist just because you didn’t see it in the places you looked. The important takeaway here is that citizens for and against President Trump are looking at the same information and coming to opposite conclusions. And neither of the conclusions is sensible. That’s confirmation bias. Obviously every individual is different, but on average, Trump’s opponents believe they see something that doesn’t exist (evidence of collusion) while Trump’s supporters believe they see something else that doesn’t exist (proof there was no collusion). If you don’t understand confirmation bias, you might think new information can change people’s opinions. As a trained persuader, I know that isn’t the case, at least when emotions are involved. People don’t change opinions about emotional topics just because some information proved their opinion to be nonsense. Humans aren’t wired that way. Confirmation bias is one of the many reasons you should not solely rely on past experience to predict the future. Those facts that you think you know from the past might be confirmation bias, and not facts at all. Most people know what confirmation bias is, if not by its name, then certainly by personal experience. We all know how hard it is to change a person’s mind about anything… ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=879))

- If you don’t know how frequently mass delusions occur in your daily experience, many of your opinions about the world are likely to be nonsense. That’s because mass delusions are the norm for humanity, not the exception. Don’t believe me? It is easy to check. Just ask your neighbors about their religious and political views. You’ll find plenty of disagreement with your worldview. And so, according to you, your neighbors and all the people who agree with them must be living in some sort of hallucination. How can they believe they are reincarnated when you know that death means either heaven or hell? You and your neighbor can’t both be right. One of you (at least) is experiencing a little piece of a larger mass delusion. And the problem isn’t limited to your neighbors. Millions of people share the same mass delusions (according to you). Do you remember when millions of Americans believed President Obama was a secret Muslim? That was a mass delusion. Do you remember when President Trump got elected and there were protests in the street because they thought he was the next Hitler? That was a mass delusion. Do you remember the dot-com bubble? That was based on mass delusions about the value of money-losing start-ups. Every other financial bubble was also a mass delusion. Below is a starter list of the more notable mass delusions. Wikipedia lists over thirty examples of mass hysteria through the years. But those are only the famous cases. Mass delusions are influencing every one of us all the time. Until the spell is broken, you can’t tell you are in one. The examples that follow should be enough for you to see the pattern. Once you see how easily mass delusions start, and how confirmation bias can keep them fueled, you might start to recognize how often it is happening to you in your daily experience.

But people who live in the 3-D world, where persuasion rules, can often have a different view of climate change because we see mass delusions (even among experts) as normal and routine. My starting bias for this topic is that the scientists could easily be wrong about the horrors of climate change, even in the context of repeated experiments and peer review. Whenever you see a situation with complicated prediction models, you also have lots of room for bias to masquerade as reason. Just tweak the assumptions and you can get any outcome you want. Now add to that situation the fact that scientists who oppose the climate change consensus have a high… ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=951))

- In the 2-D world, the scientific method and peer review squeeze out the bias over time. But in the 3-D world, the scientific method can’t detect bias when nearly everyone including the peer reviewers shares the same mass delusion. I’m not a scientist, and I have no way to validate the accuracy of the climate model predictions. But if the majority of experts on this topic turn out to be having a mass hallucination, I would consider that an ordinary situation. In my reality, this would be routine, if not expected, whenever there are complicated prediction models involved. That’s because I see the world as bristling with mass delusions. I don’t see mass delusions as rare. When nonscientists take sides with climate scientists, they often think they are being supportive of science. The reality is that the nonscientists are not involved in science, or anything like it. They are taking the word of scientists. In the 2-D world, that makes perfect sense, because it seems as if thousands of experts can’t be wrong. But in the 3-D world, I accept that the experts could be right, and perhaps they are, but it would be normal and natural in my experience if the vast majority of climate scientists were experiencing a shared hallucination. To be clear, I am not saying the majority of scientists are wrong about climate science. I’m making the narrow point that it would be normal and natural for that group of people to be experiencing a mass hallucination that is consistent with their financial and psychological incentives. The scientific method and the peer-review process wouldn’t necessarily catch a mass delusion during any specific window of time. With science, you never know if you are halfway to the truth or already there. Sometimes it looks the same. Climate science is a polarizing topic (ironically). So let me just generalize the point to say that compared with the average citizen, trained persuaders are less impressed by experts. To put it another way, if an ordinary idiot doubts a scientific truth, the most likely explanation for that situation is that the idiot is wrong. But if a trained persuader calls BS on a scientific truth, pay attention. Do you remember when citizen Trump once tweeted that climate change was a hoax for the benefit of China? It sounded crazy to most of the world. Then we learned that the centerpiece of politics around climate change—the Paris… ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=960))

- Hypnosis is a special form of persuasion, generally involving one hypnotist guiding one patient (or subject) toward some sort of personal improvement. You don’t need to be a trained hypnotist to be persuasive, but understanding what hypnosis can and cannot do is extraordinarily valuable. It can change your entire worldview. That’s what happened to me when I trained to be a hypnotist. I once believed people use facts and reason to make decisions. When I disagreed with people, I assumed it was because I had different facts or better reasons. That was an illusion. The reality one learns while practicing hypnosis is that we make our decisions first—for irrational reasons—and we rationalize them later as having something to do with facts and reason. If you believe humans are fundamentally rational, you will have a hard time learning to be a hypnotist because hypnotists rely on our irrational brain wiring to persuade. The most effective politicians do the same. In this chapter I’ll give you some background on hypnosis to show you how easily the human mind can be rewired by a skilled operator. This background will help you understand Trump’s election victory, and it might explain a lot of other mysteries in your personal and professional life.

If you try a method from a book and it doesn’t work on the first try, you’ll probably dismiss the book as a scam and stop trying. Learning hypnosis from a book might be possible, but I’ve never heard of anyone pulling it off. Hypnosis is largely an observational skill.

- One of the most confusing things about hypnosis is that the things you think it can do, it probably can’t. But the things you didn’t know it could do—such as predicting presidential outcomes—are mind-boggling. I spoke to a number of other trained persuaders during the election. The following observation is purely anecdotal, but I don’t recall any trained persuaders thinking Clinton ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1083))

- was a lock to win. Most predicted an outright Trump win, or at least a surprisingly close race. You’ve probably heard of people using hypnosis to lose weight or to stop smoking cigarettes. Hypnosis works for those methods about as well as other nonmedical methods—and by that I mean it usually doesn’t work. People who go on diets usually fail no matter what method they use. People who try to stop smoking also fail more often than not. Hypnosis gets you about the same poor result as other nonmedical methods. The reason hypnosis is not a powerful tool for losing weight or quitting smoking is almost humorously simple: You don’t want to eat less and you don’t want to stop smoking. Smokers and overeaters like both of those things. That’s the whole problem. If people didn’t enjoy eating and smoking, they wouldn’t be doing those things. And hypnosis is only good for getting you what you do want. If any part of your mind doesn’t fully embrace the change you want, hypnosis might be the wrong tool. But hypnosis can work well in situations where the subject has no objection to modifying an old behavior. For example, let’s say you want to overcome a specific type of fear. In those cases, the subject has zero desire to keep the fear. The fear provides no pleasure or other benefit. Hypnosis can work well in those situations. But you are still fighting against some sort of irrational wiring in the subject’s mind, so success is not guaranteed with hypnosis. Every brain is different, and every hypnotist is different. The best situation for hypnosis is when there is no precondition to overcome. Preconditions in this context might include an irrational fear, a love of eating junk food, or an addiction to smoking. Those cases are hard because some part of your mind wants to keep the old behavior. But sometimes you are working toward a change that has no precondition to overcome, and that’s the best situation. For example, if you were already a well-adjusted person and you wanted to learn how to relax more effectively, hypnosis would be a great tool. In this case, there is no objection to relaxing—the person just doesn’t have the tools to do it well. Hypnosis can provide the right tools. It might also surprise you that a hypnotist can sometimes induce massive orgasms in a willing subject just by choosing the right words in a private setting. But that won’t work unless the hypnotist and the subject have some sort of chemistry and a shared desire for that outcome. I know this is possible only because a coworker asked me about it while I was in hypnosis school. At the time, I didn’t know if such a thing was possible. But I needed the practice, and she volunteered to be my test subject, so I gave it a try. After about one hour of hypnosis and twenty or so screaming orgasms—no touching involved—she declared the experiment a success. I later learned that the experiment is repeatable with the right kind of subject. That’s what I mean by “mind-boggling” power.

- But the 80 percent of the public who can’t experience the phenomena can still get tremendous benefits from hypnosis. If you want to learn how to relax, how to be comfortable in a particular situation, or how to perform better at something, the only requirement is that you be willing to be hypnotized. That’s good enough for most purposes. Nonhypnotists are often under the impression that the best subjects for hypnosis are gullible, dumb, or somehow weak-minded. We learned in hypnosis class that there is no personality trait that predicts how easily someone can be hypnotized. Anecdotally, smart people seem to be the easiest to hypnotize. My hypnosis instructor said he thought that was the case, based on experience, and I’ve noticed the same thing. If there is a correlation with intelligence, it probably has to do with the fact that smart people are less concerned that the hypnotist will turn them into an assassin or a sex slave because they know that isn’t a real risk. But as a general rule, there is no way to deduce from a person’s intelligence or personality whether that person will be an especially good subject for hypnosis. A trained hypnotist can tell rather quickly how good a subject will be ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1147))

And the subjects themselves have no way to know either, but they usually think they do. That’s an illusion caused by their egos. People who view themselves as strong willed also imagine they can’t be hypnotized. Submissive personality types often assume they will be good subjects for hypnosis.

- When I signed up for hypnosis class, I assumed I would use the skill I learned only to perform hypnosis on willing subjects. But it turns out that the biggest benefit of learning hypnosis is what it does to your worldview, and how it influences all of your decisions from that point on. Once you see with your own eyes the power of persuasion, and how easily people can be reprogrammed, it changes everything you do. PERSUASION TIP 12 If you want the audience to embrace your content, leave out any detail that is both unimportant and would give people a reason to think, That’s not me. Design into your content enough blank spaces so people can fill them in with whatever makes them happiest.

- Lie Detection An unexpected benefit of learning hypnosis is that I can detect lies with freaky accuracy. Liars usually have “tells,” or clues to signal deception. Some of the tells are in the form of body language and facial microchanges—the same things that a hypnotist learns to detect. Liars also use predictable patterns of language that you can pick up once you know what to look for. For example, if you accuse an innocent person of a crime, the accused generally responds by immediately denying the accusation and asking what is wrong… ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1173))

- know so they can either double down on the lie or confess. Liars confess only if the evidence against them is airtight. Romance You can’t make someone love you if the chemistry isn’t there. Hypnosis isn’t that kind of power. But if you have natural chemistry with a person and simply want things to go as well as possible, a working knowledge of hypnosis is immensely useful. Here I’m not talking about a formal induction, in which a hypnotist puts a subject in a so-called trance state. I’m talking only about the knowledge of human nature that you absorb by studying hypnosis. Once you understand people to be irrational 90 percent of the time, you can give up on your old method of using reason and logic to make someone love you. Love, romance, and sex are fundamentally irrational human behaviors, and it helps to see them that way. For example, a man who thinks humans are rational creatures might try to attract a woman by being extra nice. That seems reasonable because people like nice people more than they like mean people. But seduction-wise, niceness is boring, and nice people are a dime… ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1178))

- hardwired to be attracted to anything that helps the gene pool, and talent is a signal for valuable genes. So instead of being nice, focus on being talented, or attractive, or smart, or muscular, or something that suggests you have good genes. A common misconception is that because nice guys seem to finish last and jerky guys seem to get the women, being a jerk must have some sort of seduction advantage. It doesn’t. That’s an illusion caused by the fact that people who have other advantages—such as wealth or beauty—have the freedom to act like jerks because they can attract mates no matter what. If you don’t understand what motivates people at a deep level, you might be fooled by your observation that jerks often do well in romance. If being mean were useful to getting sex, you would see ugly people doing it more often with great success. But keep your eyes open and you’ll notice that attractive people can get away with being mean, and ugly people can’t. Attractiveness is the key correlation. The exception to this rule is something called “negging” in the language of so-called pickup artists. The idea is to say something subversively negative (negging)—but not too negative—to a woman to make her less confident. For example, the man might… ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1189))

- looks great.” When you put the compliment in the question, you’re using the “nice” strategy that won’t get you far. When you leave out the compliment and ask if the hair is different today, it suggests that perhaps you are not crazy about it. That unspoken put-down causes some women (not all, obviously) to reframe their situation as a confident male talking to a woman with some unspoken defect. That creates the illusion—or at least the possibility—that the man is a higher social rank. The perceived difference in social rank—illusion though it is—triggers attraction in the woman in this example because we are biologically wired to believe that people of higher rank probably have some sort of genetic advantage that got them there. And we want to mate with those people to pass those genes to the kids. Personally, I have never used negging to attract a woman. By the time I learned of the concept, I was already rich and successful, so I had enough perceived status that I didn’t need any tricks. You can reach your own conclusions about the ethics of negging. I’m only including it here for education and completeness. Communicating After taking the hypnosis class, I became interested in the broader field of persuasion in the normal world. By then I was working at a large bank that encouraged employees to take a variety of in-house classes. I took classes in negotiating, selling, marketing, listening skills, business writing, leadership, public speaking, and more. When you communicate, you are usually trying to persuade, even if you don’t see it that way. You might be trying to make someone laugh, persuade someone to buy, cause someone to fall in love or to stay in love. You might be trying to convey talent or knowledge to a professional contact. At a minimum, most communication involves trying to influence people’s opinion of you, even if the content of your message is neutral. So persuasion and communication overlap quite a bit. If you learn only the tools of communication—the rules of grammar, for example—and you don’t learn persuasion, your writing will be weak or, worse, you will make an enormous persuasion mistake and not know it. A good example of an enormous persuasion mistake happened during the Republican primary debate on September 16, 2015, in Simi Valley, California. Candidate Carly Fiorina tried to cut through the crowded field by graphically… ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1200))

- In my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, I talk about the concept of a talent stack. A talent stack is a collection of skills that work well together and make the person with those skills unique and valuable. For example, a computer programmer who also knows how to do good user interface design would be more valuable than one who does not. The power of the talent stack idea is that you can intelligently combine ordinary talents together to create extraordinary value. The key concept here is that the talents in the stack work well with one another. If you acquire the right combination of ordinary talents, you don’t need to be the world’s best at any of them. For example, I am not a great artist, and I have never taken a traditional class in writing. I’m not the funniest person in my social circle, and I’m not a great business mind either. But few people in the world have a complete talent stack as valuable as mine. By being good enough in each of those individual talents, I can be a famous syndicated cartoonist and enjoy an ideal career.

Part of the reason for that wrongness is that people don’t understand the power of persuasion. Trump is the best persuader I’ve ever seen. A big reason for his persuasion effectiveness is that he has accumulated a remarkable talent stack. If you were to look at any one of his talents, you would not be impressed. And that’s what fooled observers when they were evaluating his chances. They saw a candidate who was not extraordinarily good at anything in particular. He wasn’t the smartest person in the race. He wasn’t the most experienced. He wasn’t the best communicator (in traditional terms.) For more than half of the country, he wasn’t even likable. But it didn’t matter. What he did have is one of the best talent stacks you will ever see. The combination of his skills is truly special. Let’s take a look at President Trump’s talent stack.

Only a few people in the world could have escaped her trap. Kelly started to frame her dangerous question by saying, “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals . . .’” Trump interrupted her by saying, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” Kelly finished her question and Trump responded with something about the problem of political correctness. But by then it didn’t matter. The Rosie O’Donnell reference sucked all the energy out of the room. It was a masterstroke of persuasion, timed perfectly, and executed in front of the world.

- stated positive things about women and tried to change the subject. But that would be a failing strategy because there was so much public record of Trump’s past statements about women. It would just keep coming back. Trump didn’t answer the way anyone expected. Trump used his weapons-grade persuasion and stacked together several techniques in a few sentences. He created an emotion-triggering visual image (Rosie O’Donnell) that sucked all the attention from the question to the answer, and it wasn’t even a real answer. Our visual sense is the most persuasive of our five senses, so using a real person whom we recognize, and can imagine, is a great technique. He also picked a personality who was sure to trigger the emotions of his base. Republicans generally don’t like Rosie O’Donnell because of her outspoken liberal views. Trump knew his Republican base has a strong negative reaction to O’Donnell, so he bonded with them on that point. This is the persuasion method known as pacing and leading. First you match your audience’s emotional condition to gain trust, and later you are in a position to lead them. Trump also used the High-Ground Maneuver by taking the question out of the weeds of what he said in the past and up to the concept of how much it hurts the world to be bound by such silly political correctness. I’ll tell you more about the High-Ground Maneuver in its own chapter. Trump guaranteed that all media attention would be on him because the Rosie O’Donnell quote is simply too interesting (and funny) to ignore. He sucked all the attention away from his sixteen competitors, rendering them uninteresting by comparison. That never changed. None of this looked like luck to me. It was pitch-perfect technique, and it leveraged most of his persuasion talent stack, either directly or indirectly. Trump’s response to Kelly was funny, strategic, smart, memorable, visually persuasive, thick skinned (he didn’t seem bothered), provocative, and perfectly on brand. He converted Kelly’s attack into pure energy and then moved that energy where it suited him best. Normal people can’t do that. They wouldn’t even know how to start.

For example, visual persuasion involving a small fear would normally be more powerful than an academic discussion of a big fear that included no visuals. But if the communication method is the same, my ranking of the persuasion stack generally holds. I’ll take you through the stack, starting with the weakest forms at the bottom.

- We humans like to think we are creatures of reason. We aren’t.1 The reality is that we make our decisions first and rationalize them later.2 It just doesn’t feel that way to us. That’s why I often said during the 2015–16 election that “facts and policies don’t matter.” Obviously the facts and policies do matter to outcomes. But in terms of persuasion, facts and policies and reason are almost useless. The exception to this rule is when there is no emotional content to a decision and you have all the information you need. In those cases, we can use our capacity for reason. For example, you might use your sense of reason and your command of the facts to shop for the best price across multiple sellers. As long as you have no emotional investment in the topic, reason and facts can be quite persuasive. Once you remove emotion from the decision, reason and facts are all you have to go on. But most topics in the real world are emotional. We are emotional about our relationships, our career choices, and our politics. And those topics can influence everything else we do. For example, if you are in a relationship, it is difficult to purchase anything meaningful without considering the emotional impact it will have on your partner.

Consider the campaign that started decades ago to persuade citizens to recycle. The government can persuade some citizens to recycle simply by saying it is good for the planet. But you get more people to comply by making recycling a semipublic process. Visitors to your house will notice that you either have a recycling bin or not. And you can be sure they will judge you accordingly. And neighbors will see your trash and recyclables sitting by the curb in front of your house on trash pickup day. On its surface, the question of recycling is about resource management. That boring topic wouldn’t motivate many people to comply. But because recycling is semipublic by its nature, and people don’t want to be branded as bad citizens, they recycle when they know they are being watched. People are motivated to avoid social embarrassment. The social pressure to recycle doesn’t end with the neighbors, either. Kids will pester parents to recycle because the kids learned about it in school. So parents are getting the stink eye from every direction when they don’t do a good job of recycling.

We like to justify that decision-making process with words such as “hunch,” “instinct,” and “intuition.” The Persuasion Filter says this is just one of the ways we rationalize the awkward fact that we are not using our sense of reason to make decisions. When a decision involves lots of facts, and we have access to all the facts, we are more likely to hallucinate that we used our powers of reason to reach a decision. But when we recognize that we don’t have all the facts, we hallucinate that we used our gut feeling to bridge the gap. In both cases we acted irrationally, and we tried to rationalize it to ourselves after the fact. That’s how the Persuasion Filter sees it. The Persuasion Filter does not attempt to explain reality, if there is such a thing. I present it as a useful filter for understanding your world and predicting what might happen… ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1543))

My hypothesis—consistent with the Persuasion Filter—is that people who already had a firm opinion of Trump were not persuaded by the Hitler analogies. That is consistent with analogies being a weak form of persuasion. But not all voters had a firm opinion of Trump. If you are young, you probably didn’t experience much of Trump’s personal history as it happened. And if you didn’t watch The Apprentice, you didn’t know him from there either. For the people who didn’t already know Trump, the Hitler analogy was effective, not because analogies are persuasive but because this one did a good job explaining Trump for the first time to people who had no deep knowledge of him.

- HOW TO CREATE MENTAL ANCHORS The first thing you hear about a new topic automatically becomes an anchor in your mind that biases your future opinions. In the comic above, Dilbert’s nemesis got to Dilbert’s boss first and told him Dilbert was a liar. That would prime the boss’s filter to expect Dilbert to lie, with confirmation bias nearly guaranteeing that he would see things that way in the future. But if Dilbert had complained to his boss first, Dilbert would maintain his credibility, and whoever called him a liar later would have a tougher sell. In the 3-D world of persuasion, going first makes a big difference. You see this technique most often from good negotiators. They open with a ridiculously low or ridiculously high offer to bias the other side in that direction. For example, suppose you offered to be my consultant and I have no idea what your services are worth. If the first thing you tell me is that some clients pay you $1,000 per hour, I’m more likely to agree to a higher price than if the first number you told me was $100. The initial number becomes a mental anchor that is hard to move. That’s why you should always be the first to offer numbers, even if you are talking about an entirely different situation. (Yes, that works. See Robert Cialdini’s great book Pre-Suasion.) For example, let’s say you are trying to sell your business, and neither you nor your potential buyer knows what it is worth. A business is only as good as its future, and the future is unknown. So there is a lot of bias and guessing involved when anyone buys a one-of-a-kind business. If you are the seller of the business, you want to prime the buyer by mentioning the high price paid by someone… ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1573))

- company you are selling—it forms an anchor. And it might help you get a higher price. When my start-up partners and I were brainstorming how to describe WhenHub.com to investors, we had lots of valid ways to start that description, all based on fact and all totally appropriate and honest. I steered the team toward opening with a comparison of the ways in which WhenHub could be viewed as a new player in the office-suite application space (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides). Those are multibillion-dollar products. We think WhenHub belongs in that group, sizewise and functionwise. That opening idea anchors investors to the vastness of the opportunity. Is this sort of framing unethical? It depends on the situation. I wouldn’t use this method to negotiate with a family member or friend. But in a business context, you expect both sides to be using commercial-grade persuasion of this sort. And you don’t want to go to a gunfight armed only with a knife. In a business negotiation, each side expects at least some hyperbole and “selling” technique from the other. Make your own decision about whether it’s ethical to use the same persuasion tools your adversaries are using. In the case of WhenHub, the comparison to office-suite products is entirely appropriate and we back it up. The sneakier form of persuasion would involve talking about recent unicorn start-ups in general before making our pitch, to benefit from any unconscious mental associations. That would be pure persuasion without helpful information, and you can use your judgment on the… ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1590))

- had a favorable opinion of Trump would not be persuaded by analogies, including Hitler analogies, no matter how skillfully applied. But for those who didn’t yet have a firm opinion of Trump, the Hitler analogy formed an anchor that was hard to move. The details of the analogy were unimportant. All that mattered was the association. And this leads me to my next point: Associations matter more than reason. The Hitler analogy was effective not because analogies are logical or persuasive but because any association of two things is persuasive. If you compare any two things long enough, their qualities start to merge in our irrational minds. The illusion created by analogies is that if two situations have anything in common, perhaps they have lots in common. Trump has a few things in common with Hitler—as do we all—and that makes some of his critics irrationally believe he will also invade Poland. Pulling all of this together, analogies are not persuasive on their own. But if the analogy is simply a carrier for a persuasive association—let’s say, comparing any strong leader to Hitler—the association can be persuasive to some, even while the details of the analogy are ridiculous.

- If you want to influence someone to try a new product, it helps to associate it with some part of an existing habit. For example, people usually follow a consistent routine of shaving, showering, makeup, hair, brushing their teeth, etc. The vitamin industry grafted onto that habit when some marketing genius suggested that people should take vitamins once a day. That probably isn’t the best way for your body to absorb vitamins and minerals because some of them pass from your body quickly. Biologically speaking, the most effective vitamin-taking schedule would involve multiple doses spread across your day. But if you want to sell lots of vitamins, you attach the habit to people’s existing get-ready routine—once per day. That makes it stick. To put it another way, if vitamin companies relied on you to take your vitamins at any random time you liked, it probably wouldn’t happen as often as they want. But the early marketers of vitamins cleverly convinced us that taking vitamins fits into our existing waking-up and/or going-to-bed habits. Now the practice of taking vitamins around the same time as you are brushing your teeth seems… ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1616))

So if you wanted to use habit to influence politics, you might call your news program something like Morning Joe, which is the name of a show on MSNBC featuring Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. That tells people it fits into their morning habit. PERSUASION TIP 15 Studies say humans more easily get addicted to unpredictable rewards than they do predictable rewards. Habit persuasion is why I started branding my live-streaming on Periscope and YouTube as Coffee with Scott Adams. I wanted people to associate my content with their morning coffee, so it became part of their habit. Based on comments from users, that strategy has been effective. People reported to me that I became part of their morning routine and they missed it when I skipped a day. Speaking of skipping a day, that reminds me of Persuasion Tip 15. Now ask yourself whether President Trump rewards his supporters in a predictable way or in an unpredictable way. Right, he is unpredictable as heck. In the morning he disappoints, but by lunchtime he delights. You never know what is coming. And that, in part, is why his supporters are addicted to him.

- It isn’t easy to change people’s aspirations, and you would have no reason to try unless the aspirations were somehow harmful or dangerous. But you can improve the power of your persuasion by grafting your story onto people’s existing aspirations. You see this a lot in product marketing. For example, Apple tells you that its products will help you be creative. For many people, being more creative is an aspiration. And some financial services companies tell you they will help you be financially independent. That too is an aspiration for most people. When President Trump was campaigning, he played directly to voter aspirations. He told the unemployed and underemployed that they would someday have good jobs. He told us he would make America safer, richer, and just plain greater, in a variety of ways. That is good aspirational persuasion. Compare that with Hillary Clinton’s campaign slogan about being “Stronger Together.” National strength sounds like a good quality to have, but it doesn’t feel aspirational. It almost feels defensive. And her main message of being more of the same in terms of being like the Obama administration had no aspirational quality whatsoever. Maintaining a steady course is not an aspiration for people who need help. Some pundits say Trump won because he was the candidate of change. But not all change is equal. Becoming stronger together is a change, but it doesn’t speak to our personal aspirations. Trump’s theme about jobs speaks directly to aspirational change.

- In my opinion, change as a stand-alone concept was not a persuasive element in the election. The active part of the persuasion is the change to what. Trump offered the more aspirational persuasion. FEAR (BIG AND SMALL) Fear can be deeply persuasive. But not all fear-related persuasion is equal. To maximize your fear persuasion, follow these guidelines. A big fear is more persuasive than a small one. A personal fear is more persuasive than a generic national problem. A fear that you think about most often is stronger than one you rarely think about. A fear with a visual component is scarier than one without. A fear you have experienced firsthand (such as a crime) is scarier than a statistic. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump used fear in their campaign persuasion. Trump spoke of the fears of terrorism and crime from undocumented immigrants. Clinton’s brand didn’t allow her to use those same fears for persuasion, so she cleverly used Trump himself as the object of fear by painting him as a racist,… ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=1649))

Most people think they are good people, even if they sometimes do bad things. If you remind them of their identity, and their aspirations for their identity, you will usually be met with cognitive dissonance and an implied promise to change. That might look like this: Other person: “I like defacing the political signs on the other side. Ha-ha!

- THE NORMAN VINCENT PEALE CONNECTION In the 1970s, Fred and Mary Trump and their kids started attending Marble Collegiate Church in New York City, which had a famous pastor named Norman Vincent Peale.1 Young readers of this book might not recognize that name, but people above a certain age know him as the author of the super successful book The Power of Positive Thinking. It was a mega–best seller. Peale is one of the most important authors and thinkers in American history. He influenced millions. Including me. Peale told me I could do anything if I simply thought about it the right way. It was a huge perceptual shift and it freed me from the prison I had created in my own mind. So I used my powers of positive thinking to focus on someday becoming a rich and famous cartoonist who can do his work while sitting by the beach. I’m writing this paragraph at the beach. True story. Peale was good. He was very good. Peale’s book taught people about the power of the mind and its ability to author a great life. You can see in Trump a type of positive thinking that appears to be important to his success. The public has now watched more than once as Trump imagined succeeding in a new field and then did it. Evidently, he doesn’t see any limit on how successful he can be. Trump has said in interviews that Peale was a big influence on him. It is hard to know how much, but you can see the Peale “filter” coming through in everything Trump does. In some sense, Trump thought himself into the presidency. Oh, and one more interesting thing about Peale: In his day, people accused him of being a hypnotist.2 Apparently he was so persuasive that some people assumed he had a secret skill set. I wouldn’t call Peale’s methods hypnosis, but he was a Master Persuader for sure. And Trump learned it from the source. The best source ever. So if Trump is a “natural,” it would be quite a coincidence that he had so much contact with a Master Persuader of the highest caliber. As an aside, I would love to see a study of the other kids who attended Peale’s church. I’ll bet the quality of their lives is above average. But that’s just an educated guess.

- Years ago I learned of something called reticular activation. In this context, it refers to the brain’s natural ability to filter out information that you don’t need, making it is easier to spot the things you do need. That’s why you can hear someone call your name in a noisy room when you can’t make out any other words. Your name is important to you, so your brain has a sensitive filter for it. In general, we notice things that matter and ignore things that don’t. We have to do this because otherwise the environment would be sending too many signals to our little brains at the same time. After 1987, when The Art of the Deal was a huge best seller, Trump’s brain became “tuned” to the topics of negotiating and persuasion. He made negotiating his brand, and that means his brain started to recognize other persuasion methods in his environment because that was his new filter. Negotiating was important to Trump, so he was more likely to seek new information on the topic, casually and otherwise. In other words, even if you think Trump’s coauthor wrote every word of The Art of the Deal, and even if you think Trump knew little about negotiating in 1987, the fact that it became his brand virtually guaranteed he would become an expert in it over time simply because his filters were set to absorb that kind of information. And the topic is easily absorbed. It isn’t physics. I had a similar experience after taking hypnosis classes. Once my filters were set to notice persuasion, I saw it everywhere. I was more likely to notice persuasion-related headlines and to read them. I was more likely to notice persuasion in life and to analyze those situations to understand the key variables.

Once he branded himself as a great negotiator, it almost guaranteed he would learn a lot more on the topic going forward. It would be hard for a “natural” persuader to be pitch-perfect in persuasion. You might expect a natural but untrained persuader to exaggerate, play on your emotions, and use visual imagery. You would expect to see all the tricks of a car salesperson too. But all of those tricks are common knowledge, and they don’t speak to any deep training in persuasion. A highly trained persuader would display more complexity in persuasion. It would look more engineered, if you knew what you were looking for. The following chapters will lift the lid on Trump’s persuasion so you can see the engineering. It is impressive.

- Humans are visual creatures. We believe our eyes before we believe whatever faulty opinions are coming from our other senses. So if you want to persuade, use visual language and visual imagery. The difference in effectiveness is enormous. People often asked me during the election if I was being too generous about Trump’s persuasion talents. The more popular opinion of Trump at the time, and perhaps when you read this book as well, was that his so-called persuasion was little more than lying about everything that mattered. It doesn’t take much talent to lie. But people who are not trained in persuasion would miss the technique. And most of all, they would miss the consistency of it. It would be one thing if Trump used some persuasion tricks now and then.

- That’s one of a persuader’s most basic and well-known tricks: People automatically gravitate toward the future they are imagining most vividly, even if they don’t want the future they are seeing. You’ve probably experienced something similar in your own life. When you vividly imagine something you don’t want to happen, such as dropping your phone in the toilet, it can (for some people) increase the odds it will happen. Humans are visual creatures. Like moths, we are drawn to the brightest light. And the brightest light in our minds is whatever we can visualize most clearly. This sort of persuasion doesn’t work on every person in every situation. It isn’t that powerful. But in the context of a yearlong presidential campaign, in which you only need to persuade perhaps 5 percent of the public in order to win, every advantage counts.

- One of the easiest forms of persuasion involves associating one image or idea with another in a way that makes some of the goodness (or badness) of one rub off on the other. That’s the idea behind celebrity endorsements, labeling political opponents Nazis, and marketing in general. But you already knew that. What you might not know is that each of us is “marketing” all the time. If you want to be liked and respected, you have to watch your accidental associations. For example, I know people who think bathroom humor is hilarious. I’m not here to judge their sense of humor, as that is subjective. The problem is that these folks think that sharing this sort of humor is nothing more than a laugh. But it is a lot more. It is persuasion by association. And if you tell enough bathroom jokes, your friends and family will literally start subconsciously associating you with shit. They might not be aware of the accidental persuasion. The way it manifests is that suddenly your friends feel too busy to get together with you. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2136))

- The same concept holds for folks who talk endlessly about their own health problems. I care about people, and I want to know the gist of their situations. But if they dwell on it, and include visual descriptions and lots of details about their suffering, I start to see the person and the health problem as one and the same. No one wants that. When I was younger, I made all of the mistakes of association that I’m mentioning, and more. I figured that if something was funny, or appalling, it needed to be shared, all in the spirit of fun. My more experienced self tries to stick to topics that are interesting, useful, and positive. I still like jokes, obviously, but not the gross kind that lack cleverness. As a general rule, I try to fill my brain with optimistic thoughts in order to crowd out the bad ones that sometimes slip in. This is a form of self-hypnosis, using the power of association. The positive thoughts lift my energy, which in turn lifts my mood, and even my immune system. If you are trying to get past a negative thought or memory, try distracting yourself with positive images and ideas. Or change your scenery to something that has a positive vibe. You can program yourself all the way from a funk to a good mood if you change the inputs. And best of all, you can do the same to others. Fill their heads with positive thoughts and they will associate those good feelings with you. They couldn’t separate those feelings if they tried. If you want to make a good first impression, don’t jokingly complain about the traffic on the way over. Try to work into the initial conversation some positive thoughts and images. Any positivity works. If your positivity has some visual imagery, that is even better. As the old saying goes, people won’t always remember what you said, but they almost always remember how you made them feel. You’ve probably heard it said that walking a dog is a great way to meet people. That’s partly because dogs have such a powerful association with happiness, at least for dog lovers. If you love dogs, it is hard to be unhappy when you meet a new one. All of the good feelings you have had from every past dog transfer automatically to the new dog and its owner. Another easy way to influence yourself by association is to decorate your living space in a way that you find emotionally pleasing. You can train yourself to enjoy a room so much that you become happy just by walking into it. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that because your favorite color is gunmetal gray, it makes a good wall color. Ideally, you want wall colors that give you the right kind of energy for whatever you do in that room. Gray isn’t usually the right answer. PERSUASION TIP 21 When you associate any two ideas or images, people’s emotional reaction to them will start to merge over time.

- If you are just becoming acquainted with the concepts of cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias because of this book, you probably have no reliable way of sorting out Trump’s “natural” persuasion instincts from his acquired knowledge. But I think the story becomes more clear when you look at Trump’s campaign slogans and visual imagery compared with the losing effort on the Clinton side. I think all observers would agree that Trump won the branding battle. Bigly. Let’s take a look at the technique he used to do it. Trump’s famous campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” was borrowed from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign, although Trump says he wasn’t aware of it when he decided to use it. And what happened when the media figured out that Trump was borrowing from Reagan? They wrote about it. They talked about it. They tried to turn it into a criticism about unoriginality without saying that directly. And when they were done with all that chatter, you remembered one thing: Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump have a similar vision. That is a huge persuasion win, and it might have been an accident. Trump’s biggest problem at the start was that he wasn’t a career politician, and it was hard for the public to see him as one. The best persuasion solution in that situation is to graft your reputation to an outsider who not only became president but also became a legend in the job. Although Reagan had political experience as governor of California before becoming president, the public still has a reflex to think of him as an actor who became president, because that’s the more interesting story. Reagan’s success was the perfect pattern to put in people’s heads. The pattern reminded us that an outsider can become one of the most beloved presidents in American history. Trump got all of that benefit by association from the start, and it never faded. That association alone would have made Trump’s choice of slogans one of the best branding decisions of our lifetime, although as I said, it might have been an accident. But it goes deeper. Now let’s look at the words in “Make America Great Again.” This is deep engineering. You won’t see it clearly until we talk about Clinton’s competing slogans and how bad they were. Your first impression in this chapter might be that I’m trying too hard to force a smart interpretation on Trump’s choice of slogans. But wait until you see the… ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2170))

- Hillary Clinton’s persuasion game was so weak and backward on Twitter that I came up with the fun idea that her Twitter assistant must be a mole (a traitor) from the Trump campaign. The wrongness of Clinton’s persuasion attempts on Twitter was so consistent that even today I wonder if it was intentional sabotage. My Twitter followers and I enjoyed spotting the alleged work of the Mole and tweeting about it. It was more fun than serious. I was blogging and tweeting about “the Mole” for months, offering plenty of examples. I assumed that some of my writing on the topic was reaching the right people in the Clinton campaign. After all, much of the mainstream media was reading my blog. I know that because so many of them interviewed me or contacted me privately about what I wrote. So why didn’t Clinton’s social media people fix their easy-to-fix problem? That’s still a mystery to me. Maybe the right person on Clinton’s team never saw my criticisms. Or maybe the Mole was real. I doubt I will ever know. ([Location 2242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2242))

- The biggest recurring problem with Clinton’s tweets was that she repeatedly asked voters to “Imagine President Trump” doing one thing or another that they thought would be bad. In the second dimension, that approach makes perfect sense. No one wants a president who is likely to do bad things. And making you imagine those bad things is normally a good persuasion tactic. That follows a trial lawyer approach of painting a picture and inviting the jury (in this case voters) to imagine being in the scene. Usually this is a solid persuasion technique. But it wasn’t in this special case. Here’s why. If you make voters imagine a President Trump, that makes it far easier for them to . . . wait for it . . . imagine a President Trump. And making voters imagine Trump as president was exactly what Trump was trying to do. This worked perfectly to help solve his biggest problem—voters couldn’t imagine him in the job. But what about the second part of the tweet, in which we are asked to imagine Trump doing something dangerously wrong? Doesn’t that make up for the first part of the sentence? No, it doesn’t. Not even close. Persuaders know that humans put more importance on the first part of a sentence than the second part. Our first impressions are hard to dislodge. And the first impression of those tweets—lots of them—involved imagining Trump winning the election. But it gets worse. In many cases, the tweets asked voters to imagine President Trump while providing only a link to the punch line. People don’t always click links, especially if they think they know what the link will say. And once Clinton created the “Imagine President Trump” pattern, you didn’t need to click the link to know it was something negative about him. So you imagined Trump as president, as asked, and moved to the next tweet in your timeline. I’m not done yet. Clinton’s tweets also make voters “think past the sale” to a future where there is a President Trump. If you are making people wonder how Trump would perform as president, you have already sold them on the idea that he will be president. This is one of the most basic and well-known rules of persuasion. ([Location 2250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2250))

- One of the more notable persuasion failures from the Clinton campaign involved the slogan Love Trumps Hate. The first two thirds of the slogan is literally “Love Trump.” Again, human brains put more weight on the first part of a sentence than the end. On a rational level, the sentence makes perfect sense, and it says what Trump’s critics wanted it to say. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, this slogan simply told the world to either love Trump or love the things he hates, such as terrorism and bad trade deals. Google made a similar branding mistake with its initial company slogan, “Don’t Be Evil.” In the 2-D world, that slogan is playful, clear, and morally appropriate. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, Google paired its brand with evil. You can’t unsee the association. Worse yet, that sort of slogan gives the critics an… ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2267))

- Here’s another enormous persuasion problem Democrats caused for themselves in their attempt to use Trump’s campaign slogan against him on the issue of health-care reform. Once again, they made the mistake of not realizing that the first impression is the only one that counts.

Yes, the details of the sign clarify its intent to mean something else.

- One of the interesting side stories of the election involved a major player in the election campaign whom I nicknamed Godzilla. I used a nickname because I wasn’t yet sure the monster of persuasion whom I had in mind had really entered the fight. I thought I could see his paw print on Clinton’s message by the summer of 2016, but I needed more evidence before outing Godzilla in public. And by “Godzilla” I mean the Godzilla of influence. I’m talking about the one person on the planet who could take the flamethrower out of Trump’s hand, flip it around, and turn him into an orange ember. If I was right, the election was about to become a fair fight for the first time. Without Godzilla on her side, Clinton was unarmed and helpless. Once Godzilla entered the fight, all bets were off. It was the story you didn’t see on television. Not even once. And it was the only story that mattered from that point on. Everything else was second-dimension noise. Prior to the summer of 2016, while Senator Bernie Sanders was still competing for the Democratic nomination, the Clinton persuasion game was nonexistent. I have already described her campaign’s backward-persuasion tweeting and their artless campaign slogans. As far as I could tell, no one trained in persuasion was advising the Clinton team. I saw no signs of that talent whatsoever, and the signs would have been obvious to me. I told you earlier that it takes a persuader to spot a persuader. I saw nothing. I can’t say the same for the Sanders campaign. Sanders was beating expectations everywhere. He even had the best (most persuasive) television campaign ad of the election. I noted it at the time in my blog, and a Vanderbilt University study later named it the most effective ad of the election, reporting that it made people happy and hopeful.1 The ad featured optimistic-looking people streaming toward a seaside stage to see Sanders speak, all to the tune of a patriotic song by Simon & Garfunkel, “America.” It was uplifting and inspirational. It was an identity play—the strongest positive form of persuasion. It was right on message. It showed real persuasion talent—the kind I was not seeing from Clinton’s side. In the end, Sanders’s persuasion advantage was not powerful enough to stop Clinton from winning the nomination. Clinton’s fund-raising advantage and her entrenched support within the leadership of the party were… ([Location 2283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2283))

- By August I was putting a name to Godzilla because I had learned that he had advised President Obama in his 2012 campaign. When I first saw Godzilla’s fingerprints on the election, I had no idea he had ever worked on a presidential campaign. But according to the New York Times, he had. The New York Times reported in November 2012, after Obama’s unexpected victory: [The] Obama campaign also had a panel of unpaid academic advisers. The group—which calls itself the “consortium of behavioral scientists,” or COBS—provided ideas on how to counter false rumors, like one that President Obama is a Muslim. It suggested how to characterize the Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in advertisements. It also delivered research-based advice on how to mobilize voters. The article went on to say, ”The consortium included Susan T. Fiske of Princeton University; Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California, San Diego; Robert Cialdini, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University; Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago’s business school; and Michael Morris, a psychologist at Columbia.” There it was: Robert Cialdini. Author of the book Influence, the most well-known book on the power of persuasion. His new book, Pre-Suasion, was just hitting shelves around election day. I had an advance copy of his new book, signed and mailed to me by Cialdini himself. He was aware of my blogging on the topic of persuasion, and I assume he knew that I often recommended his book. In fact, both of his books are on my Persuasion Reading List in appendix A. Cialdini’s newer book, Pre-Suasion, focuses on how to prime a person to be persuaded. It teaches how to put a thought in a person’s mind that will influence the next thought in ways that would not be obvious to the untrained. I mentioned earlier a study in which volunteers were shown an image of an American flag before being asked which political candidate they preferred. The volunteers who saw the American flag immediately before they were asked to pick a candidate were far more likely to prefer a Republican. That’s pre-suasion: You add the influence before the question is even asked. And that brings me back to the word “dark.” “Dark” is pre-suasion. “Dark” primes you to see whatever Trump does next as having bad intentions. “Dark” sets your brain’s filter to see evil. “Dark” is not normal campaign talk. “Dark” is not even normal influence. “Dark” is pre-suasion.

- suasion. “Dark” is a partial fingerprint. “Dark” sounds like Cialdini’s work. Cialdini is Godzilla. Am I sure? No. But I mentioned my hypothesis to a feature writer, who tried to track Cialdini down for a response. According to the writer, the response was “No comment.” Which to my ears does not sound like a person who is not advising a candidate. Also, people who know Cialdini personally told the writer who tracked this down that he was advising Clinton. I won’t call that confirmation because I heard it from someone who heard it from someone else. But the hypothesis fits. Coincidentally—or not—I had a few direct communications with Cialdini during the election, via Twitter direct messaging. We follow each other on Twitter, and that means we can send private messages. The messages were about his new book. He asked if he could send me a prepublication copy. This is normal business for authors. You send advance copies to anyone who might say good things about the book in public. I gave him my home address to mail it. We exchanged professional compliments. That was it. At about the same time, Cialdini knew I was publicly naming him as Godzilla. My followers on social media were tweeting my Godzilla mentions to him. Breitbart ran a big article saying I had named Cialdini as a Clinton adviser. He had my contact information. He could have easily and privately told me he wasn’t advising Clinton.

- I never got a message of that type. Godzilla was in the game. Now it was a fair fight. Over the summer of 2016, Clinton’s persuasion game went from laughable to weapons grade. She painted a picture of Trump that was dark to the extreme. Clinton and her surrogates tirelessly repeated the pre-suasion word “dark.” The word came to represent all of Trump’s alleged flaws. “Dark” meant racism and authoritarianism. It meant reckless behavior. It meant inappropriate language and actions. It meant he was mentally unbalanced. It meant whatever the voters wanted it to mean, so long as it was something negative. I taught you that the second-best form of persuasion is an appeal to identity. Trump was using identity to brand his campaign as a movement for all Americans. It was strong persuasion, and it was working. The only way to top identity persuasion is with the number one best persuasion form: fear. A big fear beats every other form of persuasion. Clinton used the word “dark” to capture all of our fears in one scary package that we couldn’t forget. We’re afraid of the dark, and when Clinton was done campaigning, half of the country was afraid of Trump as well. Not just a little bit afraid. Not simply concerned that his policies would be suboptimal. This was real fear. This was fear to the bone. And it worked. Clinton started to build a solid lead over Trump in the polls.2 I told you earlier in this book that Trump brought a flamethrower to a stick fight. But now Godzilla was taking sides with the sticks. Flamethrowers won’t stop Godzilla. Clinton’s… ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2365))

Your daily experience is brimming with small annoyances. If every one of them stayed at the top of your priority list, you wouldn’t be able to get anything done.

- You see this dynamic most vividly in your personal life. When a small misunderstanding between you and a loved one plunges you into an angry mood, the bad feeling starts to wear off in a few days even if nothing changes but the passage of time. The human mind is designed to “get over it” whenever the stakes are not high. And the stakes are not high for most of what we do. This rule of persuasion helped me predict a Trump presidency a year before most observers could see it as a possibility. The most common objection I heard when Trump first announced his run was that people simply could not wrap their heads ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06X1DWK4Q&location=2393))

- around the possibility that this obnoxious monster could ever be acceptable to enough voters to become president. Most people probably assumed their initial opinions of Trump would remain stable. As a trained persuader, I assumed the opposite, because people can get used to anything if they do it long enough. I could see from the start of the election that for many people Trump’s personal style was annoying to the point of painful. I also knew the public would have a full year to get used to his personality. And I knew that the longer they experienced it, the less outrageous it would seem—at least for some portion of the public. Others would harden their resistance. But the latter group was never going to vote for Trump anyway. The people who mattered were the ones who disliked his style but didn’t yet have a final opinion about his politics. That group was going to get used to Trump’s personality over time. It was inevitable. That’s how our brains are wired. For most people, novelty wears off.

He could have said it was awful, inappropriate, insulting, sick, or any one of dozens of descriptors. But he didn’t. He reached into the third dimension and plucked out the one word with the absolute strongest persuasion power: “contempt.” I don’t have to tell you that the English language contains lots of words. But there was only one best word for this situation. Trump probably found it. He once famously said he “has the best words.” In the second dimension, that claim is false. In the third dimension, Trump does indeed have the best words. He proved it once again with his choice of the word “contempt.” It was perfect. And it wasn’t luck.

- From a persuasion perspective, we can’t ignore President Trump’s famous haircut and what I assume was a fake tan of some sort. Early on in the race, both his hair and face registered in our minds as orange. And that’s a problem if you are trying to be taken seriously as a representative of the country. But like many problems, this one presented an opportunity. Trump could solve his distracting haircut and his oversized ego with one simple act: He could shave his head. I whimsically but seriously suggested exactly that, more than a year before election day. On August 5, 2015, I blogged . . . If Trump wants the independents and some Democrats to vote his way, he needs something bigger. He needs a trump card. And he has it. His hair.
