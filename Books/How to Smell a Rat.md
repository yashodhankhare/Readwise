## Highlights
- Never hiring any form of money manager or adviser who takes custody of your assets. What does that mean? Said another way: Always make sure the decision ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=168))
- maker (who will decide what you should own, like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) has no access to the money—meaning they can’t get their hands on it directly. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=169))
- An age-old Western saying related to how to keep people from stealing things from your wide open spaces is “good fences make good neighbors.” ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=295))
- Separating the two functions—custody and decision making—is prophylactic. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=307))
- They all had access to the till. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=398))
- Past performance is no guarantee of future returns—ever. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=845))
- If your adviser (or potential adviser) makes loose ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=863))
- claims about “beating the market,” ask “Which market is that?” ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=864))
- If a manager doesn’t have a stated benchmark, or it shifts ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=868))
- around, do additional digging—that could be a bad sign. Or it could be a sign they don’t manage to a benchmark and instead try to maximize absolute return every year—hit it out of the park. Maximizing absolute return can lead to maximizing risk—which can lead to ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=868))
- outsized losses. That may not be appropriate for many investors and may or may not be appropriate for you. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=870))
- Many larger RIAs now use Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS® ) when reporting performance—simply because many larger, institutional investors started demanding it in recent years. Created by the CFA Institute, GIPS give standardized, industry-wide guidance on performance calculation and reporting. If firms report using GIPS, you can compare apples to apples and know exactly how and why the firm reports historic performance and exactly why it does it that way. Using GIPS isn’t mandatory for money managers, ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=880))
- so if a money manager doesn’t use them, it’s not a negating factor. But GIPS can be another useful due diligence tool. (For more on GIPS, go to www.gipsstandards.org.) ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=884))
- It’s just a fact: Most pros fail to beat their benchmarks over long ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=914))
- periods. There are a few, very successful pros who have done it. And even they don’t beat it each and every year.They have individual years that they lag—sometimes a few in a row. Does that mean the pros who can’t beat the market are terrible? No—it just means it’s very, ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=915))
- very hard to do. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=917))
- Most professionals lag markets over time.You know that. But most individual investors do even worse and actually by a lot. An excellent study by Dalbar Associates tracked individual investor behavior and performance. Over the 20 years ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=917))
- ending December 31, 2007, the S&P 500 index returned an annualized average 11.8 percent. But equity mutual fund investors on average got only an annualized 4.5 percent.11 ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=919))
- Why did they do so badly when it’s easy to buy the S&P 500 as a passive index and let it ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=921))
- ride? Because it isn’t easy to buy the S&P 500 and let it ride! Investors can’t take their hands off the steering wheels of their bumper cars and let their feet off the gas and the brake, so they swerve in and out of the market at the wrong times, and get a much lower return ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=921))
- than the market itself generates. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=923))
- Many investors rationally know they should turn a hard shoulder to near-term volatility and be tough—but emotions take over. They make active decisions to avoid near-term pain at the expense of longer-term returns. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=924))
- In behavioral finance, this is called myopic loss aversion—and it can cause costly errors. Passive isn’t easy—it’s hard. Few can stomach it. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=926))
- During periods of increased volatility—even during normal bull market corrections—it’s typical to see investors ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=927))
- become fearful. They fear equities will no longer get the long-term averages they once did. This is where the saying “bull markets climb a wall of worry” comes from. Investors want less volatility—more stability. Once spooked out of equities, many investors don’t ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=928))
- return—not for years and maybe not ever. They wait for a world that’s more clear. Clarity in markets, of course, always comes at a high price, so they hop out of stocks and don’t return until they’re sure the market is rebounding—missing big early returns and materially ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=930))
- impacting long-term averages—as the Dalbar study showed! This happens regularly in every market downturn and is the main reason investors on average lag the market so badly. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=931))
- My father used to love quoting Herbert H. Dow, founder of Dow Chemical, who said, “Never promote a man who hasn’t made some bad mistakes. You would be promoting someone who hasn’t done much.” Maybe your manager never ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=942))
- had a bad or down year, but I’d argue someone who hasn’t been through a bad patch or two hasn’t been managing money long enough to be very skilled—and doesn’t know emotionally how to react when it does eventually happen. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=943))
- Average returns just aren’t normal. In fact, stocks are up big—meaning ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=961))
- in excess of 20 percent—37 percent of the time. They’ve been negative 29 percent of the time. But they’ve only been in the 0 to 20 percent range a third of all years. Two-thirds of all years they’re up big or negative. Normal returns are extreme. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=962))
- It’s just not normal for stocks to have an average year—but that’s what many scamsters want you to believe because ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=965))
- it would feel good! ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=966))
- There’s no way to predict how long it takes for markets to recoup steep losses, ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=973))
- but it’s likely far faster than most presume, and then stocks typically climb to fresh highs. Always been that way. ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=974))
- Some bearish folks like to say stocks are perpetually in a “secular bear market”—meaning stocks’ long-term trend is negative. That may sell newsletter subscriptions or get you on CNBC, but think about it. Logically, it doesn’t make sense! Look at a chart of the long-term history of the stock market and immediately it’s clear that doesn’t make sense. Stocks tend to rise more than fall over time. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=975))
- Equities are likeliest ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=978))
- to give superior returns long term—but it’s never been a smooth ride. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=978))
- If someone sells you on ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=987))
- getting market-like or better returns and never experiencing a negative year—run away! This almost certainly is a scam. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=987))
- But, ironically, it’s this same tendency to want to get out and flee the market at and around its lows that uncovers most Ponzi ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=995))
- schemes. When investors get most afraid and want to go to cash, they liquidate their investments in Ponzi schemes to get cash. When they do that, the Ponzi scheme can’t cover the redemptions with new money because new investors are too afraid to put money into the ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=996))
- market. No (or few) new investors and a flood of redemptions and the Ponzi operator can’t pay off those departing and gets discovered for what he is. This is why most major Ponzi schemes get discovered late in a bear market or early in a new bull market. Pessimism is high and ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=998))
- the scamster can’t find new suckers to pay off the old suckers. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=999))
- The bear market uncovers the schemes, and the uncovering of the schemes makes investors more bearish. Ultimately, this is all part of the process that makes a bear market culminate in pessimism that is oversold and rolls over into the ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1008))
- beginning of the next bull market. That won’t change. By the time we’ve ended the next bull market, we will have a new crop of swindlers to uncover. Always have been, always are, and always will be. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1010))

- A 2001 Barron’s article (a full eight years before he was outed!) lifted this description of Madoff ’s strategy straight from his marketing materials: Typically, a position ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1068))
- will consist of the ownership of 30 to 35 S&P 100 stocks, most correlated to that index, the sale of out-of-the-money calls on the index and the purchase of out-of-the-money puts on the index. The sale of the calls is designed to increase the rate of ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1070))
- return, while allowing upward movement of the stock portfolio to the strike price of the calls. The puts, funded in large part by the sale of the calls, limit the portfolio’s downside.1 Excuse me! But based on the ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1072))
- performance he was claiming, finance theory says that is completely impossible, unless you have some underlying strategy for precisely timing put and call sales—in which case you don’t even need the 30 to 35 S&P 100 stocks. (Which, by the way, constitute a third of ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1075))
- the very biggest, most efficiently traded, and hardest to out-think-the-market US stocks. If there was ever a way to predict stock movements and that of their puts and calls relative to the market, it would least likely work on these stocks. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1077))
- This is no “underlying” strategy; it’s just a lying strategy. In the long term, put and call prices for the biggest, most liquid stocks by definition must offset each other. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1079))
- They’re the flip sides of the same coin and therefore there’s no way in hell the puts can be “funded in large part by the sale of the calls.” ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1080))
- A strategy to time sales of puts and calls is, by definition, no different than timing trades of the underlying stocks. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1082))
- If I had a strategy that could do that consistently, I’d own the world in no time at all. So would you, and you would never think about ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1083))

- bad sign—or it’s something more sinister—a quite terrible sign. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1088))

- Some of those folks, usually perfectly honest and reputable men and women, are in every field from medicine to law to politics to education (ok, not politics, I was off base there)—but 100 percent of financial embezzlers ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1091))
- do it. If you press them, they devolve to mumbo jumbo. If you get mumbo-jumbo answers, get leery. Look at Bernie’s jive. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1092))
- Using collars isn’t necessarily a red flag. Some folks like them because you can’t make or lose much. Personally, I think they’re inefficient, costly, and there are a ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1111))

- To my knowledge, there’s simply no money manager of any form of any material size who’s had any long-term, market-beating success using primarily or even heavily “split-strike conversions” and doing little else. But I’ve been in this ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1118))
- industry 37 years and am battled-scarred and jaundiced by years of observation. How can an Average Joe know if a trading tactic is suspicious? More important, how can you know? Like a Hammer to the Head ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1120))
- Easy—always be cynical about flashy-sounding tactics and murky strategies. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1123))
- Collars aren’t bad. But they aren’t a strategy at all; they’re tactics. A tool—neither inherently good or bad. Like a hammer! Hammers are great for ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1123))
- nails, not so good for screws, and downright dangerous if someone’s coming at you with the claw end aimed at your head. A hammer won’t help you eat ice cream. It’s all in the application. Used appropriately, fine. Used indiscriminately, bad. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1124))
- Derivatives are any security whose value derives from the price movement of something else—whether it’s a stock, bond, ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1127))
- commodity, loan, mortgage, you name it. If used properly, well, and when appropriate, derivatives can be very useful. If misused, they can be pricey or even seriously ding returns. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1128))
- The derivatives most investors run into are options—whether puts or calls—and can be ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1130))
- on single stocks or even indexes.There are myriad ways to combine options—collars, straddles, butterflies, strangles, iron condors (how’s that for mumbo jumbo?), on and on. I needn’t detail them all here; you can find straightforward descriptions on any ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1130))
- finance website (even on iron condors). ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1132))
- Beyond options there are endless trading tactics—selling short, going double long, buying futures, forwards, swaps, on and on. Some tactics are just more appropriate for certain investors than others. And certain tactics ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1135))
- make more sense under specific market conditions. Most important, indiscriminate use of any tactic is a red flag. But so is any strategy description not rooted in sound finance. Another way to say that: If it sounds suspicious, maybe it is. If it sounds like mumbo ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1137))

- social event. He went down that path. When I heard him say in that very short time period—over just one drink—that he never lost money in stocks, it was perfectly obvious I didn’t need to and shouldn’t have another drink with him. Not to me, but to others, he even ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1150))

- stocks can only go to zero.You can only make 100 percent on an un-levered basis. But if you buy the right stock or other asset, you can make much more than 100 percent. So, unless you’re Jim Chanos, selling short as your only tactic is basically a loser’s game in my ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1180))
- view. Thought through another way, since stocks have risen over history a lot more than they’ve fallen, it just doesn’t make sense that selling short gets consistently big positive returns. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1181))
- Anything unusual when it comes to fees is a red flag. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1198))
- If someone’s fees are low—much lower than other comparable managers or alternatives—it’s not necessarily the bargain of the century. It’s likely too good to be true. First, you generally get what you pay for. Second, no one works for free. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JMV6CI&location=1200))
- That manager could be getting paid to recommend certain products not necessarily in your best interests. Or he could be paid by embezzling. Both bad! Be sure to ask how your adviser is compensated.
