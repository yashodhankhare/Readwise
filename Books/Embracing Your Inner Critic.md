## Highlights
- On the journey of self-discovery, let us stop looking for what is wrong with us. Let us discover, instead, who we are and how we work! Let us put our judgment aside as we explore the amazing system of selves within us and learn to live with ever-increasing honesty, choice, and freedom.

- The Inner Critic is like the bit of mirror that makes us see a distorted picture. It is that inner voice that criticizes us and speaks about us in a disparaging way. It makes everything look ugly. Most of us are not even aware that it is a voice or a self speaking inside of us because its constant judgments have been with us since early childhood and its running critical commentary ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=62))

- feels like a natural part of ourselves. It develops early in our lives, absorbing the judgments of the people around us and the expectations of the society in which we live. When we talk about this critical voice, please keep in mind that this Inner Critic is the voice within us that criticizes us, whereas the Judge is the self within us that criticizes other people.

- The great similarity we have noted among all the Inner Critics of the world is their ability to cripple people and to keep them unhappy and ineffective. Although it is interesting to think of what life would be like without this critical voice, in reality we can never get rid of it, nor would we want to. As we shall see in the course of this book, the Critic can become our ally once we learn to ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=78))

- YOU CANNOT PLEASE YOUR INNER CRITIC No matter how much you try, you cannot please your Inner Critic. No matter how much you listen to it and try to change yourself in the way that it wants, it follows you and grows stronger. It is exactly like a parent who has been critical of you. Nothing that you do is okay. It is also like a dragon that keeps growing more heads as long as you do not deal with it. The harder you try to change yourself, the stronger it gets. Try to please it, and it will grow. The answer is to learn how not to play the game, and that is what this book is about—learning not to play the critic game.

- The Inner Critic has been with us since we were small children. It was born early in our lives in an attempt to protect us and keep us safe. What is important for us to realize here is that the Inner Critic has been broadcasting like a radio station ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=87))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- since we were small children, announcing all the things that are wrong with us. We call this station KRAZY. Since it has been broadcasting for decades, the vast majority of us no longer hear it, for it is like background music and we no longer notice that it is playing. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=88))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It often happens that when people become aware of the Inner Critic and finally begin to catch hold of station KRAZY, they will say to us, “You know, I’ve heard that voice all my life. I just thought it was me!” We say to you unequivocally that the Inner Critic is not you! It is a voice in you that has developed for specific reasons. It is not a voice that has to run your life forever! ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=90))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- As we shall see, many different selves make up our individual persons. The reason that we give the Inner Critic superstar billing is that it is the one voice in us that is able to stop our personal growth entirely, or at least to stunt it severely. It blocks our ability to live a creative life. How does this happen? ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=94))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The original issue is lost and the Critic is now the problem. Once you understand that this is the voice of your Inner Critic, that radio station KRAZY is playing, then you have choices and it is possible to begin to take greater control over this area of your life. You can learn to turn down the volume or turn off the radio. You can learn to change to another station. Eventually, you can even learn to change the nature of the programming on this station. You can learn to change the behavior and attitude of this Inner Critic. First, however, you must learn to hear the music.

- In considering where the Inner Critic came from, always keep in mind that the Inner Critic’s original function is to spare us shame and pain. This will help to keep things clear as we explore the development of the Critic and its purpose in our lives. In the growing-up process your parents have to ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=111))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- teach you to look good and to behave appropriately in order to succeed in the world, both at home and in the workplace. After all, who would be to blame if you turned out badly? So your parents look at you, try their best to figure out what is wrong with you, and then do what they can to fix it. The same is true of relatives, teachers, religious leaders, people at your workplace, and general acquaintances. Being fixed, and trying to fix others, is a major part of human interactions. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=113))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Parents need to succeed in making you a proper person—whatever that means to them—in order to feel good about themselves. Underneath all this is their own insecurity and their own fear of failure as parents. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=125))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- There are lots of things about you that your parents want to change just because they are who they are! No matter what their motivation, the basic message you receive from your parents in all of this is: “There is something wrong with you.” The implication is that if only you would improve yourself all would go well for you. In order to protect ourselves from the pain and the shame of always being found less than we should be, a voice develops within us that echoes the concerns of our parents, our church, or of other people who were important to us in our early years. We literally develop a “self,” a separate subpersonality, that criticizes us before our parents—or anyone else, for that matter—can! The Inner Critic is a self (or subpersonality) that develops to protect us from being shamed or hurt. It is extremely anxious, almost desperate, for us to succeed in the world and to be accepted and liked by others. It is not the only self ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=131))

- that lives within us. You can read in detail about our many selves, how they develop, and how they operate in relationships in our books, Embracing Our Selves and Embracing Each Other. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=138))

- If you listen carefully, you can hear it whispering in your ears at most any time. Here are some of its favorite statements: The trouble with you is…. You’re basically ugly. Nothing you ever do will help. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=144))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You’re not really loveable. Or, Nobody really likes you. You’re selfish. You’re mean. You’re basically flawed. You look dreadful. You’re fat. You’re flabby. You’re too short. Nobody takes short people seriously. You’re getting old. That outfit is all wrong. You look ridiculous. You have no talent. You’re boring. You shouldn’t have said that. If you didn’t work twice as hard as everyone else, you’d never make it. You need to have your nose done. You may have fooled them into thinking you’re smart, but wait until they find out the truth about how little you really know. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=146))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You are really a fake underneath it all. These are just a few of the Inner Critic’s statements. The Inner Critic uses words in powerful ways. One its favorite words is mistake. It dearly loves this word. “That was a mistake. I should not have gone to lunch. I should not have sent that letter. I should not have eaten that sandwich. I should have said yes to that invitation.” Behind all these “should nots” and “shoulds” is the basic assumption that we erred, that we made a mistake. A mistake is unacceptable and we feel miserable whenever we think we have made one. In looking at the Critic’s use of language, we must not forget the word symptom and other related ways of describing things. Extra weight becomes a symptom. Having too much to eat becomes a symptom. A headache becomes a symptom. Too much coffee becomes an addiction. A strong attachment to another person becomes addictive behavior. The need for others, which is universal, becomes codependency, a new diagnostic category. It is not that there is no merit in some of these terms. They have proven very helpful to people who are combating certain kinds of behavior. The problem is that the Inner Critic ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=155))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- picks these terms up and uses them as weapons against our growth. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=164))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- But, like a renegade CIA agent, at some point the Critic oversteps its bounds, takes matters into its own hands, and begins to operate on its own agenda. The information, which was originally supposed to be for your overall defense and to promote your general well-being, is now being ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=177))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- used against you, the very person it was meant to protect. With the Critic’s original aims and purposes forgotten, all that is left for it is the excitement of the chase and the wonderfully triumphant feeling of conquest, as it operates secretly and independently of any outside control.

- The Inner Critic kills your creativity. How can you possibly try anything new or different when you know that you will do something wrong? The Inner Critic, on an inner level, is the source of low self-esteem. How can you possibly feel good about yourself when you have a voice inside of ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=185))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- you that is telling you nonstop what is wrong with you? The Inner Critic is a source of shame. It finds every aspect of the natural “you” unsatisfactory, and it is relentlessly trying to change everything. There is no part of you that can avoid its piercing gaze—even the depths of your feelings, dreams, and impulses that you might be able to hide from the outside world. The Inner Critic can make you depressed. If your Critic is running your life without any balance coming in from elsewhere, its constant barrage of criticism can be extremely debilitating and discouraging. This can lead to physical and psychological exhaustion and depression. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=188))

- and will, to some extent, affect our behavior. In addition to this, we are born with our own “psychic fingerprint,” a unique and indefinable but clear quality that identifies us and makes us different from everyone else. It is this quality that you think of when you think of a particular person. It has nothing to do with physical appearance or behavior; it is far more subtle. This psychic fingerprint is carried by our initial self, the Vulnerable Child who will be with us throughout our lives. Last, but not least, we are born with the inherent capacity to develop any number of selves. These selves are the building blocks of the personality we will have as we grow older. As infants, we are extremely sensitive and quite open to everything that happens around us and to us. We are totally dependent upon others for the love and the care that we need to survive. We are in a state of complete vulnerability. Without proper caretaking, we will not live to… ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=196))

- personality is made up of a group of subpersonali ties, or selves, that helps us to fit into our environment. These selves are called “primary selves” because they are primary in our lives—they determine who we are and how we act. As we develop these primary selves, we move away from our initial psychic fingerprint and we adapt to the world around us. Imagine an infant in the crib. It wants to feel good, to be smiled at, picked up, and hugged. There is someone, a mother, looking down at it. The infant discovers that when it… ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=204))

- Now that the Pleaser has become a primary self, opposite energies (or selves) must be kept away so that the Pleaser can do its job properly. The infant learns that when it is unhappy or angry and it cries loudly, it will be ignored or, perhaps, spanked. At best, its mother will try to stop its crying, but she is not the same happy loving mother that responds to the Pleaser. The crying makes her tense and irritable, and the world just does not feel as good as it did when the Pleaser was in charge. So the infant learns that crying is bad and anger becomes what we call a disowned self. The disowned… ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=214))

This Aware Ego is then in a position to take over gently from the primary selves that have cared for us over the years and to assure them that it can keep us safe. The development of this awareness and of an Aware Ego to replace the Ego that has been operating is an extremely important aspect of Inner Child work.

- Each of us has a Rule Maker who makes up the rules about what kind of person we should be and what kinds of characteristics are unacceptable.

- would probably want you to be sensible, successful, hardworking, honest, dependable, an achiever, fairly well behaved, cheerful, outgoing, self-assured, attractively dressed, and neatly groomed. These qualities will be reflected in your primary selves. Your Rule Maker will probably not want you to be lazy, sloppy, angry, too sexual, too emotional, loud, inappropriate, shy, unattractive, dishonest, or selfish. These equal and opposite qualities will become your disowned selves. Your Critic works hand in glove with this Rule Maker. It is your Critic’s job to help you to live up to the standards set by your Rule Maker who, generally speaking, sounds like the voices of parents and society blended together on an inner level. Your Critic will keep a close eye on you to be sure that you do not fall below the standard that has been set. Needless to say, the standard is impossible… ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=236))

- To learn to handle the Inner Critic means that we also must learn to separate from the Rule Maker. For instance, if the Rule Maker wants us to be competent and self-assured, the Critic will review our behavior and find any signs, either overt or covert, of incompetence or insecurity.

- THE PUSHER The Pusher is another major primary self in many of us and a great teammate of the Inner Critic. It usually develops to help us do well at school. The Pusher’s job is to get us to achieve, to meet goals, to keep moving forward in life. It helps us to get ahead in the world. The Pusher is never satisfied. We can always do more or do it faster or better. It sets ever-changing requirements for us. Just as we reach the goal line, wherever it may be, the Pusher… ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=248))

- we are like racing dogs running after an artificial rabbit that we can never catch. Your Pusher has developed as a primary self to gain recognition for you and to assure your success in the world. In our culture, we admire the person who does the most, who sets the records. Our parents try very hard to get us to be hard workers, and it must be admitted that most of us would not accomplish much without the aid of a Pusher. But the Pushers of the world have a tendency to be a bit too ambitious. We have noticed that New Age Pushers absolutely love bookstores. We estimate that a large percentage of books are purchased by the Pushers of the world, especially the New Age Pushers. Once we have the books that the Pusher buys, the Critic joins the team and criticizes us for not reading them, for not reading them carefully enough, for forgetting what we have read, or for not underlining properly.

- THE PERFECTIONIST The Perfectionist is another common primary self that develops to help us succeed in the world. It wants us to look perfect, act perfect, and be perfect in all that we do. It will not tolerate a shoddy job and will drive us to distraction, redoing and redoing everything until it is just right. Nothing is less important than anything else. It is just as important to play perfectly during a friendly tennis volley as in the final match of a tournament. If something is worth doing, it is worth doing perfectly. And that is all there is to that. Perfect is perfect. If our goal is perfection, then whose job is it to find the imperfections? You’ve guessed it, it is our friend, the Inner Critic! If the Perfectionist sets the… ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=262))

- Critic with its eagle eye and its superior intelligence will find every mistake, awkwardness, or problem and point it out to us with glee. So, as you can see from these examples, our Inner Critic is not alone but will play ball with any of the primary selves that dominate our lives. IF THESE ARE ALL SELVES, THEN WHO ARE WE? Before we discover that we are made up of selves, we think that our primary selves are who we are. We think that the set of primary selves, the personality, that we have developed to protect us truly represents us. If I have a strong Perfectionist and a strong Pusher as two of my primary selves, I just assume that I am a perfectionistic and hardworking person, and that perhaps I’m even a bit driven. Often we allow our lives to be run by our Rule… ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=269))

- Once we become aware of our primary selves, we are able to begin to separate from them and to pick up the information and the feelings of the disowned selves on the opposite side. Or, to use the analogy of the car, we take over control of the car from the primary selves, rescue the disowned selves from the trunk, and drive our own psychological car with all of these selves as passengers. This is the position of an Aware Ego. It is only from an Aware Ego, when we have access to the opposites… ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=280))

- The separation from your primary selves is the first step in developing an Aware Ego. This Aware Ego is not a self. It is a “you” that is not dominated by any self or set of selves. It is able to contain all the opposites that you are, to accept and to honor them appropriately. It moves you beyond duality. It is a process, not a goal. Your Aware Ego will not remain with you at all times because it disappears each time your primary selves take over. Your primary selves will automatically take over to protect you when you are vulnerable. You can think of them as providing a much-needed safety net. The Aware Ego gives you the ability to discover the complexity of your feelings and the richness of the many selves that inhabit your psyche. It also enables you to move in closer and closer to your own psychic fingerprint and to reclaim the unique human being that you were born to be. If you wish, you can read more about the Aware Ego in our previous writings. In reading this book, you are doing a very important piece of work. You are separating from your Inner Critic, one of your primary selves, and developing an Aware Ego in relation to that particular self. As you do so, you no longer need to be the victim of your Inner Critic and you are able to operate from an Aware Ego in one very important aspect of your life—in evaluating yourself and your behavior. Stones’ Warning: Trying to live life from an Aware Ego gives the Inner Critic the best food of all! Inner… ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=285))

- You have learned about the fact that we are made up of different selves. You are beginning to get some feel for how these selves develop and how important it is to learn about their ways of operating in your life. Early in our own relationship with each other we needed to find a way to explore ourselves and to help each other in this exploration. It was out of this need to more ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=396))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- deeply understand ourselves and to deepen our own relationship that we began to talk to the different selves in each other. We took turns “facilitating” each other. (Facilitating means talking to the other person’s selves.) In those early days, we spent hundreds of hours discovering the amazingly widespread and rich family of selves that lived inside of each of us. When it was Sidra’s turn to be subject, Hal would first spend some time talking with her to see what kinds of issues she wanted to deal with. Once there was a sense of what self or selves needed to be dealt with, he would ask her to change her physical position, to actually move to the place where that self or voice was sitting. Hal then would begin a dialogue with this particular voice. Having a dialogue with a voice means that Hal would begin to talk to a particular voice in Sidra and that voice would talk back to Hal. From this in-depth conversation the voice received the opportunity to express its feelings and ideas in great detail. These dialogues might last only five or ten minutes, or they might go on for one or two hours. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=399))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When it was Hal’s turn to be subject, the procedure would be reversed. Sidra would be the facilitator and she would ask Hal to move over to the place where a specific self (like the Pusher) would sit. She would then carry on a conversation with that particular voice. After this dialogue ended, Hal would move back to his original chair. From this position, it would be possible to view and experience the different selves that had emerged in the facilitation process. In the course of these dialogues, no attempt is made to change the view or feelings of the different parts or selves. If two selves have different viewpoints, no attempt is made to have them talk to each other or become friends with one another. In this way, both the subject and the facilitator have an opportunity to learn how to live with the many paradoxes of life. After each of these sessions was over, we found that we were able to become much more separated from and objective about the different selves in us. We learned to honor all of them. The idea was not to try to get rid of parts that we did not like, something we had both tried to do for years. The idea was to embrace all of them and learn ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=407))

- to use all of them with a new kind of awareness. That is how we developed the idea of the Aware Ego. The Aware Ego is the part of us that is always changing as it becomes more aware of and experiences the different selves and then gradually learns how to use them in life with real choice. We learned too that the more we tried to make a part go away, the stronger it became. We discovered that there were many people who recognized the Inner Critic, for example, and who were always trying to make it go away because they hated it so much. The more they would try to rid themselves of the Critic, the stronger it would grow inside. The trick, we learned, was to let the parts speak, to understand who they were and how they developed, and to learn how to use them properly in life. Another thing that we discovered in working with each other was how real these selves were. As we have said, they behave as though they are real people, each with its own hopes, feelings, and ambitions. Most of them have a real sense of how we should live our lives. What was different about our experience with each other from our prior experience was this sense of their absolute reality. The Inner Child, the Inner Critic, the Responsible Parent—each of these was no longer just a part or subpersonality. They were real, live people to us, and the more we explored, the more amazed we became. What started out as coexploration between us became ultimately the method that we have called Voice Dialogue. We have described this method in considerable detail in our book Embracing Our Selves, and we refer the interested reader to this book for a full discussion of the method and the theory. The reason that we bring this to your attention now is that in this book on the Inner Critic we will be using Voice Dialogue to show you conversations that we have had with the Inner Critic. You will have a chance to read about how the Critic feels and sounds and the kinds of things that it is saying constantly inside the minds of people. The more that you hear and read about the voice of the Inner Critic, the easier it will be to hear your own Critic and to begin the ever-important process of separating from it.

- So often when the Critic speaks to us it is as though a sin has been committed, a crime has been perpetrated, or a dark and evil deed has been done.

- When the Inner Critic speaks to us, it does so in a particular way. It makes pronouncements. It does not simply give opinions or express feelings about things. It makes absolute pronouncements. It sounds as though a voice from the heavens is handing down absolute truths to us—something like the Ten Commandments. This ability to make itself sound like absolute truth is one of the reasons that the Critic is so difficult to deal with. The major problem in dealing with the Critic is, of course, the fact that most of us do not have the foggiest notion that it is speaking to us.

- Even when we are aware of its voice, we usually have no separation from it because it sounds like it has the truth of heaven behind it. For example, let us go back to the peanut butter party that we spoke about in chapter 1. The Critic says to our midnight snacker, “You are a slob. You do not have an ounce of control and you never will.” If the snacker happens to be in the field of health and healing, the Critic might add, “And you are supposed to be helping people? I cannot believe you!” The fundamental doctrine that is being advanced by the Critic is as follows: 1. You have no business eating at night. 2. You should have perfect control at all times. 3. Normal people would not do this. 4. A health care professional, in particular, should have more control. 5. Problems of any kind are bad. A sin has been committed. A crime has been perpetrated. A dark and evil deed has been done. The effect of this kind of statement is profound. You feel like a slob. You become a slob. You feel out of control.

Its comments become a kind of judgment from heaven above. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=460))

- During the falling-in-love period, with the accompanying joy of romantic love, these Inner Critics generally fall asleep for a period of time. The other person loves us unconditionally and we love him or her unconditionally. Our Inner Children flower and feel safe and the garden grows because there is no one around to stomp on it. Having someone love you unconditionally and having this person’s full attention focused upon you is a soporific for the Inner Critic.

My thighs are too big.” To remain identified with this Critic is to live in prison. To separate from it—to recognize that these critiques are coming from a voice, from a person who lives inside of you—is to leave this dungeon of despair. The conversation we have given you is just a plain, ordinary, everyday dialogue. There is nothing special or unique about it. It is going on in the heads of people much of the time.

- were somewhat limited. What is important to realize about the Inner Critic as it operates in most of us today is that it has grown up in the New Age of psychology and it has absorbed an amazing amount of information about the way we should and should not be. As we have seen, the Critic works closely with the Rule Maker, the Pusher, and the Perfectionist, three very important selves in us. The Rule Maker is the person who figures out the way we should be in the world in order to make things safe for us. The Perfectionist sees that we do it properly. The Pusher jams us to see that things are done right away and that we keep doing more and more things. The Critic then plays off these three selves and criticizes us when it feels that we are not playing the game correctly, which is most of the time.

Life itself ceases to be fun as the New Age Pusher and Critic lead people into this merry-go-round of New Age consciousness. It is not that the ideas themselves are bad.

- THE INNER CRITIC AND THE RULE MAKER It is clear from this conversation that in order to understand the Inner Critic, we must understand the system of rules under which a person operates in the world. The rules under which Jane operates are as follows. 1. One must be loving at all times. 2. Anger is bad. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=755))

- 3. In particular, anger at one’s children is terrible. 4. In meditation one should be free of all extraneous thought. 5. One’s marriage should be basically loving at all times. Think of the consequences of these rules. It is like saying to someone, “Stand in the corner and do not think of an elephant!” Try as you may, you will think of an elephant, and the harder you try, the harder it will be to get the elephant out of your head. Try to be loving all the time, and you will be engorged with negativity. Try always to keep your mind clear while meditating, and you will be invaded by thoughts and fantasies. Try always to be loving to your children, and you will be invaded periodically by negative feelings that will assault you. The more shoulds and shouldn’ts we have from the Rule Maker, the more ammunition the Inner Critic has because one of its primary functions is to uphold these rules.

- Arnie has a different kind of Critic. He is the kind of person who is always reacting and telling people how he feels about them. His Rule Maker requires him to be tough, but he has another voice that wants him to be sensitive to people’s needs. His Critic attacks him for hurting people and for being insensitive to their feelings and needs. He initially was a shy, introverted youngster, and as he grew up he was very sensitive and quite vulnerable. Since he had to live on the streets of New York, being soft and sensitive did not work for him. It got him beaten up with great regularity, so he had to learn how to be tough and hard. Softness meant pain. The vulnerability, shyness, and tenderness that operated early in his life was buried and is now unavailable to Arnie. But the Inner Critic plays off this sensitivity. It is afraid that his anger, reactivity, and hardness result in people not liking him, which in fact is often the case. Critics are very ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=771))

- We could go on for hours listing these comments of the Critic. We have heard each of them hundreds of times during our Voice Dialogue work. What a field day all this is for the therapy profession! What therapist, counselor, or teacher can go hungry with such goings-on? To teach anything in personal growth work or to study personal growth work without an understanding of the Critic and how it works is going to add to the power and the strength of the Critic! As a client or student, too much of what is transmitted in books and workshops and therapy becomes dogma for the Rule Maker/Critic combination. For the teacher or therapist too much gets communicated in a way that lends itself to the interpretation of the Critic. The emphasis of too much therapy and too much personal growth work is on trying to find out what is wrong with people and then fixing them. This fundamental attitude is one of the main reasons why people can come out of extensive personal growth work with Critics that weigh three thousand pounds. So long as therapists and teachers are parental “knowers,” Inner Critics will gain weight.

It is the energy behind it that is central to our understanding. A Critic may say to you, “That really did not work out very well!” You feel depressed and down. You focus on what did not work out and why. That is not the issue. The issue is that someone is hurting you. No matter how good or how well-meant the reaction of the Critic, if it is said with a knife (or choke hold or hit on the head) then the issue is to recognize the… ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=803))

- It is not that people are unaware of being critical of themselves. You will hear people say all the time, “I’m very critical of myself about this or that.” However, it is not “I” who is critical of me, it is my Critic who is critical of me. That is the step we must learn to take. Every time we become aware that we are critical of ourselves, we must take the next step. We must be smarter and more aware than the Critic. We must learn to step back into our Aware Ego and say, “That is not me who is critical of myself. That is my old, tried-and-true friend, the Inner Critic. He (or she or it) is the one who is criticizing me. He must be feeling vulnerable or anxious about something. I shall have to talk to him and find out what he is upset about. Otherwise he will stay at me all day.” In this way we support the process of separation from the Critic, we help to alleviate the anxiety of the Critic, and gradually we help transform the Critic into a part of our creative and discerning mind that can operate under our control.

- When someone in our environment criticizes us, we are fighting a difficult battle. We have the person outside of us to deal with, and we have the person inside us, who is invisible and unknown to us, to deal with as well. We may feel the pain of the outer criticism, but we will not be able to find the focus of the pain and anguish caused by our inner adversary because it is invisible. Generally we just feel depressed, anxious, vaguely upset, headachy, or without energy. Once the cloak of invisibility of the Inner Critic is lifted, then our dealings with the judges of the outer world can change very much in our favor. Imagine dealing with an adversary standing in front of you when an invisible man is standing behind you hitting you on the head and choking you at the same time! The core of the outer judgments goes something like this: “The trouble with you is …!” ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=869))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- This is the lament and litany of the judges of the world. It is fixed in our minds like a religious mantra. The trouble with you is …! The trouble with you is …! The trouble with you is …! For many people it starts in early childhood and never stops for a moment throughout the rest of their lives. If we grow up with this litany on the outside, then the Inner Critic develops a corresponding music. Sung to whatever melody it chooses, the Inner Critic’s refrain is always the same as the outer judgments: The trouble with you is…. The trouble with you is…. The trouble with you is…. At some level this is always part of the core feeling of a Critic Attack. Not all judgments toward us are overt, however. We receive a great deal of negativity from our environment in ways that arc much more subtle. For example, John comes home from work, and after he gets settled in for a few minutes he asks his wife, “Did you get a chance to pick up my shirts today?” It sounds like an innocent question, but so often in relationships these kinds of questions have a hidden agenda. What he is feeling, underneath the question, is the real issue. Many people have a difficult time expressing ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=875))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- their real feelings to each other. Every unspoken feeling has the possibility of becoming a judgment directed toward the other person. A direct reaction may sting, but it at least lets us know something of the reality of the person who is expressing the feeling. Silent judgments do their work without our knowledge. Mary feels guilty when John asks about his shirts. She becomes apologetic and contrite. She is responding like a daughter to an unconscious judgment underlying John’s question. Her Critic is agreeing with his silent judgment and attacking her from within. However, what John is really feeling underneath is that she is not paying enough attention to him, that she is neglecting his needs, that she spends too much time with the children and with her friends. He knows nothing of these feelings or of his vulnerability in general. The judgmental voice in him is his refuge so that he does not have to feel hurt by her. The general rule might be expressed this way: Whenever someone is not in touch with his or her vulnerability in relationship to another person, one may expect a judgment, silent or spoken, as a way of dealing with the situation. Unconscious vulnerability is a very dangerous commodity for this reason. Sam and Helen are having dinner at a restaurant. It is a rather elegant restaurant and Helen feels vulnerable here because she feels some inadequacy about her physical appearance. She is not, however, aware of her own discomfort. She starts to feel quite judgmental about the way that Sam is eating. She looks at him and thinks that he is sloppy and without grace. She is very concerned with what the other people who are watching might think of his manners.… ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=883))

- Any condition of stress is a flash point for the Inner Critic. Here again the Inner Critic responds to vulnerability. It is always playing off our vulnerability because, as we have seen, it was born to protect it. Stress always leaves us more vulnerable if we have not learned how to handle it properly. Stress is often related to a condition of being over-tired or fatigued. Fatigue, too, makes us more vulnerable than usual. Stress and fatigue tend to diminish the coping ability of the stronger sides of our personality. Whenever our basic coping mechanisms are not working properly, we are more vulnerable and the Inner Critic is likely to attack us for not “being together” or not being strong enough or not having control of a situation or being too unfocused or ten thousand other descriptive phrases that it knows so well how to use.

Economic instability is an important factor here. Whenever we are experiencing economic difficulties, we are much more likely to feel the power of the Critic. Each of these examples of adverse fortune represents a powerful threat, which activates our vulnerability and invites in the Inner Critic, who forever lives in terror of abandonment and not being able to make it in the world. The more terrorized it feels, the more vicious will be its attack on us. It is our job to learn to see underneath these attacks and to discover the very soft, tender, and terrified core that lies beneath the tough, aggressive, and attacking bravado of our Critic friend. Killer rage and vulnerability are two sides of a coin, whether that rage be directed outwardly or inwardly. As we have said before and we will say again, disowned vulnerability makes for a very dangerous playmate! ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=932))

- DO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE TRIGGER CRITIC ATTACKS? Is there someone in your life who consistently brings on Critic Attacks in you? If so, something in this relationship is not working properly for you. Perhaps the other person is carrying one of your disowned selves. When you overvalue another person so that just being with that person makes you feel inferior, it is often a sign that the other carries a disowned self. To check this out, do the second part of the disowned self exercise at the end of Chapter 1. You might find that this other person carries a self that you have disowned over the years. For example, whenever Eleanor is with Alicia, a woman who is always elegantly attired, Eleanor begins to feel like a slob. Her Critic is saying something like, “You look pretty frumpy next to her. Nobody is going to notice you, and if they do, they’ll see how much better she looks.” Soon ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=939))

- Eleanor’s Critic is moving into other areas of her life and a full-scale Critic Attack is under way. Now, Eleanor is a woman whose primary self values sobriety, simplicity, and hard work. This self believes that paying attention to the way she looks would be wasteful and in decidedly poor taste. Eleanor’s primary self would disapprove of any time or money spent on what it would consider superficial and useless activities. Eleanor, therefore, has no choice about her appearance. It is her primary self that makes these decisions for her, and it is her Critic who supports these decisions. Therefore, Eleanor’s Critic Attacks are signaling Eleanor that she is ignoring an entire aspect of her own personality, the part of her that, like Alicia, would simply love to spend time on her appearance. Perhaps this person who usually triggers Critic Attacks in you has a primary self that characteristically puts down other people and must always feel superior to them. Or perhaps this person reminds you of your parents or of a powerful sibling and this memory re-activates your Critic’s anxiety for your safety. As you think about this, you can use this person as a teacher to help you ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=946))

If someone in your life consistently triggers Critic Attacks, it is time for you to discover what this kind of relationship is all about, whether through your own personal work or with the help of a psychotherapist. There is no need to remain in the state of misery that this kind of relationship creates. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=954))

- DEALING WITH CRITIC ATTACKS At the end of this chapter, we have included some suggestions about noting the times and places of your own Critic Attacks. In looking over these times and places, you may discover interesting patterns. Often attacks occur when people are hungry, tired, or lonesome. If so, it is a good idea to start to pay attention to your eating and sleeping patterns. You might also pay attention to your social contacts to be sure that you spend enough time with others so that you are not lonely. Some kinds of food bring on Critic Attacks. We have known people who are particularly susceptible to attacks after eating sugar or consuming caffeine in one form or another. Sometimes Critic Attacks result from the food itself. Sometimes they can be a function of the New Age Critic telling us that sugar and caffeine are bad for us. Some people get Critic Attacks after drinking just because of the effect of the alcohol itself. Each of us is different, and you might use your Critic Attacks to get an idea of what it is that you are doing that really does not agree with you. You might find that you are particularly susceptible at certain times of the day or night. Critics simply love to attack in the wee hours of the morning. If you lie in bed and allow your Inner Critic to tell you that you are an incurable insomniac and to review the mistakes of your life for you, you are in deep trouble!

- Many people find that personal writing, either some form of journal writing or writing down dreams (telling them as stories or actually working with them), is best. If this does not appeal to you, do something pleasant or distracting, like reading a book, having a glass of warm milk or herbal tea, or listening to some favorite soothing music. These techniques can often calm the Critic’s anxiety and allow you to feel less vulnerable. If you are a more active or extraverted type, get some work done. After all, you are awake anyway and your brain is fully functioning. You might even take this opportunity to tackle some unattractive job that you have been putting off. Then, not only do you soften the Critic Attack, but you literally take care of the Critic’s underlying anxiety by getting some unfinished work done!

Once you have thought of someone, consider the following questions: a. Close your eyes and visualize the last time you were together or the last time that you spoke with each other. What exactly did he or she do or say that made you feel bad? (It usually is a direct or implied judgment or a comparison of some kind.) Try to recall this as specifically as you can. b. What was your response? Can you picture or remember what happened? c. Can you make the connection between the Critic Attack and what was said to you? d. Can you see situations where this happens with other people? 2. Over the next three days, pay careful attention to your pattern of Critic Attacks.

It is often afraid that if you feel good, someone will take that feeling away from you. It is better not to feel good; then you will not be disappointed. Sometimes your Inner Critic fears the envy of others or their possible criticism, so it tries to prepare you for this in advance by criticizing you first.

It knows all the mean, uncharitable, cruel feelings that you have inside. It knows about your sexual fantasies. It knows when you are needy and vulnerable even though you might be able to hide this from others. Your Inner Critic knows about all your deepest, darkest secrets, the ones that you really want to hide. And, using this classified information, it criticizes you unmercifully. DANGER—DEPRESSION AHEAD! As the Inner Critic gains leverage, it can tilt us into a rather serious depression. As its power increases, we may even begin to feel that life is just too much trouble.

Now you have within you an abuser, and a major part of you that is being battered by its endless, and seemingly justified, abuse is your Inner Child. This creates intense psychic pain. Sometimes the Inner Critic will arrange for actual physical abuse to be added to this psychological abuse. In these cases, the Inner Critic is actually unable to rest until some punishment has been received; some actual physical suffering or great emotional pain is required. Then the Critic is relieved, it knows that it has done its job, and it knows peace for a short while. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1147))

The facilitator had been talking to Anna’s Inner Critic for quite some time. This Critic sounded a lot like Anna’s mother who was abusive to her when she was young. Suddenly Anna burst into tears. The facilitator realized that the Inner Child, who had been listening to all this abuse, had broken through. She asked Anna to move over and then began to talk to the Inner Child as follows: FACILITATOR: You were listening, weren’t you? CHILD (sobbing): Did you hear what she said? I can’t stand it anymore. I just can’t stand it. Sometimes I just want to stay in bed and never get up. It’s awful. It’s just not worth it. FACILITATOR: What’s awful? CHILD: I’m so alone. So alone! So alone! (She sobs more.) I never get to feel okay about anything. I’m always scared. She (meaning the Critic) is always screaming and screaming at me. Whatever I do, it’s no good. No matter what I look like, I’m ugly. It’s no use! I can’t do anything right. I’m stupid and clumsy and nobody ever helps me. My mom really doesn’t like me either. She used to punish me a lot.

I don’t have a single person I can turn to. I’m really afraid. Every time I want to make a friend, she (the Critic) tells me they won’t like me anyway once they get to know me, because I’m not nice, so I don’t even want to try. Besides, nobody would really want me for a friend. I think there’s something wrong with me. She says there is. And so if people ever really saw me, they’d run away. Everybody has. (Sighing) I’m just a pest and people don’t like me. Don’t you think I’m a pest? I’d better be quiet now. This conversation gives a picture of what happens to the Inner Child after years of abuse. It is alone and afraid. It thinks that there is something wrong with it. It is terrified that if it speaks out, it will be rejected. Although it desperately needs others, it cannot reach out.

- Once you become aware of the Inner Critic as a child abuser, you can move in and treat it in much the same way that you break into the outer cycle of child abuse. The Inner Critic learned how to parent you by listening to your own parents. If they were abusive, it repeats their abuse “for your own good.” It acts just like a real parent who abuses the child because the parent, herself or himself, has been the victim of abuse. The key to breaking the Inner Critic’s cycle of abuse is to separate from the Critic’s voice. As you separate from your Inner Critic, you will be able to take over the role of parent to your own Inner Child. Up until now. the Inner Critic has been the parent to the Inner Child; it has been an abusive parent because that is the only way it knew how to behave. Oddly enough, you can become a parent to the Inner Critic as well because you are in a position to deal with the underlying anxiety of the Inner Critic and to stop the Critic from its endless abusive chatter. You will be surprised to find that you have a wide range of knowledge and can make choices. The Inner Critic knows of only one way to cope with life—it knows how to criticize and how to abuse. (For more on learning to parent the Inner Critic, see chapter 17.) When we work with the Critic as an inner abuser we have a way in which to enter into the outer cycle of abuse as well. Until you separate from the abusive Inner Critic and are no longer dominated by it, you will be kept a victim to everyone around you. As a victim you will draw abusers to you. As a victim you may actually induce the abuser in almost anyone that you meet, even in people who are not normally… ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1197))

Therefore, support groups can be very important when a Killer Critic is operating, because people tend to feel isolated and these groups provide the human contact that is so necessary.

These powerful feelings and emotions that are blocked from reaching out into the world begin to shift to another track. They were initially on the aggression track, and if allowed to operate they would be part of our power and forcefulness in the world. Instead they spill over into another track, the Inner Critic track, and then the Inner Critic is infused with all of the power of our disowned aggression and emotional energy. With all of this daemonic energy available, it is no wonder that the Critic can easily shift over into Killer Critic. Such a Critic sounds absolutely daemonic in the way it attacks us. “I hate her! I despise her! I detest her! I detest everything about her! She is so weak it’s pitiful!” This daemonic rage, this daemonic condemnation is in ([Location 1311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1311))

- The Inner Patriarch is a powerful archetypal ally of the Inner Critic in women. The synergy of these two voices makes the average woman’s Inner Critic more powerful than the average man’s. The voice of the Inner Patriarch is so familiar that, much like station KRAZY, it played constantly and was not even noticed until the feminists started their writings about thirty years ago. This Inner Patriarch is the inner representation of the outer, societal beliefs in the inferiority of women, and it echoes all the judgments against women that are prevalent in our culture. With its biblical beginnings, it has the ring of absolute knowledge and unquestioned authority. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1329))

- THE POWER OF THE INNER CRITIC IN WOMEN AND IN MEN The major difference between women and men is subtly, but startlingly, summed up in a scene from the movie Tootsie, which starred Dustin Hoffman. In this scene, Hoffman is impersonating a woman. He walks past his reflection in a mirror, looks at himself self-consciously, and carefully, but inconspicuously, adjusts his girdle so that he will look better. This simple movement tells it all! Earlier in the movie, we have seen Dustin Hoffman dressed as a man. He is relaxed about his appearance and does not give it a thought. He dresses and behaves as… ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1337))

- he looks like. He is comfortable with himself. As a man, we never see him look at himself in a mirror except perhaps to shave. As a woman, all this changes. It is obvious to us that, as a man, he does not suffer from the attacks of an Inner Critic. As a woman, he does! For us, this scene illustrates the most striking difference between the Inner Critics of men and women that we have observed. Women’s Inner Critics are almost always more powerful and more persistent than men’s. Historically, this difference seems to be the product of thousands of years of patriarchal thinking. This patriarchal view of the world… ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1342))

- THE INNER CRITIC VS. THE JUDGE In the growing-up process, we usually develop either a strong Inner Critic who judges us or a strong Inner Judge who judges the world. They are the oppposite sides of the same coin. Historically speaking, it is the women who have developed the Inner Critic as a primary self and the men who have developed the Judge. Although this is not true in certain parts of the world and it is changing as the role of women changes, we still see this as a major difference between women and men. It is quite common for women to remember their fathers as judgmental rather than self-critical. Sometimes fathers are overtly judgmental, and sometimes their judgments come as silent… ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1348))

- DIFFERENCES IN CONTENT OF THE CRITIC’S COMMENTS In contrast to a man’s Inner Critic, a woman’s Inner Critic seems to feel a pressing need to “improve” the woman’s appearance or behavior in order to make her acceptable to others. It also tends to focus far more upon her physical appearance than a man’s Inner Critic focuses upon his. Again, the scene from Tootsie is a beautiful picture of this. It is unusual for a man’s Inner Critic to be concerned about his weight. It is just not an issue, unless there is some health-related reason for him to worry about it. It is equally unusual for a woman’s Inner Critic not to be concerned about her weight. Weight, for women, is almost always an issue! A similar division is apparent around aging. Women’s Inner Critics, in past years. have worried themselves sick about the physical signs of aging, while men’s Inner Critics have not necessarily seen this as a problem. The talking mirror is constantly pointing out the lines in the faces of women. This is quite unusual behavior in men.

- ABOUT SEXUALITY One of the most fascinating contrasts that we have noticed between the content of men’s and women’s Inner Critics has to do with what they say about sexuality. Men’s Critics are usually worried about performance and adequacy, while women’s Critics are usually worried about appearance and affection. Thus, in the area of sexuality, the woman’s Inner Critic is concerned with her appearance and her ability to earn love. If her man has been with another woman, her Inner Critic wants to know, “Is she more attractive?” or “Does he love ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1370))

- her more than he loves you?” Her Inner Critic wants her to be loved the most. In contrast, the man’s Inner Critic is more anxious about his performance. If his woman has been with another man, his Inner Critic will want to know, “Is he better sexually than you are?” or “Does she like what he does better than what you do?” The Critic wants the man to perform well sexually, to satisfy his woman. In recent years, as women have been told that they should be able to experience great sexual enjoyment, the Critic as Comparer has begun to criticize women about the quality and frequency of their orgasms. This, however, is not necessarily a focus on their sexual performance and its impact upon others. It is more a concern about achieving a goal, about feeling that they are the equals of the women who can enjoy themselves sexually. Here the goal is a good orgasm. The Inner Critic of a woman does not ordinarily question whether or not she has satisfied her partner adequately. This is not usually an issue for women, just as weight is not usually an issue for men. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1375))

- THE PATRIARCHY AND THE INNER CRITIC IN WOMEN Women in our society have a distinct advantage when it comes to developing a truly enormous Inner Critic. Thousands of years of living under a patriarchal system have taught women that they are inferior to men and that no matter how hard they try they will always be basically inferior. The best that they can hope for is to become more like men—to pattern themselves on male role models and move away from their female instinctual behavior. In this effort to become something other than who they are, the Inner Critic plays a truly major role. After all, it is the Critic’s ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1419))

- responsibility to see what is wrong with the woman so that it can be corrected. As the ad says, “You’ve come a long way, baby.” Much has changed in women’s roles and in the societal perceptions of women. But a five-thousand-year-old legacy does not disappear overnight. Even women who have lived independent lives as the equals of men often have within themselves, lurking deep in the shadows, an Inner Patriarch who echoes the sentiments of the outer patriarchs of the world. It is this Inner Patriarch, a most powerful archetype, who allies so strongly with the Inner Critic in most women.

- So this makes woman the source of all man’s sorrows as well as those of her own. No matter how you interpret this, no matter how religious you may be, if you are a woman raised anywhere in the Western world, this is a part of your heritage. This archetype is deep within your psyche. It is something shameful that your Inner Critic must help you to clear out. It was your fault!

- You might also note two major aspects of the curse put upon woman. Both take away from her pride in herself and her ability to trust herself, thereby giving the Inner Critic even more cause for anxiety than it already has. First, God himself has stated that her husband must rule over her. It seems that he has better judgment than she has even though he too ate the fruit. Second, her very special gift, the ability to bring forth children, is cursed, and she is told that she must bring them forth in sorrow rather than in joy. This all helps to add serious amounts of weight to a woman’s critic. Since most of us are raised in religions that incorporate ancient biblical beliefs and traditions, we can assume that these traditions have a major impact upon our current beliefs and values whether or not we are consciously aware of them. As a Jewish woman, I (Sidra) was deeply shocked when my young daughter told me that the following prayer was said each morning by the boys in her Hebrew school. This prayer is from a current prayer book. ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1440))

- The feminist scholars and writers brought forward a new and exciting body of knowledge for women. They challenged the system and changed the outer patriarchy in many areas. But what they did not notice was that there was an enemy within. Within most women is an Inner Patriarch who believes that she is indeed inferior and that she needs constant surveillance to keep her behavior appropriate! It feels a deep-seated disdain for her femaleness and can literally make her ashamed to be a woman. This Patriarch allies itself with the woman’s Inner Critic for a great double whammy.

- It is easier to fight an enemy outside than an enemy within. It is important for women to know that an Inner Patriarch exists within them, that patriarchy is not just an enemy to be battled on the outside. For many women, this is a revelation. They have been so busy with the outer battles, which have been monumentally important, that they have not necessarily looked within. As Pogo said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1480))

- If you, as a woman, can begin to hear the voice of the Patriarch within, you will find that his comments are responsible for a deep-seated feeling of shame that seems to have no particular focus. It is the shame of being a woman in this culture. As you separate from your Inner Patriarch, you will begin to see him change. At some point, the Inner Patriarch may well assume a more positive role in your life, using his masculine power to support you from within. You will hear his deep-seated concern for your well-being and for the problems that you face in what remains an essentially patriarchal society that he knows only too well.

- extremely liberating. To separate means to hear what these voices say and to realize that they represent selves that have a particular point of view but do not necessarily bear an ultimate truth. It is fairly simple to see that your Critic is criticizing you unrealistically if you hear your neighbor’s Inner Critic criticizing her for the opposite “sin,” like being too ordinary or too special or being too aggressive or too passive. But when everyone’s Inner Patriarch more or less agrees with everyone else’s, you do not have external points of reference to check against. This is why we have included this chapter and its exercises. This chapter gives you that external point of reference to check against. Disempowering these archetypal voices can lessen the size and power of the Critic and make it more manageable. There’s an age-old tradition in dealing with an overwhelming enemy: it is divide and conquer. That is just what we are doing when we separate from the Inner Patriarch and Matriarch. Then the Aware Ego can deal with each of these energies separately from those of the Inner Critic instead of having to battle them all at once.

What does your Inner Patriarch say? As you finish this chapter, see if you can tune into the voice of your Inner Patriarch. Write down the negative comments that your Inner Patriarch makes about women. Begin them with “women are …” You may repeat statements that you have read here if they feel familiar to you. Leave a space next to each of these comments so that you can make an additional notation. 2. What does your Inner Matriarch say?

Now that you have begun to hear the voice of your Inner Patriarch, you are in a position to separate from it. Look at the comments of your Inner Patriarch. Remember that even if a comment represents an idea that everyone in your community agrees is valid, “it ain’t necessarily so.” It might be helpful to have some contact with someone who already knows about the Inner Patriarch to help you as you separate from yours.

- “What will people think?” is often what your parents asked, either aloud or by implication. They wanted you to be appropriate and to think of the consequences of your actions. This was for their sakes as well as for your own. After all, your behavior directly reflected your parents’ performance. It showed whether or not they did a good job raising you. If you are a good person or a success, you are a credit to them. If you are a bad person or a failure, they will be blamed. So you carry with you not only your own requirements for acceptance, but your parents’ feelings too. This is quite a task for your Inner Critic.

- We have noticed three major reasons for wanting to lead a spiritually correct life and maintain a proper relationship to God. First of all, many of us believe it is simply the right way to be. The rules are clear and it is up to us to follow them. If this is our approach, then the Critic supports us by bringing to our attention all the ways in which we are falling short of living the proper kind of life. It wants to help us remain on the proper path. Second, many of us feel a deep love for God and need to remain in touch with divinity at all times. If we do not, then we feel an irreplaceable loss and a lack of meaning in life. The Inner Critic is usually not active when this kind of motivation is operating. However, if the Critic is active, it will attack us for not following the kind of program that keeps us in touch with divinity (such as regular prayer or meditation) and will tell us that we know better than to neglect our spiritual… ([Location 1608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0053JYRR0&location=1608))

- Since it has its beginnings in relationship, the Inner Critic is basically an other-directed social creature. It developed in relationship, and it continues to operate prominently in all our relationships, even when we are not aware of it. Its deep interpersonal roots were originally fed by the judgments of the important people in our lives. We either developed Critics that echoed the judgments of our primary caretakers, or we rebelled and developed Critics that took the opposite point of view, making us very different from these primary caretakers.

Perhaps she has a grandparent, an aunt, a teacher, a friend, or a friend’s family to provide her with an alternative model of behavior. Perhaps she learns from watching others on television. Basically, she does not try to fit into the family system. Instead, she withdraws from it. Psychologists have tried to explain why some people react like Anna by becoming strong in the face of adversity and some do not.
