- An open mind and the willingness to try new ideas to treat an old problem. Enough time to learn a new way to live with bipolar disorder. The courage to grieve the loss of some of the hopes and dreams you had for your relationship, while simultaneously taking decisive action to improve the relationship. A journal in which you can explore your ideas, thoughts, and emotions, and in which you will complete the important journal exercises you will find in each chapter.

- Treating bipolar disorder holistically is not about what is wrong with your relationship. It is about what bipolar disorder has done to your relationship and about creating a treatment plan that takes power away from the disorder. This plan can help you maintain your perspective when your partner is ill. Treating bipolar disorder realistically is ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=174))

- When your partner is ill, their beliefs about themselves and the world are often distorted. If you try to talk with them about your relationship, work, or life in general, you often talk to the bipolar disorder instead of to the person ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=191))

- you love. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=193))

- Answer the following questions in your journal: How has bipolar disorder affected my relationship as a whole? How has it affected me as a person? What is the hardest thing that I face daily regarding this illness? What do I want to see change right now? What do I need in my own life to find happiness? If things stay as they are, where do I see my relationship in the future? What is going well? ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=212))

- I understand that bipolar disorder is an illness, and I’m willing to work with you instead of blaming you. I agree that I’ll have to make some changes in my own lifestyle to help you stay stable (e.g., changes in social obligations, busyness, sleep habits, diet, exercise, and the use of caffeine, alcohol, and drugs such as pot). I understand that the cost of not treating bipolar disorder far outweighs the cost of allowing things to stay as they are. I’m willing to try out the techniques described in this book for the next six months, and if you are still not ready at that time to make the changes needed, I will reevaluate my approach. I agree to examine my own emotional behavior to see what I may be doing to contribute to your bipolar disorder symptoms. I understand that you are ill and are not sick on purpose. I agree to remind myself of this when I’m frustrated with your progress. I’m willing to be more assertive with your health care team and to let them know that I need help and direction as much as you do.

- Here are some ideas of what you can decide to do together: We will learn to work on bipolar disorder together—as a team. We agree to use the techniques in this book even when they don’t work immediately. We know that many positive changes can happen quickly, but we agree that it may take longer than we want to make the big changes. We agree that we love each other and we want to our relationship to be healthy and whole once again. We agree that we can’t continue as we are if our relationship is to survive.

- When you do talk with your partner about your needs and how you feel, be careful not to sound as if you are warning them about the consequences of their actions. That is, don’t say, You better do this or I’m going to leave. Instead, try to talk to your partner in a loving way and let them know you are trying to take care of yourself and ensure that your relationship will be stronger in the future. When you treat bipolar disorder first, with compassion and the realistic tools you will learn in this book, you can learn to focus on the positive and what works to help your partner stay stable, instead of punishing your partner for their bipolar disorder symptoms. You can then work together to create goals that will help you get to where you want to be in the future. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=255))

- Goals are different from plans: Sometimes, a goal may seem impossible because there are so many roadblocks along the way. Many people quit trying to reach their goals when the problems seem impossible to fix. But one way to help yourself stay on track is to remember that it is not the goal that needs to change when things get tough. Instead, it is the plan that needs changing. Maybe you need new tools or a different way of looking at the situation. So remember, when reaching a goal such as achieving a more stable relationship seems difficult or impossible, your plans for how to arrive at your goal may have to change occasionally, but your goal can stay the same.

- Think Positively It is human nature for people who are suffering or overwhelmed to focus primarily on what is negative. Even in the midst of difficult times it is important to focus on the good parts of your relationship as well, especially when your situation may feel hopeless. Before you finish this chapter, think of the good qualities your partner brings to you and your relationship. What do you love about your partner? What potential do you see that you know will bloom once the mood swings and their symptoms have been minimized? Write about these positive aspects of your relationship in your journal and then share them with your partner. This will help you focus on the reason you are reading this book in the first place. You want a happy, healthy, and stable relationship. And you have taken the first step toward reaching this goal.

- Treating bipolar disorder first means that you do what it takes to stabilize the illness by learning new techniques for treating it, so that you can then move on to more meaningful issues. Treating bipolar disorder first means that before you can enjoy your relationship, you must get bipolar disorder out of the way.

- Bipolar Disorder II Bipolar II (two) is the most common type of bipolar disorder, seen in about 4 to 5 percent of the general population (Judd and Akiskal 2003). People with bipolar II have a very high frequency of major depressive episodes. Over a lifetime people with bipolar II spend three times as much time in depression as do those with bipolar I (Akiskal et al. 2000). The other primary feature of bipolar II is the absence of full-blown mania; instead, people ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=373))

- with bipolar II have episodes of hypomania. (See “Hypomania” below for a definition.) Cyclothymia Cyclothymia looks like a mild version of bipolar disorder, presenting with episodes of mild depression and hypomania. Such individuals are often seen as being very moody and emotionally reactive people. Cyclothymic mood swings can occur for many years with no evidence of severe depression or mania, but it’s now recognized that for the majority of people with cyclothymia the mood swings worsen and they eventually convert to bipolar I or bipolar II (Akiskal et al. 2000). Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder Among those with bipolar disorder, 10 to 20 percent develop what is known as rapid cycling (Bowden 2003; Akiskal et al. 2000). It’s seen in bipolar I and II (but is much more common in bipolar II) and is more common in women than men. Rapid cycling is characterized primarily by its high frequency of mood episodes. Technically, people are said to have rapid cycling if they experience four or more episodes of mania and/or depression during a twelve-month period. Some people may have many more than four episodes per year and are said to have ultra-rapid cycling. There are those who may cycle monthly, weekly, and even daily. There is also increasing ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=377))

- evidence that substance abuse or incorrect use of antidepressants or stimulants may be key factors in causing or aggravating rapid cycling. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=387))

- Depression Symptoms of depression (often referred to as “major depression” or “clinical depression”) include sadness, unhappiness, or irritability; low self-esteem; a loss of enthusiasm, motivation, or vitality; extremely negative and pessimistic thinking; a range of physical symptoms including disturbances in sleep, appetite, and weight; loss of sex drive; and fatigue. Intense worry, anxiety, agitation, and suicidal thoughts are also common symptoms of major depression. Major depression can dramatically interfere with functioning (e.g., work, school, parenting, relationships). Depression is disruptive because it affects the mind and the body. A depressed person often slows down to the point that nothing can get done. Getting out of bed can feel like a monumental task to the depressed brain. Depression can also cause irritation and unreasonableness. A depressed person may be unhappy and mean, or weepy and clingy. Depression can distort your partner’s thoughts to the point that they can say and do very unreasonable things. The duration of a major depressive episode can vary substantially from person to person and often persists for a number of months. When I’m depressed, my body and mind simply shut down. All tasks become impossible and it feels like I’m living my life in heavy mud. Sometimes my depression tells me that it would just be easier to stay in bed all day. It tells me I’m no good and that everything I do is junk. It’s so strong. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=399))

- Hypomania Hypomania (both euphoric and dysphoric) is seen in bipolar II and is much less intense than full-blown mania. There is an increase in energy, a decreased need for sleep (but no daytime fatigue), and impaired judgment, though not as serious as that seen in full-blown mania. During euphoric hypomanic episodes, people have a heightened sense of well-being and are very productive and gregarious. During dysphoric episodes, people are agitated, pessimistic, and restless. This type of mania can last for a few days or go on for months and, although everyone around the person can tell something is wrong, it’s very difficult for the person experiencing the hypomania to notice the problem until the episode is over. The person’s social life often increases, as can substance abuse and spending. It’s hard for friends or family members to do anything about it, as the person is still basically functioning. Often, this is when the person is perceived as “wild” or “irresponsible,” causing the family to give up on them.

- Technically, paranoia is a symptom of psychosis, although many people with bipolar disorder develop a milder form of paranoid thinking. This type of impaired thinking doesn’t involve bizarre or unbelievable conclusions; rather it is simply being highly suspicious, mistrusting, and hypervigilant. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=489))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- PSYCHOSIS IS CONFUSING Psychotic symptoms can be difficult to understand. Often, people with bipolar disorder keep their psychotic symptoms to themselves because they really don’t know what is happening and don’t know if their thoughts are normal or a part of the illness. Psychosis can be very subtle and chronic, or it can be profound and sudden and can erupt with little warning. Because psychosis can be a normal symptom of bipolar disorder, the more you know about it, the less frightening it becomes. The most important thing to know is that psychosis is very disruptive for the person with bipolar disorder. Even a mild psychosis greatly impairs a person’s ability to function. It’s also important to know that psychosis can be treated and prevented. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=496))

- Intense Anger and Irritability Inappropriate and intense anger is often seen as a personality problem instead of as a symptom of bipolar ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=502))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- disorder. In fact, unreasonable and frequently violent reactions to events that normally wouldn’t cause irritation and anger are commonly seen in both depression and mania. (Even in euphoric mania, the person’s upbeat or even jovial mood is easily punctured and anger can quickly flare up.) This irritation and anger is often directed toward people and objects and may include slamming doors, hitting walls, yelling, or physically abusing others. Road rage is also very common. Some people with bipolar disorder end up in jail because of this symptom. During anger outbursts the person may say and do things that ordinarily they wouldn’t say or do (for example, saying very hurtful things to one’s partner). Later, when the emotions die down, the ill partner may feel remorse for what was said or done. It’s very common for partners to become fearful during intense eruptions of anger or to experience hurt feelings when the ill partner says harsh or cruel things. Sometimes my anger is so strong I feel like I’m going to explode. It feels so good to hit something or yell and start a fight. It’s a release from all of the pressure inside. It doesn’t even feel wrong at the time. It feels like something I have to do. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=503))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Often anxiety symptoms appear to others as extreme overreactions to life’s normal daily stresses. And even though people with bipolar disorder may feel anxious about specific matters, it’s not uncommon for them to experience what is called free-floating anxiety. Here, the anxiety doesn’t seem to be attached to any specific event or situation. When I get anxious, I can feel my pulse pounding in my neck and I know that if I’m asked to do even one more thing I’m going to cry and run from the room and just hide in bed. Anxiety churns in me and makes me feel that I can’t go on. It makes it impossible for me to work or talk with people normally. I just feel this whirling feeling of being sucked into something I can’t control. I actually wring my hands and lose my breath. I get the feeling that something bad is going to happen to me, but I just don’t know what it is. This often stops me from doing things I once enjoyed.

- When I look at a project I can’t see the steps I need to take to finish it. It just all looks like one big impossible jumble and even when I start with good intentions, I get completely distracted.

- When I’m depressed, I just reach a point where my thoughts take over and tell me that I’d be better off dead. This seems very reasonable, as I’m in so much pain from the depression I can’t see any point in staying on this earth. Suicide seems like a solution when I hurt so much. It doesn’t matter if I have a lot of people who love me or if I have good things in life. When I’m this sick, it just doesn’t matter.

- partners, who quickly discover that no amount of reassurance or rational argument can free the person with bipolar disorder from intense worry about their health. Feeling Overwhelmed? It’s okay if you feel scared and overwhelmed just from reading about the many symptoms your partner may experience. Bipolar disorder is scary if it’s untreated. Recognizing and naming all of your partner’s major symptoms is the first important step to take in understanding and beginning to take control over bipolar disorder. When you and your partner know what to expect, the illness can’t throw you a curveball anymore. This will help you to predict the future with some accuracy and also help you to feel safer.

- As a partner, you need to know as much about medications as the person with the illness. You are the one who will be there when the side effects are difficult to tolerate, when the medications take a long time to work, and possibly when your partner goes off medications or refuses to take them.

- No matter what the situation, the facts are clear: medications exponentially increase your partner’s ability to manage bipolar disorder, and this creates a greater chance for you to have a good relationship. This is great news, since it means there can be very positive outcomes when your partner uses medications as prescribed along with the management plan presented in this book.

- It turns out that up to 35 percent of people with bipolar disorder also have ADHD. The most recent consensus is that stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall, Dexedrine, and Concerta can be safely given to people who have bipolar disorder, but it is important to first get stabilized on bipolar medications before starting a stimulant. If stimulants are prescribed, people must be cautious about taking any of the medications after noon because some of the drug may still be in circulation later that night and interfere with sleep (and getting good sleep is very important in maintaining mood stability).

- In other words, when you and your partner can create a very structured environment around sleep, medications, and relationships, things can truly change for the better. (If you’re cynical about this, we understand, but change is possible.) The lower response rate in the other 42 percent of study participants is likely due to the five factors listed below, which directly reflect the difficulty of managing bipolar disorder in the real world. Patients stop medications or change dosages because of problematic side effects. This is never a good choice, as quickly going off medications or reducing the dose without supervision can cause ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=673))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- physical withdrawal symptoms as well as lead to the reemergence of serious mood swings. Patients stop or change medications because they are in denial about bipolar disorder. It’s very natural for anyone affected by bipolar disorder to hope that the illness will just go away one day. Because of this, patients may either refuse medications or go on and off them until they finally accept the diagnosis. Patients stop or change medications during a mood swing because they lack insight. This is especially true for those in full-blown mania or a suicidal depression. For example, patients in manic situations often lose the ability to accurately remember past experiences and how destructive they may have been. Thus, the decision to stop medications is based only on present feelings and not on possible future consequences. Patients rely on medication treatment alone and do not use a management plan such as the one found in this book. It’s essential for all people with bipolar disorder to establish routine lifestyles, take advantage of psychotherapy that specifically addresses life with bipolar disorder, deal actively with relationship problems, and work toward cultivating stronger family relationships and building a supportive treatment team. This ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=677))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- isn’t easy, but as the chances for success are greater when a person is on medications, you and your partner are already a step ahead of most and can more smoothly implement the strategies in this book. Patients perceive a negative stigma attached to the bipolar disorder diagnosis. It’s a very personal decision to tell others about a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Even though the illness is now less stigmatized and is talked about more widely in the media, people may feel shame, fear losing a job, or worry that they will be judged by others for the illness. This desire for privacy and even secrecy can be very hard on the partner, since they may feel there is no one to talk to. If the person with bipolar disorder finds it overwhelming to deal with the diagnosis, it makes sense that they may refuse medication treatment as well. If you and your partner can recreate the positive factors identified in the study and do all you can to prevent the above behaviors, your chance of a stable relationship increases dramatically.

- It’s essential that you prepare yourself for a prolonged period of medication trial and error, especially when your partner is first diagnosed. Accepting this reality can ease much of your frustration as to why it can take so long to get it right. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=710))

- It’s important to point out that it’s usually a tradeoff between side effects and mood swing reduction. As is the case with most medications used to treat serious illnesses, the benefits of the medications can outweigh potentially problematic side effects. The goal is always to find medications that work with the least side effects, but in order to do this, medications must be tried with an open mind and given a chance to work.

- Now that you have broken your partner’s bipolar disorder into major symptom categories, you are ready to create a treatment plan based on the fact that different symptoms need different treatments.

- Before you move forward, it’s a good idea to let go of some of the old behaviors you and your partner may have practiced when bipolar disorder was raging. It may help to know that even really bright, kind, and compassionate people can become unreasonable when faced with bipolar disorder symptoms. The new ways of responding to the disorder that are covered in this book may feel unfamiliar and may even be uncomfortable at first. If you and your partner have said and done things that you regret, now is a good time to let go of the past and focus on the present and the future. You really can learn a new way to live with bipolar disorder. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=985))

- you, they actually aren’t personal at all. They are simply the symptoms of an illness. The symptoms look and feel emotional and psychological, but in reality they are just symptoms. When you treat bipolar disorder first, you recognize that the appearance of symptoms means only that your partner must focus on treating bipolar disorder—instead of focusing on what you or your partner may think is wrong with your lives. When you carefully list the specific symptoms associated with each major bipolar disorder symptom category, this will help your partner to see that so many of the feelings and thoughts associated with bipolar disorder are actually symptoms instead of a personal failing or inability to deal with the real world. If your partner listens to the thoughts and does the things that the disorder tells them to do, the illness takes over and it’s hard for your partner to get better. But, if you and your partner can see and understand that there is a pattern to these symptoms, and from the very first minute they start up, you use your treatment plan to stop the illness instead of reacting to the thoughts and actions, you can then stop bipolar disorder from taking over your partner’s life and ultimately hijacking your relationship.

The solution is to write down what works and what doesn’t, so that you can read the list as soon as you see the first signs of bipolar disorder.

- If you are confused by bipolar disorder behavior, you are not alone. It really is a difficult illness to understand. The good news is that despite the chaos that bipolar disorder creates, there really are some set rules that, if you can remember them even during a crisis, will help you to focus on treating and preventing the symptoms of bipolar disorder instead of once again becoming caught in its trap. The Facts about This Difficult Illness Bipolar disorder thinking is always unreasonable and unrealistic. Always. There are no exceptions. So if your normally reasonable partner is being unreasonable, you know that you are dealing with bipolar disorder and not with a personality flaw. Bipolar disorder doesn’t simply go away one day. You must always be ready for it to reappear. It can be very sneaky. It starts small and then becomes a tornado. It’s crucial that you catch it when it’s ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1137))

- small, from the very first symptom, so that you can treat it successfully. Like people with any illness where symptoms can be triggered by outside events (such as asthma or diabetes), people with bipolar disorder can learn how to avoid and minimize certain triggers that ignite their symptoms. It just means learning how to live life in a new way. You will learn more about triggers in chapter 7. You can never talk to, cajole, or reason with someone who is in a bipolar disorder mood swing. The person you love is temporarily gone and bipolar disorder has moved in. This book will teach you to respond to bipolar disorder when your partner is ill instead of trying to talk your partner out of being ill. If your partner suddenly decides that medications are no longer needed (because they feel “wonderful” or “cured”) and they simply stop taking them without talking to a doctor, this is a sign of poor judgment and an indication that bipolar disorder is in control.

As you learn these new techniques, you can write these tools down on your “What Works” list. You will then use the list when your partner gets sick. If you are like most partners, when a crisis hits, you will not remember what you are supposed to do, especially if you are in the middle of dealing with the symptoms. In fact, even with a “What Works” list you may automatically go back to your old patterns of responding because they are familiar. This is the main reason for recording your treatment plan on paper: so you and your partner can read it when a bipolar disorder symptom begins.

- Have you ever made any of the following comments to your partner? What’s your problem? Why are you so unhappy? You have everything a person could ever want and you’re still miserable! You’re so smart. Why don’t you just do something with your life? I just don’t understand why you can’t work. Everyone else works. You just have to buckle down and do the job. If you cared, you’d just try harder. Why does everything have to be so difficult for you? Can’t you just enjoy yourself for once? Don’t you talk to me that way! You bought $100 worth of candles? What do you mean you bought $100 worth of candles? Why can’t you just calm down? Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have spoken to your partner harshly when they were sick. It’s normal for you to make these comments. Bipolar disorder behavior is so unreasonable and frustrating, it frequently causes these kinds of reactions in everyone. The problem is, although these comments make total sense to you, they ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1191))

- only make matters worse when your partner is sick. Talking this way may be effective when you are frustrated with someone who is not mentally ill or who is not living up to their potential because of lack of motivation or laziness; but this is not an effective way to communicate with someone in the middle of a mood swing. When you speak this way to someone whose behaviors are a result of the disorder, you are adding to the problem instead of finding a solution. The key is to learn to respond to bipolar disorder instead of reacting to what your partner actually says or does. When you react to your partner, you act out of personal frustration at what your partner has said and done. You react according to how your partner’s unreasonable behavior makes you feel. A reaction is immediate and doesn’t take into account why your partner says or does the things that upset you. When you learn that the behaviors are symptoms of a predictable illness, you can teach yourself to respond differently to bipolar disorder. This takes more time and a lot more planning and thought, but it can be learned. When you learn to respond instead of reacting to what your partner says and does, you are likely to see immediate results in your relationship. Look at the following examples of how you can change the way you talk to your partner when they are ill. Notice how these techniques differ from the ones you may have used in the past, and start to think of the comments you ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1199))

Make sure that you work on fixing these relationships so that their stress does not affect your partner. Bipolar disorder thrives on chaos and there is nothing more chaotic than a troubled relationship. This certainly can be difficult if your problem relationships are with family members. You will learn in the next chapter that bipolar disorder is triggered by outside events, and problem relationships are one of the biggest triggers for the disorder. Sometimes the solution can be as simple as spending more time with the calming people in your life and taking a break from the people who cause stress. This does ask a lot of you, but it’s worth it.

- Promote Physical Well-Being Bipolar disorder is very hard on the body. Your partner may experience physical problems because of a downswing or may have a host of problems due to medication side effects. What you may not realize is that you may have stress-related illness yourself when your partner is ill, as can other people in your partner’s life, including any children in your family. Many people think that bipolar disorder is strictly a mental illness, but as anyone who has just been through a serious episode can tell you, it wears out the body—yours included. Diet and exercise are two tools you and your partner can use together to control many different bipolar disorder symptoms. Mania, depression, anger, and especially anxiety are greatly affected by food choices and exercise. From caffeine to junk food, what someone puts into their body can greatly affect their mood. The good news is that a change in diet often can improve symptoms by helping the body find balance. You may wonder how you can help your partner create a healthy lifestyle, especially if they are ill and have no motivation to change anything. You can help by creating meals and an exercise plan for yourself that will help your partner as well. Help your partner learn which foods affect their symptoms. Do they crave certain foods depending on particular symptoms they experience? You really can encourage your partner to move toward stability by creating a consistent diet that supports the body, mind, and spirit.

You have the list of your partner’s major symptom categories that you created when you were working with chapter 3. You also have the list of specific symptoms under each of these major categories from chapter 5. As you can now see, you are creating a treatment plan for each major bipolar disorder symptom. You will now add a list of what works and what doesn’t under each category. You can start with depression. Take out the symptom lists you have already created for depression and list your own ideas under each of the six categories from this chapter: (1) learn what your partner wants and needs, (2) learn to respond instead of reacting, (3) help your partner make wise relationship choices, (4) promote physical well-being, (5) seek alternative treatments, and (6) help with medications… ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1326))

- You also will need to learn which of your partner’s ideas are reasonable. For example, if your partner says the best thing you can do when they are depressed is to just leave them alone, you know that this is not reasonable. It’s also normal that you each may have very different ideas about how to respond to this illness at first. The goal is to work together. Add your ideas to the “What Works” list in any order. The goal is to read this entire “What Works” list every time your partner sees the first signs of depression. You can then choose what needs to be done. You will learn more techniques in later chapters, but for now start with depression and list what you know has worked and what hasn’t worked in the past, as well as what you would like to explore in the future now that you have some ideas from this chapter.

You could put out one little fire after another, over and over again, but still wind up back where you started. A holistic treatment plan takes a different approach. It examines the factors that ignite and intensify bipolar disorder symptoms instead of treating only the results of the illness. As you and your partner learn to recognize, minimize, and treat symptoms by doing what works and avoiding what doesn’t, you will begin to see that many of your partner’s symptoms follow a pattern. They are often a by-product of an event or behavior that your partner experiences. And… ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1351))

- Your partner’s brain chemistry is very different from your brain chemistry, and because of this, situations, events, and certain behaviors affect your partner quite differently than they affect you. People with bipolar disorder often have a very small window in which they can meet demands. Once that window is closed, the triggers create bipolar disorder symptoms.

- Triggers can begin very gradually. Little triggers may be set in motion weeks in advance of any symptoms and then trigger a greater problem when they get out of hand. An example would be taking on too much to do at work or in the family, ignoring all of the symptoms that follow, and then getting so sick a few weeks later that a trip to the hospital becomes necessary. There are some triggers that are always disastrous—for example, interacting with problem people who you know always push the wrong buttons. Some triggers are more immediate and predictable—for example, deciding to discuss a delicate or stressful topic such as finances at the dinner table after a long, tiring day. Triggers can change. On some days, a person won’t be able to handle any conflict, while on other days the same person may be able to have a very contentious discussion without becoming ill. This may be particularly hard for you to live with, as you will often wonder why something you ordinarily do will suddenly upset your partner. The most serious triggers tend to be work- or school-related stresses, death or illness of a loved one, obligations that have a pressured time limit, stressful personal relationships, a move, marriage, a baby, or anything else that is new or causes a big change in a person’s life. World events such as a terrorist attack or war also can be strong triggers. In other words, always be aware that any change, whether good or bad, can be a bipolar disorder trigger. Some triggers are so strong it’s virtually impossible for your partner to stay well once they take place. When this happens, the goal is to focus on the symptoms, because the trigger is out of your control. Trigger lists are not about what someone does wrong; they are simply a way of understanding and getting clear about what specific behaviors and situations provoke stress and bipolar disorder mood swings.

It will help if you talk about the possibility of these triggers with your partner before they occur, so that you can discuss how you will handle them if they do appear. Just knowing that a big trigger will almost always make your partner ill will help you to be ready as soon as something happens. For this reason, it’s important that you and your partner discuss these triggers before they happen.

You can be the one to learn new tools to stop the arguments completely. Of course, this will be difficult if your partner is ill and wants to argue, but you have to be the one to stop. In later chapters you will find tips for preventing arguments, but the first step is simply making the decision to stop.

This chapter will follow a couple, Carlos and Pam, as they create a holistic treatment plan for Pam’s bipolar disorder. Before you read their story, here is a review of the procedures you have already learned: Medications are an important part of a holistic treatment plan, but they are not a stand-alone solution. Decide to treat bipolar disorder first before you move on to the more everyday issues. Break bipolar disorder into major symptom categories. Write down your partner’s specific symptoms under each category. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1713))

- The next step was to break Pam’s bipolar disorder into her major symptom categories. Like most couples, Carlos and Pam thought that bipolar disorder was basically just two moods: mania and depression. They assumed that all of the other behaviors were just part of Pam’s personality and that she needed therapy and a little more self-discipline to get matters under control. When they first started to list Pam’s symptoms, their lists were short. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1798))

- If you think about it, their lists are pretty funny. Pam’s symptoms have completely affected their lives in every possible way, and yet they can only see the small picture of how the illness affects her behavior. They know that she is also unhappy and restless with life, easily irritated, sexually unresponsive, often mean, and frequently unfocused and unproductive when it comes to her goals, and she feels that people talk about her at work. That they focused on what they thought bipolar disorder was supposed to mean was normal, but in order to really treat bipolar disorder holistically, they needed to discover the many facets of Pam’s mood swings. After thinking about their years together and all of their ups and downs, Carlos and Pam were able to create a more definitive major symptoms list—one that looks at the whole picture of Pam’s bipolar disorder.

- This list helped Pam and Carlos finally see that in Pam’s bipolar disorder there is a lot more than mania and depression. When they had a list of her major symptom categories, they were ready to create their treatment plans for each problem. They decided to address Pam’s irritation with their first treatment plan, as it was the symptom that caused the most trouble at the time.

- An Illness, Not a Personality Flaw The symptom list helped Carlos and Pam talk about Pam’s bipolar disorder more realistically. When they looked over the list, Pam agreed that irritation was no longer acceptable in their relationship. She agreed that she was ready to learn what works to treat the symptoms. She knew that she had to be ready with a plan the minute she felt the first signs that she was getting sick. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1865))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Carlos learned to recognize Pam’s body language and breathing. He agreed that reacting to her anger didn’t work and that he needed to learn how to respond to her when she was ill. The list helped them see that Pam has an illness with typical and predictable symptoms. It’s not something she does on purpose.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- After looking at these trigger lists, Pam commented that some of the items on her list seemed like symptoms. This is true. Triggers can be confusing. If you are uncertain what’s a symptom and what’s a trigger, that’s normal. The reason for this confusion is that what begins as a trigger can become a symptom and what starts as a symptom can become a trigger. For example, consider sleep. Deliberately sleeping only three hours in one night can trigger a mood swing, but one of the symptoms of mania is that a person may not be able to sleep more than three hours a night. The main thing to understand is that although basic triggers and symptoms often are interchangeable, root triggers almost always come from external sources. Pam and Carlos’s ultimate goal is to find the root triggers of Pam’s bipolar disorder symptoms. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=1968))

You can let your partner know you understand that bipolar disorder often will not let them ask for help or say they’re sorry. One way to look at it is that bipolar disorder is always wrong, not the person with the illness. The illness is the problem, and when you accept this fact, you can both be more compassionate toward each other. People who don’t have the illness have no idea how terrible it is to live with, and those with the illness usually have no idea how terrible it can be to live with someone who has bipolar disorder. It’s so much easier to focus on bipolar disorder when someone is ill than to start the blame-and-shame game that only adds stress to an already stressed relationship. The next time you find yourself in a bipolar… ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2073))

- Have you ever had a conversation with your partner in which it feels like your partner is talking about something completely different from and unrelated to what you’re talking about? When your partner is ill, normal conversations often become difficult or even impossible. They become conversations where you are talking normally, thinking that your ideas and feelings are being heard, but your partner is ill and not in control of what they are saying. Simple conversations suddenly turn into arguments and your partner may start to get angry, start to cry, or say something completely unreasonable such as “You never listen to me!” or “You just don’t understand.” You probably sit there stunned and wonder once again what you have done wrong. Bipolar disorder symptoms then might compel your partner to make a scene or leave, and you have no idea what is going on and eventually think, “… ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2083))

- often says and does things that are neither a part of their real behavior nor an honest reflection of their true and deeper feelings. Naturally, this interrupts your normal ability to communicate with your partner and causes problems in your relationship. Just because you love someone, it doesn’t mean that you innately know how to deal with these behavior changes, and the usual result is a huge misunderstanding that puts the relationship under terrible stress. Another problem is that the conversations seem real to both partners, which is what makes bipolar disorder so dangerous. It’s almost as though a third person has been sitting in on the conversation like some twisted bipolar Cyrano de Bergerac. Your partner gets further into the mood swing, and you just can’t understand why the person you love is acting so oddly. The good news is that there is hope. You can learn to recognize and then… ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2092))

- Don’t Be Tricked! It’s so easy to get tangled up in these very serious leading comments. Your goal is to learn to recognize them as comments originating from bipolar disorder so that you can respond to the disorder instead of reacting to the words your partner is saying. You need to say, Hey! Wait a minute! Hold it! This is bipolar disorder talking and I don’t have conversations with bipolar disorder. I have conversations with my partner. You can then address the real issue. ([Location 2180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2180))

Using your journal, write your response to the following examples of what your partner might say or do: I can tell that no one likes me at work. I feel people looking at me and I know the boss is just waiting to fire me. I’m just not sure how I feel anymore. Everything seems so pointless and I’m just not happy with my life. (Starts to cry.) I really don’t need sleep like I used to. I have so much energy. It feels great to finally be happy and get things done after being depressed for so long. You never want to have any fun!

- (Pinches lips, expels breath out in anger, and glares at you.) Think of the times you’ve heard your partner make similar comments or seen them take similar actions. Now that you have an idea of what leading comments or actions are like, write all of your partner’s leading comments and actions you can remember on the symptom lists, under your treatment plan for each major symptom category. Over time, you may observe that many of these comments don’t change. Every time your partner becomes ill with a particular symptom, they will say the same things. This is always a sign that bipolar disorder is talking and not your partner. Crying is almost always a sign that something is wrong. Note when your partner cries and put it on the symptoms list. Crying is just a nonverbal leading comment, and you need to have a response ready when the crying starts. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2262))

- The sooner you observe, think about, and finally accept the many emotions you may have to endure because of your partner’s illness, the sooner you will be ready to make the changes needed to create more stability within yourself. You may even become more objective about the role bipolar disorder plays in your relationship. Greater objectivity will help you when you and your partner begin using your holistic treatment plan. This chapter discusses many of the emotions you may feel as the partner of someone with bipolar disorder. Your goal in this chapter is to discover what you really feel about the illness and then to figure out what you can do to help yourself establish emotional stability. You may not want to do all of the journal work in this chapter at first. That’s okay. Do it anyway. You don’t have to want to do it, but you may find that writing about your emotions makes you feel better about your life, especially when you realize that all of your emotions are normal reactions to bipolar disorder. Writing can help you find solutions to these unfriendly emotions. Give it a try. ([Location 2377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2377))

The good news is that this situation doesn’t have to be permanent. What you have to do is help your partner get better so that your attraction can return. If you were attracted to your partner before, you can be attracted to your partner again. In your journal, write about this topic as honestly you can. Are you attracted to your partner when they’re sick? Does it matter to you? How do your feelings change when your partner is ill? The two important things for you to discover are these: what feelings are temporary and a result of your partner’s illness, and what feelings regarding your attraction to your partner are the real you?

What am I supposed to do? I take care of everything. I make all of the money and clean the house while she is just sick all of the time. I hate this illness. I hate it and sometimes I hate her for putting me through this. It’s easy to be angry at your partner when they’re sick. They may seem pathetic, lazy, or weak. Your partner may do things that would make anyone angry. Rest assured that you’re not alone if you want to beat up bipolar disorder over what it’s done to your life or what it’s done to the person you love. Bipolar disorder is not a nice illness. Using your journal, finish this sentence: I’m angry because… Write as much as you can on this topic and really let bipolar disorder have it. Once again, try to do this even if you don’t feel like it.

You can learn to turn to other people with your intense feelings so that you needn’t feel so guilty. Finish this sentence in your journal: I feel guilty because… If you have a lot of guilty feelings, it may be that some of your feelings are actually regret for what could have been, if only your partner were well.

- When your partner is depressed they’re going to act like a depressed person. Why do you expect something different from them? When they’re manic and it’s not treated, they are very likely to spend money like a manic person. You should expect this behavior as well. This is an illness with specific symptoms as you now know. When you create a treatment plan that helps your partner take charge of their major symptoms, you may see a significant change in their behavior. Getting frustrated is totally normal, but it will not help you or your partner. Feel the frustration and then use that energy to create a plan for their recovery. Action is the best way to deal with frustration. It’s okay and normal that you feel it, but something has to change if you want it to go away.

I woke up scared and went to bed scared. I couldn’t work and couldn’t seem to get a handle on my own emotions. I was like an animal. I just went through the motions of my life, but I wasn’t there. I lost myself for a while and this is very upsetting. I wasn’t the one who was sick. Why did this happen? There are few things more stressful than putting your partner into the hospital because of bipolar disorder. There is so much uncertainty and fear. There are many questions that the staff doesn’t have time to answer. There are worries about the future of your relationship and how well your partner will be when released from the hospital. There are financial worries and family worries and often you are the main person to shoulder this burden. Other family members and friends may not have any idea of how frightening this time is for you. They may not understand bipolar disorder and often can’t empathize with you in what you are going through. This is all very common. You’re not alone in this. There are some important facts to remember when this happens. Your partner is in the hospital to get better. Your partner is safer in the hospital than at home with you. Use this time wisely.

What frequently happens is that your partner does change and become better, and yet you are still left with the feelings the episode brought up in you. And it may not be so easy for you to just let those feelings go and get on with life. The following suggestions can help you calm many of the emotions you may feel because of bipolar disorder.

You can hope that your partner will use the new treatment plan and you can do everything possible to help them use the plan, but in the end, you are in control only of what you do. A lot of uncomfortable emotions come up when bipolar disorder is in control. But what happens if you and your partner take control? What if you get the illness stabilized? Many, many people do. Naturally, the intensity of the emotions will lessen and, hopefully, go away. You can spend a lot of time focusing on how you feel without seeing many results, but when you are aware of how you feel and then change what is causing you to feel this way, you can see results quickly. This often means changing yourself, so be willing to do whatever it takes. ([Location 2546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2546))

- You may want to talk with your partner about all of these emotions, especially after you write about them in your journal. But please be careful. You don’t want to burden your partner with all of these feelings at once. Hopefully, you will be able to work together on this in the future, but there are some things that your partner really doesn’t need to know if they are currently ill. Learn to use your judgment in this situation. Turn to others, including a therapist, if you feel the need to talk about your feelings. When you do talk with your partner about these emotions, you may be surprised to find that their emotions are quite different from your own. Theirs may include self-pity, shame, or embarrassment. It’s also important that you both learn which of your partner’s emotions are symptoms of bipolar disorder and which emotions are a response to having the illness. This is something you can do together in the future. For now, focus on your life and be honest, at least to yourself, about how you really feel.

- Most people with bipolar disorder have trouble with work and money. Strictly speaking, work and money problems are not symptoms of bipolar disorder, but they are so common among those with the disorder that they might as well be called symptoms. Many people with this illness can’t handle the stress of daily work until they are stabilized. As you learned in previous chapters, bipolar disorder symptoms are often triggered by outside events. Work can be a very powerful trigger for people with the disorder. It’s natural that your partner might have problems staying in one job for a long time or staying well enough to work at all. Naturally, this can also lead to some serious money problems. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2582))

This work history will help you become realistic about your partner’s ability to work and bring money into the relationship in the future. Although it’s best if you do this work with your partner as a discovery process, you can certainly get started on your own. Using your journal, take the following steps to create the work history. Step One: Make a chronological list of your partner’s work. Write down the dates of all of your partner’s jobs, with brief descriptions. Do this for every year since your partner’s first paying job. If possible, interview your partner to discover all of this information. Also, if your partner had a lot of schooling after high school, write this down as well. School behavior often mimics work behavior. If your partner had to leave work to be hospitalized, make a note of this. When a job ended, write down the ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2615))

Maybe your partner hasn’t been able to work much at all. You may discover that your partner was fine regarding work, until the bipolar disorder symptoms became more obvious. Think of the big picture. Does your partner have a steady and stable work history or a chaotic and unreliable one? Does your partner have work problems because of one type of mood swing in particular? Is their work ability affected by the seasons? Step Three: Determine how much money your partner made each year. If you are unsure of this, write to the Social Security Administration for a report about your partner’s taxed income. Or, estimate what was made in cash. Step Four: Discover your role. How have you reacted to your partner’s work history in the past? Were you accepting if there were limitations, or did you feel frustrated and cheated? Were your expectations realistic? This is where you must be honest with yourself about what you expected from your partner regarding work and earning money from that work. Step Five: Set realistic work goals for the future. Once you have compiled your partner’s work history, you can create a realistic picture of what your partner may do in the future.

Using your journal, take the following steps to construct a clear picture of your financial history. Step One: Know your financial status to the penny. You may be afraid of this step. Many people are. Writing down your financial status is not going to make anything worse. But it can help you achieve your goal of financial stability in the future. First, list all of your debts and expenses. These include monthly house payments or rent, car payments, loans, and credit card payments. Now, write down how much money you have to pay these debts, including any salaries that come in each month. This will give you some idea of where you are financially. If it’s very stressful to think about this, that is okay. You are about to do something about it. Step Two: Know your rights. Make sure you note whose name is on which papers. Is the house or car in your name? How about the credit cards and bank accounts? Investments or retirement funds? There will be information later in this chapter about protecting yourself from your partner’s bipolar disorder spending, so first get clear on what you owe and own and what your partner owes and owns. If you’re married, it’s important that you are familiar with the laws in your area regarding debt. Step Three: Get a realistic picture of the money that will come in the future.

- Mania really does alter the way your partner thinks. Judgment goes out the window and decisions made in the moment have absolutely nothing to do with your partner’s intelligence or with past discussions about the risks of overspending. When a person is manic, spending just feels right. Just as a depressed person feels worthless and hopeless, a manic person feels the need to spend money. These desires are not intellectual or rational. For your partner, it feels like a basic need, like needing air to breathe. If you can understand this, you will see that staying upset about your partner’s manic spending is not effective. Once mania goes too far, your partner does… ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2683))

- mood swing from going too far by using your holistic treatment plan, which includes using and staying on medications. This goes for mania and hypomania equally. Both forms of mania can cause terrible spending sprees. You have to learn how your partner manifests their spending problems. Is it by buying musical instruments, custom furniture, electronic equipment, designer clothing, gourmet food, or expensive items for other people? Or is it by giving away money to help those who are in need, or by gambling? Does your partner overspend on classes or expensive seminars when manic? Naturally, you will be more aware of the big expenditures, but by then it is already too late. Although this has been discussed in earlier chapters, it’s essential that you know the early signs that your partner is becoming manic or hypomanic if you want to prevent the mania from turning into a manic spending spree. You both need to be very clear on your partner’s exact thoughts and statements about money and spending from the very first stirrings of manic feelings. You must write these symptoms on your mania symptom list and then use the “What Works” list to stop the mania… ([Location 2689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=2689))

- Although money issues are usually a more serious problem with mania, they can also be a problem with depression. The issues can be quite different; for example, instead of spending money, your partner may never leave the house, which means that no money (except what you earn) is coming in. Your partner may ignore bills and may even be unable to count money when very sick. In some cases, people suffering from depression will spend money in a desperate attempt to feel better. If your partner has a dual diagnosis, they may spend money on alcohol, drugs, or food when depressed. Once again, all of these behaviors have to be examined and noted on your partner’s symptom list so that you can work together to prevent money crises from developing in the future.

- It’s difficult to have a loving and intimate relationship when one partner is a caretaker and the other is a patient. Do you sometimes feel that you have a child instead of a partner? You may sometimes wonder why you are in the relationship at all if it only means taking care of someone who is ill. Maybe bipolar disorder cast you in a role you have no desire to play, but you see no way out because there is no one else to play the role and the person with the illness needs help. You may be asking yourself, What about me and what I want from life? Well, what about you? What do you want and need? Now that you and your partner have the tools needed to treat bipolar disorder first, it’s time for you to become clear about the role you want to play in your relationship. You may feel that bipolar disorder has taken your choice from you. When your partner is ill, you may feel you have to play the role of caretaker. You have to hold things together. Well, the truth is No, you don’t. Everything you do is a choice.

- take their medications, or putting up with constant mood swings, there is a choice. It may not be an easy choice or even what you consider a moral choice, but you do have the power of choice. If you choose to stay in a relationship with someone who is often sick, it’s important that you at least know who you are and why you do what you do. In Sickness and in Health A great many of the people who are married to a partner with bipolar disorder say that, if they had known ahead of time what they would be getting into, they would not have married that person. This lets you know you are not alone in the sometimes tremendous struggle you face when it comes to living with someone who has bipolar disorder. As you read in the first chapter, so much is expected of you when your partner gets sick, but your partner probably is the one who gets all of the attention. Your fear, pain, worry, and frustration are rarely treated. You are not the sick person. You are simply supposed to take care of the sick person. You may wonder if this is what it means to be in a relationship. Well, is it? Maybe that is what it means to be in a doctor-patient relationship, but not a normal romantic relationship. “In sickness and in health” can be hard to take when there is no health. You often have to be a financial planner, a confidant, a therapist, a nurse, a parent, a provider, and a lover all at one time. This is a lot to ask of you and very few can do it all. So don’t despair if it’s wearing you out. It wears everyone out. Answer this question honestly: What is my role in this relationship right now and how do I feel about it? Did you say caretaker, babysitter, nurse, helper, friend, confidant, or therapist? All of these are important roles when someone is ill, but if the roles are unbalanced or the illness goes on too long, there will be problems. Most people in loving relationships are willing to do almost anything for their partner during a crisis, but most life crises are time limited. There is often a rude awakening when one begins to really see the long-term nature of bipolar disorder. An illness like cancer may speed you into action, but you probably assume it will end, either with death or with recovery. What does it mean to you to know that bipolar disorder is lifelong? Yes, the illness can be managed very successfully, but it will not go away. This means you will have to find a way to balance the many roles you will be asked to play to help your partner stay stable. Balance is definitely possible. To find it, you must address your caretaking role. Some people can handle the caretaking role and others can’t. The solution is to find a balance you can live with. Read over the following caretaking descriptions and decide where you fit in. ([Location 3062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3062))

- The Supercaretaker I’m used to doing everything anyway. It was easy for me to take over when my partner got sick. I make sure he takes his meds and gets up in the morning. I’m patient when he’s sick, and I understand that I have to do almost everything around the house. But I must admit I’m getting a little resentful. I also feel like these thoughts are unkind. I want to help him, but can’t he help himself when he’s depressed? I feel like his doctor, friend, and therapist, but I certainly don’t feel like we’re a romantic couple anymore. How did this happen? I realize that I’m more like a mother now than a lover. Many of you choose to be the caretaker in your relationships. In our culture this role is often expected of women, although there are many men who play the role easily as well. It may be that you want to feel needed and admired. Or maybe your mother or father played a similar role when you were growing up. The problem with playing the caretaker for too long, however, is that you lose who you are. You have to ask yourself if you are willing to be like Mother Teresa for the duration of your relationship or if there is something more you… ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3083))

If you identify with the supercaretaker, answer the following questions in your journal: Do I really have to do all of this, or is this something that just happened and I’m going along with it? Am I being a martyr? Am I taking care of myself? What do I need and what does our relationship need in order to be happy, healthy, and stable? The remainder of this chapter will help you to clarify your answers to these questions.

- Everyone gets tired eventually, even the supercaretaker. For many people, being a caretaker 24/7 goes on for too long, until the caretaker finally collapses. This collapse can take the form of physical exhaustion, depression, or just being fed up. Often, by this time any love the caretaker used to feel has evaporated and the relationship is held together out of guilt or a sense of obligation. One outcome may be that the caretaker quits and just leaves. Sometimes this is entirely understandable. Even if you thrive on caretaking and feel that it was a role you were meant to play, you too can take only so much before you burn out. And if you are the type who runs from the caretaking role, you too will have to beware of this collapse. ([Location 3125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3125))

- Know yourself: You can’t be all things to everyone. You don’t want to lose yourself. Use the questions in this chapter to get a clear picture of the role you now play, and ask yourself whether this is truly what you want and whether it is the best thing for your partner. Help your partner find independence: If your partner is overly dependent on you to stay well, they may have a hard time finding stability on their own. You have to help your partner learn to take care of themselves with your love and help. Don’t allow bipolar disorder to define your relationship. Caretaking is not a foundation for a relationship and doesn’t create a loving and stable future. ([Location 3140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3140))

- Establish clear and firm limits: An alternative to the all-or-nothing approach of getting burned out is to rethink your role in terms of establishing limits. At the heart of this may be the necessity to adopt a view that says, I do care and I will help, but I’m not devoting my whole life to rescuing. “Rescuing” really means believing that you have to be responsible for fixing your partner. An antirescue perspective says, I’m not responsible. I care, and I’ll help, but ultimately I don’t assume full responsibility for fixing everything. This involves a humble acknowledgment of your limitations as a human being. It’s okay for you to be human and have limits—even when it seems that your partner desperately needs you. Focus on prevention: Looking to and planning for the future can make all of the difference in your relationship. Whenever you start to take care of your partner, ask yourself if this will help them or yourself in the future. Try to structure your treatment plan so that your partner is the one to make the changes instead of you having to do everything. You now have new tools that can help your partner modify and prevent mood swings. This will naturally diminish your caretaking role. Create an equal relationship: It will help a great deal if you can create a relationship where you’re equal partners. This must take into consideration what your partner can actually do. If you’re doing 90 percent of the work, yours is not a balanced relationship. Set limits. Decide what you will do if your partner can’t or won’t change. Also, be aware that you may be so used to the caretaking role that you aren’t even aware of your own behaviors. Have you taken your partner out of the equation because they can’t work or because they’re often sick? Does your partner feel worthless or helpless? Have you contributed to this? Have you even talked with your partner about this? It’s normal if this happens, but it needs to be corrected so that your relationship can become more equal. It’s not permanent: The caretaker role doesn’t have to be permanent. In fact, it needs to end at some point. It’s okay for a crisis or even for a year, but after that it creates an unequal balance in a relationship. It affects romance, sex, and the relationship as a whole. You have a new treatment plan now and you can do what it takes to get yourself back on track. Your goal is to learn how to leave the caretaking role while still being an important part of your partner’s treatment plan. Caretaking and sexuality: There is nothing sexy about the patient-caretaker relationship. If your sex life is nonexistent when you’re taking care of your partner, it may be that you will have to leave the caretaking to someone else, so ([Location 3146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3146))

- Your friends and family probably have no idea what you need when you’re in crisis. It may seem to you that they should know. They should know when you’re in pain and that you need them when your partner is sick. Unfortunately, people are not mind readers. In fact, many people are not intuitive at all. When your partner is ill, you may feel abandoned by your friends and family and wonder why they are not there for you when you need them. The truth is that, despite very good intentions, most people who don’t live with this illness will never be able to fully appreciate what you’re going through. Often, this is the chief reason you become the major caretaker in your partner’s life. This situation can change when you accept that it’s not natural for most people to know what to do about illness. You will have to learn whom to turn to when you need help, and you will have to teach them what you need. ([Location 3179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3179))

- Choose the right people: When my partner almost died after a suicide attempt, most of the people in my life just left me alone. I couldn’t believe it. I was alone most nights when he was in the hospital. His family lived in another country and our friends just seemed to disappear when I needed them. Then I got a call from a person I hardly knew. She asked me out to dinner and talked to me about my partner and the hospital and everything. I couldn’t believe this. It helped me so much. While everyone else acted as though things were normal and got on with their lives, this friend realized that nothing was normal for me. My life was a mess. I found out later that she spent half a year in the hospital when she lost her eye due to complications with diabetes. She understood! I learned from her that you have to ask the right people for help during a crisis. My family and friends love me. I know that. But they didn’t know how to help me when I really needed them.

- There are many things about bipolar disorder that you may not like, but you will have to face them if you want to create a stable, healthy, and joyful relationship. Bipolar disorder takes away so many dreams from a couple when it’s not successfully managed. It may be that your dreams have been consistently trampled by the whims of this illness, but there is still hope. One way to face the future of your relationship is to get a clear picture about the realities of that future. You may want things to work out perfectly, where your partner is suddenly cured and your lives are what you dreamed they would be, but it may be more effective to know what you’re truly up against, so that you can face your future with a clear head. The more accepting you are of the realities of this illness and how they may affect your relationship in the future, the easier it will be to either help your partner find stability or make the decision that you no longer want to stay in the relationship.

- What if no matter what you say or do, your partner says you’re attacking them and that you just need to leave them alone? What if your partner simply refuses to make any changes? This can be a terribly frustrating and frightening position to be in. But it’s true that no one is forcing you to stay in your relationship. If you know your partner is this way and there is not much you can do to change it, then it’s up to you whether to accept this behavior from your partner or to decide that you will leave. Maybe your partner tells you that bipolar disorder is none of your business or that they want to deal with things in their own way. Maybe you will do all of the work in this book for yourself, and your partner will do none of it. This can happen, especially if your partner is controlled by the illness. You can’t force someone to do anything. You can only take care of yourself. There are many people with this illness who either deny they have it and refuse prescribed medications or feel that medications are all that they need. They feel this way even when the evidence strongly indicates that they need a lot more help than they are receiving.

If this means talking about bipolar disorder and working together on a treatment plan, then do the work yourself and approach your partner once you have a treatment plan ready. If you still meet resistance, the future is up to you. Can you live with this for the rest of your life together? The facts are that some people will consistently struggle. Whether this is due to choice or because the illness is too strong, it may be that your partner can’t change as much as you would like them to. Don’t try to force change. If you have created a plan and your partner won’t or can’t use it, and after six months or more little has changed, that is when you will have to make decisions about your own life.

- It helps if you understand that many of your partner’s family members may have untreated mental illness as well. Mental illness does run in families. Your other option is to turn to others and give your partner’s family a very limited role to play in your new treatment plan. If your partner’s family sabotages your work, then you must make a choice. It’s a hard choice, but it’s one that has to be made. You can tell them that they either have to join you or leave you alone, but they can no longer undermine the work you’re doing. One effective tool is to teach yourself how to talk with your partner’s family. For example, your partner’s family may say, “He’s not sick, he’s just creative. You need to give him some space.” Or, “She doesn’t have an illness. She’s just a sensitive person. You’re just trying to cause problems. Why can’t you accept her for how she is?” They may also continually bail your partner out of difficult situations or lend money after the mood swings have caused a financial disaster. Here is a suggestion on how you can talk with your partner’s family if they are causing you trouble: Your patient but very firm response: “I know you love your child (brother, sister, etc.). You have the right to your own opinions, but as I’m the one who lives with them every day, it’s time for me to make some decisions on my own.

- has very distinct and clear symptoms. All of the people who have bipolar disorder have the same symptoms. This isn’t something I’ve made up. It has nothing to do with being creative, though many people with bipolar disorder are very creative. It has nothing to do with being sensitive, though that’s also a symptom of the illness. I need your help with this. Every time you help them after a mood swing, you’re allowing the behavior to continue. You must see that there is a very definite pattern to their behavior. I know that you love them and it’s time for us to work together or for you to leave us alone so that they can get better. We’re going to try the new treatment plan in this book and I would love for you to join us in this new project. What do you say?” If the family is unresponsive or if your partner continues to run back to their family for help when sick and shuts you out, you then have to decide whether you will put up with this behavior and for how long. Once you decide this, create a plan to take care of yourself and let your partner’s family take over. Yes, this is hard, but you have to think of your future.

- treatment for bipolar disorder as chemotherapy, but that is exactly what it is. It’s easier to accept the side effects of cancer chemotherapy because they are so well-known and because they may be life-saving. In contrast, side effects from bipolar disorder medications are often not fully explained or they are discounted. Doctors may not talk enough about the side effects with you, and they may say that your partner just needs to adjust to the medications. It’s hard to hear this when your partner is sleeping fourteen hours a day and has gained fifteen pounds in one month. It’s hard to accept this when the person you love can’t have an orgasm. It’s hard to accept this when your partner simultaneously throws up and has diarrhea from a medication that is supposed to keep them stable. It’s understandable that your partner would want to quit taking medications that seem to make them more ill than bipolar disorder itself. But there has to be a compromise. Talk with your partner about trying your new treatment plan so that they may, at some point, be able to take smaller doses of the medications (which will mean fewer side effects). Medications are something you need to get a handle on, sooner rather than later. Just as you have to accept bipolar disorder in your relationship, your partner needs to accept that they will need certain medications, possibly for the rest of their lives, depending on what symptoms cause them the most trouble.

This is a very serious issue when you have or are thinking of having children. It doesn’t mean you have to be scared. It means you have to be aware and honest with family members.

Bipolar disorder can occur as early as six years old or as late as fifty (Hales and Yudofsky 1999). Note that most kids living in a home where one person has bipolar disorder are subject to significant stresses, and their reactions to this stress must be distinguished from the early signs of emerging bipolar disorder.

- What is your partner’s favorite thing to do? Perhaps bipolar disorder has stopped your partner from doing what they love. This can certainly be a result of all of the symptoms they experience. Mania may cause your partner to do the things they think they love to do, and yet the behavior often seems unfocused and over the top. Anxiety or psychosis may make it impossible for your partner to concentrate on anything for very long. Depression may eliminate your partner’s desire to do most things, so it’s only natural they would completely stop doing what they love.

- Bipolar disorder may have caused you both to overanalyze everything. By talking with your partner and letting them know you are making changes, you can separate yourselves from the control that bipolar disorder has over your relationship. Decide that, for at least a few hours, you will take your lives back. At first, this will not be easy, but keep doing it. Soon it will become second nature and your partner may be amazed to realize they can still have fun—even when they’re sick. This may start a healing chain reaction where your partner has a taste of what it feels like to feel better, and they will want more.

- Exercise: The “Do What You Love” Evening You can plan this evening in your journal. The first step is to answer the same question for your partner that you answered yourself: What does my partner really love to do? Once you have that answer, write down all of the ways your partner used to do this activity. It may be cooking, going to movies, rock climbing, traveling, singing, crafts, or working on the car. You will know what your partner likes. Write about what your partner was like before they got sick. How did they do what they love? Did it take special tools, supplies, or a specific location? Write down what you will need to prepare for this evening. You may have to modify things a bit, but you can still re-create the activity your partner used to love by surrounding them ([Location 3558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3558))

- with the objects and tools used for doing what they loved to do in the past. You will then plan an evening completely around this activity. Your partner may resist you at first, but keep trying. If they’re depressed, you have to break through the depression with action, and one of the best ways to do this is by helping them do something they love. Here is an example of an evening planned around a person who loves to cook and watch movies. ([Location 3563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3563))

- It’s okay for you to laugh and feel joy when someone you love is very ill. Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed to see your friends or to have a moment when you’re not thinking about your partner. You really do need a break from the stress. Time off will make you more able to deal with the reality of your partner’s illness and it will help you stay well mentally, as well as physically. This may seem too difficult to do, but there is a strong technique you can use until you are ready to actually feel laughter and joy more naturally. This technique is called acting as if. Acting as If “Acting as if” is a powerful tool you can teach your partner, but you must first learn the technique yourself. It’s interesting that so many songs tell us to act as if we are well. We are told to put on a happy face, walk on the sunny side of the street, sing in the rain, and smile even if our heart is breaking. Why? Because it can change who you are. Just as a negative thought, whether true or not, affects how you feel about yourself and the world, a happy thought, whether true or not, can trick your brain into thinking that things are better than they are. And the miracle is that, when you act as if, something happens and things suddenly do feel better than they had been feeling.

- Acting as if things are better than they are means that your partner accepts the truth that the illness makes them feel a certain way, but they have decided to act as though they are well in spite of the disorder. Here is how this works: Your partner feels too depressed to work. There are projects that need to be done, but even thinking about doing them seems impossible. When your partner acts as if, they make a conscious decision to bypass the bipolar disorder feelings and get something done anyway. Once they make the decision to act as if the project is possible, they simply stand up and say to themselves, My brain doesn’t want to do this. Bipolar disorder doesn’t want me to do this. I know the illness is ([Location 3630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3630))

- controlling me. But for now I’m going to say no to that and act as if I’m well. I’m going to start with the first step of the project and take it from there. Bipolar disorder can’t do this, but I can. (And when the bipolar thoughts start to take over, your partner can say, I hear you, but I’m acting well today, so you can just go away.) And they keep on going. Acting as if takes a lot of practice, but it works. Eventually, it will no longer be an act. The mood swing will end and your partner can feel joy naturally. This works really well if your partner can do this when you’re enjoying your bipolar-free evening. They may not want to participate at first, because it’s one of the symptoms of bipolar disorder not to do what you love doing, but they have to act as if. They have to make themselves laugh. They have to remind themselves that it’s natural and healthy to feel joy again. Laughter and joy are like muscles. You and your partner have to exercise these muscles every day. Acting as if can strengthen your relationship if you do it together on a regular basis. ([Location 3635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3635))

- It cannot be stressed enough that the use of antidepressants in bipolar I can provoke manic episodes (in psychiatry this effect is known as switching) and can cause increased frequency of manic and depressive episodes (this effect is often referred to as cycle acceleration). In addition, antidepressants are generally ineffective in treating bipolar depression in people with bipolar I. They can be used in bipolar II, but with caution, and only if other treatments have been ineffective. When used, they must be prescribed along with an antimanic agent (e.g., lithium). Antidepressants can provoke hypomania, but of greater concern is the possibility that long-term antidepressant treatment may cause cycle acceleration in bipolar II patients. Antidepressants are a well-known cause of rapid cycling (e.g., experiencing four or more full-blown episodes a year). Among antidepressants, the MAOIs (Nardil and Parnate) have the best track record in terms of effectiveness, although they are rarley used in the United States. Also effective are Wellbutrin and some other antidepressants such as Prozac and Zoloft. All carry some risks of switching, but this is much less likely if given alongside a mood stabilizer. The antidepressant Effexor and older-generation antidepressants like Elavil are very prone to cause rapid cycling and cycle acceleration. Please note that not all health care professionals are aware of this information. It simply can’t be stated often enough that antidepressants in bipolar disorder treatment must be handled by a skilled health care professional who understands these medications’ direct effect on bipolar disorder mood swings. It is never indicated for a person with bipolar disorder to be on an antidepressant without some form of antimania medication. There are no exceptions. If your loved one is on an antidepressant, it is essential that they discuss this issue with their prescriber.

- Common side effects: These include nausea and heartburn; energized or anxious feelings (this typically subsides within one to two weeks); headaches; sedation (primarily with Remeron and Desyrel); difficulty falling asleep (often subsides in a few weeks); muscle tremor; rash; and sexual dysfunction. Note that depression itself can significantly reduce sex drive, and not all forms of sexual dysfunction among depressed people are caused ([Location 3824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006CUXPEK&location=3824))

- by antidepressants. Occasionally antidepressants may decrease sex drive, but the most common sexual side effect is inorgasmia, or difficulty achieving an orgasm despite adequate arousal. Drug-induced inorgasmia can occur in 25 to 30 percent of people treated with antidepressants (sexual side effects are very rare with Wellbutrin). Antidepressants do not cause erectile dysfunction (i.e., impotency). Weight gain is another side effect common with antidepressants, especially with Remeron and Paxil (with other antidepressants, weight gain can occur in up to 10 percent of people, but the weight gain typically does not occur until the person has been taking the drug longer than six months).
