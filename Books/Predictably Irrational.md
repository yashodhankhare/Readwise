## Highlights
- Rather, they were most likely the victims of inherent biases in their perceptions of their patients’ pain—biases that apparently were not altered even by their vast experience. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=126))
- humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We don’t have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather, we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly. (For instance, we don’t know how much a six-cylinder car is worth, but we can assume it’s more expensive than the four-cylinder model.) ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=216))
- $125. In fact, you could reasonably deduce that in the combination package, the Internet subscription is free! “It’s a bloody steal—go for it, governor!” I could almost hear them shout from the riverbanks of the Thames. And I have to admit, if I had been inclined to subscribe I probably would have taken the package deal myself. (Later, when I tested the offer on a large number of participants, the vast majority preferred the Internet-and-print deal.) So what was going on here? Let me start with a fundamental observation: most people don’t know ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=220))
- We don’t know what kind of racing bike we want—until we see a champ in the Tour de France ratcheting the gears on ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=225))
- particular model. We don’t know what kind of speaker system we like—until we hear a set of speakers that sounds better than the previous one. We don’t even know what we want to do with our lives—until we find a relative or a friend who is doing just what we think we should be doing. Everything is relative, and that’s the point. Like an airplane pilot landing in the dark, we want runway lights on either side of us, guiding us to the place where we can touch down our wheels. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=225))
- But Sam also knows that given three choices, most people will take the middle choice (as in landing your plane between the runway lights). So guess which television Sam prices as the middle option? That’s right—the one he wants to sell! Of course, Sam is not alone in his cleverness. The New York Times ran a story recently about Gregg Rapp, a restaurant consultant, who gets paid to work out the pricing for menus. He knows, for instance, how lamb sold this year as opposed to last year; whether lamb did better paired with squash or with risotto; and whether orders decreased when the price of the main course was hiked from $39 to $41. One thing Rapp has learned is that high-priced entrées on the menu boost revenue for the restaurant—even if no one buys them. Why? Because even though people generally won’t buy the most expensive dish on the ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=237))
- Thus, by creating an expensive dish, a restaurateur can lure customers into ordering the second most expensive choice (which can be cleverly engineered to deliver a higher profit margin).1 SO LET’S RUN through the Economist’s sleight of hand in slow motion. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=243))
- The middle circle is the same size in both positions, of course, but it appears to change depending on what we place next to it. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=275))
- This might be a mere curiosity, but for the fact that it mirrors the way the mind is wired: we are always looking at the things around us in relation to others. We can’t help it. This holds true not only for physical things—toasters, bicycles, puppies, restaurant entrées, and spouses—but for experiences such as vacations and educational options, and for ephemeral things as well: emotions, attitudes, and points of view. We always compare jobs with jobs, vacations with vacations, lovers with lovers, and wines with wines. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=276))
- ONCE YOU SEE the decoy effect in action, you realize that it is the secret agent in more decisions than we could imagine. It even helps us decide whom to date—and, ultimately, whom to marry. Let me describe an experiment that explored just this subject. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=318))
- Now that you know this secret, be careful: when a similar but better-looking friend of the same sex asks you to accompany him or her for a night out, you might wonder whether you have been invited along for your company or merely as a decoy. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=375))
- The executive looked at me with alarm. “We could get over a lot of things here—insider trading, financial scandals, and the like—but if everyone knew everyone else’s salary, it would be a true catastrophe. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=400))
- That’s a lesson we can all learn: the more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=454))
- Understand that relativity is everywhere, and that we view everything through its lens—rose-colored or otherwise. When you meet someone in a different country or city and it seems that you have a magical connection, realize that the enchantment might be limited to the surrounding circumstances. This realization might prevent you from subsequent disenchantment. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=483))
    - Note: imp
- had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.” ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=511))
- the human brain, then, wired like that of a gosling? Do our first impressions and decisions become imprinted? And if so, how does this imprinting play out in our lives? When we encounter a new product, for instance, do we accept the first price that comes before our eyes? And more importantly, does that price (which in academic lingo we call an anchor) have a long-term effect on our willingness to pay for the product from then on? ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=519))
- But price tags by themselves are not necessarily anchors. They become anchors when we contemplate ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=595))
- found that people who move to a new city generally remain anchored to the prices they paid for housing in their former city. In their study they found that people who move from inexpensive markets (say, Lubbock, Texas) to moderately priced cities (say, Pittsburgh) don’t increase their spending to fit the new market.* ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=603))
- To put it in terms of goslings, would they swim across the pond after their original imprint and then, midway, swing their allegiance to a new mother goose? In terms of goslings, I think you know that they would stick with the original mom. But what about humans? The next two phases of the experiment would enable us to answer these questions. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=648))
- indicating that anchors have an enduring effect for present prices as well as for future prices. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=663))
    - Note: imp
- Those who had first encountered the 10-cent anchor accepted low prices, even after 90 cents was suggested as the anchor. On the other hand, those who had first encountered the 90-cent anchor kept on demanding much higher prices, regardless of the anchors that followed. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=672))
- First impressions are important, whether they involve remembering that our first DVD player cost much more than such players cost today (and realizing that, in comparison, the current prices are a steal) or remembering that gas was once a dollar a gallon, which makes every trip to the gas station a painful experience. In all these cases the random, and not so random, anchors that we encountered along the way and were swayed by remain with us long after the initial decision itself. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=675))
- “This must be a fantastic restaurant,” and joins the line. Others join. We call this type of behavior herding. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=682))
- It happens when we assume that something is good (or bad) on the basis of other people’s previous behavior, and our own actions follow suit. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=683))
- there’s also another kind of herding, one that we call self-herding. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=685))
    - Note: imp
- You’ve already made this decision many times in the past, so you now assume that this is the way you want to spend your money. You’ve herded yourself—lining up behind your initial experience at Starbucks—and now you’re part of the crowd. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=706))
- HOWEVER, THERE IS something odd in this story. If anchoring is based on our initial decisions, how did Starbucks manage to become an initial decision in the first place? In other words, if we were previously anchored to the prices at Dunkin’ Donuts, how did we move our anchor to Starbucks? This is where it gets really interesting. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=709))
- make the experience feel different—so different that we would not use the prices at Dunkin’ Donuts as an anchor, but instead would be open to the new anchor that Starbucks was preparing for us. And that, to a great extent, is how Starbucks succeeded. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=718))
- These questions may be tough nuts to crack, but in terms of our personal lives, we can actively improve on our irrational behaviors. We can start by becoming aware of our vulnerabilities. Suppose you’re planning to buy a cutting-edge cell phone (the one with the three-megapixel, 8× zoom digital camera), or even a daily $4 cup of gourmet coffee. You might begin by questioning that habit. How did it begin? Second, ask yourself what amount of pleasure you will be getting out of it. Is the pleasure as much as you thought you would get? Could you cut back a little and better spend the remaining money on something else? With everything you do, in fact, you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors. In the case of the cell phone, could you take a step back from the cutting edge, reduce your outlay, and use some of the money for something else? And as for the coffee—rather than asking which blend of coffee you will have today, ask yourself whether you should even be having that habitual cup of expensive coffee at all. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=778))
- When we face such a decision, it might seem to us that this is just one decision, without large consequences; but in fact the power of the first decision can have such a long-lasting effect that it will percolate into our future decisions for years to come. Given this effect, the first decision is crucial, and we should give it an appropriate amount of attention. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=788))
- Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Perhaps it’s time to inventory the imprints and ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=790))

- because you were lured by the FREE! To replicate this experience in our chocolate experiment, we told our customers that they could choose only a single sweet—the Kiss or the truffle. It was an either-or decision, like choosing one kind of athletic sock over another. That’s what made the customers’ reaction to the FREE! Kiss so dramatic: Both chocolates were discounted by the same amount of money. The relative price difference between the two was unchanged—and so was the expected pleasure from both. ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=944))
- think it’s because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. The real allure of FREE! is tied to this fear. There’s no visible possibility of loss when we choose a FREE! item (it’s free). But suppose we choose the item that’s not free. Uh-oh, now there’s a risk of having made a poor decision—the possibility of a loss. And so, given the choice, we go for what is free. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=971))
- ZERO MAY ALSO affect food purchases. Food manufacturers have to convey all kinds of information on the side of the box. They have to tell us about the calories, fat content, fiber, etc. Is it possible that the same attraction we have to zero price could also apply to zero calories, zero trans fats, zero carbs, etc.? If the same general rules apply, Pepsi will sell more cans if the label says “zero calories” than if it says “one calorie.” ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1072))
- you are in business, and understand that, you can do some marvelous things. Want to draw a crowd? Make something FREE! Want to sell more products? Make part of the purchase FREE! ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1082))
- What has changed is the displeasure. In this setting the rational consumer would have a lower level of displeasure for both chocolates because the prices have been reduced by one cent (and one displeasure unit). Here is the main point: because both products were discounted by the same amount, their relative difference would be unchanged. The total expected pleasure for the truffle would now be 36 pleasure units (50 – 14), and the total expected pleasure for the Kiss would now be five pleasure units (5 – 0). The truffle leads by the same 31 points, ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1140))

- When money was mentioned, the lawyers used market norms and found the offer lacking, relative to their market salary. When no money was mentioned they used social norms and were willing to volunteer their time. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1208))
- Because once market norms enter our considerations, the social norms depart. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1210))
- The conclusion: no one is offended by a small gift, because even small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from market norms. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1229))
- People are willing to work free, and they are willing to work for a reasonable wage; but offer them just a small payment and they will walk away. Gifts are also effective for sofas, and offering people a gift, even a small one, is sufficient to get them to help; but mention what the gift cost you, and you will ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1239))

- your relationships in the social domain and away from market norms. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1269))
- experiment illustrates an unfortunate fact: when a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off the rose—once a social norm is trumped by a market norm—it will rarely return. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1290))
- You can’t treat your customers like family one moment and then treat them impersonally—or, even worse, as a nuisance or a competitor—a moment later when this becomes more convenient or profitable. This is not how social relationships work. If you ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1318))
- the majority will most likely prefer cash over the gift. But the gift has its value, though this is sometimes ill understood—it can provide a boost to the social relationship between the employer and the employee, and by doing so provide long-term benefits to everyone. Think of it this way: who do you suppose is likely to work harder, show more loyalty, and truly love his work more—someone who is getting $1,000 in cash or someone who is getting a personal gift? Of course, a gift is a symbolic gesture. And to be sure, no one is going to work for gifts rather than a salary. For that matter, no one is going to work for nothing. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1361))
- Google, which offers a wide variety of benefits for employees (including free gourmet lunches), you can see how much goodwill is created by emphasizing the social side of the company-worker relationship. It’s remarkable how much work companies (particularly start-ups) can get out of people when social norms (such as the excitement of building something together) are stronger than market norms (such as salaries stepping up with each promotion). If corporations started thinking ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1366))
- pride in their profession and a sense of duty—that will motivate them to give up their lives and health. A friend of mine in Miami once accompanied a U.S. customs agent on a patrol of the offshore waters. The agent carried an assault rifle and could certainly have pounded several holes into a fleeing drug boat. But had he ever done so? No way, he replied. He wasn’t about to get himself killed for the government salary he received. In fact, he confided, his group had an unspoken agreement with the drug couriers: the feds wouldn’t fire if the drug dealers didn’t fire. Perhaps that’s why we rarely (if ever) hear about gun battles on the edges of America’s “war on drugs.” ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1378))
- Burning Man has many extraordinary aspects, but for me one of the most remarkable is its rejection of market norms. Money is not accepted at Burning Man. Rather, the whole place works as a gift exchange economy—you give things to other people, with the understanding that they will give something back to you (or to someone else) at some point in the future. Thus, people who can cook might fix a meal. Psychologists offer free counseling sessions. Masseuses massage those lying on tables before them. Those who have water offer showers. People give away drinks, homemade jewelry, and hugs. (I made some puzzles at the hobby shop at MIT, and gave them to people. Mostly, people enjoyed trying to solve them.) At first this was all very strange, but before long I found myself adopting the norms of Burning Man. I was surprised, in fact, to find that Burning Man was the most accepting, social, and caring place I had ever been. I’m not sure I could easily survive in Burning Man for all 52 weeks of the year. But this experience has convinced me that life with fewer market norms and more social norms would be more satisfying, creative, fulfilling, and ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1420))
- Neighbor Z? Since you have already paid him once (to make and share dinner with you), his logical response to your request for help might be, “Fine. How much will you pay me this time?” Again, the prospect of acting rationally, financially speaking, sounds deeply irrational in terms of social norms. The point is that while gifts are financially inefficient, they are an important social lubricant. They help us make friends and create long-term relationships that can sustain us through the ups and downs of life. Sometimes, it turns out, a waste of money can be worth a lot. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1453))
- also added, correctly, that in this situation, the economically rational thing to do would be to lease rather than buy. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1518))
- The basic lesson, then, is that when we offer people a financial payment in a situation that is governed by social norms, the added payment could actually reduce their motivation to engage and help out. But what if the situation ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1557))
- demand. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1562))
- when price is not a part of the exchange, we become less selfish maximizers and start caring more about the welfare of others. We saw this demonstrated ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1607))
- when the rules of the game involve money, this tendency ([Location 1610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1610))
- THE RESULTS FROM our experiment also help explain one of the great mysteries in life: why, when we are dining out with friends, taking the last olive feels like such a big deal. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1612))
- shared resource, and once something is part of the social good, it leads us into the realm of social norms, and with that the rules for sharing with others. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=1629))
- When we promise to save our money, we are in a cool state. When we promise to exercise and watch our diet, again we’re cool. But then the lava flow of hot emotion comes rushing in: just when we promise to save, we see a new car, a mountain bike, or a pair of shoes that we must have. Just when we plan to exercise regularly, we find a reason to sit all day in front of the television. And as for the diet? I’ll take that slice of chocolate cake and begin the diet in earnest tomorrow. Giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification, my friends, is procrastination. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2009))
- set no deadlines at all (except for the final deadline) had the worst grades; ([Location 2058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2058))
- that tightly restricting their freedom (equally spaced deadlines, imposed from above) is the best cure for procrastination. But the biggest revelation is that simply offering the students a tool by which they could precommit to deadlines helped them achieve better grades.

- Resisting temptation and instilling self-control are general human goals, and repeatedly failing to achieve them is a source of much of our misery. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2077))
- the most obvious conclusion is that when an authoritative “external voice” gives the orders, most ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2083))
- What’s the bottom line? We have problems with self-control, related to immediate and delayed gratification—no doubt there. But each of the problems we face has potential self-control mechanisms, as well. If we can’t save from our paycheck, we can take advantage of our employer’s automatic deduction option; if we don’t have the will to exercise regularly alone, we can make an appointment to exercise in the company of our friends. These are the tools that we can commit to in advance, and they may help us be the kind of people we want to be. ([Location 2088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2088))
- if a particular desired behavior results in an immediate negative outcome (punishment), this behavior will be very difficult to promote, even if the ultimate outcome (in my case, improved health) is highly desirable. After all, that’s what the problem of delayed gratification is all about. Certainly, we know that exercising regularly and eating more vegetables will help us be healthier, even if we don’t live to be as old as the Delany sisters; but because it is very hard to hold a vivid image of our future health in our mind’s eye, we can’t keep from reaching for the doughnuts.

- fallibility, I believe it’s useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and positive reinforcements with the not-so-pleasant steps we have to take toward our long-term objectives. For me, beginning a movie—before I felt any side effects—helped me to sustain the unpleasantness of the treatment. As a matter of fact, I timed everything perfectly. The moment I finished injecting myself, I pressed the Play button. I suspect that had I hit Play after the side effects kicked in, I would not have been as successful in winning the tug-of-war. And who knows? Maybe if I had waited for the side effects to kick in before I started the movies, I would have created a negative association and would now ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002C949KE&location=2333))
- The trick is to find the right behavioral antidote for each problem. By pairing something that we love with something that we dislike but that is good for us, we might be able to harness desire with outcome—and thus overcome some of the problems with self-control we face every day.
