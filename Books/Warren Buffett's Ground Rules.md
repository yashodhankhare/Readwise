## Highlights
- “The availability of a quotation for your business interest (stock) should always be an asset to be utilized if desired. If it gets silly enough in either direction, you take advantage of it.”1 —JULY 12, 1966 ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=387))
- Why do smart, well-staffed, well-resourced, well-connected, experienced investment managers so consistently fail to beat an unmanaged index? Writing in 1965, Buffett offered his own opinion: In the great majority of cases the lack of performance exceeding or even matching an unmanaged index in no way reflects lack of either intellectual capacity or integrity. I think it is much more the product of: (1) group decisions—my perhaps jaundiced view is that it is close to impossible for outstanding investment management to come from a group of any size with all parties really participating in decisions; (2) a desire to conform to the policies and (to an extent) the portfolios of other large well-regarded organizations; (3) an institutional framework whereby average is “safe” and the personal rewards for independent action are in no way commensurate with the general risk attached to such action; (4) an adherence to certain diversification practices which are irrational; and finally and importantly, (5) inertia.6...

- In the great majority of cases the lack of performance exceeding or even matching an unmanaged index in no way reflects lack of either intellectual capacity or integrity. I think it is much more the product of: (1) group decisions—my perhaps jaundiced view is that it is close to impossible for outstanding investment management to come from a group of any size with all parties really participating in decisions; (2) a desire to conform to the policies and (to an extent) the portfolios of other large well-regarded organizations; (3) an institutional framework whereby average is “safe” and the personal rewards for independent action are in no way commensurate with the general risk attached to such action; (4) an adherence to certain diversification practices which are irrational; and finally and importantly, (5) inertia.6 ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=862))
- So far, Buffett’s lessons from the letters have revolved around six key ideas for all investors: Think of stocks (1) as fractional claims on entire businesses, (2) that swing somewhat erratically in the short term but (3) behave more in line with their gains in intrinsic business value over the longer term, which, when (4) viewed through the lens of a long-term compounding program (5) tend to produce pretty good results, which, with (6) an index product, can be captured efficiently in a low-cost, easy-to-implement way. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=952))
- The first test measures each year’s results relative to the market’s performance—we simply don’t care if we are up or down in any given year. Instead, we focus on whether the year has been better or worse than the market average. Because the general trend is up, if you ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=985))
- can manage to be down a little less in down markets and up a little more in up markets, your performance will likely be stellar. Investors simply want to beat the averages on a relative basis cumulatively and as often as possible, letting the plus and minus years fall where they may in absolute terms. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=987))
- It’s not that he insisted his standards were the best, or that others weren’t equally valid, but these were his standards, and he made it clear that only those who agreed with them should be in the Partnership. If he achieved what ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=995))
- he set out to do, he wanted to receive the proper “hosannas.” If not, he expected partners to withdraw. The takeaway for the rest of us is to establish and ensure the yardsticks are in place ahead of time in order to avoid any misunderstanding about what you should be cheering for, because, as Buffett puts it, you don’t want soft fruit thrown when the expectation is for vigorous applause. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=997))
- Virtually every comment he makes regarding performance is made on a relative basis. At one point, he explains his thinking as if he were talking to a golfing buddy: I would consider a year in which we declined 15% and the Average 30% to be much superior to a year when both we and the Average advanced 20%. Over a period of time there are going to be good ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1013))
- and bad years; there is nothing to be gained by getting enthused or depressed about the sequence in which they occur. The important thing is to be beating par; a four on a par three hole is not as good as a five on a par five hole and it is unrealistic to assume we are not going to have our share of both par three’s and par five’s.6 ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1016))
- He taught and reminded investors that even a given year’s relative performance was largely a matter of luck. It relies on the “voting machine” nature of short-term market movements. As you stretch out your evaluation horizon, the test becomes more and more like a “weighing machine.” Buffett also teaches investors that there is one important caveat to the ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1033))
- multiyear test: Underperformance in the late stages of a speculative bull market is highly likely. It’s a caveat that he repeats to this day. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1036))
- Because of the conservative nature of his value-oriented investment style, Buffett teaches us to generally expect better relative performance in down markets. Again, he was perfectly fine with being down in such periods, but he expected to be down less than the market as a whole. Investors following these principles today should share in this expectation. Because of the methods deployed and the types of securities purchased, down markets tend to show the ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1043))
- best performance. As Buffett told partners in 1962, a declining Dow gives us our chance to shine and pile up the percentage advantages which, coupled with only an average performance during advancing markets, will give us quite satisfactory long-term results. Our target is an approximately ½% decline for each 1% decline in the Dow and if achieved, means we have a considerably more conservative vehicle for investment in stocks than practically any alternative.8 ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1046))
- Buffett reminds investors that principles, including those that measure performance, don’t change. He insisted on a minimum 3-year test for active managers versus the market when the industry wasn’t really measuring at all. By the end of the 1960s, the industry had gone from not measuring up at all to measuring up way too frequently. He was still advocating a minimum 3-year test when these folks were measuring by the minute, which was just as bad as not measuring at all. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1051))
- I want to stress the points mentioned in the “Ground Rules” regarding application of the standard—namely that it should be applied on at least a three-year basis because of the nature of our operation and also that during a speculative boom we may lag the field. However, one thing I ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1077))
- can promise you. We started out with a 36-inch yardstick and we’ll keep it that way. If we don’t measure up, we won’t change yardsticks. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1079))
- Frankly, I have several selfish reasons for insisting that we apply a yardstick and that we both utilize the same yardstick. Naturally, I get a kick out of beating par—in the lyrical words of Casey Stengel, “Show me a good loser, and I’ll show you a loser.” More importantly, I insure that I will not get blamed for the wrong reason (having losing years) but only for the right reason (doing poorer than the Dow). Knowing partners will grade me on the right basis helps me do a better job. Finally, setting up the relevant yardsticks ahead of time insures that we will all get out of this business if the results become mediocre (or worse). It means that past successes cannot cloud judgment of current results. It should reduce the chance of ingenious rationalizations of inept performance. (Bad lighting has been bothering me at the bridge table lately.) While this masochistic ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1100))
- approach to measurement may not sound like much of an advantage, I can assure you from my observations of business entities that such evaluation would have accomplished a great deal in many investment and industrial organizations. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1106))
- No matter how others in the market were changing their yardsticks—no matter whether they were measuring too infrequently or too often—Buffett teaches us never to change ours. It is the market that changes around the investor’s fixed mindset; the market never holds sway over us. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1146))

- As Charlie Munger has said, “I think I’ve been in the top 5% of my age cohort almost my entire adult life in understanding the power of incentives, and yet I’ve always underestimated that power. Never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of incentive superpower.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1171))
- “If you want ants to come, you put sugar on the floor.” ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1182))
- but where he was unique was that he also set it up so that if the Partnership’s results were poor, his performance would be equally miserable. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1262))
- Intrinsic value can be estimated a number of different ways. Most are a derivation of an appraisal of either the value of a company’s (1) assets or (2) earnings power. Each method, asset based or earnings based, can be useful at different times and indeed they are linked; the value of any asset will always be linked to the earnings it is capable of producing. However, one approach is typically more practical depending on the situation. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1451))
- After introducing the stellar records of this anomalous group, Buffett laid out their unifying method, which should sound familiar: While they differ greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock (emphasis Buffett). . . . Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1496))
- a business, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the difference between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1499))
- Value investors’ methods are highly atypical in one important way. Usually when a new idea or rules-based trading system is introduced and shown to be effective, market participants copy it, and by doing so, the excess return from the new idea gets “arbitraged away.” Simply buying cheap stocks, however, has remained a remarkably effective strategy, despite the fact that its efficacy ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1501))
- has been well documented for decades. Buffett concludes his famous speech by addressing this anomaly: I can only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and David Dodd wrote Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing in the last 35 years I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult. The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It is likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1503))
- Because his primary focus was not to lose money, Graham liked to “look down before he looked up.” He relished acquiring companies that could (if necessary) be shuttered, where all the assets could be sold off and all the debts and obligations extinguished, and yet still, once all this activity was complete, a residual amount would be remaining as a profit above the market price. These companies were literally worth more dead (in liquidation) than they were alive (as going concerns). It’s not that the companies were actually liquidated all that often, although sometimes they were—the ([Location 1519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1519))
- the point was that there was value in the equity even in liquidation. Graham’s system not only generated healthy returns, but also all but ensured that he would never go broke again. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1523))
- Buffett was also purchasing these kinds of stocks for the Partnership, called “net-nets” for short. In these situations, he often found some combination of a large pile of cash, securities in the bank, trade receivables due, or salable inventory. The collective liquidation value of these assets alone was “netted” against all the company’s liabilities—when what remained was still worth more than the market price of the ([Location 1525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1525))
- company, he possessed a large margin of safety. Buyers like Graham and Buffett (and the once-famous Ned “Net-Quick” Evans, whose name in his era was as well known as Buffett’s is today) defined the times by investing in these types of situations. Whether they chose to wind up the business at a profit or allowed it to recover on its own, they were usually buying below the liquidation value, getting the value of the underlying business for free or even at a negative value. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1528))
- Better yet was when he spotted others doing the work on behalf of all shareholders, and he could go along for the ride. Investing alongside them but not participating in the activism directly was called “coattail riding.” Anyone can do that. Buying the securities right after ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1546))

- Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school (and as I write this no one has come back from recess—I may be the only one left in the class), the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a “high-probability insight.” This is what causes the cash register to really sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights usually are, and, of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side—the figures should hit you ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1594))
- over the head with a baseball bat. So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1598))
- Buying stocks that are cheap when the companies are struggling gives the investor a chance to be rewarded twice: once through improved business results and then again through an improved market valuation in accordance with the better business results.

- think people would be better off if they only had 10 opportunities to buy stocks throughout their lifetime. You know what would happen? They would make sure that each buy was a good one. They would do lots and lots of research before they made the buy. You don’t have to have many 4X growth opportunities to get rich. You don’t need to do too much, but the environment makes you feel like you need to do something all the time.

How do they relate to my long-term expectations for earnings and cash flows? (3) Invert: What are the likely ways I’ll be wrong? If I’m wrong, how much can I lose? (4) What is the current intrinsic value of the business? How fast is it growing or shrinking? And finally, (5) Compare: does the discount to intrinsic value, properly weighted for both the downside risk and upside reward, compare favorably to all the other options available to me? ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1725))

- Over the years our timing of purchases has been considerably better than our timing of sales. We do not go into these generals with the idea of getting the last nickel, but are usually quite content selling out at some intermediate level between our purchase price and what we regard as fair value to a private owner. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1799))
- Just because something is cheap does not mean it is not going to go down. During abrupt downward movements in the market, this segment may very well go down percentage-wise just as much as the Dow. Over ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1802))
- In his commentary on Generals we see Buffett departing from teaching principles and now teaching methods. While principles never change—they are timeless—methods can and often should change according to a given investing environment. We see different methods used by Buffett at various stages of the Partnership, in various stages of the market cycle, in order to best act in accordance with his principles. Through this migration of his style from value ([Location 1892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1892))
- quality, he’s providing us with several methods for our own investment endeavors. Generals–Private Owner and Generals–Relatively Undervalued are the first two tools he’s given us and they can provide a wide variety of potential choices in the market. We can hunt for bargains or we can hunt for great businesses. In his discussion of Workouts and Controls, our next two chapters, we’ll continue adding tools to our toolkit and see the ways in which Buffett chooses among them. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1896))
- “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to arbitrage and you feed him forever.”1 —BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY’S 1988 ANNUAL REPORT ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1904))
- Results tend to be magnified in both directions because borrowed money is typically used alongside the partner’s capital in order to obtain larger positions. Buffett’s self-imposed limit on the use of borrowed money for arbitrage was 25% of partnership capital. Not a trivial sum. The key in this business is not being wrong very often. Because leverage was used, the actual returns for investors were even better. However, to make money in merger arb, the deals have to close. While most go through as planned, some deals get scuttled by unfavorable antitrust law, tax rulings, shareholder disapproval, etc. This is what Buffett called “upsetting the applecart”; when this happens, the target’s stock tends to quickly revert to its pre-buyout price. Buffett described the business, when it was profitable, as “getting the last nickel after the other fellow has made the first 95 cents.” ([Location 1943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1943))
- Being on the wrong side of a busted arb can be expensive. Not only do you fail to make the nickel, but you can also lose a meaningful chunk of the 95 cents. Buffett probably assessed most deals but was highly selective in the ones he participated in. Workouts is a business that doesn’t accommodate very many mistakes. ([Location 1950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1950))
- The allocation served as a useful toggle to Buffett. He told partners in the very first letter to expect BPL to tilt the portfolio ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1969))
- mix toward Generals when the market was falling and tilt toward Workouts when it was rising. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=1970))
- In this category we are not talking about rumors or “inside information” pertaining to such developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait until we can read it in the paper. The risk pertains not primarily to general market behavior (although that is sometimes tied in to a degree), but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the expected development does not materialize. . . . The gross profits in many workouts appear quite small. A friend ([Location 2080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2080))
- refers to this as getting the last nickel after the other fellow has made the first ninety-five cents. However, the predictability coupled with a short holding period produces quite decent annual rates of return. This category produces more steady absolute profits from year to year than generals do. In years of market decline, it piles up a big edge for us; during bull markets, it is a drag on performance. On a long term basis, I expect it to achieve the same sort of margin over the Dow attained by generals. As I have mentioned in the past, the division of our portfolio among the three categories is largely determined ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2084))
- by the accident or availability. Therefore, in a minus year for the Dow, whether we are primarily in generals or workouts is largely a matter of luck, but it will have a great deal to do with our performance relative to the Dow. This is one of many reasons why a single year’s performance is of minor importance and, good or bad, should never be taken too seriously. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2089))
- “We do not want to get active merely for the sake of being active. Everything else being equal, I would much rather let others do the work. However, when an active role is necessary to optimize the employment of capital, you can be sure we will not be standing in the wings.”1 ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2110))

- In his discussions on Controls, Buffett is teaching us to not think about “investing in a stock” but instead to think about “being in a business.” ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2210))

- The dominant factors affecting control valuations are earnings power (past and prospective) and asset values. The nature of our controlled businesses, the quality of the assets involved, and the fact that the Federal Income Tax basis applicable to the net assets substantially exceeds our valuations, cause us to place considerably more weight on the asset factor than is typical in most business valuations. . . . The Partnership Agreement charges me with the responsibility for establishing fair value for controlling interests, and this means fair to both adding and withdrawing partners at a specific point in time. Wide changes in the market valuations ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2268))
- accorded stocks at some point obviously find reflection in the valuation of businesses, although this factor is of much less importance when asset factors (particularly when current assets are significant) overshadow earnings power considerations in the valuation process. ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2273))
- These were not good businesses, didn’t earn adequate or better returns on the assets they employed, and were not readily valued on current earnings. If they were, a reasonable study of the past and prospective earnings of the business would play a more dominant role. ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2278))
- The initial question is always the same: Are you capable of estimating what these assets are worth? Or, as Buffett would put it, are you within your circle of competence? If the answer is no, forget it and move on to valuing something else. There is nothing wrong with that; in ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2310))
- fact, you should take pride in knowing what you are and are not capable of valuing. This self-knowledge is what distinguishes the great investors and avoiding mistakes is just as important as doing a good job picking winners. Buffett puts the majority of potential investments into the “too hard to value” pile and simply moves on. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2312))
- Just because the assets were purchased at $1,000 doesn’t mean that’s what they’re worth now. Circumstances may have changed. All the balance sheet shows is what has happened in the past. When you do your valuation work, the assets (tickets in our example) are always worth what they can be sold for and the liabilities are always assumed to be due in full. That’s the difference between accounting value and economic, or true intrinsic value. In some cases, particularly when the business is of a poor quality, assets will be worth less than their carrying value. ([Location 2318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2318))
- In an optimally run business, the value of control to a financial buyer is zero. The right to force change is valuable only when something needs fixing. All three Controls offered significant opportunities for improvement. ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2347))

- objectives discussed in the October 9th letter. When I am dealing with people I like, in businesses I find stimulating (what business isn’t?), and achieving worthwhile overall returns on capital employed (say, 10–12%), it seems foolish to rush from situation to situation to earn a few more percentage points. It also does not seem sensible to me to trade known pleasant personal relationships with high grade people, at a decent rate of return, for possible irritation, aggravation or worse at potentially higher returns.12 ([Location 2385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2385))

- There is an added twist to Dempster that distinguished Buffett from the vast majority of his contemporaries and demonstrates the flexibility of his thought process: He understood his job as a business owner and his job as an investor to be one and the same. Most people think of themselves in one role or the other; it clicked with Buffett early that the roles are one and the same in that both are capital allocators.

- Too often, managers of poor-return businesses feel they have no other choice but to reinvest profits back into their business. Then they judge their success relative to industry peers. This can often lead the “healthiest person in hospice” syndrome, where good money is reinvested at low incremental rates of return and serves only to perpetuate a continuation of poor returns. Buffett was wired differently, and he achieves better results in part because he invests using an absolute scale. With Dempster he wasn’t at all bogged down with all the emotional baggage of being a veteran of the windmill business.

- One sidelight for the fundamentalists in our group: B.P.L. owns 71.7% of Dempster acquired at a cost of $1,262,577.27. On June 30, 1963 Dempster had a small safe deposit box at the Omaha National Bank containing securities worth $2,028,415.25. Our 71.7% share of $2,028,415.25 amounts to $1,454,373.70. Thus, everything above ground (and part of it underground) is profit.

Accordingly, on June 30, we owned $1,772,000 of marketable securities with a market value on that date of $2,028,000.

It appears to be impossible to make any prorate distribution without such a distribution being taxable as an ordinary dividend. Our legal advisors have recommended that the most effective way to placing this capital in the hands of Dempster stockholders would be through sale of the operating assets of the Company as a going concern, to be followed by the liquidation of the corporation. This does not mean a liquidation of the operating business, for it will have been previously sold as a going concern.

There is an old saying on Wall Street, “What is a good idea in the beginning is often a bad idea in the end.” Buffett claimed no comfort when large numbers of people agreed with him; he didn’t care what those in positions of influence and authority thought. He recognized that conventionally, something met the test of conservatism when a lot of people were in agreement, including the “experts.” He makes a strong point to distinguish his view of what makes ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=2889))

That way, even if he turned out to be wrong on a couple, results would still be incredible.

- Given two otherwise identical investment options, it’s axiomatic that the better return will come from the one taxed at the lower rate. Perhaps less obvious but equally true is that when the tax rate is equal, the better return will come from the one taxed later. While a tax liability is born the moment an investment goes to profit, it doesn’t get paid until the investment is sold. Deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) from unrealized capital gains are best thought of as highly attractive, interest-free loans from the government, with terms so favorable no bank would ever make them. They charge no interest and have no specific due date. DTLs provide a form of debt that allows you to control more assets than you otherwise would.

Assuming the normal 35% capital gains rate applies, an unpaid tax bill of $17,500 (35% of the $50,000 gain) will come due when the stocks are sold. You have to train yourself to think of your holdings in terms of your net worth, or what you would have left if you sold everything tomorrow and paid the tax, which in this example is $82,500.

It is extremely improbable that 20 stocks selected from, say, 3,000 choices are going to prove to be the optimum portfolio both now and a year from now at the entirely different prices (both for the selections and the alternatives) prevailing at that later date. If our objective is to produce the maximum after-tax compound rate, we simply have to own the most attractive securities obtainable at current prices.

There are only three ways to avoid ultimately paying the tax: (1) die with the asset—and that’s a little too ultimate for me—even the zealots would have to view this “cure” with mixed emotions; (2) give the asset away—you certainly don’t pay any taxes this way, but of course you don’t pay for any groceries, rent, etc., either; and (3) lose back the gain—if your mouth waters at ([Location 3278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3278))

The size of your funds, and probably more germane, the size of the funds of an outside manager, can also play a role. The question of size is not nearly as straightforward as you might think—and it’s our next topic. CHAPTER 12 SIZE VERSUS PERFORMANCE “Our idea inventory has always seemed to be 10% ahead of our bank account. If that should change, you can count on hearing from me.”1 —JANUARY 18, 1964 ([Location 3313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3313))
- However, once BPL’s assets grew beyond what his investment ideas could absorb, Buffett stopped accepting new partners. Tracking the progression of his commentary on the issue reveals just how closely intertwined size and the market cycle really are when it comes to expected performance. The interesting question is, at what point does the incremental addition of capital flip from a positive to a negative? In general, that point will always be the moment capital outgrows ideas. In practice, the answer depends largely on where you are in the market cycle. It’s not a static number—it’s market dependent. In bear markets, even the largest fund managers can put huge amounts of capital to work easily; at speculative peaks, usually only the smallest will be able to find really high-return ideas. If BPL’s funds had remained below a few million dollars, Buffett would probably have remained fully invested even as the market headed toward its speculative peak. This mindset may well have prompted Buffett’s comment during the tech bubble’s peak when he said, If I was running $1 million, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950’s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts back then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.2 ([Location 3324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3324))

My present opinion is that there is no reason to think these should not be offsetting factors; if my opinion should change, you will be told.

As he explained, “As circumstances presently appear, I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to help them. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results.”5 This last sentence tells us a lot about Buffett as both an investor and a human being.

As the market continued to stay hot and funds grew even larger, Buffett took the next step of incremental caution by lowering BPL’s official expected rate of return in October 1967. Still, now with roughly $65 million in capital, he made it clear that size was not the primary problem, it was the market; he thought that even if he were operating with one-tenth the capital, his performance would only be expected to be “a… ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3369))

- However, in the case of control situations increased funds are a definite advantage. A “Sanborn Map” cannot be accomplished without the wherewithal.

- your results. Therefore, unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the Partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. The only way to make this effective is to apply it across-the-board and I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up to her to find some other partnership for them. Because I anticipate that withdrawals (for taxes, among other reasons) may well approach additions by present partners and also because I visualize the curve of expectable performance sloping only very mildly as capital increases, I presently see no reason why we should restrict capital additions by existing partners.

- John Brooks’s account of the period, The Go-Go Years, summed up the unscrupulous way they came into being: “In the sixties, as Wall Street moved rapidly through the revolution that made it the first genuinely public securities market in the world’s history, the crucial new element in stock trading was the financial and accounting naiveté of the millions of new investors.”7 Brooks was talking in part about a new phenomenon that had emerged largely in this decade, the price/earnings (PE) ratio, which was calculated by dividing the price of a company’s shares by its earnings. The 1961 annual report of Sanborn Map and Berkshire Hathaway, for instance, didn’t even report earnings on a per share basis. PE’s principal drawback as an investing tool is that all the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach are implicit as opposed to explicit, meaning the assumed ([Location 3530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3530))
- growth in cash flow and the investment required to fund that growth are not clearly distinguished. Two companies could easily both trade at 10 times PE and produce vastly different results. PE is not a bad measure, per se, it’s just a really blunt tool. I think of it like using a Magic Marker to take notes—why would you do that when you can use a pen? In any event, PE had just come into vogue and the conglomerates soon figured out that they could use it to fool the market for some time. They discovered that they could acquire companies with low PE ratios and their stock would go up because it held its higher PE ratio—the additional earnings were being capitalized at a higher rate. Now, you would think that when, for example, two companies of equal size merge and one ([Location 3538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=3538))

- The next point of difficulty is the intensified interest in investment performance. For years I have preached the importance of measurement. Consistently I have told partners that unless our performance was better than average, the money should go elsewhere. In recent years this idea has gained momentum throughout the investment (or more importantly, the investing) community. In the last year or two it has started to look a bit like a tidal wave.

- determining whether we were “performing.” Naturally, as the investment public has taken the bit in its teeth, the time span of expectations has been consistently reduced to the point where investment performance by large aggregates of money is being measured yearly, quarterly, monthly, and perhaps sometimes even more frequently (leading to what is known as “instant research”). The payoff for superior short term performance has become enormous, not only in compensation for results actually achieved, but in the attraction of new money for the next round. Thus a self-generating type of activity has set in which leads to larger and larger amounts of money participating on a shorter and shorter time span.

- We’ve all heard the adage that history doesn’t repeat but rather it rhymes. The stock market is the same. It goes through cycles. Great investors understand the market’s history so they can see the commonality of the cycles and learn what to avoid.

- The end of the Partnership was just the end of the beginning for Buffett. In 1970 he took on the title of Berkshire’s chairman and CEO. By transitioning from a partnership to a corporation, he was evolving to a higher form. In it, he had gained a controlling interest in an entity with permanent capital and the ability to move that capital tax-free from one operating company to another. The Partnership mentality, however, hasn’t changed a bit. If anything, it’s gotten stronger. ([Location 4519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013CC91JS&location=4519))

With deeper insights and different circumstances (more money, fewer potential investments), the old ideas don’t get replaced; they just get less useful to him. Meaning, of course, they can still be useful to us. Buffett leaves us a road map that is invaluable for students and investors alike. It’s as if he’s laid down a challenge to all of us. It’s as if he has written the letters, made them public, and said, “Here’s how to invest, here’s how I did it; this is the road I took.
