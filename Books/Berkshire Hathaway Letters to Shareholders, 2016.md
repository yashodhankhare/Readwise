## Highlights
- The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=119))

- You will note that while dividends exceeded net earnings during this six-year period, the major reason for the 22% decrease in net worth has been the repurchase by the Company of its own stock, pursuant to a program whereby the Company’s outstanding shares have been reduced to 1,017,547 shares—a 37% reduction compared with the shares outstanding on October 1, 1960. This decrease in outstanding shares has been appropriate, considering the reduction in scale of the Company’s operations due to closing of unprofitable mills.

- At the end of 1974 the net unrealized loss in the stock section of our portfolio amounted to about $17 million, but we expressed the opinion, nevertheless, that this portfolio overall represented good value at its carrying value of cost. During 1975 a net capital loss of $2,888,000 before tax credits was ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=824))
- When such criteria are maintained, our intention is to hold for a long time; indeed, our largest equity investment is 467,150 shares of Washington Post “B” stock with a cost of $10.6 million, which we expect to hold permanently. With this approach, stock market fluctuations are of little importance to us—except as they may provide buying opportunities—but business performance is of major importance. On this score we have been delighted with progress made by practically all of the companies ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=829))

- appears that 1977 also will be a year of net realized capital gains. We now have a substantial unrealized gain in our stock portfolio as compared to a substantial unrealized loss several years ago. Here again we consider such market fluctuations from year to year relatively unimportant; unrealized appreciation in our equity holdings, which amounted to $45.7 million at yearend, has declined by about $5 million as this is written on March 21st. However, we consider the yearly ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=933))

- Most of our large stock positions are going to be held for many years and the scorecard on our investment decisions will be provided by business results over that period, and not by prices on any given day. Just as it would be foolish to focus unduly on short-term prospects when acquiring an entire company, we think it equally unsound to become mesmerized by prospective near term earnings or recent trends in earnings when purchasing small pieces of a company; i.e., marketable common ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=1069))

- In some cases our indirect interest in earning power is becoming quite substantial.  For example, note our holdings of 953,750 shares of SAFECO Corp. SAFECO probably is the best run large property and casualty insurance company in the United States.  Their underwriting abilities are simply superb, their loss reserving is conservative, and their investment policies make great sense.

Of course, with a minor interest we do not have the right to direct or even influence management policies of SAFECO.  But why should we wish to do this?  The record would indicate that they do a better job of managing their operations than we could do ourselves.  While there… ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=1385))
- all one loses by accepting a passive participation in excellent management.  Because, quite clearly, if one controlled a company run as well as SAFECO, the proper policy also would be to sit back and let management do its job.

We are not at all unhappy when our wholly-owned businesses retain all of their earnings if they can utilize internally those funds at attractive rates.  Why should we feel differently about retention of earnings by companies in which we hold small equity interests, but where the record indicates even better prospects for profitable employment of capital?

- previously have carried such equity securities at the lower of aggregate cost or aggregate market value.  Because we have large unrealized gains in our insurance equity holdings, the result of this new policy is to increase substantially both the 1978 and 1979 yearend net worth, even after the appropriate liability is established for taxes on capital gains that would be payable should equities be sold at such market valuations. As you know, Blue Chip Stamps, our 60% owned subsidiary, is fully ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=1425))

(That should keep you on your toes.) Market values of Blue Chip Stamps’ equity holdings are given in footnote 3 on page 18. 1979 Operating Results We continue to feel that the ratio of operating… ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=1429))
- Measuring such results against shareholders’ equity with securities valued at market could significantly distort the operating performance percentage because of wide year-to-year market value changes in the net worth figure that serves as the denominator.  For example, a large decline in securities values could result in a very low “market value” net worth that, in turn, could cause mediocre operating earnings to… ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=1435))

- High rates of inflation create a tax on capital that makes much corporate investment unwise—at least if measured by the criterion of a positive real investment return to owners.  This “hurdle rate” the return on equity that must be achieved by a corporation in order to produce any real return for its individual owners—has increased dramatically in recent years.  The average tax-paying investor is now running up a down escalator whose pace has accelerated to the point where his upward progress is nil. For example, in a world of 12% inflation a business earning 20% on equity (which very few manage consistently to do) and distributing it all to individuals in the 50% bracket is chewing up their real capital, not enhancing it. (Half of the 20% will go for income tax; the remaining 10% leaves the owners of the business with only 98% of the purchasing power they possessed at the start of the year—even though they have not spent a penny of their “earnings”).  The investors in this bracket would actually be better off with a combination of stable prices and corporate earnings on equity capital of only a few per cent. Explicit income taxes alone, unaccompanied by any implicit inflation tax, never can turn a positive corporate return into a negative owner return. (Even if there were 90% personal income tax rates on both dividends and capital gains, some real income would be left for the owner at a zero inflation rate.) But the inflation tax is not limited by reported income.  Inflation rates not far from those recently experienced can turn the level of positive returns achieved by a majority of corporations into negative returns for all owners, including those not required to pay explicit taxes. (For example, if inflation reached 16%, owners of the 60% plus of corporate America earning less than this rate of return would be realizing a negative real return—even if income taxes on dividends and capital gains were eliminated.) Of course, the two forms of taxation co-exist and interact since explicit taxes are levied on nominal, not real, income.  Thus you pay income taxes on what would be deficits if returns to stockholders were measured in constant dollars. At present inflation rates, we believe individual owners in medium or high tax brackets (as distinguished from tax-free entities such as pension funds, eleemosynary institutions, etc.) should expect no real long-term return from the average American corporation, even though these individuals reinvest the entire after-tax proceeds from all dividends they receive.  The average return on equity of corporations is fully offset by the combination of the implicit tax on capital levied by inflation and the explicit taxes levied both on dividends and gains in value produced by retained earnings. As we said last year, Berkshire has no corporate solution to the problem. (We’ll say it again next year, too.) Inflation does not improve our return on equity.

- Equity Value-Added An additional factor should further subdue any residual enthusiasm you may retain regarding our long-term rate of return.  The economic case justifying equity investment is that, in aggregate, additional earnings above passive investment returns—interest on fixed-income securities—will be derived through the employment of managerial and entrepreneurial skills in conjunction with that equity capital.  Furthermore, the case says that since the equity capital position is associated with greater risk than passive forms of investment, it is “entitled” to higher returns.  A “value-added” bonus from equity capital seems natural and certain. But is it? Several decades back, a return on equity of as little as 10% enabled a corporation to be classified as a “good” business—i.e., one in which a dollar reinvested in the business logically could be expected to be valued by the market at more than one hundred cents.  For, with long-term taxable bonds yielding 5% and long-term tax-exempt bonds 3%, a business operation that could utilize equity capital at 10% clearly was worth some premium to investors over the equity capital employed.  That was true even though a combination of taxes on dividends and on capital gains would reduce the 10% earned by the corporation to perhaps 6%-8% in the hands of the individual investor. Investment markets recognized this truth.  During that earlier period, American business earned an average of 11% or so on equity capital employed and stocks, in aggregate, sold at valuations far above that equity capital (book value), averaging over 150 cents on the dollar.  Most businesses were “good” businesses because they earned far more than their keep (the return on long-term passive money).  The value-added produced by equity investment,… ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=2365))

- 14%—the 7% tax-exempt equivalent to the higher-bracket individual investor is just as frozen as is the coupon on a tax-exempt bond.  Such a perpetual 7% tax-exempt bond might be worth fifty cents on the dollar as this is written. If, on the other hand, all earnings of our typical American business are retained and return on equity again remains constant, earnings will grow at 14% per year.  If the p/e ratio remains constant, the price of our typical stock will also grow at 14% per year.  But that 14% is not yet in the pocket of the shareholder.  Putting it there will require the payment of a capital gains tax, presently assessed at a maximum rate of 20%.  This net return, of course, works out to a poorer rate of return than the currently available passive after-tax rate. Unless passive rates fall, companies achieving 14% per year gains in earnings per share while paying no cash dividend are an economic failure for their individual shareholders.  The returns from passive capital outstrip the returns from active capital.  This is an unpleasant fact for both investors and corporate managers and, therefore, one they may wish to ignore.  But facts do not cease to exist, either because they are unpleasant or because they are ignored. Most American businesses pay out a significant portion of their earnings and thus fall between the two examples. And most American businesses are currently “bad” businesses economically—producing less for their individual investors after-tax than the tax-exempt passive rate of return on money.  Of course, some high-return businesses still remain attractive, even under present conditions.  But American equity capital, in aggregate, produces no value-added for individual investors. It should be stressed that this depressing situation does not occur because corporations are jumping, economically, less high than previously.  In fact, they are jumping somewhat higher: return on equity has improved a few points in the past decade.  But the crossbar of passive return has been elevated much faster.  Unhappily, most companies can do little but hope that the bar will be lowered significantly; there… ([Location 2391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=2391))

- A further, particularly ironic, punishment is inflicted by an inflationary environment upon the owners of the “bad” business.  To continue operating in its present mode, such a low-return business usually must retain much of its earnings—no matter what penalty such a policy produces for shareholders. Reason, of course, would prescribe just the opposite policy.  An individual, stuck with a 5% bond with many years to run before maturity, does not take the coupons from that bond and pay one hundred cents on the dollar for more 5% bonds while similar bonds are available at, say, forty cents on the dollar.  Instead, he takes those coupons from his low-return bond and—if inclined to reinvest—looks for the highest return with safety currently available.  Good money is not thrown after bad. What makes sense for the bondholder makes sense for the shareholder.  Logically, a company with historic and prospective high returns on equity should retain much or all of its earnings so that shareholders can earn premium returns on enhanced capital.  Conversely, low returns on corporate equity would suggest a very high dividend payout so that owners could direct capital toward more attractive areas. (The Scriptures concur.  In the parable of the talents, the two high-earning servants are rewarded with 100% retention of earnings and encouraged to expand their operations.  However, the non-earning third servant is not only chastised—“wicked and slothful”—but also is required to redirect all of his capital to the top performer.  Matthew 25: 14-30) But inflation takes us through the looking glass into the upside-down world of Alice in Wonderland.  When prices continuously rise, the “bad” business must retain every nickel that it can.  Not because it is attractive as a repository for equity capital, but precisely because it is so unattractive, the low-return business must follow a high retention policy.  If it wishes to continue operating in the future as it has in the past—and most entities, including businesses, do—it simply has no choice. For inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.  That tapeworm preemptively consumes its requisite daily diet of investment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism.  Whatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more dollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are continuously required by the business… ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUM1W3E&location=2410))
