- power that are needed in natural settings are usually not analytical at all-the power of intuition, mental simulation, metaphor, and storytelling. The power of intuition enables us to size up a situation quickly. The power of mental simulation lets us imagine how a course of action might be carried out. The power of metaphor lets us draw on our experience by suggesting parallels between the current situation and something else we ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002V1I69S&location=119))

For instance, when fireground commanders are called out to a blaze, they do not know what type of outcome they will be trying to reach: a fire needs to be extinguished, or the fire is so big that the best thing to do is to prevent it from spreading further, or they need to begin with search and… ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002V1I69S&location=137))

The lieutenant leads his hose crew into the building, to the back, to spray water on the fire, but the fire just roars back at them."Odd," he thinks. The water should have more of an impact.

You need to do this all by yourself, using an inexhaustible pile of concrete blocks and a jack, the only machine you are permitted.Figure 5.1Truck levitationOne way to imagine the task is shown in figure 5.2.

- with the initial state. Then you jack up the right rear tire, slip a set of blocks underneath that tire, remove the jack, and use it on the left rear tire. You repeat the process until all the tires have been raised. You build a pile of blocks underneath the center of the truck. Then you (carefully) remove all of the blocks supporting each tire so that you wind up with the target state.This is an action sequence because you are changing from one ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002V1I69S&location=663))

- several years because the process seems so central to decision making and because we keep finding it in expert performance.We found that as early as 1946 Adriaan de Groot had studied the mental simulation of chess masters. Two decision researchers, Kahneman and Tversky (1982), had written a paper on the simulation heuristic, based on laboratory studies. They described how a person might build a simulation to explain how something might ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002V1I69S&location=734))

We dropped about 20 percent of the cases because the description did not clearly show how the mental simulation was being used.

- mental simulations were not very elaborate. Each seemed to rely on just a few factors-rarely more than three. It would be like designing a machine that had only three moving parts. Perhaps the limits of our working memory had to be taken into account.

- pathways that are possible. The programs are not as limited by memory capacity as we are. However, these programs are extremely specialized. They run simulations only in the single area for which they have been programmed. In contrast, you and I carry around a multipurpose mental simulator that adapts to all kinds of different problems and requires virtually no reprogramming time. True, it has a limited memory capacity, but its versatility is astounding. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002V1I69S&location=822))
