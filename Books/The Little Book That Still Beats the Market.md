- Category: #books

## Highlights
- 1. If you really want to “beat the market,” most professionals and academics can’t help you, and 2. That leaves only one real alternative: You must do it yourself. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=122))
- “No, Ben, I don’t sell gum. I spend my time figuring out what businesses are worth, just ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=178))

- Quick Summary 1. You can stick your money under the ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=265))
- mattress. (But that plan kind of stinks.) 2. You can put your money in the bank or buy bonds from the U.S. government. You will be guaranteed an interest rate and your money back with no risk.1 ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=266))
- 3. You can buy bonds sold by companies or other groups. You will be promised higher interest rates than you could get by putting your money in the bank or by buying government bonds—but you could lose some or all of your ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=269))
- money, so you better get paid enough for taking the risk. 4. You can do something else with your money. (We’ll talk about what in the next chapter.) And I almost forgot, 5. Hot air rises. Hey, I did learn ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=270))
- something from that balloon after all. Thanks, Johnson Smith. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=274))
- However, whenever the long-term government bond is paying less than 6 percent, we will still assume the rate is 6 percent. In other words, our other investment alternatives will, at a minimum, still have to beat 6 percent, no ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=276))
- matter how low long-term U.S. government bond interest rates go. The big picture is that we want to make sure we earn a lot more from our other investments than we could earn without taking any risk. Obviously, if long-term U.S. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=278))
- government bond rates rose to 7 percent or higher, we would use 7 percent or that higher number. Now that’s really it. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=279))
- So, here’s what you ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=374))
- need to know: 1. Buying a share in a business means you are purchasing a portion (or percentage interest) of that business. You are then entitled to a portion of that business’s future earnings. 2. Figuring out ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=374))
- what a business is worth involves estimating (okay, guessing) how much the business will earn in the future. 3. The earnings from your share of the profits must give you more money than you would receive by ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=376))
- placing that same amount of money in a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. (Remember: Last chapter we set 6 percent as your absolute minimum annual return when government bond rates fall below 6 percent.) ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=378))
- 4. No, I haven’t forgotten about the magic formula. But you’re going to have to stop bugging me about it, okay? Sheesh! ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=380))
- So why do share prices move around so much every year when it seems clear that the values of the underlying businesses do not? Well, here’s how I explain it to my students : Who knows and who cares? ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=431))

- In any case, ready or not, here comes the summary: 1. Stock prices move around wildly ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=487))
- 2. It is a good idea to buy shares of a company at a big discount to your estimated value of those shares. Buying shares at a large discount to value will provide you with a large margin of safety and lead to safe and consistently ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=490))
- profitable investments. 3. From what we’ve learned so far, you wouldn’t know a bargain-priced stock if it hit you in the head. 4. Being a few cards short of a full deck, you might as well keep reading. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=492))
- That 10 percent return, calculated by dividing the earnings per share for the year by the share price, is known as ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=523))
- the earnings yield. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=524))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- boil down to this: It’s hard to predict the future. If we can’t predict the future earnings of a business, then it’s hard to place a value on that business. If we can’t value a business, then even if Mr. Market goes crazy sometimes and offers us unbelievable bargain prices, we won’t recognize them. But rather than focusing on all the things that we don’t know, let’s go over a couple of the things that we do know. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=534))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- You would rather own a business that earns a high return on capital than one that earns a low return on capital ! ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=571))
    - Tags: [[market-structure]] 
- if you just stick to buying good companies (ones that have a high return on capital) and to buying those companies only at bargain prices (at prices that give you a high earnings yield), you can end up systematically buying many of the good companies that crazy Mr. Market has decided to literally give away. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=576))
- But first, as always, here comes the summary: 1. Paying a bargain price when you purchase a share in a business is a good thing. One way to do this is to purchase a ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=584))
- business that earns more relative to the price you are paying rather than less. In other words, a higher earnings yield is better than a lower one. 2. Buying a share of a good business is better than buying a share of a bad ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=586))
- business. One way to do this is to purchase a business that can invest its own money at high rates of return rather than purchasing a business that can only invest at lower ones. In other words, businesses that earn a high return on ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=588))
- capital are better than businesses that earn a low return on capital. 3. Combining points 1 and 2, buying good businesses at bargain prices is the secret to making lots of money. And most important, 4. Don’t give ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=590))
- money to guys named Jimbo. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=593))
- In fact, unless Jimbo expects those Just Broccoli stores to earn a lot more in the coming years (a presumption that would obviously involve making predictions ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=594))
- about the future), it seems pretty clear that Jimbo’s business is so bad he shouldn’t even be building Just Broccoli stores. If he has a choice of building a new store for $400,000 that will earn him just 2.5 percent each year on his investment or ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=595))
- buying a U.S. government bond that will earn him 6 percent on his investment—risk free—what’s the point of even building a store in the first place? By opening Just Broccoli stores, Jimbo is actually throwing money away! (Even ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=597))
- though it looks like he is earning 2.5 percent on his investment in a new store, in reality he is throwing away the added 3.5 percent he could earn by simply buying a risk-free U.S. government bond!) ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=598))
- Graham’s formula involved purchasing companies whose stock prices were so low that the purchase price was actually lower than the proceeds that would be received from simply shutting down the business and selling off the company’s assets in a fire sale (he called these stocks by various names: bargain issues, net-current-asset stocks, or stocks selling below their net liquidation value). ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=610))
- The formula starts with a list of the largest 3,500 companies available for trading on one of the major U.S. stock exchanges.5 It then assigns a rank to those companies, from 1 to 3,500, based on their return on capital. The company whose business had the highest return on capital would be assigned a rank of 1, and the company with the lowest return on capital (probably a company actually losing money) would receive a rank of 3,500. Similarly, the company that had the 232nd best return on capital would be assigned a rank of 232. Next, the formula follows the same procedure, but this time, the ranking is done using earnings yield. The company with the highest earnings yield is assigned a rank of 1, and the company with the lowest earnings yield receives a rank of 3,500. Likewise, the company with the 153rd highest earnings yield out of our list of 3,500 companies would be assigned a rank of 153. Finally, the formula just combines the rankings. The formula isn’t looking for the company that ranks best on return on capital or the one with the highest earnings yield. Rather, the formula looks for the companies that have the best combination of those two factors. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=655))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If you’re not a numbers person, don’t worry. Just keep in mind that the companies that receive the best combined rankings are the ones that have the best combination of both factors. In this system, the company that had the 232nd best return on capital could outrank the company that ranked 1st in return on capital. Why? Because we could purchase the company that had the 232nd best return on capital (an excellent ranking out of 3,500) for a price low enough to give us a very high earnings yield (153rd cheapest out of 3,500 based on earnings yield). Getting excellent rankings in both categories (though not the top-ranked in either) would be better under this ranking system than being the top-ranked in one category with only a pretty good ranking in the other. Pretty simple, right? But it can’t be this easy! Can a portfolio of 30 or so of the highest-ranked stocks really get such great investment results? Well, consider this. Take a look at the returns that would have been achieved over this 17-year period if we had simply followed the recommendations of the magic formula (see Table 6.1). Oops! This can’t be. The results are just too good! Surely, something must be wrong here. We’ll really have to examine these results very closely. But let’s say we leave that for the next chapter. For now, we can review the short summary and spend some more time enjoying the results from using the magic formula. They appear to be quite satisfactory.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- in the real world may be quite difficult. For instance, the magic formula may be picking companies that are so small that few people can really buy them. Often, small companies have very few shares available for purchase, and even a small amount of demand for those shares can push share prices higher. If that’s the case, the formula may look great on paper, but in the real world, the fantastic results can’t be replicated. That’s why it’s important that the companies chosen by the magic formula be pretty large. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=699))

- formula doesn’t work at all! Isn’t that great? In fact, on average, in five months out of each year, the magic formula portfolio does worse than the overall market. But forget months. Often, the magic formula doesn’t work for a full year or even more. That’s even better! Imagine buying a book that tells you to invest real money in a group of stocks whose names were spit out by a computer. Imagine diligently watching those stocks each day as they do worse than the market averages over the course of many months or even years. Now imagine deciding enough is enough. No more trusting that stupid book or that mindless computer. You’re going to roll up your sleeves and investigate the companies you purchased and the outlook for the businesses you actually own. As we’ll find out later, imagine the ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=797))

For full-year periods, the magic formula failed to beat the market averages once every four years.10 For one out of every six periods tested, the magic formula did poorly for more than two years in a row. During those wonderful 17 years for the magic formula, there were even some periods when the formula did worse than the overall market for three years in a row! Think it’s easy to stick with a formula that hasn’t worked for several years?

- investment book. For his book, the author tested dozens of stock-picking formulas over a period of many decades to determine which of those strategies had beaten the market over the long run. The book was excellent and well-reasoned. The author then opened a mutual fund based on buying only those stocks picked by the most successful formula of the dozens he had tested. The fund then proceeded to perform worse than the major market averages for two of its first three years. For one of those years, the fund underperformed the market average by 25 percent! After three years, the fund was performing… ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=816))

Had he known that that same fund, the one managed strictly according to his formula, would come back over the next three years to be one of the top-performing mutual funds since the time of its inception (even including the tough first few years), perhaps he would have stuck with it longer! But that’s not unusual. The unpredictability of Mr. Market’s moods and the pressures of competing with other money managers can make it really hard to stick with a strategy that hasn’t worked for years.… ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=822))

Business wasn’t too good for the first three or four years, as the same strategy that had been so successful in the past drastically underperformed the returns of competing… ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=828))

The vast majority of them ran for the exits, pulling their money away in large numbers, most likely to give it to a manager who, unlike my friend, “knew what he was doing.” As you guessed, they should have stuck around. The last five or six years have been so good for my friend and his strategy that now the investment record of his firm since its inception (once again, including those tough first few years) has trounced the returns of the major market averages over the comparable time frame.

Only four original clients remain.11 So what’s the point? The point is that if the magic formula worked all the time, everyone would probably use it. If everyone used it, it would probably stop working. So many people would be buying the shares of the bargain-priced stocks selected by the magic formula that the prices of those shares would be pushed higher almost immediately. In other words, if everyone used the formula,… ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=839))

If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won’t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy—usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it. After a few years… ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=846))

As a professional manager, if you do poorly while everyone else is doing well, you run the risk of losing all your clients and possibly your job! Many managers feel the only way to avoid that risk is to invest pretty much the way everyone else does. Often this means owning the most popular companies, usually the ones whose prospects look most promising over the next few quarters or the next year or two. Perhaps now you’re beginning to see why most everyone else won’t be using the magic formula.

At least, that’s where the statistics over this 17-year period seem to point.

Over shorter periods, it may work or it may not. When it comes to the magic formula, “shorter” periods can often mean years, not days or months. In a strange but logical way, that’s the good news.

- Quick Summary 1. Most people and businesses can’t find investments that will earn very high rates of return. A company that can earn a high return on capital is therefore very special. 2. Companies that earn a high return on capital may also have the opportunity to invest some or all of their profits at a high rate of return. This opportunity is very valuable. It can contribute to a high rate of earnings growth. 3. Companies that achieve a high return on capital are likely to have a special advantage of some kind. That special advantage keeps competitors from destroying the ability to earn above-average profits. 4. By eliminating companies that earn ordinary or poor returns on capital, the magic formula starts with a group of companies that have a high return on capital. It then tries to buy these above-average companies at below-average prices. 5. Since the magic formula makes overwhelming sense, we should be able to stick with it during good times and bad. And finally, 6. If you must vomit under the 3em-spaces, don’t forget to run! ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=971))

- As we already know, the magic formula picks stocks that have both a high earnings yield and a high return on capital. For earnings yield, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to the price we have to pay. For return on capital, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to how much the company has to pay to buy the assets that created those earnings. To calculate these ratios, the magic formula doesn’t look at future earnings. That’s too hard. The magic formula uses last year’s earnings. The funny thing is, that seems like the wrong thing to do. The value of a company comes from how much money it will earn for us in the future, not from what happened in the past. If a company earned $2 per share last year, but will earn only $1 per share this year and even less in the future, using last year’s earnings to calculate earnings yield and return on capital will be very misleading. But that’s precisely what the magic formula does! ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=1106))

- So what should we be doing? Ideally, better than blindly plugging in last year’s earnings to the formula, we should be plugging in estimates for earnings in a normal year.20 Of course, last year’s earnings could be representative of a normal year, but last year may not have been typical for a number of reasons. Earnings could have been higher than normal due to extraordinarily favorable conditions that may not be repeated in most years. Alternatively, there may… ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003VWCQB0&location=1117))
- Plugging in estimates for next year’s earnings to our formula may suffer from the same problem. Next year may not be typical. So one solution might be to look ahead even further to our estimates of what earnings will be three or four years from now in a normal or average environment. Short-term issues that may have affected last year’s earnings or that may affect earnings over the next year or two could then largely be eliminated from our thinking. In this ideal world, we would then be able to take our estimates of normal earnings and calculate earnings yield and return on capital.
