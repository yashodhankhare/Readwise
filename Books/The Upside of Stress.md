## Highlights
- IF YOU HAD to sum up how you feel about stress, which statement would be more accurate?” A) Stress is harmful and should be avoided, reduced, and managed. B) Stress is helpful and should be accepted, utilized, and embraced. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=94))

- I turned stress into the enemy, and I wasn’t alone. I was just one of many psychologists, doctors, and scientists crusading against stress. Like them, I believed that it was a dangerous epidemic that had to be stopped. But I’ve changed my mind about stress, and now I want to change yours. Let me start by telling you about the shocking scientific finding that first made me rethink stress. In 1998, thirty thousand adults in the United States were asked how much stress they had experienced in the past year. They were also asked, Do you believe stress is harmful to your health? Eight years later, the researchers scoured public records to find out who among the thirty thousand participants had died. Let me deliver the bad news first. High levels of stress increased the risk of dying by 43 percent. But—and this is what got my attention—that increased risk applied only to people who also believed that stress was harming their health. People who reported high levels of stress but who did not view their stress as harmful were not more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of death of anyone in the study, even lower than those who reported experiencing very little stress. The researchers concluded that it wasn’t stress alone that was killing people. It was the combination of stress and the belief that stress is harmful. The researchers estimated that over the eight years they conducted their study, 182,000 Americans may have died prematurely because ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=103))

- they believed that stress was harming their health. That number stopped me in my tracks. We’re talking over twenty thousand deaths a year! According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that would make “believing stress is bad for you” the fifteenth-leading cause of death in the United States, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS, and homicide. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=114))

- The finding I had stumbled across—that stress is harmful only when you believe it is—offered me an opportunity to rethink what I was teaching. Even more, it was an invitation to rethink my own relationship to stress. Would I seize it? Or would I file away the paper and continue to crusade against stress?

- TWO THINGS in my training as a health psychologist made me open to the idea that how you think about stress matters—and to the possibility that telling people “Stress will kill you!” could have unintended consequences. First, I was already aware that some beliefs can influence longevity. For example, people with a positive attitude about aging live longer than those who hold negative stereotypes about getting older. One classic study by researchers at Yale University followed middle-aged adults for twenty years. Those who had a positive view of aging in midlife lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those who had a negative view. To put that number in perspective, consider this: Many things we regard as obvious and important protective factors, such as exercising regularly, not smoking, and maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, have been shown, on average, to add less than four years to one’s life span. Another example of a belief with long-reaching impact has to do with trust. Those who believe that most people can be trusted tend to live longer. In a fifteen-year study by Duke University researchers, 60 percent of adults over the age of fifty-five who viewed others as trustworthy were still alive at the end of the study. In contrast, 60 percent of those with a more cynical view on human nature had died. Findings like these had already convinced me that when it comes to health and longevity, some beliefs matter. But what I didn’t know yet was whether how you think about stress was one of them. The second thing that made me willing to admit I might be wrong about stress was what I know about the history of health promotion. If telling people that stress is killing them is a bad strategy for public health, it wouldn’t be the first time a popular health promotion strategy backfired. Some of the most commonly used strategies to encourage healthy behavior have been found to do exactly the opposite of what health professionals hope. For example, when I speak with physicians, I sometimes ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=132))

- ask them to predict the effects of showing smokers graphic warnings on cigarette packs. In general, they believe that the images will decrease smokers’ desire for a cigarette and motivate them to quit. But studies show that the warnings often have the reverse effect. The most threatening images (say, a lung cancer patient dying in a hospital bed) actually increase smokers’ positive attitudes toward smoking. The reason? The images trigger fear, and what better way to calm down than to smoke a cigarette? The doctors assumed that the fear would inspire behavior change, but instead it just motivates a desire to escape feeling bad. Another strategy that consistently backfires is shaming people for their unhealthy behaviors. In one study at the University of California, Santa Barbara, overweight women read a New York Times article about how employers are beginning to discriminate against overweight workers. Afterward, instead of vowing to lose weight, the women ate twice as many calories of junk food as overweight women who had read an article on a different workplace issue. Fear, stigma, self-criticism, shame—all of these are believed, by many health professionals, to be powerfully motivating messages that help people improve their well-being. And yet, when put to the scientific test,… ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=147))

- After I first discovered the study linking beliefs about stress to mortality, I started to pay more attention to how people reacted when I talked about the harmful effects of stress. I noticed that my message was met with the same kind of overwhelming feeling I would expect from medical warnings intended to frighten or shame. When I told exhausted undergraduate students about the negative consequences of stress right before final exam period, the students left the lecture hall more depressed. When I shared scary statistics about stress with caregivers, sometimes there were tears. No matter the audience, nobody ever came up afterward to say, “Thank you so much for telling me how toxic my stressful life is. I know I can get rid of the stress, but I’d just never thought to do it before!” I realized that as much as I believed talking about stress was important, how I was doing it might not be helping. Everything I had been taught about stress… ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=159))

- The latest science reveals that stress can make you smarter, stronger, and more successful. It helps you learn and grow. It can even inspire courage and compassion. The new science also shows that changing your mind about stress can make you healthier and happier. How you think about stress affects everything from your cardiovascular health to your ability to find meaning in life. The best way to manage stress isn’t to reduce or avoid it, but rather to rethink and even embrace it. So, my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to help you get rid of your stress—I want to make you better at stress. That is the promise of the new science of stress, and the purpose of this book.

- But most important, this is a practical guide to getting better at living with stress. Embracing stress can make you feel more empowered in the face of challenges. It can enable you to better use the energy of stress without burning out. It can help you turn stressful experiences into a source of social connection rather than isolation. And finally, it can lead you to new ways of finding meaning in suffering. Throughout this book, you’ll find two types of practical exercises to try: ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=191))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The Rethink Stress exercises in Part 1 are designed to shift your way of thinking about stress. You can use them as writing prompts or as any other forms of self-reflection that work for you. You might think about the topic while you’re on the treadmill at the gym or riding the bus to work. You can make it a private reflection or use it to start a conversation. Talk about it with your spouse over dinner or bring it up at your parents’ group at church. Write a Facebook post about it and ask your friends for their thoughts. Along with helping you think differently about stress in general, these exercises also encourage you to reflect on the role that stress plays in your life, including in relation to your most important goals and values. The Transform Stress exercises in Part 2 include on-the-spot strategies to use in moments of stress, as well as self-reflections that will help you cope with specific challenges in your life. They will help you tap into your reserves of energy, strength, and hope when you’re feeling anxious, frustrated, angry, or overwhelmed. Transform Stress exercises rely on what I call “mindset resets”—shifts in how you think about the stress you are experiencing in the moment. These mindset resets can alter your physical stress response, change your attitude, and motivate action. In other words, they transform the effect that stress is having on you in the very moment you are feeling stressed. These exercises are based on scientific studies, and I encourage you to treat them like experiments yourself. Try them out and see what works for you.

- So far, I’ve avoided defining stress—in part because the word has become a catchall term for anything we don’t want to experience and everything that’s wrong with the world. People use the word stress to describe both a traffic delay and a death in the family. We say we’re stressed when we feel anxious, busy, frustrated, threatened, or under pressure. On any given day, you might find yourself getting stressed out by email, politics, the news, the weather, or your growing to-do list. And the biggest source of stress in your life right now could be work, parenting, dealing with a health crisis, getting out of debt, or going through a divorce. Sometimes we use the word stress to describe what’s going on inside us—our thoughts, emotions, and physical responses—and sometimes we use it describe the problems ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=223))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- we face. Stress is commonly used to describe trivial irritations, but it’s just as likely to be shorthand for more serious psychological challenges such as depression and anxiety. There is no single definition of stress that can encompass all these things, and yet we use that word to refer to all of them. The fact that we use the word stress to describe so much of life is both a blessing and a curse. The downside is that it can make talking about the science of stress tricky. Even scientists—who usually nail down their definitions—use stress to describe a mind-boggling array of experiences and outcomes. One study might define it as feeling overwhelmed by caregiving demands, while another looks at it in terms of workplace burnout. One study uses stress to describe daily hassles, while another uses it to talk about the long-term effects of trauma. Worse yet, when this science gets communicated in the media, the headlines often use the familiar word stress but fail to provide details about what a study actually measured, leaving you to guess at whether the findings apply to your own life. At the same time, there is a benefit to the catchall nature of the word. Because we use stress to describe so many aspects of life, how you think about it has a profound effect on how you experience life. Changing your thoughts about stress can have a similarly profound effect, transforming both everyday aggravations and how you relate to the biggest life challenges. So, rather than try to offer a narrow and manageable definition of stress, I’m willing to keep the meaning broad. Yes, it would be easier to say, “This book ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=228))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- is about thriving under pressure at work” or “This book will help you manage the physical symptoms of anxiety.” But the transformative power of choosing to see the upside of stress comes from its ability to change how you think about, and relate to, so many different aspects of life. So as we begin this journey together, I offer this conception of stress: Stress is what arises when something you care about is at stake. This definition is big enough to hold both the frustration over traffic and the grief over a loss. It includes your thoughts, emotions, and physical reactions when you’re feeling stressed, as well as how you choose to cope with situations you’d describe as stressful. This definition also highlights an important truth about stress: Stress and meaning are inextricably linked. You don’t stress out about things you don’t care about, and you can’t create a meaningful life without experiencing some stress. My goal, in writing this book, is to provide science, stories, and strategies that address the full range of what we mean by stress, even knowing that not every example will resonate with you, and that it is impossible to address every aspect of human experience that gets labeled as “stressful.” We’ll look at… ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=240))

- I can’t guarantee that every idea in this book is going to help with every form of stress or suffering. However, I no longer worry that the benefits of embracing stress apply only to the small stuff. To my surprise, embracing stress ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=262))

- has helped me the most in the most difficult situations—dealing with the death of a loved one, coping with chronic pain, and even overcoming a paralyzing fear of flying. That’s also what I’ve heard from my students. The stories they share at the end of the course usually aren’t about getting better at juggling deadlines or dealing with an irritating neighbor. They are about coming to terms with the loss of a spouse. Facing a lifelong struggle with anxiety. Making peace with a past that includes childhood abuse. Losing a job. Getting through cancer treatment. Why would seeing the good in stress help in these circumstances? I believe it is because embracing stress changes how you think about yourself and what you can handle. It is not a purely intellectual exercise. Focusing on the upside of stress transforms how you experience it physically and emotionally. It changes how you cope with the challenges in your life. I wrote this book with that specific purpose in mind: to help you discover your own strength, courage, and compassion. Seeing the upside of stress is not about deciding whether stress is either all good or all bad. It’s about how choosing to see the good in stress can help you meet the challenges in your life.

- Crum beamed. She had just demonstrated the single idea that motivates all her research: How you think about something can transform its effect on you. I was meeting Crum in her basement lab at the Columbia Business School to talk about her research on stress. For a young scientist, Crum has an unusual track record of high-profile findings. Her work gets attention because it shows that our physical reality is more subjective than we believe. By changing how people think about an experience, she can change what’s happening in their bodies. Her findings are so surprising that they make a lot of people scratch their heads and say, “Huh? Is that even possible?” This reaction—Is that even possible?—is a familiar one to researchers who study mindsets. Mindsets are beliefs that shape your reality, including objective physical reactions (like the strength of my arm as Crum pushed on it), and even long-term health, happiness, and success. More important, the new field of mindset science shows that a single brief intervention, designed to change how you think about something, can improve your health, happiness, and success, even years into the future. The field is full of remarkable findings that will make you think twice about your own beliefs. From placebos to self-fulfilling prophecies, perception matters.

- Crum’s provocative hypothesis is that when two outcomes are possible—in this case, the health benefits of exercise or the strain of physical labor—a person’s expectations influence which outcome is more likely. She concluded that the housekeepers’ perception of their work as healthy exercise transformed its effects on their bodies. In other words, the effect you expect is the effect you get.

- Crum wanted to see if changing people’s perceptions of stress could modify this measure of resilience. Could a three-minute video about stress alter this key ratio of stress hormones?

- A belief with this kind of power goes beyond a placebo effect. This is a mindset effect. Unlike a placebo, which tends to have a short-lived impact on a highly specific outcome, the consequences of a mindset snowball over time, increasing in influence and long-term impact. As we’ve seen, a mindset is a belief that biases how you think, feel, and act. It’s like a filter that you see everything through. Not every belief can become a mindset. Some beliefs simply aren’t that important. You might believe that chocolate is better than vanilla, that it’s rude to ask somebody’s age, and that the world is round, not flat. Those beliefs, no matter how strongly you hold them, have relatively ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=387))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The beliefs that become mindsets transcend preferences, learned facts, or intellectual opinions. They are core beliefs that reflect your philosophy of life. A mindset is usually based on a theory about how the world works. For example, that the world is getting less safe, that money will make you happy, that everything happens for a reason, or that people cannot change. All of these beliefs have the potential to shape how you interpret experiences and make decisions. When a mindset gets activated—by a memory, a situation you find yourself in, or a remark someone makes—it sets off a cascade of thoughts, emotions, and goals that shape how you respond to life. This, in turn, can influence long-term outcomes, including health, happiness, and even longevity. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=392))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- It turns out that how you think about stress is also one of those core beliefs that can affect your health, happiness, and success. As we’ll see, your stress mindset shapes everything from the emotions you feel during a stressful situation to the way you cope with stressful events. That, in turn, can determine whether you thrive under stress or end up burned out and depressed. The good news is, even if you are firmly convinced that stress is harmful, you can still cultivate a mindset that helps you thrive.

- In addition to optimism, two other personality traits seem to be associated with a more positive view of stress: mindfulness and the ability to tolerate uncertainty. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=473))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Crum’s research points to a more likely possibility: Stress mindsets are powerful because they affect not just how you think but also how you act. When you view stress as harmful, it is something to be avoided. Feeling stressed becomes a signal to try to escape or reduce the stress. And indeed, people who endorse a stress-is-harmful mindset are more likely to say that they cope with stress by trying to avoid it. For example, they are more likely to: Try to distract themselves from the cause of the stress instead of dealing with it. Focus on getting rid of their feelings of stress instead of taking steps to address its source. Turn to alcohol or other substances or addictions to escape the stress. Withdraw their energy and attention from whatever relationship, role, or goal is causing the stress. In contrast, people who believe that stress can be helpful are more likely to say that they cope with stress proactively. For example, they are more likely to: Accept the fact that the stressful event has occurred and is real. Plan a strategy for dealing with the source of stress. Seek information, help, or advice. Take steps to overcome, remove, or change the source of stress. Try to make the best of the situation by viewing it in a more positive way or by using it as an opportunity to grow. These different ways of dealing with stress lead to very different outcomes. When you face difficulties head-on, instead of trying to avoid or deny them, you build your resources for dealing with stressful experiences. You become more confident in your ability to handle life’s challenges. You create a strong network of social support. Problems that can be managed get taken care of, instead of spiraling out of control. Situations that you can’t control become opportunities to grow. In this way, as with many mindsets, the belief that stress is helpful becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=477))

- Crum has gone on to conduct stress mindset interventions and workshops in a variety of settings, including with health care professionals, college students, executives, and even Navy SEALs. She has also experimented with other methods for changing people’s stress mindsets, some of which we’ll see later in this chapter. What her work shows is that very brief interventions can lead to lasting changes in how people think about and experience stress. Adopting a more positive view of stress reduces what we usually think of as stress-related problems and helps people thrive under high levels of stress. These findings, like the results of Crum’s early research, might leave you scratching your head, wondering how exactly this works. To understand why mindset interventions can have such strong effects—and how you might begin to change your own mind about stress—let’s take a closer look at what science tells us about the art of changing minds. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=523))

- I think this is one of the most promising aspects of mindset science. Once an idea takes root, you don’t have to work so hard at it. It’s not a conscious strategy you need to employ or an inner debate you need to have every day. After an initial introduction to a new mindset, it can take hold and flourish. Walton acknowledges that, to many, these results sound more like science fiction than science. But mindset interventions are not miracles or magic. They are best thought of as catalysts. Changing your mindset puts into motion processes that perpetuate positive change over time. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=581))

- That’s the thing about mindset interventions: They seem too good to be true. They contradict a deeply held cultural belief about the process of change itself. We believe that all meaningful problems are deeply rooted and difficult to change. Many problems are deeply rooted, and yet one of the themes you’ll see again and again in this book is that small shifts in mindset can trigger a cascade of changes so profound that they test the limits of what seems possible. We are used to believing that we need to ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=613))

- change everything about our lives first, and then we will be happy, or healthy, or whatever it is we think we want to experience. The science of mindsets says we have it backward. Changing our minds can be a catalyst for all the other changes we want to make in our lives. But first, we may need to convince ourselves that such change is possible.

- In the stress mindset interventions we’ve looked at so far, people were manipulated into a mindset shift. Nobody said, “Seeing the good in stress is good for you.” The message was much simpler: “Stress is good for you.” Can a mindset shift still work if you try to change your own mind about stress, or do you have to be tricked into it?

- The training started by letting employees know about research on both the harms and the benefits of stress. Then the employees learned about the power of mindset, including the results of Crum’s previous studies. The employees were explicitly told that the aim of the training was to help them choose a more positive stress mindset. To help them cultivate this new mindset, the employees were asked to reflect on their own experiences with stress, including times when stress had been helpful. They were also taught a three-step process for practicing the new mindset whenever they felt stressed. The first step is to acknowledge stress when you experience it. Simply allow yourself to notice the stress, including how it affects your body. The second step is to welcome the stress by recognizing that it’s a response to something you care about. Can you connect to the positive motivation behind the stress? What is at stake here, and why does it matter to you? The third step is to make use of the energy that stress gives you, instead of wasting that energy trying to manage your stress. What can you do right now that reflects your goals and values? The employees were encouraged to remember this three-step process when they experienced stress and to try to practice it at least once a day.

- The first step toward changing your mind about stress is to notice how your current mindset shows up in everyday life. We usually don’t see the effect of a mindset because we are too identified with the beliefs behind it. The mindset doesn’t feel like a choice that we make; it feels like an accurate assessment of how the world works. Even if you are fully aware of what you think about stress, you probably don’t realize how that belief affects your thoughts, emotions, and actions. I call this “mindset blindness.” The solution is to practice mindset mindfulness—by paying attention to how your current stress mindset operates in your life. To get to know your stress mindset, start to notice how you think and talk about stress. Because a mindset is like a filter that colors every experience, you’ll probably discover that you have a standard way of thinking and talking about stress. What do you say out loud or think to yourself? (My own stressed-out mantra, before I started to seriously rethink stress, was “This is too much!”) Notice how thinking about stress in your habitual way makes you feel. Does it motivate you? Inspire you? Exhaust you? Paralyze you? How does it make you feel about yourself or your life? Your stress mindset will also influence how you react to other people’s stress. Notice how you feel and what you say or do when people around you are stressed. When other people complain about stress, does it make you anxious? Do you tell them to calm down or not to stress so much? Do you try to avoid people when they are most frazzled? Or do you use other people’s stress as an invitation to vent about your own problems, as if you were competing to see whose life is more stressful? Whatever you observe yourself doing, try to notice its effects. How does it affect your own well-being or influence your relationships with others? Then, start to look for stress mindsets in the world around you. What are the messages you get on a daily basis about how you’re supposed to think about stress? Once you start looking for stress mindsets, you’ll see them everywhere: in the media, in how other people talk about their lives, even in advertisements that use the promise of stress reduction to sell everything from shampoo to office furniture. As I was working on this chapter, someone sent me an article titled “10 Reasons Why Stress Is the Most Dangerous Toxin in Your Life”—and it turned out to be an advertorial for a holistic remedy. I don’t know if the article boosted sales, but the title alone was a brilliant way to create some extra stress about stress. Notice how it affects you to hear messages like this. Do they motivate self-care, or do they just make you worry about your health? When other people talk about their stress from a certain mindset, how does it make you feel about your own stress? Practicing mindset mindfulness doesn’t require anything other than curiosity.

- The most important takeaway, to me, is that seeing the good in stress doesn’t require abandoning the awareness that, in some cases, stress is harmful. The mindset shift that matters is the one that allows you to hold a more balanced view of stress—to fear it less, to trust yourself to handle it, and to use it as a resource for engaging with life.

- Stress, he claimed, was the response of the body to any demand made on it. It wasn’t just a response to noxious injections, traumatic injuries, or brutal laboratory conditions, but to anything that requires action or adaptation. By defining stress in this way, Selye set the stage for our modern terror about stress. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=781))

- The science of stress is complex, and there is no doubt that some stressful experiences lead to negative outcomes. But we are not Selye’s lab rats. The stress those animals were exposed to is the worst possible kind: unpredictable, uncontrollable, and completely devoid of meaning. As we’ll see, the stress in our own lives rarely fits this description. Even in circumstances of great suffering, human beings have a natural capacity to find hope, exert choice, and make meaning. This is why in our own lives, the most common effects of stress include strength, growth, and resilience. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=847))

- Finally, you have a say in how your body responds to stress. Stress is a biological state designed to help you learn from experience. That means your stress response is extremely receptive to the effects of deliberate practice. Whatever actions you take during stress, you teach your body and brain to do spontaneously. If you want to respond to stress differently—to face challenges confidently, to stand up for yourself, to seek social support instead of withdrawing, to find meaning in your suffering—there is no better way to change your habits than to practice this new response during stress. Every moment of stress is an opportunity to transform ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1053))

Even if it feels like your stress response is pushing you in one direction, focusing on how you want to respond can shift your biology to support you. If there is a side of the stress response you would like to develop, consider what it would look like in any stressful situation you are dealing with now. What would someone who is good at that side of stress think, feel, or do? Is there any way to choose that response to stress right now?

- Rethink Stress: What Brings Meaning to Your Life? Take a few moments to list your most meaningful roles, relationships, activities, or goals. In what parts of your life are you most likely to experience joy, love, laughter, learning, or a sense of purpose? When you have listed a few, ask yourself this: Would you also describe any of them as sometimes or frequently stressful? We often imagine how ideal it would be to get rid of the stress we experience at home, at work, and in pursuit of our goals. But that isn’t a realistic possibility. We don’t get to choose between a stress-full or a stress-free experience of family, work, community, love, learning, or health. If there is something in your life that is both meaningful and causing you a great deal of stress, take a few moments to write about why this role, relationship, activity, or goal is so important to you. You might also consider writing about what life would be like if you suddenly lost this source of meaning. How would you feel about the loss? Would you want it back in your life?

- minutes. Describe why this value is important to you. You could also write about how you express this value in your everyday life, including what you did today. If you are facing a difficult decision, you could write about how this value might guide you. These ten minutes can change how you relate to the stress in your life, even if you don’t write about anything that is currently stressful. You may want to repeat this exercise with the other two important values at another sitting, or revisit this exercise when you are feeling especially overwhelmed by stress. Students sometimes tell me they struggle with choosing a value for this exercise—either they aren’t sure how to identify their own values or they have difficulty narrowing it down to one. Keep in mind that values reflect what you care about. For this exercise, you are simply expressing what feels important and meaningful to you right now. It can be an attitude, a personal strength, a priority, or even a community you care about. It can be what you would like to experience in life or what you would like to share with others. It could be a principle you would like to use to make important life decisions. For this exercise, it doesn’t matter if you are “good” at a value, or if other people will understand why it is important to you. A value can be something that comes naturally to you or something that you would like to develop in yourself. For example, one of my students initially found this exercise uninspiring because she had… ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1259))

- Once a week, a small group of physicians meet for two hours. They begin by practicing a mindfulness technique, such as awareness of breathing and body sensations. Unlike what many people think, mindfulness isn’t about relaxation or escaping the stress of the day. Instead, it is the ability to pay attention to and accept whatever thoughts, sensations, and emotions are happening. If you’re feeling sad, you notice what sadness feels like in your body. You don’t try to push it away and replace it with happy thoughts. One of the effects of the biological stress response is to make you more open to your experience. You feel things more, and your ability to notice expands. You are more sensitive to other people and to your environment. This increased openness is helpful, but can be overwhelming. Many people, when they experience this opening in the presence of other people’s suffering, want to slam it shut.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Although avoiding stress can seem like a rational strategy, it almost always backfires. One of the benefits of embracing stress is that you find the strength to pursue goals and endure experiences that are difficult but meaningful. The mindset exercise below will help you recognize the costs of trying to avoid stress in your life. Take a few minutes to write in response to any of the questions that seem relevant to your experiences. 1. Missed opportunities: What events, experiences, activities, roles, or other opportunities have you turned down or cut out of your life because you thought they were (or would be) too stressful? Has your life been enhanced or narrowed by these choices? What is the cost to you of missing these opportunities? 2. Avoidant coping: What activities, substances, or other “escapes” do you turn to when you want to avoid, get rid of, or numb thoughts and feelings related to the stress in your life? Are these coping strategies a good use of your time, energy, and life? Do they enhance meaning or help you grow? Are any of these coping strategies self-destructive? 3. Limiting your future: Is there anything you would like to do, experience, accept, or change, if only you were not afraid of the stress it might bring into your life? How would your life be enhanced by pursuing any of these possibilities? What is the cost to you of not allowing yourself to pursue them?

- from her time as a graduate student. One night, she was working alone late in the basement of the Psychology Department at Yale, lost in a train of self-doubt, worrying about her research project and whether she would be able to finish it. There was a knock on the door. The department’s IT guy opened the door and looked in. Before Crum could say anything, he commented, “Just another cold, dark night on the side of Everest.” Then he closed the door and walked away. Two weeks later, Crum was lying awake in bed when his comment came back to her. “If you were climbing Everest, you can imagine it would be cold, and there’d be some nights it would be dark, and you’d be tired,” Crum thought. “You’d be pretty miserable. But what did you expect? You’re climbing Everest.” At that time in her life, finishing her dissertation was her Mount Everest. She wasn’t sure she would succeed. But that challenge was important enough to be worth weathering a few cold, dark nights. Everyone has an Everest. Whether it’s a climb you chose, or a circumstance you find yourself in, you’re in the middle of an important journey.

- when you forget the context the stress is unfolding in. “Just another cold, dark night on the side of Everest” is a way to remember the paradox of stress. The most meaningful challenges in your life will come with a few dark nights. The biggest problem with trying to avoid stress is how it changes the way we view our lives, and ourselves. Anything in life that causes stress starts to look like a problem. If you experience stress at work, you think there’s something wrong with your job. If you experience stress in your marriage, you think there’s something wrong with your relationship. If you experience stress as a parent, you think there’s something wrong with your parenting (or your kids). If trying to make a change is stressful, you think there’s something wrong with your goal. When you think life should be less stressful, feeling stressed can also seem like a sign that you are inadequate: If you were strong enough, smart enough, or good enough, then you wouldn’t be stressed. Stress becomes a sign of personal failure rather than evidence that you are human. This kind of thinking explains, in part, why viewing stress as harmful increases the risk of depression. When you’re in this mindset, you’re more likely to feel overwhelmed and hopeless. Choosing to see the connection between stress and meaning can free you from the nagging sense that there is something wrong with your life or that you are inadequate to the challenges you face. Even if not every frustrating moment feels full of purpose, stress and meaning are inextricably connected in the larger context of your life. When you take this view, life doesn’t become less stressful, but it can become more meaningful. Part 1… ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1453))

- A few things stood out about people who thrived under stress. First, they ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1484))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- thought about stress differently. They saw it as a normal aspect of life, and they didn’t believe that it was possible or even desirable to have an entirely comfortable, safe life. Instead, they viewed stress as an opportunity to grow. They were more likely to acknowledge their stress and less likely to view every struggle as a catastrophe headed toward a worst-case scenario. They believed that difficult times require staying engaged with life rather than giving up or isolating oneself. Finally, they also believed that no matter what the circumstances, they must continue making choices—ones that could change the situation or, if that wasn’t possible, that could change how the situation affected them. People who held these attitudes were more likely to take action and to connect with others during stress. They were less likely to turn hostile or self-defensive. They were also more apt to take care of themselves, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They built a reserve of strength that supported them in facing the challenges in their lives. Maddi named this collection of attitudes and coping strategies “hardiness,” which he defined as the courage to grow from stress.

- Maddi’s definition of what it means to be good at stress—the courage to grow from stress—is still my favorite description of resilience. It reminds us that we cannot always control the stress in our lives, but we can choose our relationship to it. It acknowledges that embracing stress is an act of bravery, one that requires choosing meaning over avoiding discomfort. This is what it means to be good at stress. It’s not about being untouched by adversity or unruffled by difficulties. It’s about allowing stress to awaken in you these core human strengths of courage, connection, and growth. Whether you are looking at resilience in overworked executives or war-torn communities, the same themes emerge. People who are good at stress allow themselves to be changed by the experience of stress. They maintain a basic sense of trust in themselves and a connection to something bigger than themselves. They also find ways to make meaning out of suffering. To be good at stress is not to avoid stress, but to play an active role in how stress transforms you.

- Transform Stress: Turn Nerves into Excitement As corny as it sounds, many of my students report that telling themselves that they are excited when they feel anxious really works. One of my students, Mariella, had recently become a yoga instructor—a dream job for her, but also one that triggered a lot of anxiety. She had all the physical signs of stress before every class that she taught. She had always labeled these sensations as “anxiety” and thought that her body’s response was a problem. “I would worry that I was going to freak out and not be able to teach,” she told me. “One time, I canceled a class five minutes before I was supposed to teach because I thought I was going to have a panic attack.” Mariella started to experiment with rethinking the physical signs of anxiety. “I still feel the same sensations, but I say to myself, ‘This is good. This is ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1627))

- my body trying to help me perform.’” Framing the pre-class nerves as excitement helped her channel the energy into her teaching. Rather than trying to manage her symptoms, she was able to turn her focus to her students and began enjoying teaching more. Even though the familiar feelings of anxiety showed up before every class, she no longer needed to cancel class out of fear that she would have a meltdown and be unable to teach. When you’re anxious before a big event—be it a meeting, a speech, a competition, or an exam—remember that there is a fine line between anxiety and excitement. When researchers at the University of New Orleans strapped heart rate monitors onto experienced skydivers and nervous novices, they found that the more seasoned jumpers weren’t calmer than those about to take their first leap. Instead, the experienced skydivers showed even higher heart rates before and during the jump. The more pumped they were to take the dive, the bigger their excite-and-delight response. When you need to take a leap and want to do well, don’t worry about forcing yourself to relax. Instead, embrace the nerves, tell yourself you’re excited, and know that your heart is in it.

- The desire to avoid feeling anxious overtakes other goals. In the worst cases, people organize their lives around avoiding anything that provokes anxiety. And while they hope that this will make them feel safe, it tends to have the opposite effect. Avoiding what makes them anxious only reinforces their fears and increases their worrying about future anxiety. I’ve had my own experience transforming the cycle of anxiety and avoidance. For years, a lifelong fear of flying kept me from getting on a plane. At first, I was willing to fly for important family events a couple of times a year. But then my fear got to be so strong that I would have a panic attack if I even thought about flying. My flight could be months in the future, and I would live with constant dread that whole time about the three hours I’d be airborne. So I made the choice not to fly. I really believed that the fear would go away if I knew I didn’t have to fly. ([Location 1681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1681))

- After a few years, my decision began to feel like a self-imposed prison. I would have dreams about being in cities that I couldn’t get to without flying, and then wake up anguished by the fact that I couldn’t visit them. I worried that something would happen to a family member and I wouldn’t be able to get on a plane. And the worst part? The feeling of being trapped by fear hadn’t gone away. I was still trapped by fear; it had just turned its focus to the consequences of not flying. Eventually I came to realize that I was paying the price of fear whether I flew or not. Avoiding flying had not, as I had hoped, gotten rid of my anxiety. So I made a conscious, terrified decision to choose to be afraid and to fly. I started small, with short flights. I hated every minute of it, but I valued being able to do it. I was able to attend events that I wanted to be at, like professional conferences, and those that I had feared I would miss, including my grandmother’s funeral. Eventually, I came to realize that I preferred the meaning that flying adds to my life, over the illusion that I could prevent anxiety by avoiding the thing I was afraid of. I wish I could say that I now love to fly. The truth is, I still dislike it, but I have gotten much better at it. Most important, I now fly several times a month, for work and to be with family. My first flight after years of refusing to board a plane was a short trip from San Francisco to Phoenix. Since then, I’ve flown throughout North America and to Asia and Europe. Every time I get on a plane, I feel both anxious and grateful to myself. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1688))

- Transform Stress: Turn a Threat into a Challenge Viewing the stress response as a resource can transform the physiology of fear into the biology of courage. It can turn a threat into a challenge and can help you do your best under pressure. Even when the stress doesn’t feel helpful—as in the case of anxiety—welcoming it can transform it into something that is helpful: more energy, more confidence, and a greater willingness to take action. You can apply this strategy in your own life anytime you notice signs of stress. When you feel your heart pounding or your breath quickening, realize that it is your body’s way of trying to give you more energy. If you notice tension in your body, remind yourself that the stress response gives you access to your strength. Sweaty palms? Remember what it felt like to go on your first date—palms sweat when you’re close to something you want. If you have butterflies in your stomach, know that they are a sign of meaning. Your digestive tract is lined with hundreds of millions of nerve cells that respond to your thoughts and emotions. Butterflies are your gut’s way of saying, “This matters.” Let yourself remember why this particular moment matters to you. Whatever the sensations of stress are, worry less about trying to make them go away, and focus more on what you are going to do with the energy, strength, and drive that stress gives you. Your body is providing you access to all your resources to help you rise to this challenge. Instead of taking a deep breath to calm down, take a deep breath to sense the energy that is available to you. Then put the energy to use, and ask yourself, “What action can I take, or what choice can I make, that is consistent with my goal in this moment?” ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1844))

- One of the questions I often get is, “This whole ‘embracing stress’ thing only works if you don’t have real anxiety, right?” Behind this question is a belief: Real anxiety is really, really bad. I really do need to get rid of it. If I embrace it, I’ll fall apart. I need to fight it or it will consume me. Well, there’s something I haven’t mentioned about Jeremy Jamieson’s Social Stress Test study, the one that transformed threat responses into challenge responses. Half his participants had social anxiety disorder. The Social Stress Test was their worst nightmare. Social anxiety disorder is a complex psychological condition, but one way to think of it is as a vicious cycle that traps people in social isolation. The cycle starts with anxiety about social interactions. People with social anxiety believe they are not good in social situations, so they worry about them in advance. They fear that they’ll do something foolish and that others will judge them. They panic over whether they’ll have to make small talk and be unable to escape. They might feel claustrophobic in groups and worry that they’ll get stuck in a crowd. When people with social anxiety disorder are actually in a social situation, they tend to focus on themselves instead of others. Thoughts run through their head: I look stupid. Why did I just say that? Can they tell how nervous I am? They feel awkward. They don’t know what to say. As they grow more anxious, their sweaty palms and racing heart are taken as proof of their social inadequacy: There’s something wrong with me. They start to worry that their anxiety is actually dangerous. Why am I sweating so much? Am I having a heart attack? To cope, they engage in safety behaviors, like not making eye contact, staying in the bathroom too long, looking for a way out, going home early, or getting so drunk that they can’t feel their own feet, let alone the anxiety. The self-focus and avoidance behaviors make it difficult to connect with others. So afterward, they think, “That was awful. I didn’t do well at all. I guess I can’t cope in social situations. Next time, I’ll just skip the whole thing.” It’s a vicious cycle that feeds on itself. Eventually, the anxiety about social performance becomes anxiety about anxiety. It’s a classic anxiety-avoidance cycle. Avoiding social situations becomes a strategy to avoid the anxiety—just like math anxiety can spiral into math avoidance, and my fear of flying kept me grounded and trapped. The social situations that trigger social anxiety aren’t just big events, with crowds and strangers. They can be a work meeting where you are expected to contribute a comment; or going to church, where you’ll have to engage in small talk; or going to the store and having to ask for help. Social anxiety can affect very broad parts of a person’s life. As the vicious cycle of anxiety and avoidance continues to spiral out of control, the world gets smaller and smaller. Keep all this in mind, and then imagine what it would be… ([Location 1885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=1885))

- Embracing stress is a radical act of self-trust: View yourself as capable and your body as a resource. You don’t have to wait until you no longer have fear, stress, or anxiety to do what matters most. Stress doesn’t have to be a sign to stop and give up on yourself. This kind of mindset shift is a catalyst, not a cure. It doesn’t erase your suffering or make your problems disappear. But if you are willing to rethink your stress response, it may help you recognize your strength and access your courage.

- IN THE LATE 1990s, two psychology researchers at UCLA were talking about how the female scientists in their lab responded differently to stress than the men did. The men would disappear into their offices, but the women would bring cookies to lab meetings and bond over coffee. Forget fight-or-flight, they joked. The women were tending and befriending. The joke stuck in the mind of one of the women, postdoctoral researcher Laura Cousino Klein. Psychology research showed that stress leads to aggression, but that wasn’t her experience. And it didn’t fit with what she observed in other women either. They were more likely to want to talk with someone about their stress, spend time with their loved ones, or channel their stress into caring for others. She wondered if it was possible that science had neglected an important aspect of stress. ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=2030))

- Klein decided to dig deeper into the science, and she made the surprising discovery that 90 percent of the published research on stress was conducted on males. This was true of animal studies as well as human studies. When Klein shared this observation with Shelley Taylor, the director of the lab she worked in, something clicked for her, too. Taylor challenged her lab to study the social side of stress, especially in women. Looking at both animal and human research, they found evidence that stress can increase caring, cooperation, and compassion. Under stress, women show an increase in tending—caring for others, be it their children, family, spouse, or other communities—and befriending, an increase in behaviors that strengthen social ties, such as listening, spending time together, and providing emotional support.

- Here’s where things get interesting. A tend-and-befriend response may have evolved to help us protect offspring, but when you are in that state, your bravery translates to any challenge you face. And—this is the most important part—anytime you choose to help others, you activate this state. Caring for others triggers the biology of courage and creates hope.

- This study tells us two things. First, where we place our attention when people we care about are suffering can change our own stress response. If we focus on comforting, helping, and caring for our loved ones, we experience hope and connection. If, instead, we focus on relieving our own distress, we stay stuck in fear. The second thing this study shows is that we can create the biology of courage through small actions. In this case, it was holding a loved one’s hand while he or she experienced pain. In everyday life, there are many opportunities to make similar small choices of connection. Whether you are overwhelmed by your own stress or the suffering of others, the way to find hope is to connect, not to escape. The benefits of taking a tend-and-befriend approach go beyond helping your loved ones, although this, of course, is an important function. In any situation where you feel powerless, doing something to support others can help you sustain your motivation and optimism.

- Transform Stress: Turn Overwhelmed into Hopeful When you are feeling overwhelmed, look for a way to do something for someone else that goes beyond your daily responsibilities. Your brain might tell you that you don’t have the time or energy, but that is exactly why you should do it. You can also make this a daily practice—set a goal of finding an opportunity to support someone else. By doing so, you prime your body and brain to take positive action and to experience courage, hope, and connection. Two strategies can amplify the benefit of this practice. First, your brain’s reward system will get a bigger boost from doing something new or unexpected than if you do the same kind act every day. Second, small acts can be just as powerful as grand gestures, so look for little things you can do instead of waiting for the perfect moment to be magnanimous. I encourage my students to be creative in what they decide to be generous with.

Then consider the possibility that this source of suffering is part of the human experience.

- One evening when I walked into my New Science of Stress course, I found a newspaper waiting for me on the lectern. A student had brought in an article titled “Stress: It’s Contagious” that appeared in one of our local papers. The article claimed that stress is “as contagious as any airborne pathogen” and compared its toxicity with that of secondhand smoke. One expert discussed a study showing that people had a stress response when they passively observed another person suffering. “It was surprising how easily the stress was transmitted,” he said. Another expert urged people not to be “stress carriers.” I later found another article online describing the same research; it led with the headline “Is Second Hand Stress Killing You?” I was fascinated by how these articles not only reinforced the “stress is toxic” mindset but also added a new layer of threat: You can catch toxic stress ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=2636))

- by being around other people who are stressed, and your own stress is harming everyone around you. When I read part of the article to my students and asked them what the practical takeaway was, the first response was, “Isolate yourself.” Then, “If you are stressed, keep it to yourself. Don’t share your worries with others.” The lessons continued, all with the same themes: Stay away from people who are suffering. Don’t let yourself get infected by being around people who are stressed. Don’t be a burden to others by sharing your stress with them. Of all the stress-will-kill-you scare stories I’ve ever seen in the media, this one saddened me the most. Because if you follow the strategies my students took away from the story, you’ll cut yourself off from two of the most important sources of resilience: knowing that you aren’t alone in your suffering and being able to help others. The social nature of stress is not something to fear. When you take a tend-and-befriend approach, even contagious stress can be strengthening. As we’ve seen, caring creates resilience, whether the altruism is a response to rescue us from our own suffering or simply a natural reaction to the pain of others. A sympathetic stress response to another person’s suffering can spark empathy and motivate helping, which in turn enhance our own well-being. Furthermore, we shouldn’t be afraid to let others see the truth of our own struggles—especially when we need their support. In many ways, our transparency is a gift, allowing others to feel less alone and offering them the opportunity to experience the benefits of tending and befriending.

- Mark Seery, a psychologist at the University at Buffalo, keeps a framed print of a thirty-two-cent Iowa postage stamp featuring the 1931 painting Young Corn by Grant Wood in his office. Although Seery has lived in Buffalo for a decade and made it his home, he keeps the painting in view because its rolling hills and cornfields remind him of where he comes from. The importance of a person’s past plays a central role in Seery’s research. He is best known for a controversial paper published in 2010 titled “Whatever Does Not Kill Us,” in which he challenged the widespread belief that traumatic events always increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and illness. Instead, he showed that a history of negative life events can actually protect against these outcomes. Adversity, he claimed, can create resilience.

- scientific journal, one reviewer rejected the paper, claiming that Seery was endorsing child abuse. The reviewer told Seery, “You’re saying these negative events are good, and that’s dangerous.” I’ve had similar experiences simply describing Seery’s findings to others. At a conference for people who work with trauma survivors, a fellow speaker publicly criticized me for talking about Seery’s work in my presentation on resilience. He thought I was implying that people who had been raped, abused, or otherwise victimized should be grateful for the opportunity it gave them to grow. When I reported the pushback I had gotten, Seery sympathized but rejected the interpretation. “I just look at it so differently,” Seery told me. These negative events are so unambiguously bad at the time they occur, he explained, that there is no denying that. It’s easy to see the negative in suffering. “The tricky part,” he added, “is to see anything other than that.” Seery isn’t endorsing trauma. He simply wants to figure out the role that adversity plays in the human experience. He understands that most people would prefer to hand their traumatic experiences back to the universe. And he’s certainly not suggesting we stop trying to prevent suffering so that people have more opportunity to develop resilience. But as much as we want to avoid pain and suffering, it’s almost impossible to get through life without experiencing some trauma, loss, or serious adversity. If avoiding suffering isn’t possible, what is the best way to think about the experience? “Given that it’s happened,” Seery asked, ([Location 2706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=2706))

After I shared Luis’s story with the students, I explained how setbacks and failures can be catalysts for growth. The question, I told them, isn’t if you will ever have a setback or challenge at college, but what you will do when it happens. Experiences that most students dread—critical feedback on a paper, not doing well on an exam—are, in a strange way, moments to look forward to. They are your invitation to start building resources on campus, just like Luis did. When he asked for help and put in the extra effort, he invested in himself, and I invested in him. He ended up not just with a good grade but also with someone who genuinely cared about him and would go the extra mile to help him succeed.

Then, set a timer for fifteen minutes and write about the experience, addressing any or all of the following questions: What did you do that helped you get through it? What personal resources did you draw on, and what strengths did you use? Did you seek out information, advice, or any other kind of support? What did this experience teach you about how to deal with adversity? How did this experience make you stronger? Now think about a current situation you are struggling through. Which of these strengths and resources can you draw on in this situation? Are there any coping skills or strengths you want to develop?

The science of post-traumatic growth doesn’t say that there is anything inherently good about suffering. Nor does it say that every traumatic event leads to growth. When any good comes from suffering, the source of that growth resides in you—your strengths, your values, and how you choose to respond to adversity. It does not belong to the trauma.

- changes the way people cope. It’s a classic mindset effect. People who find benefit in their difficulties report more purpose in life, hope for the future, and confidence in their ability to cope with the current stress in their lives. They then are more likely to take proactive steps to deal with the stress and to make better use of social support. They also are less likely to rely on avoidance strategies to escape their stress. Even their biological response to stress is different. In the laboratory, people who can find a benefit in their struggles show a healthier physical response to stress and a faster recovery. All this—rather than some sort of magical thinking—is why benefit-finding predicts outcomes as far-ranging as less depression, higher marital satisfaction, fewer heart attacks, and stronger immune function. I have to admit that even as I write about this research, I struggle with the term benefit-finding. It bothers me in the same way that I’ve witnessed others object to post-traumatic growth, or to the cliché “Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” To my ears, benefit-finding sounds like the kind of positive thinking that tries to scurry away from the reality of suffering: Let’s look for the bright side so we don’t have to feel the pain or think about the loss. But despite my own allergic reaction, this research doesn’t suggest that the most helpful mindset is a Pollyannish insistence on turning everything bad into something good. Rather, it’s the ability to notice the good as you cope with things that are difficult. In fact, ([Location 2961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=2961))

The same is true for medical scares. Survivors of a life-threatening disease, as well as their caregivers, are more likely to experience lasting personal and relationship growth if they report both benefits, such as learning to live in the present moment, and costs, such as fatigue or fears about the future.

If you try to find the benefit in them, it will be difficult to find an authentic answer.

- The reports we are exposed to in the media have a real impact on our well-being. In one major U.S. survey, exposure to the news was one of the most commonly reported source of daily stress. Of people who reported high levels of stress, 40 percent mentioned watching, reading, or listening to the news as a major contributor to the stress in their lives. Stress caused by the news, as opposed to stress caused by your life, is unique in its ability to trigger a sense of hopelessness. Watching TV news after a natural disaster or terrorist attack has consistently been shown to increase the risk of developing depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. One shocking study found that people who watched six or more hours of news about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing were more likely to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms than people who were actually at the bombing and personally affected by it. It’s not just traditional news programs that instill fear and hopelessness; stories of tragedy, trauma, and threats dominate many forms of media. In fact, a 2014 study of U.S. adults found that the single best predictor of people’s fear and anxiety was how much time they spent watching TV talk shows.

- Transform Stress: Tell Your Own Story of Growth and Resilience One of the best ways to notice, value, and express your own growth is to reflect on a difficult time in your life as if you were a journalist writing a restorative narrative. How would a storyteller describe the challenges you have faced? What would a good observer see as a turning point in your story—a moment when you were able to reengage or find meaning? If a journalist were to follow you for a week, what evidence would the journalist see of your strength and resilience? What do you do that demonstrates your growth or expresses your values? What would friends, family, coworkers, or others who have witnessed your journey say to describe how you have changed or grown? What objects in your home or office would a photojournalist want to photograph as evidence of your growth or resilience? Consider taking some time to write your own story about any experience that you view as both stressful and a source of growth or meaning. Or use any medium that appeals to you, such as photo collage, drawing, or video. This exercise can be very personal or private, and you never need to share it with anyone. But it can also be a wonderful exercise to share with others. ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OI5PGWU&location=3144))

Consider the examples we’ve seen in this book: Stress increases the risk of health problems, except when people regularly give back to their communities. Stress increases the risk of dying, except when people have a sense of purpose. Stress increases the risk of depression, except when people see a benefit in their struggles.
