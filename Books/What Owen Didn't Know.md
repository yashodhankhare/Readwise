## Highlights
- You can’t do just one thing. All actions have consequences, and consequences have consequences – if not now, then later. ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=66))

- ‘So you must match time’s swiftness with your speed in using it, and you must drink quickly as though from a rapid stream that will not always flow.’ ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=86))

- It was a sombre evening, but they learned a lesson about risking what you have and need, for what you don’t have and don’t need. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=100))

- She felt she was resilient, but still wondered whether understanding something intellectually fully prepared one to live it emotionally. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=104))

- There were certain things that Rose wanted the children to appreciate. -          To make good friends you need to be a good friend. -          It’s better to be enthusiastic than clever. -          Self-esteem is far more important than the opinions of others. -          It’s fine to not know. The joy is in discovery. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=184))

- Their chats sometimes got heated. Owen could make a coherent case for making time sacrifices now, to ‘buy’ freedom later, while Rose forcefully made the counterpoint of what he was missing in the moment. They eventually found a way to reconcile arguments of logic and those of emotion, and began to appreciate that logic and emotion were completely different languages. Depending on the context, either or both could be right or wrong. Owen was yet again reminded of his dad’s reference to all of life being contrast and paradox. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=364))

- More constructively, Owen also recalled his dad advising that if you wanted to get the best from people, you should build on their strengths, rather than try to correct weaknesses. Weakness can be coached to average, but strength can be leveraged to the moon. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=462))

- He would need to find the right time to raise his concern. His father had often said that it’s never the wrong time to do the right thing. Yet he held off raising the alarm, and soon began to worry whether his shield of honest intent was being subtly eroded by his environment.

- ‘There are a few settings where a simple adjustment can vastly improve our lives. Now you might be sceptical, and that’s understandable. What I’m going to share with you is both practical and proven. For those of you who are sufficiently curious to hear me out, I will explore how changing just a few settings can really help us. These settings are accessible by everyone. They are irrefutably life-changing. They are all legal. There are three that I’ll talk about. It will take us less than ten minutes. The first default setting relates to conversation. Are you a listener or a talker? In our conversations, we can default to a lecturing lens or to a listening lens. The rooster can crow at 142 decibels, which is like being within one hundred metres of a roaring jet engine. That’s almost deafening. So why doesn’t the rooster deafen itself? Because when it opens its beak, it shuts off its ear canals. Sound familiar? Too many of us are roosters. Or crocodiles – all mouth, no ears. Seneca said that one of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood. Well, one of the nicest gifts you can give to ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=513))

- someone is to listen to them. Really listen. Amazing things start to happen when we truly listen. When we show that we are interested in what someone has to say, we become more interesting. You become interesting by being interested. Conversations become a voyage of discovery rather than a battle of wits. Even when we’re sceptical about what someone has to say, the learning lens asks: “In what circumstances might they be right?” Or: “What might I be missing here?” When we wear a learning lens, we are courteous, we are focused on bringing out the best in others, and we are never showing off how much we know. The net effect of defaulting to the learning lens is warmer relationships and deeper understanding. Growing up in our house, there was a phrase we always heard: ABC – Always Be Curious. The curious among us prefer the learning lens over the lecturing one. So that’s default setting number one – reset your thermostat to a learning lens.’ Owen stopped briefly to scan the room, make eye contact, and then took another drink of water. He could see that everyone was now fully engaged, and he relaxed further. Moving on steadily, he continued: ‘The second default setting relates to how we perceive people and how we react to events. I would ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=523))

- rather give people the benefit of the doubt, and occasionally be made a fool of, than be a cynic. Assume the best. It’s good for you and it’s great for the person you’re getting to know. They frequently rise to your best opinion of them. I’ve yet to hear a good word about cynics, or closet cynics posing as realists. The kindest thing I can say about cynics is that they are not prejudicial. They distrust everything equally.’ Owen noticed a few people smiling in the audience, but not everyone got the joke. ‘As a default setting, it is far better in life to default to the kindest… ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=535))

- Accept reality, and default to the kindest interpretation. A great side effect of defaulting to the kindest interpretation, especially with people, is that it reciprocates. You become more likeable. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=559))

- Instead of focusing on goals, build habits instead. Adjusting our default settings is habit-building. Making tiny improvements forever is a habit. It is perhaps the most underrated and most powerful habit of all. Habits eat goals for breakfast. Why tiny improvements? Because tiny improvements are accessible to all of us. Because when we continue to make tiny improvements, we are locking ourselves into a positive reinforcing feedback loop, one we can stick to. I do press-ups every day. How many? I started with one a day two years ago. Every month, I increase the number by one. I’m now up to twenty-four per day. By my thirtieth birthday, I should be doing over a hundred press-ups daily. The key is not to go backwards. That’s the beauty of tiny improvements. Keep it simple. A simple plan executed beats a complex one contemplated. The cumulative impact of tiny improvements over a decent stretch of time is surprising, and over a lifetime it’s nothing short of staggering. Compound interest works the same way. By making time our friend, we can reduce the incline on the hill of life, and can gently nudge the rock forwards, indefinitely. Over time the rock reaches a great height, and it doesn’t take enormous willpower and effort to keep it there. We have been continually making tiny improvements, and along the way we lock in the rock. So, there you have it. Changing just a few key default settings can make all the difference. Try the learning lens, take the kindest interpretation, and make tiny improvements forever. And remember, when you are always improving, your best days are always ahead. Now what could be better than that? Thanks for listening. Don’t worry if you missed any of what I said – the session has been recorded as a podcast. I’m happy to take any questions.’ ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=584))

- Rose asked about the combination to the front door. She was curious about where the cube of 23 came from. Owen explained how 23 was an interesting number; that most human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, making 23 the perfect combination generator. His lock needed a five-digit code: 23 x 23 x 23 got him to 12,167. Rose smiled, wondering: Who thinks like this? ‘I appreciate this may appear odd, but it is memorable. For me, and now for you, 12,167 is an easy number to find your way back to. Remember Russell Crowe in the movie A Beautiful Mind? He played John Nash, the mathematician who was obsessed with the number 23, and with good reason. Look up the 23 enigma on Wikipedia when you have some time to kill. Two films have been made about it. A German movie called 23 and a Jim Carrey film, The Number 23. The average cycle of our physical biorhythms is 23 days. I don’t believe in numerological theories, but the power of linking is a great way of remembering things. Michael Jordan wore the number 23, and ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L3XJ96J&location=693))

- Rose had read numerous psychology books. She had studied the Stoics. But there is a deep chasm between understanding something intellectually and knowing it viscerally. That’s the gap between the label and the experience. She wasn’t going to magically forge advantage from adversity simply by reading about how others had done it. No amount of reading, philosophising, or indeed writing could have protected her from such an unexpected loss. Loss of friendship. Loss of love. Loss of even caring about loss.
